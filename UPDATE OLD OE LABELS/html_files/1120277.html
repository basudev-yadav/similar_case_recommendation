[Arising out of SLP (Civil) Nos.10703-10704 of 2005]

S.B. SINHA, J :
</p>
<p id="p_2">	Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3"> 	Whether Rules 4(2) and 9(10)(b) of the Kerala Abkari Shops Disposal 
Rules, 2002 (for short "the Rules") are ultra vires the Abkari Act (for short 
"the Act") is the question involved in these appeals which arise out of a 
judgment and order dated 22.3.2005 passed by a Division Bench of the 
Kerala High Court at Ernakulam in Writ Appeal Nos. 676, 677, 680, 722 of 
2004 and Writ Petition (C) Nos. 17138 of 2003 and 26918, 27105 and 37762 
of 2004 whereby and whereunder the High Court following its earlier 
decision in <a href="/doc/53099/" id="a_1">Anil Kumar v. State of Kerala</a>  [2005 (1) KLT 130] dismissed the 
appeals and the writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_4"> 	The Appellant herein is a federation of trade unions of toddy tappers 
and workers in toddy shops situate in the State of Kerala.  
</p>
<p id="p_5"> 	The Abkari Act was enacted by the Maharaja of Cochin in the year 
1902.  It is a pre-constitutional statute.  It is applicable to the entire State of 
Kerala.  The provisions of the said Act seek to control and regulate various 
categories of intoxicating liquor and intoxicating drugs including arrack, 
toddy, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), country liquor and other types 
of foreign liquor.  
</p>
<p id="p_6"> 	On or about 1.4.1996, the State of Kerala banned the sale of arrack.  A 
policy decision admittedly was taken by the Labour and Rehabilitation 
Department of the State of Kerala that the workers who had been engaged in 
manufacture, import, export, transport, sale and possession of arrack should 
be rehabilitated.  The State of Kerala paid compensation at the rate of Rs. 
30,000/- per worker.  The said workers were also paid benefits under the 
Abkari Workers Welfare Fund Board Act.  It is not in dispute that a Welfare 
Board has also been constituted for the workers working in the toddy shops.    
 	The expressions "Arrack" and "toddy" have been defined in Sections 
3(6A) and 3(8) of the Act as under:
</p>
<p id="p_7">"3(6A) "Arrack" means any potable liquor other 
than Toddy, Beer, Spirits of Wine, Wine Indian 
made spirit, foreign liquor and any medicinal 
preparation containing alcohol manufactured 
according to a formula prescribed in a 
pharmacopoeia approved by the Government of 
India or the Government of Kerala, or 
manufactured according to a formula approved by 
the Government of Kerala in respect of patent and 
proprietory preparations or approved as a bona fide 
medicinal preparation by the Expert Committee 
approved under section 68A of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_8">3(8) "Toddy" means fermented or unfermented 
juice drawn from a coconut, palmyra, date, or any 
other kind of palm tree;"
</p>
<p id="p_9"> 	Section 8 of the Act dealing with trade in Arrack was amended by Act 
No. 16 of 1997 which came into force from 3.6.1997.  The trade was 
banned.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	Sections 18A, 24(c), 24(d) and 29(1), which are relevant for our 
purpose, read as under:
</p><p id="p_11">"18 A. Grant of exclusive or other privilege of 
manufacture etc on payment of rentals.
</p><p id="p_12">(1) It shall be lawful for the Government to grant 
to any person or persons, on such conditions and 
for such period as they may deem fit, the exclusive 
or other privilege -
</p><p id="p_13">(i) of manufacturing or supplying by wholesale; or
</p><p id="p_14">(ii) of selling by retail; or
</p><p id="p_15">(iii) of manufacturing or supplying by wholesale 
and selling by retail any liquor or intoxicating 
drugs within any local area on his or their payment 
to the Government of an amount as rental in 
consideration of the grant of such privilege. The 
amount of rental may be settled by auction, 
negotiation or by any other method as may be 
determined by the Government, from time to time, 
and may be collected to the exclusion of, or in 
addition, to the duty or tax leviable Under Sections 
17 and 18.
</p><p id="p_16">(2) No grantee of any privilege under Sub-section 
(1) shall exercise the same until he has received a 
licence in that behalf from the Commissioner.
(3) In such cases, if the Government shall by 
notification so direct, the provisions of Section 12 
relating to toddy and toddy producing trees shall 
not apply."
</p><p id="p_17">24. Forms and conditions of licenses, etc.  Every 
license or permit granted under this Act shall be 
granted  
</p><p id="p_18">(a)	***
</p><p id="p_19">(b)	***
</p><p id="p_20">(c)	subject to such restrictions and on such 
conditions; and
</p><p id="p_21">(d)	shall be in such form and contain particulars 
 as the Government may direct either generally, 
or in any particular instance in this behalf."
</p><p id="p_22">29. Power to make rules  (1) The Government 
may, by notification in the Gazette, either 
prospectively or retrospectively, make rules for the 
purposes of this Act."
</p>
<p id="p_23"> 	In exercise of the said power, the Rules were framed.  After a lapse of 
about six years, the State inserted the impugned Rules, inter alia directing 
that one arrack worker each must be employed in all toddy shops in the 
following terms:
</p>
<p id="p_24">"4(2)	The shops so notified under sub-rule (1) 
above shall be such shops as are retained after 
abolition of certain existing shops.  Grantees of 
privilege of such retained shops shall undertake to 
engage the existing workers and such eligible 
workers of the abolished shops who were 
registered with the Toddy Workers Welfare Fund 
Board as on 31-3-2000 and as are redeployed to 
their shops.  Grantee of privilege shall also 
undertake to engage on Arrack worker of the 
abolished Arrack Shops of the State as would be 
allotted to his shop for rehabilitation, on the basis 
of district level seniority."
</p>
<p id="p_25">9(10) 	In order to ensure that the employment of 
workers of abolished Toddy and Arrack Shops are 
protected, the licensees shall abide by the 
following conditions also:
</p>
<p id="p_26">(a)	***		***
</p><p id="p_27">(b)	One Arrack Worker who has been remaining 
unemployed since the abolition of Arrack Shops 
with effect from 1st April 1996 shall be absorbed in 
the shop as may be decided by Government by 
observing the District level seniority of such 
Arrack Workers."
</p>

<p id="p_28">	The validity of the said Rules was questioned both by the holders of  
licences as also by the toddy workers.  The employees of the toddy shops are 
traditional workers.  A learned Single Judge of the High Court upheld the 
validity of the Rules inter alia holding:
</p>
<p id="p_29">(i)	in view of Section 18A of the Act, as control of liquor in trade is 
within the exclusive domain of the State and as terms and 
conditions can be prescribed for granting a licence, the impugned 
rules were validly made.
</p><p id="p_30">(ii)	Although, Section 29(2) does not contain any provision enabling 
the State to make such a provision, the same would, however, 
come within the purview of sub-section (1) thereof.
</p><p id="p_31">(iii)	Source of power of the State to frame such rules can be traced to 
Entries 23 and 24 of List III of the Seventh Schedule of the 
Constitution of India.  
</p>
<p id="p_32"> 	The Division Bench of the said High Court upheld the said 
conclusions of the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_33"> 	Only the toddy workers are in appeal before us.
</p>
<p id="p_34"> 	Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 
Appellants would submit :
</p>
<p id="p_35">(i)	The State in making the aforementioned rules transgressed its 
power of delegated legislation as the Act does not contain any 
provision as regards adoption of welfare measures to be taken by 
the State.
</p><p id="p_36">(ii)	The social purpose for which the said rules were made is governed 
by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_2">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  
</p><p id="p_37">(iii)	As the matter relating to the terms and conditions of employment 
of workmen is covered by the said parliamentary legislation, the 
State had no competence whatsoever to make such a rule.  
</p><p id="p_38">(iv)	The power under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/226033/" id="a_3">Section 29</a> of the Act could be 
resorted to only for the purpose of giving effect to the Act and not 
for a purpose de'hors the same.  
</p><p id="p_39">(v)	The entries contained in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule of 
the Constitution of India enumerate only the legislative field, 
specifying the sources of legislation by the Parliament and the 
State legislatures and in terms thereof, the State has no power to 
make the concerned rule.
</p><p id="p_40">(vi)	It may be true that the State has the exclusive privilege of carrying 
on business in liquor but the same would not mean that while 
parting with the said privilege the State can impose any 
unreasonable restriction which would be violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_4">Article 14</a> of 
the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_41"> 	Mr. T.L.V. Iyer, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 
State, on the other hand, would contend that : 
</p><p id="p_42">(i)	imposition of such a condition is within the domain of the State in 
terms of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_5">Sections 18A</a>, <a href="/doc/1042042/" id="a_6">24(c)</a>, <a href="/doc/1042042/" id="a_7">24(d)</a> and <a href="/doc/226033/" id="a_8">29</a> of the Act inasmuch as 
while granting a licence for sale of toddy, the State merely parts 
with a privilege which exclusively vested in it and in that view of 
the matter if in terms of the policy decision of the State, arrack 
workers were to be rehabilitated, it could direct employment of 
unemployed arrack workers and, thus, there was absolutely no 
reason as to why such a condition cannot be imposed while parting 
with the privilege by the State in terms of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_9">Section 18A</a> of the Act 
which enables the State to impose such conditions or restrictions as 
it may deem fit for the purpose of grant of a licence to sell 
intoxicating liquor.  
</p><p id="p_43">(ii)	As arrack and toddy both come within the purview of the Act, the 
State is entitled to exercise its control thereover which in turn 
would mean that a provision enabling the arrack workers, thrown 
out of employment, to be employed in toddy shops has a 
reasonable nexus with the purposes of the Act and such a provision 
cannot be said to be extraneous to the provisions of the Act and 
would come within the purview of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/226033/" id="a_10">Section 29</a> 
thereof.  
</p><p id="p_44">(iii)	The Rules which are impugned in these appeals enable the State to 
direct employment of toddy workers also who are displaced by the 
relocation of the toddy shops or reduction in their number and as 
such the workers cannot successfully question the validity of the 
Rules.  
</p><p id="p_45">(iv)	The right of the State to impose conditions is recognised by 
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_11">Sections 18A</a>, <a href="/doc/1042042/" id="a_12">24(c)</a> and (d) and in that view of the matter while 
considering the validity of the Rules made in terms of sub-section 
(1) of <a href="/doc/226033/" id="a_13">Section 29</a> of the Act, the jurisdiction of this Court should 
not be confined only to looking at the object and purport of the Act 
as contended by the Appellants herein but also look to the purposes 
which are sub-served thereby.  
</p><p id="p_46">(v)	<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_14">Section 69</a> of the Act also assumes importance in this context and 
confers a statutory flavour on the rules made under the Act and 
rules validly made in terms thereof become a part of the Act itself.
</p>
<p id="p_47"> 	Mr. Romy Chacko, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
Intervener would supplement the submissions of Mr. Iyer contending that 
the purpose of the Act must be found out from the various provisions of the 
Act and not from <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_15">Section 18A</a> of the Act or <a href="/doc/1042042/" id="a_16">Section 24</a> alone.  The learned 
counsel would contend that while parting with the privilege, the State can 
impose any condition and it is for the licensee to take it or leave it.  The 
learned counsel would further submit that as dealing in liquor is res-extra 
commercium, as has been held by this Court in <a href="/doc/1159364/" id="a_17">Har Shankar and Others v. 
Dy. Excise and Taxation Commr. And Others</a>[(1975) 1 SCC 737], the 
licensee could not have contended that the condition imposed for grant of 
licence was onerous.
</p>
<p id="p_48">	Drawing our attention to sub-rule (38) of Rule 7, it was urged that the 
licensees are bound by all the rules which have either been passed under the  
Act or which may thereafter be made thereunder or under any law relating to 
Abkari Revenue which may be made in future and, thus, the power 
conferred upon the State must be held to be of wide amplitude.
</p>
<p id="p_49">	<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_18">The Act</a> was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the 
import, export, transport, manufacture, sale and possession of intoxicating 
liquor and/ or intoxicating drugs in the State of Kerala.  While framing the 
Rules for the purposes of the Act, the legislative policy cannot be abridged.  
The Rules must be framed to carry out the purposes of the Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_50"> 	By reason of <a href="/doc/310761/" id="a_19">Section 8</a> of the Act, trade in arrack was prohibited as far 
back as in the year 1996.  By reason of the impugned Rules, the State has 
not laid down the terms and conditions for employment of a worker.  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_20">The 
Act</a> does not contain any provision therefor.  Under the common law as also 
under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_21">Specific Relief Act</a>, an employer is entitled to 
employ any person he likes.  It is well-settled that no person can be thrust 
upon an unwilling employer except in accordance with the provisions of a 
special statute operating in the field.  Such a provision cannot be made by 
the State in exercise of its power under delegated legislation unless the same 
is expressly conferred by the statute.    
</p>
<p id="p_51"> 	A rule is not only required to be made in conformity with the 
provisions of the Act whereunder it is made, but the same must be in 
conformity with the provisions of any other Act, as a subordinate legislation 
cannot be violative of any plenary legislation made by the Parliament or the 
State Legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_52">	The State by enacting <a href="/doc/1822068/" id="a_22">Section 8</a> of the Act prohibited sale of arrack.  
Once such a right to bring about prohibition, having regard to the principles 
contained in <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_23">Article 47</a> of the Constitution of India is exercised, no trade 
being in existence, the question of exercise of any control thereover would 
not arise.  Such a power in view of <a href="/doc/1822068/" id="a_24">Section 8</a> of the Act must be held to be 
confined only to carrying out the provisions thereof meaning thereby, no 
person can be allowed to deal in arrack and in the event, any person is found 
to be dealing therewith, to take appropriate penal action in respect thereof as 
provided.
</p>
<p id="p_53"> 	Rules 4(2) and 9(10)(b) in the Rules were introduced six years after 
the trade in arrack was completely prohibited.  In the aforementioned 
backdrop of events, the question as regard applicability of the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_25">Sections 18A</a>, <a href="/doc/1763595/" id="a_26">24(c)</a> and (d) of the Act is required to be construed.  <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_27">Section 
18A</a> of the Act recognises the common law right of the State to part with the 
privilege.  The State's exclusive privilege of supply or sale of liquor is also 
not in question.  But, we may notice that <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_28">Section 18A</a> is an enabling 
provision.  It was enacted evidently having regard to <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_29">Article 47</a> of the 
Constitution of India.  The State while parting with its exclusive privilege or 
a part thereof, may impose such conditions but once such terms and 
conditions are laid down by reason of a statute, the same cannot be deviated 
from.
</p>
<p id="p_54"> 	In Har Shankar (supra) whereupon Mr. Chacko placed reliance, it was 
stated:
</p>
<p id="p_55">"5. Auctions for granting the right to sell country 
liquor for the year 1968-69 were initially held in 
various districts of Punjab on or about March 8, 
1968 in pursuance of conditions of auction framed 
on February 19, 1968. Those auctions became 
ineffective by reason of a judgment dated March 
12, 1968 of a Division Bench of the High Court of 
Punjab and Haryana in Civil Writ No. 1376 of 
1967 (<a href="/doc/20367/" id="a_30">Jage Ram v. State of Haryana</a>). Following 
an earlier judgment in <a href="/doc/841120/" id="a_31">Bhajan Lal v. State of 
Punjab the High</a> Court took the view that the 
licence fee realised through the medium of 
auctions was really in the nature of "still-head 
duty" and that the licensees could not be called 
upon by the Government to pay still-head duty on 
the liquor quota which, under the terms of 
auctions, they were bound to lift but which in fact 
was not lifted by them."
</p>
<p id="p_56"> 	The said decision has no application to the fact of the present case, as 
therein this Court was concerned with a different question.
</p>
<p id="p_57"> 	It is, furthermore, not in dispute that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_32">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of 
India would be attracted even in the matter of trade in liquor.
</p>
<p id="p_58"> 	<a href="/doc/320843/" id="a_33">In State of M.P. and Others v. Nandlal Jaiswal and Others</a> [(1986) 4 
SCC 566], this Court opined:
</p>
<p id="p_59">"The State under its regulatory power has the 
power to prohibit absolutely every form of activity 
in relation to intoxicants  its manufacture, 
storage, export, import, sale and possession. No 
one can claim as against the State the right to carry 
on trade or business in liquor and the State cannot 
be compelled to part with its exclusive right or 
privilege of manufacturing and selling liquor. But 
when the State decides to grant such right or 
privilege to others the State cannot escape the 
rigour of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_34">Article 14.</a> It cannot act arbitrarily or at 
its sweet will. It must comply with the equality 
clause while granting the exclusive right or 
privilege of manufacturing or selling liquor. It is, 
therefore, not possible to uphold the contention of 
the State Government and Respondents 5 to 11 that 
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_35">Article 14</a> can have no application in a case where 
the licence to manufacture or sell liquor is being 
granted by the State Government. The State cannot 
ride roughshod over the requirement of that 
article."
</p>

<p id="p_60"> 	<a href="/doc/675008/" id="a_36">In Khoday Distilleries Ltd. and Others v. State of Karnataka and 
Others</a> [(1995) 1 SCC 574], a Constitution Bench of this Court upon 
referring to a large number of decisions summed up its findings in the 
following terms:
</p>
<p id="p_61">"60(e) For the same reason, the State can create 
a monopoly either in itself or in the agency created 
by it for the manufacture, possession, sale and 
distribution of the liquor as a beverage and also 
sell the licences to the citizens for the said purpose 
by charging fees. This can be done under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_37">Article 
19(6)</a> or even otherwise.
</p><p id="p_62">(f) For the same reason, again, the State can 
impose limitations and restrictions on the trade or 
business in potable liquor as a beverage which 
restrictions are in nature different from those 
imposed on the trade or business in legitimate 
activities and goods and articles which are res 
commercium. The restrictions and limitations on 
the trade or business in potable liquor can again be 
both under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_38">Article 19(6)</a> or otherwise. The 
restrictions and limitations can extend to the State 
carrying on the trade or business itself to the 
exclusion of and elimination of others and/or to 
preserving to itself the right to sell licences to do 
trade or business in the same, to others.
</p><p id="p_63">(g) When the State permits trade or business in the 
potable liquor with or without limitation, the 
citizen has the right to carry on trade or business 
subject to the limitations, if any, and the State 
cannot make discrimination between the citizens 
who are qualified to carry on the trade or 
business."	
</p>
<p id="p_64"> 	While imposing terms and conditions in terms of <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_39">Section 18A</a> of the 
Act, the State cannot take recourse to something which is not within its 
jurisdiction or what is otherwise prohibited in law.  Sub-sections (c) and (d) 
of <a href="/doc/1763595/" id="a_40">Section 24</a> of the Act provide that every licence or permit granted under 
the Act would be subject to such restrictions and on such conditions and 
shall be in such form and contain such particulars as the Government may 
direct either generally or in any particular instance in this behalf.  The said 
provisions are also subject to the inherent limitations of the statute.  Such an 
inherent limitation is that rules framed under the Act must be lawful and 
may not be contrary to the legislative policy.  The rule making power is 
contained in <a href="/doc/1585615/" id="a_41">Section 29</a> of the Act.  At the relevant time, sub-section (1) of 
<a href="/doc/1585615/" id="a_42">Section 29</a> of the Act provided that the government may make rules for the 
purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act which has been amended 
by Act No. 12 of 2003 with effect from 1.4.2003 empowering the State to 
make rules either prospectively or retrospectively for the purposes of the 
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_65"> 	Its power, therefore, was to make rules only for the purpose of 
carrying out the purposes of the Act and not de'hors the same.  In other 
words, rules cannot be framed in matters that are not contemplated under the 
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_66"> 	The State may have unfettered power to regulate the manufacture, sale 
or export-import sale of intoxicants but in the absence of any statutory 
provision, it cannot, in purported exercise of the said power, direct a 
particular class of workers to be employed in other categories of liquor 
shops.
</p>
<p id="p_67"> 	The Rules in terms of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1585615/" id="a_43">Section 29</a> of the Act, thus, 
could be framed only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the 
Act.  Both the power to frame rules and the power to impose terms and 
conditions are, therefore, subject to the provisions of the Act.  They must 
conform to the legislative policy.  They must not be contrary to the other 
provisions of the Act.  They must not be framed in contravention of the 
constitutional or statutory scheme.  
</p>
<p id="p_68"> 	<a href="/doc/130040/" id="a_44">In Ashok Lanka and Another v. Rishi Dixit and Others</a> [(2005) 5 SCC 
598], it was held:
</p>
<p id="p_69">" We are not oblivious of the fact that framing 
of rules is not an executive act but a legislative act; 
but there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that such 
subordinate legislation must be framed strictly in 
consonance with the legislative intent as reflected 
in the rule-making power contained in <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_45">Section 62</a> 
of the Act."
</p>
<p id="p_70">	<a href="/doc/837072/" id="a_46">In Bombay Dyeing &amp; Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Bombay Environmental Action 
Group &amp; Ors</a>. [2006 (3) SCALE 1], this Court has stated the law in the 
following terms:
</p>
<p id="p_71">"A policy decision, as is well known, should not be 
lightly interfered with but it is difficult to accept 
the submissions  made on behalf of the learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants that 
the courts cannot exercise their power of judicial 
review at all.  By reason of any legislation whether 
enacted by the legislature or by way of subordinate 
legislation, the State gives effect to its legislative 
policy.  Such legislation, however, must not be 
ultra vires the Constitution.  A subordinate 
legislation apart from being intra vires the 
Constitution, should not also be ultra vires the 
parent Act under which it has been made.  A 
subordinate legislation, it is trite, must be 
reasonable and in consonance with the legislative 
policy as also give effect to the purport and object 
of the Act and in good faith."
</p>

<p id="p_72">	In Craies on Statute Law, 7th edition, it is stated at page 297:
</p>
<p id="p_73">"The initial difference between subordinate legislation 
(of the kind dealt with in this chapter) and statute law 
lies in the fact that a subordinate law-making body is 
bound by the terms of its delegated or derived 
authority, and that courts of law, as a general rule, will 
not give effect to the rules, etc., thus made, unless 
satisfied that all the conditions precedent to the 
validity of the rules have been fulfilled.  The validity 
of statutes cannot be canvassed by the courts, the 
validity of delegated legislation as a general rule can 
be.  The courts therefore (1) will require due proof that 
the rules have been made and promulgated in 
accordance with the statutory authority, unless the 
statute directs them to be judicially noticed; (2) in the 
absence of express statutory provision to the contrary, 
may inquire whether the rule-making power has been 
exercised in accordance with the provisions of the 
statute by which it is created, either with respect to the 
procedure adopted, the form or substance of the 
regulation, or the sanction, if any, attached to the 
regulation : and it follows that the court may reject as 
invalid and ultra vires a regulation which fails to 
comply with the statutory essentials."
</p>
<p id="p_74"> 	In G.P. Singh's Principles of Statutory Interpretation, Tenth Edition, it 
is stated at page 916:
</p>
<p id="p_75">"Grounds for judicial review. Delegated legislation is 
open to the scrutiny of courts and may be declared 
invalid particularly on two grounds: (a) Violation of 
the Constitution; and (b) Violation of the enabling 
Act.  The second ground includes within itself not 
only cases of violation of the substantive provisions 
of the enabling Act, but also cases of violation of the 
mandatory procedure prescribed.  It may also be 
challenged on the ground that it cannot be said to be 
in conformity with the statute or <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_47">Article 14</a> of the 
Constitution or that it has been exercised in bad faith.  
The limitations which apply to the exercise of 
administrative or quasi-judicial power conferred by a 
statute except the requirement of natural justice also 
apply to the exercise of power of delegated 
legislation.  Rules made under the Constitution do 
not qualify as legislation in true sense and are treated 
as subordinate legislation and can be challenged in 
judicial review like delegated legislation.  
Compliance with the laying requirement or even 
approval by a resolution of Parliament does not 
confer any immunity to the delegated legislation but 
it may be a circumstance to be taken into account 
along with other factors to uphold its validity 
although as earlier seen a laying clause may prevent 
the enabling Act being declared invalid for excessive 
delegation."

of India</a> [(2004) 8 SCC 524], this Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_77">63. When any criterion is fixed by a statute or by a 
policy, an attempt should be made by the authority 
making the delegated legislation to follow the policy 
formulation broadly and substantially and in 
conformity therewith. [<a href="/doc/89704603/" id="a_49">See Secy., Ministry of

	We may notice that in <a href="/doc/1422834/" id="a_50">State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. vs. Basant Nahata</a>  
[(2005) 12 SCC 77 : AIR 2005 SC 3401], it was pointed out :
</p>
<p id="p_78">	"The contention raised to the effect that this Court would 
not interfere with the policy decision is again devoid of any 
merit.  A legislative policy must conform to the provisions 
of the constitutional mandates.  Even otherwise a policy 
decision can be subjected to judicial review"
</p>
<p id="p_79"><a href="/doc/1699480/" id="a_51">In B.K. Industries &amp; Others v. Union of India &amp; Others</a> [(1993) Supp. 
3 SCC 621], this Court clearly held that a delegate cannot act contrary to the 
basic feature of the Act stating:  
</p>
<p id="p_80">"..The words'so far as may be' occurring in 
<a href="/doc/1159457/" id="a_52">Section 3(4)</a> of the Cess Act cannot be stretched to 
that extent.  Above all it is extremely doubtful 
whether the power of exemption conferred by Rule 
8 can be carried to the extent of nullifying the very 
Act itself.  It would be difficult to agree that by 
view of the power of exemption, the very levy 
created by <a href="/doc/1567650/" id="a_53">Section 3(1)</a> can be dispensed with.  
Doing so would amount to nullifying the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_54">Cess Act</a> 
itself.  Nothing remains thereafter to be done under 
the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_55">Cess Act</a>.  Even the language of Rule 8 does 
not warrant such extensive power.  Rule 8 
contemplates merely exempting of certain 
exciseable goods from the whole or any part of the 
duty leviable on such goods.  The principle of the 
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_56">Kesavananda Bharati v. 
State of Kerala</a> applies here perfectly.  It was held 
therein that the power of amendment conferred by 
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_57">Article 368</a> cannot extend to scrapping of the 
Constitution or to altering the basic structure of the 
Constitution.  Applying the principle of the 
decision, it must be held that the power of 
exemption cannot be utilised for, nor can it extend 
to, the scrapping of the very Act itself.  To repeat, 
the power of exemption cannot be utilised to 
dispense with the very levy created under <a href="/doc/223295/" id="a_58">Section 
3</a> of the Cess Act or for that matter under <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_59">Section 3</a> 
of the Central Excise Act."
</p>
<p id="p_81">The law that has, thus, been laid down is that if by a notification, the 
Act itself stands affected; the notification may be struck down.
</p>
<p id="p_82"> 	Furthermore, the terms and conditions which can be imposed by the 
State for the purpose of parting with its right of exclusive privilege more or 
less has been exhaustively dealt with in the illustrations in sub-section (2) of 
<a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_60">Section 29</a> of the Act.  There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the 
general power to make rules is contained in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_61">Section 29</a>.  
The provisions contained in sub-section (2) are illustrative in nature.  But, 
the factors enumerated in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_62">Section 29</a> are indicative of the 
heads under which the statutory framework should ordinarily be worked out.
</p>
<p id="p_83"> 	Neither <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_63">Section 18A</a> nor sub-sections (c) and (d) of <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_64">Sections 24</a> of the 
Act confer power upon the delegatee to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the 
other department of the State and take upon its head something which is not 
within its domain or which otherwise would not come within the purview of 
the control and regulation of trade in liquor.  The conditions imposed must 
be such which would promote the policy or secure the object of the Act.  To 
grant employment to one arrack worker in each toddy shop in preference to 
the toddy workers neither promotes the policy nor secures the object of the 
Act.  It is not in dispute that the purport and object of such rules is to 
rehabilitate the former employees of arrack shops.  Rehabilitation of the 
employees is not within the statutory scheme and, thus, the Rules are ultra 
vires the provisions of the Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_84"> 	<a href="/doc/330885/" id="a_65">In State of Kerala and Others v. Maharashtra Distilleries Ltd. and 
Others</a> [(2005) 11 SCC 1], this Court took notice of the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_66">Section 18A</a> of the Act.  It was held that the State had no jurisdiction to 
realise the turn over tax from the manufacturers in the garb of exercising its 
monopoly power.  It was held that turn-over tax cannot be directed to be 
paid either by way of excise duty or as a price of privilege.
</p>
<p id="p_85"> 	The said decision, therefore, is an authority for the proposition that the 
State while implementing the purposes of the Act must act within the four-
corners thereof.  It may be true that all types of intoxicating liquors 
including 'toddy' are subject matter of control but the power to control has 
been arbitrarily exercised.  Whereas in the case of Arrack, the trade has 
totally been prohibited, the trade in toddy has merely been subjected to the 
control within the purview of the provisions of the Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_86"> 	So far as trade in toddy is concerned, the toddy workers not only act 
in the shops, some of them are also toddy tappers.  It requires a specialised 
skill.  They form a different class.  Even assuming that both toddy and 
former arrack workers belong to the same class, the rehabilitation of arrack 
workers who had been thrown out of employment because of an excise 
policy on the part of the State, do not have any reasonable nexus with the 
purpose of the Act, namely, the prohibition of grant of excise licence in 
relation to the trade in arrack.
</p>
<p id="p_87"> 	If a policy decision is taken, the consequences therefor must ensue.  
Rehabilitation of the workers, being not a part of the legislative policy for 
which the Act was enacted, we are of the opinion that by reason thereof, the 
power has not been exercised in a reasonable manner.  Rehabilitation of the 
workers is not one of the objectives of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_88"> 	The submission of Mr. Iyer that there exists a distinction between 
carrying out the provisions of the Act and the purpose of the Act, is not 
relevant for our purpose.  The power of delegated legislation cannot be 
exercised for the purpose of framing a new policy.  The power can be 
exercised only to give effect to the provisions of the Act and not de'hors the 
same.  While considering the carrying out of the provisions of the Act, the 
court must see to it that the rule framed therefor is in conformity with the 
provisions thereof.  
</p>
<p id="p_89"> 	Reference to the provisions of Articles 39, 42 and 43 of the 
Constitution of India by the learned counsel for the Respondent is 
misconceived.  While exercising the power of rehabilitation, the State did 
not take recourse to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_67">Article 47</a> of the Constitution of India.  
The matter might have been different if the State took a decision in exercise 
of its executive power in consonance with the legislative policy of the State 
as also for the purpose of giving effect to Articles 39, 42 and 43 of the 
Constitution of India.  But, herein, the State was exercising a specific power 
of delegated legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_90"> 	Recourse to <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_68">Section 69(1)</a> of the Act is again misconceived.  Only a 
rule validly made will have a statutory flavour.  If a rule is not validly made, 
the question of its being interpreted in the same manner as if enacted or as if 
the same is a part of the statute, would not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_91"> 	<a href="/doc/986214/" id="a_69">In Hotel Balaji and Others v. State of A.P. and Others</a> [1993 Supp (4) 
SCC 536], whereupon Mr. Iyer placed reliance, it is stated:
</p>
<p id="p_92">"The necessity and significance of the delegated 
legislation is well accepted and needs no 
elaboration at our hands. Even so, it is well to 
remind ourselves that rules represent subordinate 
legislation. They cannot travel beyond the purview 
of the Act. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_70">Where the Act</a> says that rules on being 
made shall be deemed "as if enacted in this Act", 
the position may be different. (It is not necessary 
to express any definite opinion on this aspect for 
the purpose of this case.) But where the Act does 
not say so, the rules do not become part of the 
Act."
</p>
<p id="p_93"> 	The said decision runs counter to the position in the present case.  
</p>
<p id="p_94"> 	Mr. Chacko has referred to Rule 7(38) of the Rules.  For the reasons 
stated hereinbefore, reference to sub-rule (38) of Rule 7 which mandates the 
licensee to be bound by the rules made under the Act is fallacious as rules 
contemplated thereunder would mean a valid rule and not a rule which has 
been made de'hors the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_95"> 	The High Court, furthermore, in our opinion, is not correct in tracing 
the legislative power of the State to Entries 23 and 24 of the List III of the 
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.  The legislative field 
contained in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India provides for 
field of plenary power of the legislature but what a legislature can do, 
evidently, a delegatee may not, unless otherwise provided for in the statute 
itself.
</p>
<p id="p_96"> 	The rights and liabilities of a workman would fall within the purview 
of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_71">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  What is the right of a 
workman in case an industry is closed is governed by <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_72">Section 25(FFF)</a> and/ 
or <a href="/doc/607947/" id="a_73">Section 25(J)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act.
</p>
<p id="p_97"> 	The State while pursuing its social object or policy may do something 
to rehabiliate the workers affected by the ban but the same would not mean 
that the State can thrust such employees upon an unwilling employer.  It, 
furthermore, would not mean that the State can rehabilitate one set of 
workers at the cost of the other.  
</p>
<p id="p_98"> 	The employees in the arrack shops had already been paid an amount 
of Rs. 30,000/- as compensation and other benefits under the Abkari 
Workers Welfare Fund Board Act.  We are informed that they have also 
been paid a sum of Rs. 2000/- each in 1997.  If they became entitled to any 
other benefit, the State may provide the same as a part of welfare policy but 
not in pursuit of an excise policy.
</p>
<p id="p_99">	The matter can be considered from another angle.
</p>
<p id="p_100"> 	When an employer gives employment to a person, a contract of 
employment is entered into.  The right of the citizens to enter into any 
contract, unless it is expressly prohibited by law or is opposed to public 
policy, cannot be restricted.  Such a power to enter into a contract is within 
the realm of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_74">Indian Contract Act</a>.  It has not been and could not be 
contended that a contract of employment in the toddy shops would be hit by 
<a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_75">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act.  So long as the contract of 
employment in a particular trade is not prohibited either in terms of the 
statutory or constitutional scheme, the State's intervention would be 
unwarranted unless there exists a statutory interdict.  Even to what extent 
such a legislative power can be exercised would be the subject matter of 
debate but in a case of this nature there cannot be any doubt that the 
impugned rules are also contrary to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_76">Indian Contract Act</a> 
as also the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_77">Specific Relief Act</a>, 1963.  
</p>
<p id="p_101"> 	<a href="/doc/1690380/" id="a_78">In Pearlite Liners (P) Ltd. v. Manorama Sirsi</a> [(2004) 3 SCC 172], it is 
stated:
</p>
<p id="p_102">"It is a well-settled principle of law that a 
contract of personal service cannot be specifically 
enforced and a court will not give a declaration 
that the contract subsists and the employee 
continues to be in service against the will and 
consent of the employer. This general rule of law 
is subject to three well-recognised exceptions: (i) 
where a public servant is sought to be removed 
from service in contravention of the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_79">Article 311</a> of the Constitution of India; (ii) where 
a worker is sought to be reinstated on being 
dismissed under the industrial law; and (iii) where 
a statutory body acts in breach of violation of the 
mandatory provisions of the statute"
</p>
<p id="p_103"> 	Furthermore, a person may not have any fundamental right to trade or 
do business in liquor, but the person's right to grant employment or seek 
employment, when a business is carried on in terms of the provisions of the 
licence, is not regulated. 
</p>
<p id="p_104"> 	Reliance placed by the learned counsel on <a href="/doc/693331/" id="a_80">C.M. Joseph and Others v. 
State of Kerala and Others</a> [(2001) 10 SCC 578] is again mis-placed.  
Therein, Rule 6(39) of the Rules was held to be suffering from no infirmity 
and it is in that situation it was held that as the said rule was in existence at 
the time when licence was granted, the licensee could not be allowed to 
impugn the same.  We are not concerned with the right of the licensee but 
the right of the workmen.  
</p>
<p id="p_105"> 	<a href="/doc/1765754/" id="a_81">In Solomon Antony and Others v. State of Kerala and Others</a> [(2001) 
3 SCC 694], this Court again held that the contractors were liable to pay the 
duty on even unlifted portion of the designated quantum of rectified spirit 
having regard to the binding nature of the contract. 
</p>
<p id="p_106"> 	"Take it or leave it" argument advanced by Mr. Chacko is stated to be 
rejected.  The State while parting with its exclusive privilege cannot take 
recourse to the said doctrine having regard to the equity clause enshrined 
under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_82">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.  The State must in its dealings 
must act fairly and reasonably.  The bargaining power of the State does not 
entitle it to impose any condition it desires.  
</p>
<p id="p_107"> 	<a href="/doc/1288069/" id="a_83">In Hindustan Times and Others v. State of U.P. and Another</a> [(2003) 1 
SCC 591], wherein one of us was a member, this Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_108">"39. The respondents being a State, cannot in view 
of the equality doctrine contained in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_84">Article 14</a> of 
the Constitution of India, resort to the theory of 
"take it or leave it". The bargaining power of the 
State and the newspapers in matters of release of 
advertisements is unequal. Any unjust condition 
thrust upon the petitioners by the State in such 
matters, in our considered opinion, would attract 
the wrath of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_85">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India 
as also <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_86">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act. <a href="/doc/477313/" id="a_87">See 
Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. 
Brojo Nath Ganguly</a> and <a href="/doc/268805/" id="a_88">Delhi Transport Corpn. v. 
D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress</a>. It is trite that the State 
in all its activities must not act arbitrarily. Equity 
and good conscience should be at the core of all 
governmental functions. It is now well settled that 
every executive action which operates to the 
prejudice of any person must have the sanction of 
law. The executive cannot interfere with the rights 
and liabilities of any person unless the legality 
thereof is supportable in any court of law. The 
impugned action of the State does not fulfil the 
aforementioned criteria."
</p>


<p id="p_109"> 	We, however, accept the submission that Rule 4(2) of the Rules must 
be held to be ultra vires in its entirety as even that part of it, vis-`-vis, the 
toddy workers, is not severable.  Hence Rule 4(2) is declared ultra vires in 
its entirety.
</p>
<p id="p_110"> 	For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be 
sustained.  It is set aside accordingly.  The appeals are allowed.  No costs.
