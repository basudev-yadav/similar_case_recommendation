HEADNOTE:
The  validity  of the Punjab Security of Land  Tenures	Act,
1953  (Act  10 of 1953) and of the Mysore Land	Reforms	 Act
(Act 10 of 1962) as amended by Act 14 of 1965 was challenged
by the petitioners under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_6">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution.  Since
these  Acts  were  included  in	 the  9th  Schedule  to	 the
Constitution  by  the Constitution  (Seventeenth)  Amendment
Act,  1964, the validity of the said <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_7">Amendment Act</a> was	also
challenged.   In this connection it was urged  that  Sankari
Prasad's  case	in which the validity  of  the	constitution
(First)	 Amendment  Act,  1951 had been	 upheld	 and  Sajjan
Singh's	 case  in  which the validity  of  the	Constitution
(Seventeenth)  Amendment Act, 1964, had been upheld by	this
Court,	had  been wrongly decided.  It	was  contended	that
Parliament had no   power  to  amend fundamental  rights  in
Part III of the Constitution.
HELD:	Per  Subba  Rao,  C.J.,	 Shah,	Sikri,	Shelat	 and
Vaidialingam, JJ.   (Hidayatullah,    J.    Concurring)	   :
Fundamental Rights cannot be abridged	or taken away by the
amending  procedure  in Ail. 368 of  the  Constitution.	  An
amendment to the Constitution is 'law' within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_8">Art.  13(2)</a>  and  is therefore subject to Part	III  of	 the
Constitution. <a href="/doc/1706770/" id="a_9">Sri Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India
JUDGMENT</a>:
</pre><p id="p_1">Rajasthan,  [1965] 1 S.C.R. 933, reversed.  Per Subba,	Rao,
C.J., Shah, Sikri, Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ.
</p><p id="p_2">(i)  Fundamental rights are the primordial rights  necessary
for  the  development of human personality.   They  are	 the
rights which enable a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">763</span>
man  to chalk out his own life in the manner he likes  best.
Our Constitution, in addition to the well-known	 fundamental
rights,	 also  included the rights of minorities  and  other
backward communities in such rights. [789 E]
The  fundamental rights are given a transcendental  position
under  our  Constitution and are kept beyond  the  reach  of
Parliament.   At  the  same time Parts III  and	 IV  of	 the
Constitution constituted an integrated scheme forming a self
contained code.	 The scheme is made so elastic that all	 the
Directive  Principles  of  State Policy	 can  reasonably  be
enforced  without  taking away or-abridging the	 fundamental
rights.	 While recognisingthe	immutability   of    the
fundamental   rights,	subject	 to   social   control	 the
Constitution  itself  provides	for the	 suspension  or	 the
modification   of   fundamental	  rights   under    specific
circumstances, as in Arts. 33, 34 and 35.  The	non-obstante
clause with which the last article opens makes it clear that
all the other provisions of the Constitution are subject  to
this  provision.   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_10">Article 32</a> makes the right  to  move	 the
Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement
of  the	 rights conferred by the said  Parts  a	 fundamental
right.	Even during grave emergencies <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_11">Art. 358</a> only suspends
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_12">Art.  19</a>  and all other rights are  untouched  except  those
specifically suspended by the President under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_13">Art. 359.</a> [789
H; 790 D]
     The Constitution has given a place of permanence to the
fundamental   freedoms.	   In  giving  to   themselves	 the
Constitution  the  people  have	 reserved   the	 fundamental
freedoms  to themselves.  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_14">Art. 13</a> merely in-corporates	that
reservation.   The Article is however not the source of	 the
protection  of fundamental rights but the expression of	 the
reservation.   The  importance attached to  the	 fundamental
freedoms  is  so  transcendatal that a	bill  enacted  by  a
unanimous  vote	 of  all  the  members	of  both  Houses  is
ineffective to derogate from its guaranteed exercise.  It is
not  what Parliament regards at a given moment as  conducive
to the public benefit but what Part III declarer. protected,
which determines the ambit of the freedom. The incapacity of
Parliament  therefore in exercise of its amending  power  to
modify, restrict, or imposefundamental	freedoms in  Part
III arises from the scheme of theConstitution	and    the
nature of the freedoms. [792 <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_15">D-F]

If  it	is  the	 duty of  Parliament  to  enforce  directive
principles  it is equally its duty to enforce  them  without
infringing   the   fundamental	rights.	  The	verdict	  of
Parliament  on	the scope of the law of	 social	 control  of
fundamental rights is not final but justiciable.  If it were
not  so, the whole scheme of the Constitution  would  break.
[815 H; 816 A-B] ,
</p><p id="p_3">(ii)<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_19">Article  368</a> in terms only prescribes various steps	 in
the  matter of amendment.  The article assumes the power  to
amend  found else where.  The completion of  the  procedural
steps cannot be said to culminate in the power to amend	 for
if  that  was so the Constitution makers could	have  stated
that  in  the Constitution.  Nor can the  power	 be  implied
either	from  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_20">Art. 368</a> or from the nature  of  the  articles
sought to be amended; the doctrine of necessary	 implication
cannot	be invoked if there is an express provision.   There
is  no necessity to imply any such power as  Parliament	 has
the plenary power to make any law including the law to amend
the  Constitution  subject  to	the  limitations  laid	down
therein [793 E-G]
</p><p id="p_4">(iii)The power of Parliament to amend the  Constitution
is derived from Arts. 245, 246 and 248 read with item 97  in
List I. The residuary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">764</span>
power of Parliament can certainly take in the power to amend
the Constitution. [794 A-D]
Though	a  law	    made under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_21">Art. 245</a> is  subject  to	 the
provisions of the Constitution it would be wrong to say that
every  law of amendment made under it would  necessarily  be
inconsistent  with  the articles sought to be  amended.	  It
cannot reasonably be said that a law amending an article  is
inconsistent  with  it.	 The limitation in <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_22">Art.	 245</a>  is  in
respect of the power to make a law and not of the content of
the law made within the scope of its power. [794 E-F]
An order by the President under <a href="/doc/1043584/" id="a_23">Art. 392</a> cannot attract	 Art
368  as the amendment contemplated by the latter  provisions
can  be	 initiated  only by the introduction of	 a  bill  in
Parliament.   It cannot therefore be said that if the  power
of amendment is held to be a legislative power the President
acting under <a href="/doc/1043584/" id="a_24">Art. 392</a> can amend the Constitution in terms of
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_25">Art. 368.</a> [794 G-H]
</p><p id="p_5">(iv) The Constituent Assembly, it so minded, could certainly
have conferred an express legislative power on Parliament to
amend  the  Constitution by  ordinary  legislative  process.
There  is,  therefore,	no  inherent  inconsistency  between
legislative  process and the amending one.  Whether  in	 the
field of a constitutional law or statutory law amendment can
be brought about only by 'law'. [794 C-D]
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_26">Article	 13(2</a>),	 for the purpose of that Article,  gives  an
inclusive  definition  of 'law'.  It does  not	Prima  facie
exclude	 constitutional	 law.  The process  under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_27">Art.	 368</a>
itself closely resemble the legislative process.
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_28">Article	 368</a>  is  not  a complete code	in  respect  of	 the
procedure of amendment.	 The details of procedure in respect
of  other  bills have to be followed so far as	possible  in
respect of a Bill under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_29">Art. 368</a> also, The rules made by the
House  of the People providing procedure for amendments	 lay
down  a	 procedure similar to that of other bills  with	 the
addition  of  certain special provisions.  If  amendment  is
intended  to be Something other than law the  constitutional
insistence  on the said legislative process is	unnecessary.
The  imposition	 of further conditions is only	a  safeguard
against the hasty action or a protection to the states	 but
does  not change the legislative character of the  amendment
[795 G 796 C]
<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_30">Article 3</a> of the Constitution permits changes in States	 and
their boundaries by a legislative process under Arts. 4	 and
169  amendments in the Solution are made by 'law' but  by  a
fiction	 are deemed not to be amendments for the purpose  of
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_31">Art. 368.</a>  This shows that amendment is law and that but for
the  fiction it would be an amendment within the meaning  of
Art, 368. [796 C-F]
Therefore  amendments either under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_32">Art. 368</a> or	under  other
Articles   are	only  made  by	Parliament   following	 the
legislative  process and are 'law' for the purpose  of	<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_33">Art.

Commissioner  v.  Pedrick Ransinghe, [1964] 2  W.L.R.  1301,
referred to.
</p><p id="p_6">(v)  One need not cavil at the description of amending power
as  a sovereign power for it is sovereign only	viithin	 the
scope  of the power conferred by a  particular	Constitution
which  may  expressly  limit the  power	 of  amendment	both
substantive  and  procedural.  If cannot therefore  be	said
that amending power can have no limitations being a sovere4p
power. [804]
The  argument that the amending process	 involves  political
questions and is therefore outside.the scope of judicial re-
view cannot also be aeCePted- It may be.Parliament seeks  to
amend  the Constitution for political reasons but the  court
in denying that power will not be deciding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">765</span>
a   political  question;  it  will  only  be  holding	that
Parliament has no power to armed Particular articles of	 the
Constitution for any purpose whatsoever, be it political  or
otherwise. [804 E-G]
</p><p id="p_7">(vi) If power to abridge the fundamental rights is denied to
Parliament  revolution	is  not	 a  necessary  result.	 The
existence  of  an  all comprehensive  power  cannot  prevent
revolution if there is chaos in the country brought about by
misrule	 or abuse of power.  Such considerations are out  of
place in construing the provisions of the Constitution by  a
Court of law. [816 B-C]
</p><p id="p_8">(vii)	  While-ordinarily  @  Court will  be  reluctant  to
reverse	 its  previous	decisions  it is  its  duty  in	 the
constitutional field to correct itself as early as possible,
for  otherwise	the  future  progress  of  the	country	 and
happiness  of the people will be at stake.  As it was  clear
that the decision in Sankari Prasad's case was wrong, it was
pre-eminently  a  typical  case	 where	this  Court   should
overrule  it.  The longer it held the field the greater	 the
scope  for erosion of fundamental rights.  As  it  contained
the  seeds  of destruction of the cherished  rights  of	 the
people,	 the  sooner  it was overruled the  better  for	 the
country. [816 <a href="/doc/25576/" id="a_34">G-H]
The  Superintendent  and Legal Remembrancer  Stale  of	West
Bengal	v.The Corporation</a> at Calcutta, [1967] 2 S.C.R.,	 170
relied on.
</p><p id="p_9">(viii)	  The  Constitution  (Seventeenth  Amendment)	Act,
1964,  inasmuch	 as it takes away  or  abridges	 fundamental
rights was beyond 'the amending power of Parliament and void
because	 of contravention of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_35">Art. 13(2).</a>  But having  regard
to  the	 history  of  this  and	 earlier  amendment  to	 the
Constitution,  their  effect  on  the  social  and  economic
affairs of the country and the chaotic situation that may be
brought	 about by the sudden withdrawl at this stage of	 the
amendments from the Constitution it was undesirable to	give
retroactivity of this decision.	 The present was therefore a
fit   case   for  the  application  of	 the   doctrine	  of
"prospective.  overruling,  evolved  by the  courts  in	 the
United States of America. [805 E; 807 E, G; 808 C-D]
Great  Northern Railway v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Ref.	 Co.  (1932)
287  U.S.  358:	 77 L. Ed. 360, Chicot	County	Drainage  v.
Baxter State Bank, (1940) 308 U.S. 371, Griffin v. Illionis,

1081  and  Link	 letter	 v. Walker,  (1965)  381  U.S.	618,
referred to.
</p><p id="p_10">(ix),  The doctrine of "prospective overruling" is a  modern
doctrine suitable for a fast moving society.  It does not do
away with the doctrine of state decision but confines it  to
past  transactions.  While in Strict theory it may  be	said
that  the  doctrine 'involves the making of  law,  *hat	 the
court  really does is to declare the law but refuse to	give
retroactivity  to  it.	It is really  a	 pragmatic  solution
reconciling  the two conflicting doctrines, namely,  that  a
court  finds the law and that it does make law It finds	 law
but  restricts its operation to the future.  It enables	 the
court to bring about a smooth transition by correcting,	 its
errors without disturbing the impact of those errors on past
transactions.  By the application of this doctrine the	past
may be preserved and the future protected. [913 A-C; 814  E-
F]
Our   Constitution  does  not  expressly  of  by   necessary
implication  speak  against  the  doctrine  of	 prospective
overruling.   Articles 32, 141 and 142 are  designedly	made
comprehensive to enable the Supreme Court to declare law and
to give such directions or pass such orders as are necessary
to  do complete justice.  The expression 'declared' in	<a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_36">Art.
141</a>  is	 wider	than the words 'found  or  made'.   The	 law
declared  by the Supreme Court is the law of the  land..  If
so, there is no acceptable reason why
7 66
the  Court, in declaring the law in supersession of the	 law
declared by it earlier, could not restrict the operation  of
the law as declared to the future and save the	transactions
whether	 statutory  or otherwise that were affected  on	 the
basis of the earlier law. [813 F-H]
As  this  Court for the first time has been called  upon  to
apply  the  doctrine evolved in a  different  country  under
different circumstances, it would like to move warily in the
beginning  and would lay down the following  propositions  :
(1)  The doctrine of prospective overruling can	 be  invoked
only  in matters arising under our Constitution; (2) it	 can
be  applied  only by highest court of the country,  ie.	 the
Supreme	 Court as it has the constitutional jurisdiction  to
declare	 law binding on all the Courts as it has India;	 (3)
the scope of the retrospective operation of the law declared
by  the supreme Court superseding its earlier  decisions  is
left to its discretion to be moulded in accordance with- the
justice of the cause or matter before it. [814 C-D]
Applying  the  doctrine	 of prospective	 overruling  in	 the
circumstances  of the present case the Court  declared	that
this   decision	 would	not  affect  the  validity  of	 the
Constitution  (Seventeenth  Amendment) Act  1964,  or  other
amendments  to the Constitution taking away or	abridge	 the
fundamental  rights.   It further declared  that  in  future
Parliament  will  have	no power to amend Part	III  of	 Abe
Constitution  so as to take away or abridge the	 fundamental
rights. [814 F-G]
</p><p id="p_11">(x)  As	 according  to the above decision  the	Constitution
(Seventeenth  Amendment) Act held the field the validity  of
the  two impugned Acts, namely the Punjab Security  of	Land
Tennures Act, 10 of 1953 and the Mysore Land Reforms Act, 10
of  1962,  as  amended	by Act 14 of  1965,  could,  not  be
questioned on the ground that they offended Art 13, 14 or 31
of the Constitution. [815 E]
</p><p id="p_12">(xi) On	 the findings the following, questions did not	fall
to be considered :

providing  for a poll in Goa, Daman and Diu was an  instance
of  analogus  exercise	of  such  residuary  power  by	 the
Parliament, [816 E-F]

High Courts and finally this Court have been made the Judges
of whether any lagislative or executive action on  the	part
of   the   State,  considered  as  comprehensively   as	  is
possible,offends     the   Fundamental	 Rights	  and	<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_40">Art.
13(2)</a>declares  that  legislation which so offends is  to  be
deemed to be void.  The general words of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_41">art. 368</a> cannot  be
taken  to  mean that by calling an Act an <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_42">Amendment  of	 the
Constitution Act</a> a majority of total strengths and a  2/3rds
majority of the members presnt and voting in each House	 may

Chapter giving them. [860 A-D; 867 FF]
</p><p id="p_15">(iii)	  In   Britain	there  is  no  distinction   between
constitutional law and' ordinary law as to the procedure  of
their  enactment.  In our Constitution too in spite  of	 the
claim that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_43">Art. 368</a> is a Code Arts. 4, 11 and 169 show	that
the amendment of the Constitution can be by the ordinary law
making	procedure.   By this method one of  the	 legislative
limbs  in a State can be removed or created.  This  destroys
at  one stroke the claim that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_44">Art. 368</a> is a code  and.	also
that any special method of amendment of the Constitution  is
fundamentally necessary. [861 E-G]
The only difference between constitutional law and  ordinary
law can, be said to arise from the fact that  constitutional
laws  are  generally  amend-able under a  process  which  in
varying	 degrees, is more difficult or elaborate.  This	 may
give a distinct character to the law of the  Constitutionbut
it  does not serve to distinguish it from the other laws  of
the land for the purpose of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_45">Art. 13(2).</a>	 The Article  itself
does  not exclude constitutional law which could  have	been
easily	done had the constitution makers. so intended.	[862

An  amendment  to the Constitution is not made	under  power
derived' from Arts. 245 or 248 of the Constitution read with
entry  97 of List 1. The power of amendment is sui  generis.

</p><p id="p_16">(iv) A	 narrow	 view  need  not  be  taken  of	  the	word
amendment'..  By an amendment new matter may be	 added,	 old
matter	removed	 or  altered.  The  power  of  amending	 the
Constitution  is  however  not	intended  to  be  used	 for
experiments or as an escape, from restrictions against undue
State action enacted in the Constitution itself.  Nor is the
power  of  amendment available for the	purpose	 of  remoing
express	 or implied restrictions against the State. [862  F;

</p><p id="p_19">(v)  In	 <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_46">Art.  13(2)</a> the restriction is against	 the  State.
There  is  a difference between the State and  its  agencies
such  as  Government,  Parliament, the	Legislature  of	 the
States,	 and  the local and other  authorities.	  The  State
means  more than any of these or all of them  put  together.
By  making  the State subject to Fundamental  Rights  it  is
clearly stated in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_47">Art. 13(2)</a> that any of the agencies acting
alone or all the agencies acting together are not above	 the
Fundamental Rights.  Therefore when the- House of the People
or  the	 Council  of  States  introduces  a  Bill  for	 the
abridgement  of	 the  Fundamental  Rights,  it	ignores	 the
injunction  against it and even if the two Houses  pass	 the
Bill the injunction is next operative against the  President
since  the  expression Government of India  in	the  <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_48">General
Clauses	 Act</a>  means  the  President  of	 India.	  Thus	 the
injunction  in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_49">Art. 13(2)</a> is against the whole force of	 the
State	acting	either	in  its	 executive  or	 legislative
capacity. [866 E-H]
</p><p id="p_20">(vi) It	 is wrong to invoke the Directive Principles  as  if
there  is  some antinomy between them  and  the	 Fundamental
Rights.	  The  Directive Principles lay down the  routes  of
State  action  but such action must avoid  the	restrictions
stated	in the Fundamental Rights.  It cannot  be  conceived
that  in following the Directive Principles the	 Fundamental
Rights can be ignored. [867 G, 868 B]
</p><p id="p_21">(vii)	  Our  Constitution has given a guaranteed right  to
the  persons whose fundamental rights are affected  to	move

capable	 of being taken away.  This makes  our	Constitution
unique	and the American or other foreign precedents  cannot
be of much assistance. [875 H]

</p><p id="p_23">(viii)	  Parliament  today is not the constituent  body  as
the  constituent 'assembly was but a constituted body  which

</p><p id="p_24">(ix) If it is desired to abridge the Fundamental Rights	 the

Parliament   in	 Arts.	15,  16	 and  19  did  not   abridge
fundamental rights and were therefore valid. [879 C, 883 B]
</p><p id="p_26">(xi) Our  Constitution	accepted the theory  that  Right  of
Property  is  a fundamental right though perhaps it  was  an
error  to  do so if socialisation was desired.	 It  treated
property rights as inviolable except through law for  public
good  and on payment of compensation.  However	the  various
amendments  have significantly changed the position.   As  a
result	of  them,  except for  land  within  the  prescribed
ceiling,  all other land can be acquired or  rights  therein
extinguished   or  modified  without  compensation  and	  no
challenge to the law can be made under Arts. 14, 19 or 31 of
the Constitution. [887 B; 888 B-C; 896 F-G]
As  there is apprehension that the erosion of the  right  to
property  may be practised against other fundamental  rights
it  is necessary to call a halt.  An attempt to	 abridge  or
take  away  Fundamental Rights by a  constituted  Parliament
even through an amendment of the Constitution can I declared
void.	This Court has the power and the jurisdiction to  do
so.  The opposite view expressed in Sajjan Singh's case	 was
wrong.. [898 B-C]
</p><p id="p_27">(xii)	  The  First, Fourth and Seventh amendments  of	 the

courts to decline to take up an amendment for  consideration
after  a  considerable	lapse  of  time	 when  it  was	 not
challenged  before or was sustained on an  earlier  occasion
after challenge. [893 O, H 1902 D-E]

</p><p id="p_28">(xiii)	  In the Seventeenth Amendment, the extension of the
definition of 'estate' to include ryotwari and	agricultural
lands is an inroad into the Fundamental Rights but it cannot
be questioned in view, of the existence of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_55">Art. 3 1A(1)	 (a)</a>
whose validity cannot now be challenged.  The new definition
of estate introduced by the amendment is beyond the reach of
the Courts not because it is not law but because it is "law"

The third section of the Act is however invalid.  It adds 44
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_58">State  Act</a>s  to the ninth schedule.  The Schedule  is  being

There can therefore, be no doubt that the power to amend the
Constitution  must be contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_66">Art. 368.</a>  If  there	 was
any doubt in the matter it is resolved by the words, namely,
"the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the

procedure has been followed. [826 A-D]

amendment of the Constitution in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_67">Art. 248</a> or in any entry of
List  1. It would in the circumstances 'be more	 appropriate
to  read  the power in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_68">Art. 368</a> than in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_69">Art. 248</a>  read	with
item 97 of List I. [826 H-827 A]
The  original  intention of the Constitution makers  was  to
give  residuary	 power to the States.  The  mere  fact	that
during	the passage of the Constitution by  the	 Constituent
Assembly  residuary  power was finally vested in  the  Union
would not therefore mean that it includes the power to amend
the  Constitution.  Moreover residuary power cannot be	used
to  change the fundamental law of the  Constitution  because
all legislation is under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_70">Art. 245 "</a>subject to the provisions
of this Constitution". [827 B, H]
Mere  accident of similarity of procedure provided  in	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_71">Art.
368</a>  to	 that  provided	 for  ordinary	legislation   cannot
obliterate the basic difference 'between constitutional	 law

done  under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_72">Art.  368</a>	and  not  its  similarity  to  other
procedure  that should be stressed.  What emerges after	 the

procedure   under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_74">Art.	 368</a>  differs  from,  the   ordinary

care  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_75">Art.368.</a> What emerges after the procedure has	been
followed is not an Act but the Constitution stands  amended.
After that the courts can only see whether the procedure  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_76">Art. 368</a> was followed.	If it has been followed there is  no
question of testing the amendment of the Constitution On the
avail  of fundamental rights or in any other way as  in	 the

It  may	 be  open to doubt whether the	power  of  amendment
contained  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_77">Art.  368</a> goes to the  extent  of  completely
abrogating the present Constitution and substituting I it by

The seventeenth amendment is merely in exercise of the power
of amendment as indicated above and cannot be struck down on

</p><p id="p_44">(xii)The  doctrine  of	prospective  overruling	 cannot	  be
accepted in this    country.  The doctrine accepted here  is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">773</span>
from  the  date	 the  law came	into  force.   It  would  be

Moreover a law contravening <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_105">Art. 13(2)</a> is void ab initio  as

</p><p id="p_45">Per  Bachawat  J.-(i) <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_110">Article 368</a> not  only  prescribes	 the
procedure  but	also gives the power of	 amendment.   It  is
because	 the power to amend is given by the article that  by
following  its	procedure the Constitution  stands  amended.
The  proviso is enacted on the assumption that	the  several
articles mentioned in it are amendable; but for the  proviso
they  would have been amendable under the main part.   There
is no other provision in the Constitution under which  these
articles' can be amended. [904 D]
Articles  4, 169, Fifth Schedule Part D and  Sixth  Schedule
Para 21 empower the Parliament to make amendments to certain

amended	 by  recourse to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_112">Art. 368</a> only.	  No  other  article

</p><p id="p_46">(ii) The  power to amend the Constitution cannot be said  to
reside in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_113">Art. 248</a> and List 1, item 97 because if  amendment
could be made by ordinary legislative process <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_114">Art. 368</a> would
be meaningless.	 Under the residual power the Parliament has
no  competence	to make any law with respect to	 any  matter

under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_115">Art.  368</a>  even	Lists 11 and  III  can	be  amended.
Moreover a law passed by residual power is passed by  virtue
of  <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_116">Art.  245</a> and must be subject to the provisions  of	 the
Constitution   so   that  it  cannot   derogate	  from	 the

</p><p id="p_47">(iii)	  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_117">Article  368</a>	gives the power	 of  amending  'this

</p><p id="p_48">(iv) The  contention that a constitutional  amendment  under

rejected.  The distinction between the Constitution and	 law
is so fundamental that the Constitution is not regarded as a
law  or	 a  legislative act.  The  Constitution	 mean-,	 the
Constitution  as amended.  An amendment made  in  conformity
with <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_123">Art. 368</a> is a part of the Constitution and is  likewise
not  law.  Save as expressly provided in Arts. 4, 169  Fifth
Schedule Part D and Sixth Schedule para 21 no law can  amend
the  Constitution and a law which purports to make  such  an
amendment  is  void.  It is for this reason  that  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_124">Art.	 368</a>
avoids all reference to law making by the Parliament.  There

If  a  constitutional amendment creating a  new	 fundamental
rights and incorporating it in Part III were a law, it would
not  be open to the Parliament by a subsequent amendment  to
abrogate  the  new fundamental right for such  an  amendment
would  be  repugnant  to Part 111.  But	 the  conclusion  is
absurd for the body which enacted the right can surely	take
it away by the same process. [909 E]
Marbury	 v.  Madison, (1803) 1 Cranch 137 :2  L.Ed.  60	 and
Riley v. Carter, 88 A.L.R. 1008, referred to.
</p><p id="p_49">(v)  There is no conflict between Arts. 13(2) and 368.	 The
two articles operate in different fields, the former in	 the
field	of  law,  the  latter  in  that	 of   constitutional
amendment. [910 B]
</p><p id="p_50">(vi) The  non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_125">Art. 35</a> does not show	that
the article is not amendable.  The non-obstante clause is to
be found also in, Arts. 258(1). 364, 369, 370 and 371A.	  No
one  has  suggested that these articles are  not  amendable.
[910 D]
</p><p id="p_51">(vii)	  The  words 'fundamental' used in regard to  rights
in  Part III and the word guaranteed in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_126">Art. 32</a> do not	mean
that the said rights cannot be amended.	 The constitution is
never  at rest; it changes with the progress of	 time.	 The
scale  of  values in Parts III and IV is  not  immortal	 and
these  Parts being parts of the Constitution are not  immune
from amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_127">Art. 368.</a> [910 F-G]
The impugned amendments to be Constitution were made to meet
the  situations	 created by decisions of this Court  and  to
carry  out urgent agrarian reforms.  If it is held that	 the
rights,	 conferred by Part III cannot be abridged  or  taken
away  by  constitutional amendments,  all  these  amendments
would  be invalid.  The Constitution makers could  not	have
intended  that the ' rights conferred by Part III could	 not
be  altered for' giving effect to the policy of	 Part.	 IV.
Nor  was it intended that defects in Part III could  not  be
cured or that possible errors in judicial interpretations of
Part   III   could  not	 be  rectified	 by   constitutional
amendments. [913 D-E]
</p><p id="p_52">(viii)	  It  cannot be said that the people in exercise  of
their  sovereign  power have placed the	 fundamental  rights
beyond	the reach of the amending power.  The people  acting
through	 the  Constituent Assembly reserved  for  themselves
certain	 rights and liberties and ordained that	 they  shalt
not be curtailed by ordinary legislation.  But the people by
the same Constitution also authorised the Parliament to make
amendments to the Constitution.	 In exercise of the amending
power the Parliament has ample authority to, abridge or take
away the fundamental rights under Part III [915 B-C]
Merely because of possibility of abuse, the power cannot  be
denied. [916 H]

may fail to achieve the purpose. [916 <a href="/doc/1789936/" id="a_129">A]

</p><p id="p_55">(x)  The  best exposition of the Constitution is that  which
it has received from contemporaneous judicial decisions	 and
enactments.   No one in Parliament doubted  the	 proposition
that  fundamental  rights could be amended, when  the  First
Amendment   Act	 of  1951  was	passed.	  The	concept	  of
amendability  was upheld in <a href="/doc/1879676/" id="a_130">S. Krishnan &amp; Ors. v.  State  of
Madras</a> [1951] S.C.R. 621 decided in 1951,'in Sankari  Prasad

In   validating	 the  impugned	laws  Parliament   was	 not

said laws and such constitutional validating was within	 its
competence. [920 C-E]
</p><p id="p_58">(xiii)	  The abolition of Zamindari was a necessary reform.
It  is the First Constitution Amendment Act that  made	this

be undone.  The battle for the put is lost. [921 B-C]
If the First Fourth, Sixteenth &amp; Seventeenth Amendments Acts
are  void  they do not legally exist from  their  inception.
They  cannot  be,  valid  from	1951  to  1967	and  invalid
thereafter.   To  say that they were valid in the  past	 and
Will be invalid in the future is to amend  the.Constitution.
Such  a naked power of amendment is not given to the  Judges
and therefore the doctrine of prospective overruling  cannot
be, adopted. [921 D-E]
It  is	not  possible  to say  that  the  First	 and  Fourth
Amendments  though originally valid have now been  validated
by acquiescence.  If they infringe <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_132">Art. 13(2)</a> they were void
from their inception.  If these ammendments are validated by
acquiescence the Seventeenth Amendment is equally validated.

</p><p id="p_59">(xv) The  contention  that Dr. Ambedkar did not	 regard	 the
fundamental  rights  as amendable is not  supported  by	 the
speeches in the' Constituent Assembly. [922 C-D]
Per Ramaswami J.(i) In a written Constitution the  amendment
of the Constitution is a substantive constituent act  which,
is  made  in the exercise of the sovereign power  through  a
predesigned procedure unconnected with ordinary legislation.
The  amending  power in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_133">Art. 368</a> is hence  sui	generis	 and
cannot	be  compared to the law making power  of  Parliament
pursuant to <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_134">Art. 246</a> read with Lists II and Ill.  It follows
that the expression 'law' in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_135">Art. 13(2)</a> cannot be  construed
as  including  an  amendment of the  Constitution  which  is
achieved   by  Parliament  in  exercise	 of  its   sovereign
constituent  power but must mean law made by  Parliament  in
its legislative capacity under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_136">Art. 246</a> read 'with I List  I
and  III of the 7th Schedule.  It is also clear on the	same
line of reasoning that law in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_137">Art. 13(2)</a> cannot be construed
so  as	to include "law' made by Parliament under  Arts.  4,
169, 392, 5th Schedule Part 1 and 6th Schedule para 21.	 The
amending power of Parliament exercised under these  Articles
stands on the same pedestal as the constitutional amend ment
made under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_138">Art. 368</a> so far as <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_139">Art. 13(2)</a> is concerned.	[930
H 931 E]
</p><p id="p_60">(ii) The  language  of	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_140">Art. 368</a> is  perfectly	general	 and
empowers  Parliament to amend the Constitution	without	 any
exception whatsoever.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">776</span>
<p id="p_61">The use of the word 'fundamental' to describe the rights  in
Part  III and the word 'guaranteed' in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_141">Art. 32</a>	cannot	lift
the fundamental rights above the Constitution itself [931 F,
H]
</p><p id="p_62">(iii)	  It  is unreasonable to suggest that what <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_142">Art.	 368</a>
provides  is  only  the	 mechanics  of	the  procedure	 for
amendment and not the power to amend.  The significant	fact
that  a separate part has been devoted in  the	Constitution
for  "amendment of the constitution" and there is  only	 one
Article	 in  that  Part shows that both the  power  and	 the
procedure to amend are enacted in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_143">Art. 368.</a>  Again the words
"the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the
terms  of  the	Bill" in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_144">Art. 368</a>  clearly  contemplate	 and
provide for the power to amend after the requisite procedure
has been followed. [932 C-E]
</p><p id="p_63">(iv) The  power	 of  constitutional  amendment	cannot	fall
within Arts. 246 and 248 read with item 97 of List I because
it is illogical and a contradiction in terms to say that the
amending  power can be exercised "subject to the  provisions
of the Constitution" as the power under these articles	must
be. [933 B]
</p><p id="p_64">(v) There is no room for an implication in the	construction
ofArt. 368.    If  the	Constitution makers  wanted  certain
basic  features to be unamendable they would have  said	 so.

</p><p id="p_65">The  concepts  of  liberty and	equality  are  changing	 and
dynamic	 and hence the notion of permanency or	immutability
cannot	be attached to any of the fundamental  rights.	 The
adjustment  between  freedom  and  compulsion,	between	 the
rights	of individuals and the social interest	and  welfare
must  necessarily  be  a  matter  for  changing	 needs	 and
conditions.  The proper approach is therefore to  look	upon
the  fundamental rights of the individual as conditioned  by
social responsibility, by the necessities of the society, by
the  balancing	of  interests and not  as  pre-ordained	 and
untouchable private rights. [934 E-935 C]
</p><p id="p_66">(vi) It	 must  not be forgotten that neither the  rights  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_146">Art. 31</a> nor those in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_147">Art. 19</a> are absolute.  The purposes for
which	fundamental  rights  can  be  regulated	 which	 are
specified in cls. (2) to (6) could not have been assumed  by
the  Constitution  makers  to be  static  and  incapable  of
expansion.   It	 cannot	 be assumed  that  the	Constitution
makers	intended  to  forge a  political  strait-jacket	 for
generations  to	 come.	Today at a time when  absolutes	 are
discredited,  it must not be too readily assumed that  there
are  basic  features of the Constitution which	shackle	 the
amending  power and which take precedence over	the  general
welfare	 of  nation  and the need for  agrarian	 and  social
reform. [936 B-937 C]
</p><p id="p_67">(vii)	  In construing <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_148">Art. 368</a> it is essential to remember
the  nature  and  subject  matter of  that  Article  and  to
interpret it subjectae materies.  The power of amendment  is
in  point  of quality an adjunct of sovereignty.  It  is  in
truth  the  exercise of the highest sovereign power  in	 the
State. if the amending power is an adjunct of sovereignty it
does not admit of any limitations. [937 D]
</p><p id="p_68">(viii)	  If  the fundamental rights are unamendable and  if
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_149">Art. 368</a> does not include any such power it follows that the
amendment  of, say, <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_150">Art. 31</a> by insertions of Arts.  31A	 and
31B  can  only	be  made by a  violent	revolution.   It  is
doubtful  if the proceedings of a new  Constituent  Assembly
that may be called will have any legal validity for if the

sufficient support for it in the Constitution as amended  by

though	it is "law" under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_169">Art. 13 (2)</a> and is an inroad	into

Subbarao,   C.J.  These	 three	writ  petitions	 raise	 the
important  question  of	 the validity  of  the	Constitution
(Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964.
</p><p id="p_105">Writ  Petition No. 153 of 1966, is filed by the	 petitioners
therein	 against  the  State of	 Punjab	 and  the  Financial
Commissioner, Punjab.  The petitioners are the son, daughter
and granddaughters of one Henry Golak Nath, who died on July
30,  1953.  The Financial Commissioner, in revision  against
the  order  made by the Additional  Commissioner,  Jullundur
Division,  held by an order dated January 22, 1962  that  an
area  of 418 standard acres and 9-1/4 units was	 surplus  in
the  hands  of the petitioners under the provisions  of	 the
Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act X of 1953, read with <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_170"> s.
10-B</a>  thereof.	The petitioners, alleging that the  relevant
provisions of the said Act where under the said area was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">781</span>
declared surplus were void on the ground that they infringed
their  rights under cls. (f) and (g) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_171">Art. 19</a> and <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_172">Art.  14</a>
of  the Constitution, filed a writ in this Court under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_173">Art.
32</a> of the Constitution for a direction that the Constitution
(First Amendment) Act 1951, Constitution (Fourth  Amendment)
Act,  1955, Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act,  1964,
insofar	 as  they  affected their  fundamental	rights	were
unconstitutional and inoperative and for a direction that<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_174"> s.
10-B</a>  of  the said Act X of 1953 was void  as  violative  of
Arts. 14 and 19 (1) (f) and (g) of the Constitution.
Writ  Petitions	 Nos.  202 and 203 of  1966  were  filed  by
different petitioners under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_175">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution	 for
a  declaration that the Mysore Land Reforms Act (Act  10  of
1962) as amended by Act 14 of 1965, which fixed ceilings  on
land  holdings and conferred ownership of surplus  lands  on
tenants	 infringed Arts. 14, 19 and 31 of  the	Constitution
and, therefore, was unconstitutional and void.
The States of Punjab and Mysore, inter alia, contended	that
the said Acts were saved from attack on the ground that they
infringed  the	fundamental  rights of	the  petitioners  by
reason	of  the Constitution  (Seventeenth  Amendment)	Act,
1964,  which, by amending <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_176">Art. 31-A</a> of the Constitution	 and
including the said two Arts in the 9th Schedule thereto, had
placed them beyond attack.
</p><p id="p_106">In Writ Petition No. 153 of 1966, 7 parties intervened.	  In
Writ  Petition	No. 202 of 1966 one  party  intervened.	  In
addition,  in  the first petition, notice was given  to	 the
Advocates  General  of	various	 States.   A11	the  learned
counsel	 appearing  for the parties, the  Advocates  General
appearing  for	the States and the learned counsel  for	 the
interveners   have,  placed  their   respective	  viewpoints
exhaustively before us.	 We are indebted to all of them	 for
their  thorough	 preparation  and clear	 exposition  of	 the
difficult  questions  of law that were raised  in  the	said
petitions.
</p><p id="p_107">At  the outset it would be convenient to place	briefly	 the
respective  contentions	 under	different heads	 :  (1)	 The
Constitution is intended to be permanent and, therefore,  it
cannot	be  amended  in a way which would  injure,  maim  or
destroy	  its	indestructible	character.  (2)	  The	word
"amendment"  implies such an addition or change	 within	 the
lines	of  the	 original  instrument  as  will	 effect	  an
improvement or better carry out the purpose for which it was
framed	and  it	 cannot be so construed	 as  to	 enable	 the
Parliament  to	destroy	 the  permanent	 character  of	 the
Constitution.  (3) The fundamental rights are a part of	 the
basic structure of the Constitution and, therefore, the said
power can be exercised only to preserve rather than  destroy
the essence of those rights. (4) The limits on the power  to
amend are implied in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_177">Art. 368</a>, for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">782</span>
expression   "amend"  has  a  limited  meaning.	  The	wide
phraseo-logy  used  in the Constitution in  other  Articles,
such as "repeal" and "re-enact" indicates that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_178">art. 368</a> only
enables a modification of the Articles within the  framework
of  the	 Constitution  and a destruction of  them.  (5)	 The
debates in the Constituent Assembly, particularly the speech
of  Mr. Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first PA= Minister of  India,
and the reply of Dr. Ambedkar, who piloted the Bill disclose
clearly that it was never the intention of the makers of the
Constitution by putting in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_179">Art. 368</a> to enable the Parliament
to  repeal the fundamental rights, the	circumstances  under
which  the amendment moved by Mr. H. V. Kamath, one  of	 the
members of Constituent Assembly, was withdrawn and <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_180">Art.	 368</a>
was  finally adopted, support the contention that  amendment
of  Part II, is outside the scope of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_181">Art. 368.</a> (6) Part	 III
of  the	 Constitution  is a  self-contained  Code.  and	 its
provisions  are	 elastic  enough  to  meet  all	  reasonable
requirements of changing situations. (7) The power to  amend
is  sought to be derived from three sources, namely, (i)  by
implication  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_182">Art. 368</a> itself; The procedure  to  amend
culminating in the amendment of the Constitution necessarily
implies	 that power, (ii) the power and ,the limits  of	 the
power  to  amend are implied in the Articles  sought  to  be
amended, and (iii) <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_183">Art. 368</a> only lays down the procedure  to
amend, but the power to amend is only the legislative  power
conferred on the Parliament under Arts. 245, 246 and 248  of
the Constitution. (8) The definition of "law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_184">Art.  13(2)</a>
of the Constitution includes every branch of law, statutory,
constitutional, etc.,' and therefore, the power to amend  in
whichever  branch it may be classified, if it takes away  or
abridges  fundamental rights would be void  thereunder.	 (9)
The impugned amendment detracts from the jurisdiction of the
High  Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_185">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution and also	 the
legislative  powers  of the States and	therefore  it  falls
within the scope of the proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_186">Art. 368.</a>
The  said summary, though not exhaustive, broadly gives	 the
various	 nuances  of the contentions raised by	the  learned
counsel,  who question the validity of the  17th  Amendment.
We  have  not noticed the other arguments  of  Mr.  Nambiar,
which  are peculiar to the Writ Petition No. 153 of 1966  as
those  questions do not arise for decision, in the  view  we
are taking on the common questions.
</p><p id="p_108">On  behalf of the Union and the States the following  points
were  pressed  : (1) A Constitutional amendment is  made  in
exercise of the sovereign power and not legislative power of
Parliament  and,.  therefore, it partakes  the	quality	 and
character   of	the  Constitution  itself.  (2)	  The	real
distinction is between a rigid and a flexible  Constitution.
The  distinction  is based upon the express  limits  of	 the
amending power. (3) The provisions of Art.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">			    783</span>
<p id="p_109">368-axe	 clear	and unequivocal and there  is  no-scope	 for
invoking  implied  limitations on that	power:	further	 the
doctrine  of impliedpower has been rejected by the  American
courts and jurists. (4) The object of the amending clause in
a  flexible  Consetitution is to enable	 the  Parliament  to
amend  the Constitution in order to express the will of	 the
people	according  to the changing course of events  and  if
amending  power	 is restricted by implied  limitations,	 the
Constitution  itself  might  be	 destroyed  by	 revolution.
Indeed,	 it  is	 a safety valve and  an	 alternative  for  a
violent	 change by revolution. (5) There- are no  basic	 and
non-basic  features of the Constitution; everything  in	 the
Constitution is basic and it can be amended in order to help
the future growth and progress of the country. (6)  Debates.
in  the	 Constituent  Assembly cannot  be  relied  upon	 for
construing <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_187">Art. 368</a> of the Constitution and even if-they can
be,  there  is nothing in the debates to  prove,  positively
that  fundamental rights were excluded from  amendment.	 (7)
Most of the amendments are made out of political  necessity:
they  involve, questions, such. as, how to exercise  power,,
how to make the lot of the citizens better and the like and,
therefore,  not being judicial questions, they	are  outside
the  court's jurisdiction. (8) The language of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_188">Art.  368</a>  is
clear,	categorical, imperative and universal, on the  other
hand,  the  language  of  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_189">Art. 13(2)</a> is	 such  as  to  admit
qualifications or limitations and, therefore, the Court must
construe  them	in such a manner as that Article  could	 not
control	 <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_190">Art.  368.</a> (9) In order to  enforce  the  Directive
Principles  the Constitution was amended from time  to	time
and  the  great fabric of the Indian Union  has	 been  built
since  1950  on	 the basis that the  Constitution  could  be
amended	 and,  therefore, any reversal of,  the	 previous  I
decisions would introduce economic chaos in our country	 and
that,	therefore,   the  burden  is  very   heavy   uponthe
petitioners to establish that the fundamental rights  cannot
be amended under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_191">Art. 368</a> of the Constitution. (10) <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_192">Art. 31-
A</a>  and the 9th Schedule do not affect the power of the	High
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_193">Art. 226</a> or the legislative power of the  States
though	 the  area  of	their  operation  is  limited	and,
therefore, they do not fall within the scope of the  proviso
to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_194">Art. 3 68.</a>

<a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_203">(Punjab	 Act</a>  10  of  1953) is included	 as  item  54.	 The
definition  of "estate" was amended and the  Ninth  Schedule
was  amended by including therein the said two Acts  by	 the
Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">785</span>
<p id="p_121">The result of the said amendments is that both the said Acts
dealing-   with	 estates,  within  their   wide	  definition
introduced by the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment)	Act,
1964, having been included in the Ninth Schedule, are placed
beyond	any attack on the ground that their  provisions	 are
inconsistent with or take away or abridge any of the  rights
conferred  by  Part III of the Constitution.  It  is  common
case  that if the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment)	Act,
1964, was constitutionally valid, the said Acts could not be
impugned on any of the said grounds.
</p><p id="p_122">The  question of the amendability of the fundamental  rights
was  considered	 by  this Court earlier	 in  two  decisions,
namely,	 <a href="/doc/1706770/" id="a_204">Sri Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India	 and
State of Bihar</a>(1) and in <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_205">Sajjan Singh v. State of  Rajasthan
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">(2)</span>
In</a> the former the validity of the Constitution (First Amend-
ment) Act, 1951, which inserted, inter alia, Arts. 31-A	 and
31-B  in the Constitution, was questioned.   That  amendment
was  made  under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_206">Art.	368</a>  of	 the  Constitution  by	 the
Provisional Parliament.	 This Court held that Parliament had
power to amend Part III of the Constitution.  The Court came
to  that  conclusion on two grounds, namely,  (1)  the	word
"law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_207">Art. 13(2)</a> was one made in exercise of	 legislative
power  and  not	 constitutional	 law  made  in	exercise  of
constituent  power; and (ii) there were two articles  (Arts.
13(2)  and  368)  each	of which  was  widely  phrased	and,
therefore, harmonious construction required that one  should
be  so read as to be controlled and qualified by the  other,
and  having  regard to the circumstances  mentioned  in	 the
judgment  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_208">Art.	13</a>  must be read subject  to  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_209">Art.  368.</a>   A
careful	 perusal of' the judgment indicates that  the  whole
decision turned upon an assumption that the expression "law"
in Art 13(2) does not include constitutional law and on that
assumption  an attempt was made to harmonise <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_210">Article 13	 (2)</a>
and <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_211">368</a> of the Constitution.

text  of  the question of the validity of  the	Constitution
(Seventeenth  Amendment) Act, 1964.  Two questions arose  in
that  case:  (1)  Whether  the	amendment  Act	insofar	  it
purported  to take away or abridge the rights  conferred  by
Part III of the Constitution fell within the prohibition  of
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_212">Art. 13(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_213">(2)</a> Whether Articles 31-A and 31-B sought  to
make changes in Arts. 132, 136 or 226 or in any of the lists
in  the Seventh Schedule and therefore the  requirements  of
the  proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_214">Article 368</a> had to be satisfied.   Both	 the
Chief Justice and Mudholkar, J. made it clear that the first
contention  was	 not raised before the Court.	The  learned
counsel	  appearing  for  both	the  parties  accepted	 the
correctness  of the decision in Sankari Prasad's case(1)  in
that

<p id="p_125">regard.	 Yet Gajendragadkar, C.J. speaking for the  majority
,agreed	 with the reasons given in Sankari Prasad's  case(1)
on  the first question and Hidayatullah and  Mudholkar,	 JJ.
expressed their dissent from the-said view.  But all of them
agreed, though for different reasons on the second question.
Gajendragadkar,	 C.J.  speaking	 for  himself,	Wanchoo	 and
Raghubar  Dayal, JJ. rejected the contention that  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_215">Art.	 368</a>
did  not  confer  power	 on Parliament	to  take.  away	 the
fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III. When a suggestion
was  made that the decision in the aforesaid case should  be
reconsidered and reviewed, the learned Chief Justice  though
he  conceded  that  in	a  case-  where	 a  decision  had  a
significant  impact on the fundamental rights  of  citizens,
the  Court would be inclined to review its earlier  decision
in  the	 interests  of	the public good,  he  did  not	find
considerations of substantial and compelling character to do
so  in	that case.  But after: referring  to  the  reasoning
given in Sankari Prasad's case(1) the; learned Chief Justice
observed
	      "In our opinion , the expression "amendment of
	      the,  Constitution" plainly and  unambiguously
	      means  amendment of all the provisions of	 the
	      Constitution."
</p><p id="p_126">Referring,  to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_216">Art. 13 (2</a>), he restated the  same  reasoning
found in, the earlier decision and added that if it was	 the
intention  of the Constitution-makers to  save,	 fundamental
rights from the amending,process they should have taken	 the
precaution of making A-. clear provision in that regard.  In
short,	the majority, speaking through	Gajendragadkar,	 C.L
agreed	that  no case had been made, out for  reviewing	 the
earlier decision and practically accepted the reasons  given
in the-earlier decision.  Hidyatullah J.     speaking	 for
himself, observed
	      "But  I  make  it clear that  I  must  not  be
	      understood to have subscribed to the view that
	      the word "law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_217">Art. 13(2)</a> does not  control
	      constitutional   amendments.,  I	reserve	  my
	      opinion  on that case for I apprehend that  it
	      depends  on  how	wide  is  the  "law"in	that
	      Article."
</p><p id="p_127">	      After  giving  his reasons  for  doubting	 the
	      correctness of the reasoning given in  Sankari
	      Prasad's case(1), the learned Judge  concluded
	      thus :
</p><p id="p_128">	      "I  would require stronger reasons than  those
	      given  in Sankari Prasad's case(1) to make  me
	      accept  the view that Fundamental Rights	were
	      not really fundamental but were intended to be
	      within the powers of amendment in common	with
	      the  other  parts	 of  the  Constitution	 and
	      without the concurrence of the States."
</p><p id="p_129">	      (1)   [1952] S.C.R. 89.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">	      787</span>
<p id="p_130">	      The. learned Judge continued
	      "The Constitution gives so many assurances  in
	      Part  III that it would be difficult to  think
	      that  they  were the playthings of  a  special
	      majority."
</p><p id="p_131">Mudholkar, J. was positive that the result of a	 legislative
action	of a legislature could not be other than "law"	and,
therefore,  it	seemed	to  him	 that  the  fact  that	 the
legislation  dealt with the amendment of a provision of	 the
Constitution would not make, its results anytheless a 'law".
He  further  pointed  out that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_218">Art. 368</a>	 did  not  say	that
whenever Parliament made an amendment to the Constitution it
assumed	 a  different capacity from that  of  a	 constituent
body.	He  also brought out other defects in  the  line  of
reasoning  adopted  in Sankari Prasad's case(1).   It  will,
therefore,be  seen-that the correctness of the	decision  in
Sankari	 Prasad's  case(1)  was not  questioned	 in   Sajjan
Singh's	 case(2) Though it was not questioned, three of	 the
learned	 Judges agreed with the view expressed therein,	 but
two  learned Judges were inclined to take a different  view.
But,  as that question was not raised, the  minority  agreed
with  the  conclusion,	arrived at by the  majority  on	 the
question whether the Seventeenth Amendment Act was,  covered
by  the	 proviso.  to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_219">Art. 368</a>	of  the	 Constitution.	 The
conflict between the majority and the minority in   Sajjan's
Singh's case(1) falls to be resolved in this case.  The said
conflict and, the great importance of the question raised is
the  justification  for-..the  Constitution  of	 the  larger
Bench., The decision in Sankri Prasad's case(1) was  assumed
to be correct in subsequent decisions of this Court.  <a href="/doc/1879676/" id="a_220">See S.
Krishnan  v. State of Madras</a>(1), <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_221">The State-' of West  Bengal
v.   Anwar   All  Sarkar</a>(1)  and  <a href="/doc/761967/" id="a_222">Basheshar  Nath   v.	 The
Commissioner  of  Income-tax, Delhi and	 Rajasthan</a>(5).	 But
nothing	 turns	upon that fact, as the	correctness  of	 the
derision was not questioned-. in those cases.
A correct appreciation of the scope and the place of  funda-
mental	rights in our Constitution will give its  the  right
perspective for solving the problem presented before us, Its
scope  cannot be appreciated unless we have a conspectus  of
the Constitution, its objects. and its machinery to  achieve
those  object.	The objective sought- to be achieved by	 the
Constitution is declared in sonorous terms. in its  preamble
which reads
	      "We  the	people	of  India  having   solemnly
	      resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign,
	      Democratic, Republic and to secure to all	 its
	      citizens	 justice.  liberty.  equality.	 and
	      fraternity-.

<p id="p_136">It  contains in a nutshell, its ideals and its	aspirations.
The  preamble  is  not	a platitude but	 the,  mode  of	 its
realisation  is	 worked out in detail in  the  Constitution.
The    Constitution   brings   into   existence	   different
constitutional	entities, namely, the Union, the States	 and
the  Union Territories.	 It creates three major	 instruments
of  power,  namely, the Legislature, the Executive  and	 the
Judiciary.   It demarcates their jurisdiction  minutely	 and
expects	 them  to exercise their respective  powers  without
overstepping their limits.  They should function within	 the
spheres allotted to them.  Some powers overlap and some	 are
superseded  during emergencies.	 The mode of  resolution  of
conflicts   and	  conditions  for  supersession	  are	also
prescribed.  In short, the scope of the power and the-manner
of its exercise are regulated by law.  No authority  created
under  the  Constitution  is supreme;  the  Constitution  is
supreme; and all the authorities function under the  supreme
law of the land.  The rule of law under the Constitution has
a  glorious content.  It embodies the. modem concept of	 law
evolved over the centuries.  It empowers the Legislatures to
make  laws in respect of matters enumerated in the  3  Lists
annexed	 to Schedule VII.  In Part IV of  the  Constitution,
the Directive Principles of State Policy are laid down.	  It
enjoins	 it to bring about a social order in which  justice,
social.	  economic  and	 political-shall  inform   all	 the
institutions of national life.	It directs it to work for an
egalitarian  society  where  there is  no  concentration  of
wealth,	 where	there  is  plenty,  where  there  is   equal
opportunity for all, to education, to work, to	livelihood'.
and  where there is social justice.  But, having  regard  to
the  past  history of our country, it could  not  implicitly
believe the representatives of the people, for	uncontrolled
and unrestricted power might lead to an authoritarian State.
It,  therefore,	 preserves the natural	rights	against	 the
State  encroachment and constitutes the higher judiciary  of
the  State  as	the  sentinel of the  said  rights  and	 the
balancing  wheel  between  the	rights,	 subject  to  social
control.   In  short,  the fundamental	rights,	 subject  to
social	control, have been incorporated in the rule of	law.
That  is  brought about by an interesting process.   In	 the
implementation	of the Directive Principles,  Parliament  or
the  Legislature of a State makes laws in respect of  matter
or  matters allotted to it.  But the higher Judiciary  tests
their  validity on certain objective criteria,	namely,	 (i)
whether	 the  appropriate Legislature  has  the	 legislative
competency  to	make  the law; (ii)  whether  the  said	 law
infringes  any of the fundamental rights; (iii) even  if  it
Infringement  the  freedoms  under  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_223">Art.  19</a>,  whether	 the
infringement  only  amounts to "reasonable  restriction"  on
such  rights  in  "public  interest."  By  this	 process  of
scrutiny, the court maintains the validity of only such laws
as keep a just balance between freedoms and social  control.
The  duty of reconciling fundamental rights in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_224">Art.  19</a>	 and
the laws of social control is cast upon the courts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">789</span>
and the touchstone or the standard is contained in the	said
two expressions.  The standard is an elastic one; it  varies
with  time, space and condition.  What is  reasonable  under
certain	  circumstances	 may  not  be  so  under   different
circumstances.	 The  constitutional philosophy	 of  law  is
reflected  in  Parts-1111 and IV of the	 Constitution.	 The
rule  of law under the Constitution serves the needs of	 the
people	 without   unduly  infringing  their   rights.	  It
recognizes the social reality and tries to adjust itself  to
it  from-time,	to  time avoiding  the	authoritarian  pat@.
EKery  institution or political party that  functions  under
the  Constitution must accept it; otherwise it has no  place
under the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_137">Now, what are the fundamental rights ? They are embodied  in
Part III of the Constitution and they may be classified thus
:  (i) right to equality, (ii) right to freedom,  (iii)right
against exploitation, (iv) right to freedom of religion, (v)
cultural and educational rights, (vi) right to property, and
</p><p id="p_138">(vii) right to constitutional remedies.	 They are the rights
of  the people preserved by our Constitution.	"Fundamental
rights" are the modern name for what have been traditionally
known  as "natural rights".  As one author puts:  "they	 are
moral rights which every human being everywhere at all times
ought	to  have  sim  y  because  of  the  fact   that	  in
contradistinction  with ot moral." They are  the  primordial
ment of human personality. man to chalk out his own life  in
is  rational and ry for the developrights which enable a  he
likes best.  Our Constitution, in addition to the well-known
fundamental   rights,  also  included  the  rights  of	 the
minorities, untouchables and other backward communities,  in
such rights.
</p><p id="p_139">After	having	 declared  the	 fundamental   rights,	 our
Constitution says that all laws in force in the territory of
India	immediately   before   the   commencement   of	 the
Constitution, insofar as they are inconsistent with the said
rights, are, to the extent of such inconsistency, void.	 The
Constitution  also  enjoins the State not to  make  any	 law
which  takes away or abridges the said rights  and  declares
such laws, to the extent of such inconsistency, to be  void.
As  we	have  stated earlier, the only	limitation  c)n	 the
freedom	 enshrined  in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_225">Art. 19</a> of the Constitution  is	that
imposed by a valid law rating as a reasonable restriction in
the interests of the public.
</p><p id="p_140">It  will,  therefore, be seen that  fundamental	 rights	 are
given	transcendental position under our  Constitution	 and
are  kept beyond the reach of Parliament.  At the same	time
Parts 1111 and V constituted an integrated scheme forming  a
self-contained code.	  The scheme is made so elastic that
all   the  Directive  '	 Principles  of	 State	Policy	 can
reasonably be enforced 'without taking
</p><p id="p_141">-up.  Cl/67-5
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">790</span>
away or abridging the fundamental rights.  While recognizing
the  immutability of fundamental rights, subject  to  social
control,   the	Constitutional	itself	provides   for	 the
suspension  or the modification of fundamental rights  under
specific  circumstances,  for  instance,  <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_226">Art.	33</a>  empowers
Parliament  to	modify the rights conferred by Part  III  in
their  application to the members of the armed forces,	<a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_227">Art.
34</a> enables it to impose restrictions on the rights conferred
by the said parts while martial law is in force in an  area,
<a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_228">Art. 35</a> confers the power on it to make laws with respect to
any of the matters which under clause (3) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_229">Art. 16</a>, Clause
(3) of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_230">Art. 32</a>,	    <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_231">Art. 33</a> and <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_232">Art. 34</a>			 may
be provided for by law.	 The non-obstante clause with  which
the	   last article opens makes  it clear that  all	 the
other  provisions  of the Constitution are subject  to	this
provision.   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_233">Article 32</a> makes the right to move the  Supreme
Court, by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the
rights conferred by the said Parts a guaranteed right.	Even
during	 grave	emergencies  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_234">Art.  358</a>	only  suspends	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_235">Art. 19;</a> and <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_236">Art. 359</a> enables the President by
order  to  declare  the	 right to move	any  court  for	 the
enforcement  of such of the rights conferred by Part III  as
may  be mentioned in that order to be suspended; that is  to
say,  even  during  emergency, only  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_237">Art.  19</a>  is  suspended
temporarily and all other rights are untouched except  those
specifically suspended by the President.
In the Book "Indian Constitution-Corerstone of a Nation"  by
Granville Austin, the scope origin and the object of  funda-
mental	rights	have been graphically stated.	Therein	 the
learned author says :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "........	 the core of the commitment  to	 the
	      social revolution lies in Parts III and IV, in
	      the  Fundamental Rights and fit the  Directive
	      Principles  of  State Policy.  These  are	 the
	      conscience of the Constitution."
	      Adverting	 to the necessity for  incorporating
	      fundamental  rights  in  a  Constitution,	 the
	      learned author says
	      That a declaration of rights had assumed	such
	      importance  was  not surprising; India  was  a
	      land  of communities, of	minorities,  racial,
	      religious, linguistic, social and caste.	 For
	      India  to become a state these minorities	 had
	      to agree to be governed both at the centre and
	      in  the  provinces by  fellow  Indian-members,
	      perhaps,	of  another minority-and  not  by  a
	      mediatory	 third power, the British.  On	both
	      psychological    and    political,    rounds.,
	      therefore-,  the	demand	for  written   right
	      rights  would  provide  tangible	 safeguards,
	      against oppression-proved overwhelming.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">791</span>
<p id="p_142">Motilal Nehru, who presided over the Committee called for by
the Madras Congress resolution, in May, 1928 observed in his
report :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "It  is obvious that our first care should  be
	      to have our Fundamental Rights guaranteed in a
	      manner which will not permit their  withdrawal
	      under  any circumstances ....  Another  reason
	      why great importance attached to a Declaration
	      of  Rights-  is the unfortunate  existence  of
	      communal differences in the country.   Certain
	      safeguards   are	necessary  to	create	 and
	      establish a sense of security among those	 who
	      look   upon  each	 other	with  distrust	 and
	      suspicion.   We could dot, better	 secure	 the
	      full  enjoyment  of  religious  and   communal
	      rights  to all communities than  by  including
	      them   among  the	 basic	principles  of	 the
	      Constitution."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on April 30, 1947  in
	      proposing	 for  the adoption  of	the  Interim
	      Report on Fundamental Rights, said thus :
	      "A  fundamental right should be  looked  upon,
	      not  from the point of view of any  particular
	      difficulty  of  the moment, but  as  something
	      that  you	 want  to  make	 permanent  in	 the
	      Constitution.   The  other  matter  should  be
	      looked upon-however important it might  be-not
	      from  this permanent and fundamental point  of
	      view,  but  from the more temporary  point  of
	      view."
</blockquote><p id="p_143">Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who was Prime Minister at that time
and. who must have had an effective voice in the framing  of
the Constitution, made this distinction between	 fundamental
rights and other provisions of the Constitution, namely, the
former	were  permanent and the latter were  amendable.	  On
September 18, 1949 Dr. Ambedkar in speaking on the amendment
proposed by Mr. Kamath to <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_238">Art. 304</a> of the Draft Constitution
corresponding	to  the	 present  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_239">Art.	368</a>,  namely,	"Any
provision  of this Constitution may be amended,	 whether  by
way of variation, addition or repeal, in the manner provided
in this article", said thus
	      "Now,  what  is  it  we do  ?  We	 divide	 the
	      articles	of  the	 Constitution  under   three
	      categories.   The	 first category is  the	 one
	      which   consists	of-articles  which  can	  be
	      amended by Parliament by a bare majority.	 The
	      second  set  of articles	are  articles  which
	      require  two-thirds majority.  If	 the  future
	      Parliament  wishes  to  amend  any  particular
	      article which is not mentioned in Part III  or
	      <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_240">article 304</a>, all that is necessary for them is
	      to  have two-thirds majority.  Then  they	 can
	      amend it."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">792</span>
<p id="p_144">Therefore,  in	Dr. Ambedkar's view the	 fundamental  rights
were  so  important that they could not be  amended  in	 the
manner provided by <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_241">Art. 304</a> of the Draft Constitution, which
corresponds to the present <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_242">Art. 368.</a>
</p><p id="p_145">We have referred to the speeches of Pandit Jawaharlal  Nehru
and Dr. Ambedkar not with a view to interpret the provisions
of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_243">Art. 368</a>, which we propose to do on its own	 terms,	 but
only  to  notice the transcendental character given  to	 the
fundamental rights by two of the important architects of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_146">This  Court also noticed the paramountcy of the	 fundamental
rights in many decisions.  In A. K. Gopalan v. State of Mad-
ras(1) they are described as "paramount', in <a href="/doc/149321/" id="a_244">State of Madras
v. Smt.	 Champakam Dorairajan</a>(2) as "sacrosanct", in  <a href="/doc/944601/" id="a_245">Pandit
M.  S.	M. Sharma v. Shri Sri Krishna  Sinha</a>(s)	 as  "rights
reserved  by  the people', in <a href="/doc/673012/" id="a_246">Smt.  Vijam Bai  v.  State  of
Uttar  Pradesh</a>(1)  as "inalienable  and	 inviolable",and  in
other  cases as "transcendental".  The	minorities  regarded
them  as  the bedrock of their political existence  and	 the
majority  considered  them as a guarantee for their  way  of
life.  This, however, does not mean that the problem is	 one
of  mere  dialectics.	The Constitution has  given  by	 its
scheme	a place of permanence to the  fundamental  freedoms.
In  giving to themselves the Constitution, the	people	have
reserved the fundamental freedoms to themselves.  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_247">Article 13</a>
merely	incorporates  that  reservation.   That	 Article  is
however	 not  the source of the	 protection  of	 fundamental
rights	 but  the  expression  of  the	 reservation.	 The
importance  attached  to  the  fundamental  freedoms  is  so
transcendental	that a bill enacted by a unanimous  vote  of
all  the members of both the Houses is ineffective to  dero-
gate  from  its	 guaranteed exercise.  It is  not  what	 the
Parliament  regards  at a given moment as conducive  to	 the
public benefit, but what Part III declares protected,  which
determines the ambit of the freedom.  The incapacity of	 the
Parliament  therefore in exercise of its amending  power  to
modify, restrict or impair fundamental freedoms in Part	 III
arises from the scheme of the Constitution and the nature of
the freedoms.
</p><p id="p_147">Briefly stated, the, Constitution declares certain rights as

control infringing the said power on Parliament and the them

require	 consent of the majority of the States,	 fundamental
rights can. be dropped without such consent.  While a single
fundamental  right cannot be abridged or taken away  by	 the
entire Parliament unanimously voting to that effect, a	two-
thirds'	 majority  can	do away	 with  all  the	 fundamental
rights.	 The entire super structure built with precision and
high  ideals  may  crumble  at	one  false  step.   Such   a
conclusion would attribute unreasonableness to the makers of
the Constitution, for, in that event they would be  speaking
in  two voices.	 Such an intention cannot be  attributed  to
the makers of the Constitution unless the provisions of	 the
Constitution compel us to do so.
</p><p id="p_154">With  this  background	let  us	 proceed  to  consider	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_248">Art.  368</a>,  vis-a-vis  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_249">Art.  13(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_155">The first question is whether amendment of the	Constitution
under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_250">Art. 368</a> is "law" within the meaning of	<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_251">Art.  13(2).</a>
The marginal note to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_252">Art. 368</a> describes that article as	 one
prescribing  the  procedure for amendment.  The	 article  in
terms only prescribes various procedural steps in the matter
of amendment: it shall be initiated by the introduction of a
bill  in either House of Parliament; it shall be  passed  by
the prescribed majority in both the Houses; it shall then be
presented  to  the President for his assent; and  upon	such
assent	the  Constitution shall stand amended.	The  article
assumes the power to amend found else and says that it shall
be  exercised in the manner laid down therein. The  argument
that  the completion of the procedural AM culminates in	 the
exercise  of the power to amend may be subtle but  does	 not
carry  conviction.   If	 that  was  the	 intention  of	 the
provisions, nothing prevented the makers of the Constitution
from  stating  that the Constitution may be amended  in	 the
manner suggested.  Indeed, whenever the Constitution  sought
to  confer  a  special power to amend on  any  authority  it
expressly said so : (See Arts. 4 and 392).  The	 alternative
contention that the said power shall be implied either	from
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_253">Art.  368</a>  or from the nature of the articles sought  to  be
amended	 cannot be accepted, for the simple reason that	 the
doctrine of necessary implication cannot be invoked if there
is  an express sion or unless but for such  implication	 the
article will no necessity to imply any plenary power to make
any Constitution subject to the
Uninfluenced  by  any foreign doctrines let us look  at	 the
provisions of our Constitution.	 Under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_254">Art. 245</a>, "subject to
the provisions of the Constitution, Parliament may make laws
for the whole or any part of the territory of  India........
<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_255">Article	 246</a>  demarcates  the matters in  respect  of  which
Parliament and State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">794</span>
Legislatures  may  make	 laws.	In the	field  reserved	 for
Parliament there is Entry 97 which empowers it to make	laws
in respect of " any other matter not enumerated in Lists  II
and  III including any tax not mentioned in either of  those
lists."	 <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_256">Article  248</a> expressly states that  Parliament	 has
exclusive  power to make any law with respect to any  matter
not  enumerated in the Concurrent List ,or State  List.	  It
is, therefore, clear that the residuary power of legislation
is vested in Parliament.  Subject to the argument based upon
the  alleged nature of the amending power as  understood  by
jurists	 in  other countries, which we shal  consider  at  a
later stage, it cannot be contended, and indeed, it was	 not
contended,  that  the Constituent Assembly, if	it  were  so
minded,	 could	not have conferred  an	express	 legislative
power  on Parliament to amend the Constitution	by  ordinary
legislative process.  Articles 4 and 169, and para 7 of	 the
5th Schedule and para 21 of the 6th Schedule have  expressly
conferred  such	 power.	 There is,  therefore,	no  inherent
Inconsistency  between legislative process and the  amending
one.  Whether  in  the	field of  a  constitutional  law  or
statutory  law amendment can be brought about only  by	law.
The  residuary power of Parliament, unles there is  anything
contrary in the ,Constitution, certainly takes in the  power
to  amend  the Constitution. It is said	 that  two  Articles
'indicate the contrary intention.  As <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_257">Art. 245</a>, the argument
proceeds, is subject to the provisions of the  Constitution,
every law of amendment will necessarily be inconsistent with
the articles sought to be amended.  'Ibis is an argument  in
a circle.  Can it be said reasonably that a law amending  an
article	 is  inconsistent with the article amended ?  If  an
article of the Constitution expressly says that it cannot be
amended,  a law cannot be made amending it, as the power  of
Parliament to make a law is subject to the said Article.  It
may-well be that in a given case such a limitation may	also
necessarily  be implied.  The limitation in <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_258">Art. 245</a>  is  in
respect of the power to make a law and not of the content of
the  law  made Within the scope of its	power.	 The  second
criticism  is based upon <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_259">Art. 39</a> of the Constitution.	That
provision   confers  power  on	the  President	 to   remove
difficulties;	in  the	 circumstances	mentioned  in	that
provision,  he	can by order direct  that  the	Constitution
shall  during such period as may be specified in that  order
have  effect subject to such adaptations, whether by way  of
modification,  addition ,or omission, as he may deem  to  be
necessary   or	 expedient.   The  argument  is	  that	 the
President's power, though confined to a	 temporqry period,is
co-extensive  with  legislative power and if  the  power  to
amend  is a legislative power it would have to be held	that
the  President can amend the Constitution in terms  of	Art.
</p><p id="p_156">368.   Apart  from the limited scope of <a href="/doc/1043584/" id="a_260">Art. 392</a>,  which  is
intended  only for the purpose of removing difficulties	 and
for bringing about a smooth transition, an order made by the
Presi-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">795</span>
<p id="p_157">dent cannot attract <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_261">Art. 368</a>, as the amendment	contemplated
by that provision can be initiated only by the	introduction
of a bill in the Parliament.  There is no force in either of
the two criticisms.
</p><p id="p_158"> Further,  there is, internal evidence in  the	Constitution
itself which indicates that amendment to the Constitution is
a "law" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_262">Art. 245.</a>	 Now, what is  "law"
under  the  Constitution  ? It is not  denied  that  in	 its
comprehensive  sense it includes constitutional law and	 the
law  amending the Constitution is constitutional  law.	 But
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_263">Art.  13(2)</a>  for  the  purpose	of  that  Article  gives  an
inclusive  definition.	It does not  exclude  Constitutional
law.-  It prima facie,takes in constitutional law.   <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_264">Article
368</a>  itself  gives the necessary clue to the  problem.	 The
amendment  can be initiated by. the introduction of a  bill;
it shall be passed by the two Houses; it shall' receive	 the
assent	of the President.  These are  well-known  procedural
steps  in the process of law-making : Indeed this  Court  in
Sankari	 Prasads  case(1)  brought out this  idea  in  clear
terms.. It said "in the first place, it is provided that the
amendment  must be initiated by the introduction of a  "bill
in  either  House  of  Parliament'  a  familiar	 feature  of
Parliament  procedure (of <a href="/doc/1181040/" id="a_265">Article 107(1)</a> which says "A	bill
may  originate in either House of Parliament").	 'Then,	 the
bill  must be "Passed in each House,"-just  what  Parliament
does  when  it	is  called  upon  to  exercise	its   normal
legisrative function <a href="/doc/846895/" id="a_266">Article 107(2)1;</a> and finally, the	bull
thus  passed  must be "president to the President"  for	 his
"assent", again a parliamentary process through which  every
bill  must  pass  before  it  can  reach  the  statute-book,
(<a href="/doc/158646/" id="a_267">Article  1 1 1</a> ). We thus- find that each of the  component
units of Parliament is to play its allotted part in bringing
about  an  amendment to the Constitution.  We  have  already
seen  that Parliament effects amendments of the first  class
mentioned  above  by  going  through  the  same	  three-fold
procedure  but	with  a simple majority.  The  fact  that  a
different  majority  in	 the  same  body  is  required	 for
effecting  the second and third- categories of 1  amendments
make the amending agency a different body."
In the same decision it is pointed out that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_268">Art. 368</a> is	 not
a  complete  code in respect of the procedure.	 This  Court
said  "There are gaps in the procedure as to how  and  after
what  notice  a bill is to be introduced, how it  is  to  be
passed by each House and how the President's assent is to be
obtained.   Having  provided  for  the	Constitution  of   a
Parliament  and	 prescribed  a	certain	 procedure  for	 the
conduct	  of  its  ordinary  legislative  business   to	  be
supplemented by rules made by each House (<a href="/doc/1670439/" id="a_269">Article 118</a>),	 the
makers	of the Constitution must be taken to  have  intended
Parliament  to follow that procedure, so far as they may  be
applicable  consistently with the express provision of	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_270">Art.
368</a>, when they have entrusted to it the power of =ending the
Con-

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">796</span>
<p id="p_160">stitution."  The  House of the People made  rules  providing
procedure  for amendments, the same as for other Bills	with
the addition of certain special provisions viz., Rules	155,
156, 157 and 158.  If amendment is intended to be  something
other  than law, the constitutional insistence on  the	said
legislative  process  is unnecessary.  In  short,  amendment
cannot	be made otherwise than by following the	 legislative
process.  The fact that there are other conditions, such as,
a  larger majority and in the case of articles mentioned  in
the proviso a ratification by Legislatures is provided, does
not make the amendment anytheless a law.  The imposition  of
further conditions is only a safeguard against hasty  action
or  a  protection  to the States, but does  not	 change	 the
Legislative character of the amendment.
</p><p id="p_161">This  conclusion is reinforced by the other articles of	 the
Constitution.	<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_271">Article 3</a> enables Parliament by law to	form
now  States  and  alter areas, boundaries or  the  names  of
existing  States.  imposed two, further conditions,  of	 the
President,  and (ii) in therein, the views expressed by	 the
Legislatures.  Notwithstanding the said conditions it cannot
be  suggested  that  the expression  "law"  under  the	said
Article	 is not one made by the Legislative process.   Under
<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_272">Art.  4</a>, such a law can contain provisions for amendment  of
Schedules  I and IV indicating thereby that  amendments	 are
only  made  by Legislative process.  What is more,  cl.	 (2)
thereof	 introduces a fiction to the affect that such a	 law
shall not be deemed to be an amendment to the  Constitution.
This  shows that the amendment is law and that but  for	 the
fiction it would be an amendment within the meaning of	Art.
</p><p id="p_162">368.   <a href="/doc/1295106/" id="a_273">Article	169</a>  which empowers  Parliament	 by  law  to
abolish or create Legislative Councils in States, para 7  of
the  5th  Schedule  and para 21 of the	6th  Schedule  which
enable	Parliament by law to amend the said Schedules,	also
bring  out the two ideas that the amendment is law  made  by
legislative process and that but for the fiction  introduced
it would attract <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_274">Article 368.</a>	   That	  apart	  amendments
under the said provisions can be made	by     the     Union
Parliament  by simple majority.	 That an amendment  is	made
only by legislative process with or without conditions	will
be  clear  if  two  decisions  of  the	Privy  Council	 are
considered  in	juxta-position.	 They are  McCawley  v.	 The
King(1)	 and  The  Bribery  Commissioner  v.  Pedrick	Rana
singhe(2).
</p><p id="p_163">The  facts  in McCawley v. The King(1) were these:  In	1859
Queensland  had been granted a Constitution in the terms  of
an Order in Council made on June 6 of that year under powers
derived	 by Her Majesty from the Imperial Statute, 18  &amp;  19
Vict.
</p><p id="p_164">(1) [1920] A.C. 691.
</p><p id="p_165">(2) [1964] W.L.R. 1301.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">797</span>
<p id="p_166">c.   54.  The Order in Council had set up a legislature	 for
the  territory,	 consisting  of	 the  Queen,  a	 Legislative
Council	 and  a. Legislative Assembly,	and  the  law-making
power  was vested in Her Majesty acting with the advice	 and
consent of the Council and Assembly.  Any laws could be made
for the "peace, welfare and good government of the  Colony".
The  said legislature of Queensland in the year 1867  passed
the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_275">Constitution Act</a> of that year.  Under that Act power was
given  to  the	said legislature to make  laws	for  "peace,
welfare	 and  good  Government of the Colony  in  all  cases
whatsoever".  But, under<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_276"> s. 9</a> thereof a two-thirds  majority
of  the	 Council  and of the Assembly  %,as  required  as  a
condition precedent to the validity of legislation  altering
the  constitution,of the Council.  The	Legislature,  there-
fore, had, except in the case covered by<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_277"> s. 9</a> of the Act, an
unrestricted  power to make laws.  The Legislature passed  a
law  which conflicted with one of the existing terms of	 the
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_278">Constitution Act</a>.  Lord Birkenhead, L.C., upheld-the law, as
the  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_279">Constitution Act</a> conferred an absolute power  upon	 the
legislature  to pass any law by majority even though it,  in
substance, amended the terms of the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_280">Constitution Act</a>.
In  The Bribery Commissioner v. Pedrick	 Ranasinghe(1),	 the
facts are these : By section 29 of the Ceylon (Constitution)
Order in Council, 1946, Parliament shall have power to	make
laws  for  the, "peace. order and good	government"  of	 the
Island	and  in	 the exercise of its power  under  the	said
section it may amend or repeal any of the provisions of	 the
Order in its application to the Island.	 The proviso to that
section says that no Bill for the amendment or repeal of any
of  the provisions of the Order shall be presented  for	 the
Royal  assent  unless it has endorsed on  it  a	 certificate
under the hand of the Speaker that the number of votes	cast
in  favour thereof in the House of Representatives  amounted
to  not less than two-thirds of the whole number of  members
of the House.  Under<a href="/doc/1164414/" id="a_281"> s. 55</a> of the said Order the appointment
of Judicial Officers was vested in the Judicial Service Com-
mission.   But	the Parliament under s. 41  of	the  Bribery
Amendment  Act,	 1958, provided for the appointment  of	 the
personnel  of the Bribery Tribunals by the  Governor-General
on  the	 advice	 of  the  Minister  of	Justice.   The	said
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_282">Amendment  Act</a>	was in conflict with the said<a href="/doc/1280060/" id="a_283"> s. 55</a>  of	 the
Order and it was passed without complying with the terms  of
the  proviso to<a href="/doc/1280060/" id="a_284"> s. 29</a> of the Order.  The Privy Council	held
that  the  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_285">Amendment  Act</a>  was	void.	Lord  Pearce,  after
considering   McCawley's   case(2)   made   the	   following
observations, at p. 1310 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      "........	 a  legislature	 has  no  power	  to
	      ignore, the conditions of law-making that	 are

	      legislature   of	 Ceylon,  or   whether	 the
	      Constitution  is "uncontrolled", as the  Board

</blockquote><p id="p_167">It will be seen from the said judgments that an amendment of
the  Constitution is made only by legislative  process	with
ordinary majority or with special majority, as the case	 may
be.   There.fore, amendments either under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_286">Art. 368</a> or  under
other Articles ,axe made only by Parliament by following the
legislative process adopted by it ' n making other law,.  In
the  premises,	an  amendment "Of the  Constitution  can  be
nothing but "law".
</p><p id="p_168">A comparative study of other Constitutions indicates that no
particular pattern is followed.	 AR the Constitutions confer
an  ,express  power  to	 amend, most  of  them	provide	 for
legislative  procedure	with special  majority,	 referendum,
convention,  etc., and a few with simple majority.   Indeed,
Parliament  of England, which is a supreme body,  can  amend
the  constitution like any other :statute.  As none  of	 the
Constitutions  contains provisions similar to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_287">Art.  368</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_288">Art. 13(2</a>), neither the said Constitutions nor the decisions
given  by  courts  thereon would be  of	 any  assistance  in
construing the scope of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_289">Art. 368</a> of our Constitution.
A brief survey of the nature of the amending process adopted
by various constitutions will bring out the futility of	 any
attempt	 to  draw  inspiration from  the  said	opinions  or
decisions  on  the said constitutions.	The  nature  of	 the
amending power in different constitutions generally  depends
on  the	 nature of the polity created by  the  constitution,
namely, whether it is federal or unitary constitution or  on
the   fact  whether  it	 is  a	written	 or   an   unwritten
constitution  or on the circumstances whether it is a  rigid
or a flexible constitution.  Particularly the difference can
be traced to the "spirit and genius of the nation in which a
particular  constitution  has  its  birth".   The  following
articles of the 'Constitution of the different countries are
brought	 to our notice by one or other of the  counsel	that
appeared  before  us.	<a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_290">Art. 5</a> of the  Constitution  of	 the

</p><p id="p_169">Broadly speaking amendments can be made by four methods (i)  by
ordinary  legislative process with or without  restrictions,
</p><p id="p_170">(ii) by the people through, referendum, (iii) by majority of
all  the   units of a federal State; and (iv) by  a  special
convention.  The first method can be in four different ways,
namely,	 (i)  by  the  ordinary	 course	 of  legislation  by
absolute majority or by special majority, (See <a href="/doc/504161/" id="a_300">Section 92</a> (1
)-  of the British North America Act, sub-section 152  South
African	 Apt, where under except <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_301">sections 35</a>, <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_302">137</a>  and	<a href="/doc/1471143/" id="a_303">152</a>,
other  provisions could be amended by  ordinary	 legislative
process	 by absolute majority.	Many  constitutions  provide
for special majorities.); (ii) by a fixed quorum of  members
for  the  consideration	 of the	 proposed  amendment  and  a
special	  majority  for	 its  passage;	(see   the   defunct
Constitution  of Rumania), (iii) by dissolution and  general
election  on a particular issue; (see the  Constitutions  of
Belgium,  Holland,  Denmark  and  Norway),  and	 (iv)  by  a
majority of two Houses of Parliament in joint session as  in
the  Constitution  of the South Africa.	 The  second  method
demands	 a  popular vote, referendum , or plebiscite  as  in
Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, Italy, France and  Denmark.
The third method is by an agreement in some form or other of
either of the majority or of all the federating units as  in
Switzerland,  Australia	 and the United States	of  America.
The fourth method is generally by creation of a special body
ad hoc for the purpose of constitution revision as in  Latin
America.    Lastly,   some  constitutions   impose   express
limitation on the power to amend. (See <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_304">Art. 5</a> of the  United
States	Constitution  and  the Constitution  of	 the  Fourth
French Republic).  A more elaborate discussion of this topic
may  be	 found	in the American	 political  Constitution  by
Strong.	 It will, therefore, be seen that the power to amend
and  the procedure to amend radically-differ from  State  to
State;	it is left to the constitution-makers  to  prescribe
the  scope of the power and the method of  amendment  having
regard	to the requirements of the particular State.   There
is  no	article in any of the constitutions referred  to  us
similar to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_305">article 13(2)</a> of our Constitution.  India adopted
a  different system altogether: it empowered the  Parliament
to amend the Constitution by the legislative process subject
to  fundamental rights.	 The Indian 1 Constitution has	made
the amending process comparatively flexible, but it is	made
subject to fundamental rights.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">800</span>
<p id="p_171">Now let us consider the argument that the power to amend  is
a  sovereign  power, that the said power is supreme  to	 the
legislative  power,  that  it does not	permit	any  implied
limitations  and  that amendments made in exercise  of	that
power involve political questions and that, therefore,	they
are outside judicial review, This wide proposition is sought
to  be	supported on the basis of opinions  of	jurists	 and
judicial decisions.  Long extracts have been read to us from
the  book "The Amending of the Federal Constitution  (1942)"
by  Lester Bernhardt Orfield, and particular  reference	 was
made to the following passages :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	      "At the point it may be well to note that when
	      the  Congress  is	 engaged  in  the   amending
	      process	it  is	not  legislating.    It	  is
	      exercising  a peculiar power bestowed upon  it
	      by  Article Five.	 This Article for  the	most
	      part   ,controls	 the  process;	 and   other
	      provisions of the Constitution, such as  those
	      relating to the passage of legislation, having
	      but little bearing."
</blockquote><p id="p_172">Adverting to the Bill of Rights, the learned author  remarks
that  they may be repealed just as any other  amendment	 and
that  they are no more sacred from a legal  standpoint	than
any  other  part  of the  Constitution.	  Dealing  with	 the
doctrine of implied limitations, he says that it is  clearly
untenable.   Posing the question 'Is other a law  about	 the
amending power of the Constitution ?", he answers, "there is
none".	 He would even go to the extent of saying  that	 the
sovereignty,  if it can be said to exist at all, is  located
in  the	 amending body.	 The author is	certainly  a  strong
advocate  of  the  supremacy of the amending  power  and  an
opponent  of  the  doctrine  of	 implied  limitations.	 His
opinion	  is  based  upon  the	terms  of  <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_306">Art.	 5</a>  of	 the
Constitution  of  the  United  States  of  America  and	 his
interpretation	of  the decisions of the  Supreme  Court  of
America.  Even such an extreme exponent of the doctrine does
not  say  that a particular  constitution  cannot  expressly
impore	restrictions on the power to amend or that  a  court
cannot	 reconcile   the  articles  couched   in   unlimited
phraseology.   Indeed  <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_307">Art. 5</a> of the  American	Constitution
imposes	 express  limitations on the amending  power.	Some
passages from the book "Political Science and Government" by
James Wilford Garner are cited.	 Garner points out :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	      "An unamendable constitution, said Mulford, is
	      the  &amp;&amp;worst  tyranny of time, or	 rather	 the
	      very tyranny of time"</blockquote>
<p id="p_173">	      But he also notices
	      "The provision for amendment should be neither
	      so rigid as to make needed changes practically
	      impossible  nor  so flexible as  to  encourage
	      frequent and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">			    801</span>
unnecessary changes  and thereby lower the authority of	 the
Constitution."
</p><p id="p_174">Munro in his book "The Government of the United States", 5th
Edition, uses strong words when he says
	      ".......	it is impossible to conceive  of  an
	      unamendable  constitution	 as anything  but  a
	      contradiction in terms."
</p><p id="p_175">The  learned  author  says that such  a	 constitution  would
constitute  "government	 by the	 graveyards."  Hugh  Evander
Wills in his book "Constitutional Law of the United  States"
avers that the doctrine of amendability of the	Constitution
is grounded in the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people
and  that  it  has no such implied limitations	as  that  an
amendment  shall not contain a new grant of power or  change
the dual form of government or change the protection of	 the
Bill   of   Rights,  or	 make  any  other  change   in	 the
Constitution.	Herman	Finer in his book  "The	 Theory	 and
Practice of Modem Government" defines "constitution" as	 its
process	 of  amendment,	 for, in his view, to  amend  is  to
deconstitute and reconstitute.	The learned author concludes
that the amending clause is so fundamental to a constitution
that he is tempted to call it the constitution itself.	 But
the  learned author recognizes that difficulty in  amendment
certainly  products circumstances and makes  impossible	 the
surreptitious	abrogation  of	rights	guaranteed  in	 the
constitution.	William	 S. Livingston	in  "Federalism	 and
Constitutional Change" says :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	      "The  formal  procedure  of  amendment  is  of
	      greater	 importance   than   the    informal
	      processes,  because  it constitutes  a  higher
	      authority to which appeal lies on any question
	      that may arise."
</blockquote><p id="p_176">But  there  are	 equally  eminent  authors  who	 express   a
different  view.  In "American Jurisprudence", 2nd  Edition,
Vol.  16,  it is stated that a statute	and  a	constitution
though of unequal dignity are both laws.  Another calls	 the
constitution  of  a State as one of the laws of	 the  State.
Cooley	in  his	 book on "Constitutional  Law"	opines	that
changes	 in  the  fundamental  laws of	the  State  must  be
indicated  by  the people themselves.	He  further  implies
limitations  to	 the amending power from the belief  in	 the
constitution  itself,  such  as,  the  republican  form	  of
Government cannot be abolished as it would be  revolutionary
in ifs characters.  In the same book it is further said that
the  power to amend the constitution by	 legislative  action
does  not  confer  the power to break it any  more  than  it
confers the power to legislate on any other subject contrary
to  the	 prohibitions.	 C. F. Strong  in  his	book  "Modem
Poliical  Constitutions", 1963 edition, does not accept	 the
theory	of absolute sovereignty of the amending power  which
does not brook any limitations, for he says.

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">	      "In  short,  it attempts to  arrange  for	 the
	      recreation of a constituent assembly  whenever
	      such  matters are in future to be	 considered,
	      even though that assembly be nothing more than
	      the ordinary legislature acting under  certain
	      restrictions.  At the same time, there may  be
	      some  elements of the constitution  which	 the
	      constituent    assembly	wants	to    remain
	      unalterable  by  the action of  any  authority
	      whatsoever.    These   elements  are   to	  be
	      distinguished  from  the rest,  and  generally
	      come  under  the heading of  fundamental	law.
	      Thus, for example, the American  Constitution,
	      the  oldest  of  the  existing  Constitutions,
	      asserts that by no process of amendment  shall
	      any   State,  without  its  own  consent,	  be
	      deprived of its equal suffrage in the  Senate,
	      , while among the Constitutions more  recently
	      promulgated, those of the Republics of; France
	      and  Italy, each containing a  clause  stating
	      that the republican form of government  cannot
	      be the subject of an amending proposals"

A catena of American decisions have been cited before us  in
support	 of  the  contention that the unending	power  is  a
supreme power or that it involves political issues which are
not  justiciable.  It would be futile to consider  them.  at
length, for after going through them carefully we find	that
there  are no considered judgments of the  American  Courts,
which would have a persuasive effect in that regard.  In the
Constitution  of the United States of America,	prepared  by
Edwards S. Corwin, Legislative Reference Service, Library of
Congress,  (1953  edn.),  the following	 summary  under	 the
heading "Judicial Review under Article V" is given :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      "Prior  to 1939, the Supreme Court  had  taken
	      cognizance  of a number of diverse  objections
	      to the validity of specific amendments.  Apart
	      from   holding   that   official	 notice	  of
	      ratification  by the several States  was	con-
	      clusive upon the Courts, it had treated  these
	      questions	 as  justiciable,  although  it	 had
	      uniformly	 rejected  them on the	merits.	  In
	      that  year,  however, the	 whole	subject	 was
	      thrown  into  confusion  by  the	inconclusive
	      decision in Coleman v. Miller.  This case came
	      up  on  a writ of certiorari  to	the  Supreme
	      Court of Kansas to review the denial of a writ
	      of  mandamus  to compel the Secretary  of	 the
	      Kansas  Senate  to erase an endorsement  on  a
	      resolution ratifying the		child
	      labour  amendment to the Constitution  to	 re-
	      effect that it had been adopted by the  Kansas
	      Senate.  The attempted ratification was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">	      803</span>
	      assailed	on  three  grounds :  (1)  that	 the
	      amendment had been previously rejected by	 the
	      State  Legislature; (2) that it was no  longer
	      open  to ratification because an	unreasonable
	      period  of  time thirteen years,	had  elapsed
	      since  its submission to the States,  and	 (3)
	      that  the lieutenant governor had no right  to
	      cast the deciding vote in the Senate in favour
	      of  ratification.	 Four opinions were  written
	      in   the	Supreme	 Court,	 no  one  of   which
	      commanded	 the support of more than four	mem-
	      bers  of the Court.  The majority	 ruled	that
	      the  plain-tiffs, members of the Kansas  State
	      Senate,  had  a  sufficient  interest  in	 the
	      controversy   to	give  the   federal   courts
	      jurisdiction  to	review	the  case.   Without
	      agreement	  as  to  the  grounds	 for   their
	      decision,	 a different majority  affirmed	 the
	      judgment	of  the	 Kansas	 court	denying	 the
	      relief sought.  Four members who concur-red in
	      the  result had voted to dismiss the  writ  on
	      the  ground  that	 the  amending	process	 "is
	      political"  in its. entirety, from  submission
	      until   an  amendment  becomes  part  of	 the
	      Constitution,  and is not subject to  judicial
	      guidance,	 control  or  interference  at	 any
	      point."	whether	 the  contention  that	 the
	      lieutenant governor should have been permitted
	      to  cast	the  deciding  vote  in	 favour	  of
	      ratification    presented	   a	 justiciable
	      controversy  was	left  undecided,  the  court
	      being  equally  divided on the point.   In  an
	      opinion  reported	 as  "the  opinion  of	 the
	      Court"'  but  in which it	 appears  that	only
	      three Justices concurred, Chief Justice Hughes
	      declared	that  the  writ	 of'  mandamus	 was
	      properly denied because the question as to the
	      effect  of  the  previous	 rejection  of	 the
	      amendment	 and the lapse of time since it	 was
	      submitted	  to  the  States   were   political
	      questions	 which should be left  to  Congress.
	      On  the same day, the Court dismissed a.	writ
	      of  certiorari  to review a decision  'of	 the
	      Kentucky Court of Appeals declaring the action
	      of the Kentucky General Assembly purporting to
	      ratifying	 the child labour amendment  illegal
	      and  void.   Inasmuch  as	 the  governor	 had
	      forwarded the certified copy of the resolution
	      to the Secretary of State before being  served
	      with a copy of the restraining order issued by
	      the State Court, the Supreme Court found	that
	      there 'was no longer a controversy susceptible
	      of judicial determination."
</blockquote><p id="p_178">This passage, in our view, correctly summarises the American
law  on the subject.  It will be clear therefrom that  prior
to  1939  the  Supreme	Court of  America  had	treated	 the
objections  to	the  validity  of  specific  amendments	  as
justiciable  and  that only in 1939 it rejected them  in  an
inconclusive judgment without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">804</span>
discussion.   In  this state of affairs we  cannot  usefully
draw  much  from the judicial wisdom of the  Judges  of	 the
Supreme Court of America.
</p><p id="p_179">One  need not cavil at the description of an amending  power
as  sovereign  power, for it is sovereign  only	 within	 the
scope  of the power conferred by a particular  constitution.
All  the authors also agree, that a particular	constitution
can expressly limit the power of amendment, both substantive
and  procedural.   The only conflict lies in the  fact	that
some  authors  do not pen-nit implied limitations  when	 the
power  of  amendment  is expressed in  general	words.	 But
others	countenance  such  limitations	by  construction  or
otherwise.   But none of the authors goes to the  extent  of
saying, which is the problem before us, that when there	 are
conflicting articles couched in widest terms, the court	 has
no jurisdiction to construe and harmonize them.	 If some  of
the  authors meant to say that-in our view, they did  not-we
cannot agree with them, for, in that event this Court  would
not be discharging its duty.
</p><p id="p_180">Nor  can we appreciate the arguments repeated before  us  by
learned	 counsel  for  the  respondents	 that  the  amending
process involves political questions which are, outside	 the
scope  of judicial review.  When a matter comes	 before	 the
Court,	its jurisdiction does not depend upon the nature  of
the  question raised but on die, question whether  the	said
matter	is expressly or by necesssary  implication  excluded
from  its  jurisdiction.  Secondly, it is  not	possible  to
define	what is a political question and what is  not.	 The
character  of a question depends upon the circumstances	 and
the  nature of a political society.  To put if	differently,
the  court does not decide any political question at all  in
the ordinary sense of the. term, but only ascertains whether
Parliament is acting within the scope of the amending power.
It  may be that Parliament seeks to amend  the	Constitution
for  political reasons, but the Court in denying that  power
will  not be deciding on political questions, but will	only
be holding that Parliament has no power to amend  particular
articles of the Constitution for any purpose whatsoever,  be
it  political or otherwise.  We, therefore, hold that  there
is nothing in the nature of the amending power which enables
Parliament  to	override all the express  or  implied  limi-
tations	 imposed  on  that power.  As we  have	pointed	 out
earlier,   our	Constitution adopted a novel method  in	 the
sense  that  Parliament makes the amendment  by	 legislative
process	  subject  to  certain	restrictions  and,that	 the
amendment so made being law" is.subject to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_308">Art. 13(2).</a>
The  next argument is based upon the expression	 "amendment"
in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_309">Art. 368</a> of the Constitution and if is contended that the
said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">805</span>
expression  has-.a Positive and a negative content and	that
in exercise of the power amendment parliament cannot destroy
the  structure of the Constitution, but it can	only  modify
the provisions thereof within the framework of the  original
instrument for its better effectuation.	 If the fundamentals
would be amenable to the ordinary process of amendment	with
a special majority, the argument proceeds, the	institutions
of  the	 President  can	 be  abolished,	 the   parliamentary
executive  can	be removed, the fundamental  rights  can  be
abrogated, the concept of federalism' can be obliterated and
in short the sovereign democratic republic can be  converted
into   a  totalitarian	system	of  government.	  There	  is
considerable  force in this argument.  Learned	and  lengthy
arguments  are advanced to sustain it or to reject it.	 But
we  are relieved of the necessity to express our opinion  on
this  all important question as, so far as  the	 fundamental
rights	are concerned, the question  raised can be  answered
on   a	 narrower  basis.  This	 question  may	 arise	 for
consideration  only  if	 Parliament  seeks  to	destroy	 the
structure  of  the Constitution embodied in  the  provisions
other  than  in Part III of the Constitution.	We  do	not,
therefore, propose to express our opinion in that regard.
In  the view we have taken on the scope of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_310">Art.	 368</a>  vis--a
vis  the  fundamental  rights, it  is  also  unnecessary  to
express our opinion on the question whether the amendment of
the  fundamental  rights is covered by the proviso  to	Art.
</p><p id="p_181">368.
The result is that the Constitution (Seventeenth  Amendment)
Act, 1964, inasmuch as it takes away or abridges the  funda-
mental rights is void under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_311">Art. 13(2)</a> of the Constitution.
The  next question is whether our decision should  be  given
retrospective operation.     During the period between	1950
and 1967 i.e 17 years as many as 20 amendments were made in
our  Constitution.   But  in  the  context  of	the  present
petitions  it  would be enough if we notice  the  amendments
affecting  fundamental right to property.  The	Constitution
came into force on January 26, 1950. The Constitution (First
Amendment) Act, 1951, amended Arts. 15 and 19, and Arts. 31-
A  and	31-B were inserted with retrospective  effect.	 The
object	of  the	 amendment was said to be  to  validate	 the
acquisition  of	 zamindaries or the abolition  of  permanent
settlement  without interference from courts.  The  occasion
for  the  amendment  was that the High	Court  of  Patna  in
Kameshwar  Singh  v, State of Bihar(1) held that  the  Bihar
Land  Reforms Act (30 of 1950) passed by the State of  Bihar
was unconstitutional, while the High Courts of Allahabad and
Nagpur upheld the validity of corresponding legislations  in
Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh respectively.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">806</span>
The amendment was made when the appeals from those decisions
were  pending  in the Supreme Court.   In  Sankari  Prasad's
case(1)	 the  constitutionality of the	said  amendment	 was
questioned but the amendment was upheld.  It may be  noticed
that  the  said amendment was not made on the basis  of	 the
power  to amend fundamental rights recognized by this  Court
but only in view of the conflicting decisions of High Courts
and without waiting for the final decision from this  Court.
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_312">article	 31-A</a> was again amended by the Constitution  (Fourth
Amendment) Act, 1955.  Under that amendment cl. (2) of	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_313">Art.
31</a> was amended and cl. (2-A) was inserted therein.  While in
the  original  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_314">article	31-A</a>  the  general  expression	"any
provisions  of his Part" was found, in the  amended  article
the scope was restricted only.to the violation of Arts.	 14,
19 and 31 and 4 other clauses were included, namely, clauses
providing for (a) taking over the management of any property
by  the State for a limited-period; (b) amalgamation of	 two
or more corporations; (c) extinguishment or modification  of
rights	of  person;  interested	 in  corporations;  and	 (d)
extinguishment or modification of rights accruing under	 any
agreement,  lease or licence relating to minerals,  and	 the
definition of "estate" was enlarged in order to include	 the
interests  of  raiyats	and  under-raiyats.   The  expressed
object	of the amendment was to carry out  important  social
welfare	 legislations on the desired lines, to	improve	 the
national   economy  of	the  State  and	 to  avoid   serious
difficulties  raised by courts in that regard.	<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_315">Article	 31A</a>
has  further  been  amended  by	 the  Constitution   (Fourth
Amendment)  Act, 1955.	By the said amendment in  the  Ninth
Schedule  to the Constitution entries 14 to 20	were  added.
The main objects of this amending Act was to distinguish the
power of compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of private
property  and the deprivation of property and to extend	 the
scope  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_316">Art. 31-A</a> to cover different categories of  social
welfare legislations and to enable monopolies in  particular
trade  or  business to be created in favour  of	 the  State.
Amended	 <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_317">Art.  31(2)</a>makes the adequacy of  compensation	 not
justiciable.   It may be said-that the Constitution  (Fourth
Amendment)  Act, 1955 was made by Parliament as	 this  Court
recognized the power of Parliament to amend Part III of	 the
Constitution;  but  it can' also be said with  some  plausi-
bility	that,  as Parliament had exercised  the	 power	even
before	the.  decision	of this Court  in  Sankari  Prasad's
case(1), it would have amended the Constitution even if	 the
said decision was not given by this Court.  The	 Seventeenth
Amendment  Act was made on June 20, 1964.  The occasion	 for
this  amendment was the decision of this Court	in  <a href="/doc/9285/" id="a_318">Karimbil
Kunhikoman  v.	State of Kerala</a>(2), which  struck  down	 the
Kerala	Agrarian  Relations  Act  IV  of  1961	relating  to
ryotwari lands.	 Under that amendment the definition of	 the
expression "estate" was enlarged so as to take
(1) [1952] S.C.R. 89, 105
(2) [1962] Supp.  1 S.C.R. 829
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">807</span>
in  any land held under ryotwari settlement and any held  or
let  for purposes of agriculture or for	 purposes  ancillary
thereto, including waste land, forest land, land for pasture
or  sites  of  buildings and other  structures	occupied  by
cultivators  of	 land, agricultural  labourers	and  village
artisans.   In	the Ninth Schedule  the	 amendment  included
items  21 to 65.  In the objects and reasons it	 was  stated
that  the definition"'estate" was not wide enough, that	 the
courts	had  struck  down many land reform  Acts  and  that,
therefore,  in order to give them protection  the  amendment
was made.  The validity of the Seventeenth Amendment Act was
questioned in this Court and was held to be valid in  Sajian
Singh's case(1).  From the history of these amendments,	 two
things	appear, namely, unconstitutional laws were made	 and
they were protected by the amendment of the Constitution  or
the amendments were made in order to protect the future laws
which  would be void but for the amendments.  But  the	fact
remains	 that  this  Court held as early  as  in  1951	that
Parliament  had power to amend the fundamental	rights.	  It
may,   therefore,   said  that	the   Constitution   (Fourth
Amendment)  Act,  1955, and  the  Constitution	(Seventeenth
Amendment) Act, 1964, were based upon the scope of the power
to  end recognized by this Court.  Further  the	 Seventeenth
Amendment Act was also approved by this Court.
Between	 1950  and 1967 the Legislatures of  various  States
made  laws  bringing  about an agrarian	 revolution  in	 our
country	 zamindaries, inams and other  intermediary  estates
were  abolished,  vested  rights were  created	in  tenants,
consolidation  of  holdings of villages was  made,  ceilings
were  fixed  and the surplus lands transferred	to  tenants.
All these were done on the, basis of the correctness of	 the
decisions  in  Sankari Prasads case(2)	and  Sajjan  Singh's
case(1), namely, that Parliament had the power to amend	 the
fundamental  rights and that Acts in regard to estates	were
outside	 judicial scrutiny on the ground they infringed	 the
said rights.  The agrarian structure of our country has been
revolutionised on the basis of the said laws.  Should we now
give  retrospectivity  to our decision, it  would  introduce
chaos and unsettle the conditions in our country.  Should we
hold  that because of the said consequences  Parliament	 had
power  to  take away fundamental rights, a time	 might	come
when  we  would	 gradually and imperceptibly  pass  under  a
totalitarian  rate.  Learned counsel for the petitioners  as
well as those for the respondents placed us on the horns  of
this  dilemma, for they have taken extreme  positions-leamed
counsel	 for  the petitioners want us to reach	the  logical
position by holding that all the said laws are void and	 the
learned counsel for the respondents persuade us to hold that
Parliament has unlimited power and, if it chooses, it can do
away with fundamental rights.  We do not think that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">808</span>
this Court is so helpless.  As the highest Court in the land
we  must  evolve  some reasonable  principle  to  meet	this
extraordinary situation.  There is an essential	 distinction
between Constitution and statutes.  Comparatively  speaking,
Constitution  is  permanent; it is an  organic	statute;  it
grows  by  its	own  inherent  force.	The   constitutional
concepts are couched in elastic terms.	Courts are  expected
to  and	 indeed should interpret, its  terms  without  doing
violence to the language, to suit the expanding needs of the
society.   In  this process and in a real  sense  they	make
laws.	Though	it is not admitted, the said  role  of	this
Court is effective and cannot be ignored.  Even in the realm
of  ordinary statutes, the subtle working of the process  is
apparent  though  the  approach	 is  more  conservative	 and
inhibitive.--In the constitutional field, therefore, to meet
the  present extraordinary situation that may be  caused  by
our  decision, we must evolve some doctrine which has  roots
in  reason and precedents so that the past may be  preserved
and the future protected.
</p><p id="p_184">There are two doctrines familiar to American  Jurisprudence,
one  is	 described as Blackstonian theory and the  other  as
"prospective over-ruling", which may have some relevance  to
the  present  enquiry.	Blackstone in his  Commentaries,  69
(15th  edn., 1809) stated the common law rule that the	duty
of  the	 Court	was  "not to pronounce a  new  rule  but  to
maintain and expound .the old one".  It means the Judge does
not make law but only discovers or finds the true law.	 The
law  has  always been the same.	 If  a	subsequent  decision
changes	 the earlier one, the latter decision does not	make
law  but only discovers the correct principle of  law.	 The
result of this view is that it is necessarily  retrospective
,operation.   But Jurists, George F. Canfield,	Robert	Hill
Freeman, John Henry Wigmore and Cardozo, have expounded	 the
doctrine of "prospective over-ruling" and suggested it as "a
useful	judicial .tool".  In the words of Canfield the	said
expression means
	      "......a court should recognize a duty to	 an-
	      nounce  a	 new  and  better  rule	 for  future
	      transactions  whenever the court	has  reached
	      the   conviction	 that  an   old	  rule	 (as
	      established by the precedents) is unsound even
	      though  feeling compelled by stare decisis  to
	      apply  the  old  and  condemned  rule  to	 the
	      instant  case  and to transactions  which	 had
	      already taken place."
</p><p id="p_185">Cardozo,  before he became a Judge of the Supreme  Court  of
the United States of America, when he was the Chief  Justice
of New York State addressing the Bar Association said thus
	      The  rule (the Blackstonian rule) that we	 are
	      asked  to apply is out of tune with  the	life
	      about us.	 It has been made discordant by	 the
	      forces that generate a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">				   809</span>
	      living law.  We apply it to this case  because
	      the  repeal might work hardship to  those	 who
	      have trusted to its existence.  We give notice
	      however that any one trusting to it  hereafter
	      will do at his peril."
</p><p id="p_186">The  Supreme Court of the United States of America,  in	 the
year 1932, after Cardozo became an Associate Justice of that
Court  in  Great  Northern Railway v. Sunburst	Oil  &amp;	Ref.
Co.,(1) applied the said doctrine to the facts of that case.
In  that case the Montana Court had adhered to its  previous
construction  of the statute in question but  had  announced
that  that  interpretation  would not  be  followed  in	 the
future.	  It was contended before the Supreme Court  of	 the
United	States of America that a decision of a	court  over-
ruling	 earlier   decision  and  not  giving	its   ruling
retroactive operation violated the due process clause of the
14th Amendment.	 Rejecting that plea, Cardozo said :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	      "This   is  not  a  case	where  a  Court	  in
	      overruling an earlier decision has come to the
	      new ruling of retroactive dealing and  thereby
	      has  made	 invalid what was  followed  in	 the
	      doing.   Even  that may often be	done  though
	      litigants not infrequently have argued to	 the
	      contrary .... This is a case where a Court has
	      refused  to make its ruling  retroactive,	 and
	      the novel stand is taken that the Constitution
	      of  the  United  States is  infringed  by	 the
	      refusal.	  We   think   that   the    Federal
	      Constitution has no voice upon the subject.  A
	      state in defining the elements of adherence to
	      precedent may make a choice for itself between
	      the principle of forward operation and that of
	      relation	backward.   It may be  so  that	 the
	      decision	of the highest courts, though  later
	      over-ruled,    was   law	  nonetheless	 for
	      intermediate  transactions .... On  the  other
	      hand,  it may hold to the ancient	 dogma	that
	      the law declared by its Courts had a  platonic
	      or ideal existence before the act of  declara-
	      tion,   in   which  event,   the	 discredited
	      declaration will be viewed as if it had  never
	      been and to reconsider declaration as law from
	      the  beginning... . The choice for  any  state
	      maybe determined by the juristic philosophy of
	      the Judges of her Courts, their considerations
	      of law, its origin and nature."
</blockquote><p id="p_187">The  opinion of Cardozo tried to harmonize the	doctrine  of
prospective over-ruling with that of stare decisis.
In 1940, Hughes, C.J., in Chicot County Drainage District v.
Baxter State Bank(2) stated thus

	      a new judicial declaration."
</blockquote><p id="p_189">In  Griffin  v.	 Illionis(1) the Supreme  Court	 of  America
reaffirmed  the doctrine laid down in Sunburst's  case	(2).
There,	a  statute required defendants to  Submit  bills  of
exceptions   as	 a  pre-requisite  to  an  appeal   from   a
conviction;  the  Act was held unconstitutional in  that  it
provided no means whereby indigent defendants could secure a
copy  of the record for this purpose.  Frankfurter,  J.,  in
that context observed
	      "......  in arriving at a new  principle,	 the
	      judicial	process is not important to,  define
	      its  scope and limits.  Adjudication is not  a
	      mechanical   exercise  nor  does	 it   compel

</p><p id="p_190">In Wolf v. Colorado(3) a majority of the Supreme Court	held
that  in a prosecution in a State Court for a  state  crime,
the 14th Amendment did not forbid the admission of  evidence
obtained  by  an unreasonable search and  seizure.   But  in
Mapp.  v. Ohio(4) the Supreme Court reversed  that  decision
and held that all evidence obtained by searches and  seizure
in   violation	 of  the  4th  Amendment  of   the   Federal
Constitution was, by virtue of the due process clause of the
14th  Amendment guaranteeing the right to privacy free	from
unreasonable  State  instrusion,  inadmissible	in  a  State
court.	 In  Linkletter	 v.  Walker(5)	the  question  arose
whether	 the  exclusion of the rule enunciated	in  Mapp  v.
Ohio(4)	 did not apply to State Court convictions which	 had
become final before the date of that judgment.	Mr.  Justice
Clarke, speaking for the majority observed
	      "We  believe  that the existence of  the	Wolf
	      doctrine prior to Mapp is 'an operative'	fact

</p><p id="p_199">This  case  has	 reaffirmed  the  doctrine  of	 prospective
overruling and has taken a pragmatic approach in refusing to
give it retroactivity.	In short, in America the doctrine of
prospective  overruling is now accepted in all	branches  of
law,  including constitutional law.  But the carving of	 the
limits of retrospectivity of the new rule is left to  courts
to  be done, having regard to the requirements	of  justice.
Even  in England the Blackstonian theory was  criticized  by
Bentham and Austin.  In Austin's Jurisprudence, 4th Ed.,  at
page 65, the learned author says :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	      "What  hindered Blackstone was  'the  childish
	      fiction'	employed  by our  judges,  that	 the
	      judiciary or common law is not 'Made by  them,
	      but-  is	a  miraculous  something  made,	  by
	      nobody,  existing, I suppose,  from  eternity,
	      and  merely declared from time to time by	 the
	      Judges."
</blockquote><p id="p_200">Though English Courts in the past accepted the	Blackstonian
theory and though the House of Lords strictly adhered to the
doctrine  of  'precedent'  in the earlier  years,  both	 the
doctrines  were	 practically  given  up	 by  the   "Practice
Statement (Judicial Precedent)" issued by the House of Lords
recorded  in  (1966)  1 W.L.R. 1234.   Lord  Gardiner  L.C.,
speaking   for	the  House  of	Lords  made  the   following
observations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">812</span>
	      "Their  Lordships nevertheless recognise	that
	      too  rigid adherence to precedent may lead  to
	      injustice in a particular case and also unduly
	      restrict	the proper development of  the	law.
	      They  propose,  therefore,  to  modify   their
	      present  practice and, while  treating  former
	      decisions	 of this House as normally  binding,
	      to  depart  from a previous decision  when  it
	      appears right to do so.
</p><p id="p_201">	      In this connection they will bear in mind	 the
	      danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis
	      on  which contracts, settlements	of  property
	      and fiscal arrangements have been entered into
	      and also the especial need for certainty as to
	      the criminal law."
</p><p id="p_202">	      This  announcement is not intended  to  affect
	      the  use of precedent elsewhere than  in	this
	      House."
</p><p id="p_203">It  will be seen from this passage that the House  of  Lords
hereafter in appropriate cases may depart from its  previous
decision when it appears right to do so and in so  departing
will  bear in mind the danger of giving effect to  the	said
decision retroactivity.	 We consider that what the House  of
Lords means by this statement is that in differing from	 the
precedents it will do so only without interefering with	 the
transactions  that had taken place on the basis	 of  earlier
decisions.   This decision, to a large extent, modifies	 the
Blackstonian theory and accepts, though not expressly but by
necessary   implication	  the	doctrine   of	"prospective
overruling."
</p><p id="p_204">Let us now consider some of the objections to this doctrine.
The objections are: (1) the doctrine involved legislation by
courts; (2) it would not encourage parties to prefer appeals
as  they  would	 not  get any  benefit	therefrom;  (3)	 the
declaration  for the future would only be obiter, (4) it  is
not   a	  desirable  change;  and  (5)	 the   doctrine	  of
retroactivity  serves  as a brake on court  which  otherwise
might be tempted to be so fascile in overruling.  But in our
view,  these objections are not insurmountable.	 If a  court
can over-rule its earlier decision-there cannot be any	dis-
pute now that the court can do so there cannot be any  valid
reason	why it should not restrict its ruling to the  future
and not to the past.  Even if the party filing an appeal may
not be benefited by it, in similar appeals which he may file
after  the change in the law he will have the benefit.	 The
decision cannot be obiter for what the court in effect	does
is  to declare the law but on the basis of another  doctrine
restricts  its scope.  Stability in law does not  mean	that
injustice shall be perpetuated.	 An illuminating article  on
the subject is found in Pennsylvania Law Review, [Vol.	I 10
p. 650].
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">813</span>
<p id="p_205">It  is a modem doctrine suitable for a fast moving  society.
It does not do away with the doctrine of stare decisis,	 but
confines  it to past transactions.  It is true that  in	 one
sense  the court only declares the law, either customary  or
statutory or personal law.  While in strict theory it may be
said  that  the doctrine involves making of  law,  what	 the
court really does is to declare the law but refuses to	give
retroactivity  to  it.	It is really  a	 pragmatic  solution
reconciling  the two conflicting doctrines, namely,  that  a
court finds law and that it does make law.  It finds law but
restricts its operation to the future.	It enables the court
to bring about a smooth transition by correcting its  errors
without	 disturbing the impact of those errors on  the	past
transactions.  It is left to the discretion of the court  to
prescribe  the	limits of the retroactivity and	 thereby  it
enables it to would the relief to meet the ends of justice.
In India there is no statutory prohibition against the court
refusing  to give retroactivity to the law declared  by	 it.
Indeed,.  the doctrine of res judicata precludes  any  scope
for  retroactivity in respect of a subject-matter  that	 has
been  finally decided between the parties.  Further,  Indian
court  by interpretation reject retroactivity. to  statutory
provisions  though  couched in general terms on	 the  ground
that  they  affect  vested rights.  The	 present  case	only
attempts  a  further  extension of  the	 said  rule  against
retroactivity.
</p><p id="p_206">Our Constitution does not expressly or by necessary implica-
tion speak against the doctrine of prospective	over-ruling.
Indeed,	 Arts. 32, 141 and 142 are couched in such wide	 and
elastic	 terms	as to enable this Court to  formulate  legal
doctrines to meet the ends of justice.	The only  limitation
thereon is reason, restraint and injustice.  Under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_322">Art.	 32</a>,
for  the enforcement of the fundamental rights	the  Supreme
Court  has the power to issue suitable directions or  orders
or  writs.   <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_323">Article 141</a> says that the law declared  by	 the
Supreme	 Court shall be binding on all courts; and <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_324">Art.	 142</a>
enables it in the exercise of its jurisdiction to pass	such
decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete
justice	 in  any cause or matter pending before	 it.   These
articles  are  designedly made comprehensive to	 enable	 the
Supreme Court to declare law and to give such directions  or
pass  such orders as are necessary to do  complete  justice.
The expression "declared" is wider than the words "found  or
made".	 To  declare is to announce  opinion.	Indeed,	 the
latter	involves  the process, while  the  former  expresses
result.	  Interpretation,  ascertainment and  evolution	 are
parts of the process, while that interpreted, ascertained or
evolved is declared as law.  The law declared by the Supreme
Court  is  the	law of the and.	 If so, we do  not  see	 any
acceptable reason why it, in declaring the law in superses-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">814</span>
<p id="p_207">sion  of the law declared by it earlier, could not  restrict
the operation of the law as declared to future and save	 the
transactions,  whether	statutory  or  otherwise  that	were
effected  on  the basis of the earlier law.   To  deny	this
power  to  the Supreme Court on the basis of  some  outmoded
theory that the Court only finds law but does not make it is
to  make  ineffective the powerful  instrument	of.  justice
placed	in  the	 hands	of the	highest	 judiciary  of	this
country.
</p><p id="p_208">As  this  Court for the first time has been called  upon  to
apply  the  doctrine evolved in a  different  country  under
different  ,circumstances, we would like to move  warily  in
the beginning.	We would lay down the following propositions
:  (I)	The  doctrine of  prospective  over-ruling,  can  be
invoked	 only in matters arising under our Constitution;  (2
it  an be applied only by the highest court of the  country,
i.e.,  the  Supreme  Court  as	it  has	 the  constitutional
jurisdiction  to  declare an binding on all  the  courts  in
India; (3) the scope of the retroactive operation of the law
declared  by  the  Supreme  Court  superseding	its  earlier
decisions  .is	left  to its discretion	 to  be	 moulded  in
accordance  with the justice of the cause or  matter  before
it.
</p><p id="p_209">We  have arrived at two conclusions, namely, (1)  Parliament
has no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as  to
take away or abridge the fundamental rights; and (2) this is
a  fit case to invoke and apply the doctrine or	 prospective
overruling.   What then is the effect of our  conclusion  on
the  instant  case ?. Having regard to the  history  of	 the
amendments  their impact on the social and economic  affairs
of our country and the chaotic situation that may be brought
about  by  the	sudden	withdrawal  at	this  stage  of	 the
amendments from the Constitution, we think that considerable
judicial  restraint is called for.  We,	 therefore,  declare
that  our  decision  will not affect  the  validity  of	 the
Constitution  (Seventeenth  Amendment) Act, 1964,  or  other
amendments made to the Constitution taking away or abridging
the  fundamental rights.  We further declare that in  future
Parliament  will  have	no power to amend Part	III  of	 the
Constitution  so as to take away or abridge the	 fundamental
rights.	  In  this  case we do not propose  to	express	 our
opinion on the question of the scope of the amendability  of
the   provisions   of  the  Constitution  other	  than	 the
fundamental  rights, as it does not arise for  consideration
before us.  Nor are we called upon to express out opinion on
the  question regarding the scope of the amends	 ability  of
Part  Ill of the constitution otherwise than by taking	away
or  abridging the fundamental rights.  We will not also	 in-
dicate	our  view one way or other whether any of  the	Acts
questioned  can	 be sustained under the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution  without the aid of Arts. 31A, 31B and the	 9th
Schedule.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">815</span>
<p id="p_210">The aforesaid discussion leads to the following results
	      (1)  The power of the Parliament to amend	 the
	      Constitution  is derived from Arts.  245,	 246
	      and 248 of the Constitution and not from	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_325">Art.
	      368</a>  thereof which only deals with  procedure.
	      Amendment is a legislative process.
</p><p id="p_211">	      (2)   Amendment is 'law' within the meaning of
	      <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_326">Art. 13</a> of the Constitution and, therefore, if
	      it takes away or abridges the rights conferred
	      by Part III thereof, it is void.
</p><p id="p_212">	      (3)   The Constitution (First Amendment)	Act,
	      1951,  Constitution  (Fourth  Amendment)	Act,
	      1955,   and,the	Constitution	(Seventeenth
	      Amendment)  Act, 1964, abridge the  scope.  of
	      the fundamental rights.  But, on the basis  of
	      earlier  decisions  of this Court,  they	were
	      valid.
</p><p id="p_213">	      (4)   On	the application of the	doctrine  of
	      'prospective over-ruling', as explained by  us
	      earlier,	 our   decision	  will	 have	only
	      prospective operation and, therefore, the said
	      amendments will continue to be valid.
</p><p id="p_214">	      (5)   We declare that the Parliament will have
	      no  power	 from the date of this	decision  to
	      amend any of the provisions of Part III of the
	      Constitution so as to take away or abridge the
	      fundamental rights enshrined therein.
</p><p id="p_215">	      (6)   As	  the	Constitution	(Seventeenth
	      Amendment)  Act holds the field, the  validity
	      of  the two impugned Acts, namely, the  Punjab
	      Security	of Land Tenures Act X of  1953,	 and
	      the  Mysore  Land Reforms Act X  of  1962,  as
	      amended	by  Act	 XIV  of  1965,	 cannot	  be
	      questioned  on  the ground  that	they  offend
	      Arts. 13, 14 or 31 of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_216">Before we close, it would be necessary to advert to an argu-
ment  advanced on emotional plane.  It was said that if	 the
provisions  of	the   Constitution could not be	 amended  it
would  lead  to	 revolution.   We have	not  said  that	 the
provisions of the Constitution cannot be amended but what we
have said is that they cannot be amended so as to take	away
or  abridge the fundamental rights.  Nor can  we  appreciate
the  argument  that  all  the  agrarian	 reforms  which	 the
Parliament  in power wants to effectuate cannot	 be  brought
about  without	amending  the fundamental  rights.   It	 was
exactly to prevent this attitude- and to project the  rights
of  the	 that the fundamental rights were  inserted  in	 the
Constitution.	If  it	is the duty  of	 the  Parliament  to
enforce the directive principles, it is equally its duty  to
enforce them without infringing the fundamental rights.	 The
Constitution-makers  thought  that it could be done  and  we
also think that the directive prin-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">816</span>
<p id="p_217">ciples can reasonably be enforced within the self-regulatory
machinery  provided by Part III.  Indeed both Parts III	 and
IV  of	the Constitution form an integrated  scheme  and  is
elastic	 enough	 to  respond to the changing  needs  of	 the
society.  The verdict of the Parliament on the scope of	 the
law  of social control of fundamental rights is	 not  final,
but  justiciable.   If	not  so, the  whole  scheme  of	 the
Constitution  will break.  What we can- I not understand  is
how  the enforcement of the provisions of  the	Constitution
can   bring   about  a	revolution.   History	shows	that
revolutions  are brought about not by the majorities but  by
the  minorities	 and  some  time  by  military	coups.	 The
existence  of  an all comprehensive  amending  power  cannot
prevent	 revolutions,  if  there is  chaos  in	the  country
brought	 about by mis-rule or abuse of power.  On the  other
hand,  such  a	restrictive power  gives  stability  to	 the
country and prevents it from passing under a totalitarian or
dictatorial  regime.  We cannot obviously base our  decision
on  such hypothetical or extraordinary situations which	 may
be  brought  about with or without  amendments.	  Indeed,  a
Constitution  is only permanent and not eternal.   There  is
nothing	 to  choose between destruction by amendment  or  by
revolution,  the  former is brought  about  by	totalitarian
rule, which cannot brook constitutional checks and the other
by the discontentment brought about by mis-rule.  If  either
happens,  the constitution will be a scrap of  paper.	Such
considerations are out of place in construing the provisions
of the Constitution by a court of law.
</p><p id="p_218">Nor  are we impressed by the argument that if the, power  of
amendment is 'not all comprehensive there will be no way  to
change	the  structure of our Constitution  or	abridge	 the
fundamental  rights  even if the whole country	demands	 for
such  a	 change.   Firstly,  this  visualizes  an  extremely
unforeseeable and
extravagant  demand; but even if such a	 contingency  arises
the residuary power of the Parliament may be relied upon  to
call   for   a	Constituent  Assembly  for  making   a	 new
Constitution  or  radically  changing it.   The	 recent	 Act
providing for a poll in Goa, Daman and Diu is an instance of
analogous   exercise   of  such	 residuary  power   by	 the
Parliament.   We  do not express our final opinion  on	this
important question.
</p><p id="p_219">A  final  appeal  is made to us that we	 shall	not  take  a
different  view as the decision in Sankari Prasad's  case(1)
held the field for many years.	While ordinarily this  Court
will  be reluctant to reverse its previous decision,  it  is
its  duty in the constitutional field to correct  itself  as
early as possible, for otherwise the future progress of	 the
country	 and the happiness of the people will be  at  stake.
As  we are convinced that the decision in  Sankari  Prasad's
case(1)	 is wrong, it is pre-eminently a typical case  where
this  Court  should over-rule it.  The longer it  holds	 the
field the greater will
(1)  [1952] S.C.R 89, 105
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">817</span>
be  the	 scope	for erosion of fundamental  rights.   As  it
contains the seeds of destruction of the cherished rights of
the  people the sooner it is over-ruled the better  for	 the
country.
</p><p id="p_220">This argument is answered by the remarks made by this  Court

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">818</span>
<p id="p_225">the three petitions for present purposes.  The main argument
in  all	 the three petitions has been as to  the  scope	 and
effect	of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_330">Art.  368</a>  of the  Constitution  and  the  power
conferred thereby to amend the Constitution.
Before	we  come  to the specific I  points  raised  in	 the
present	 petitions,  we may indicate  the  circumstances  in
which  Sankari	Prasad's case(1) as well as  Sajjan  Singh's
case (2) came to be decided and what they actually  decided.
The  Constitution  came into force on January  26,.1950.  It
provides  in  Part  III	 for  certain  fundamental   rights.
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_331">Article	 31</a>  which is in Part 111, as it  originally  stood,
provided for compulsory acquisition of property.  By  clause
(1)  it	 provided that "no person shall be deprived  of	 his
property  save	by authority of law".	Clause	(2)  ;hereof
provided  that any law authorising taking of  Possession  or
acquisition  of	 property  must	 provide  for	compensation
therefor  and  either  fix the	amount	of  compensation  or
specify the principles on which, and the manner in which the
compensation  was to be determined and paid.  Clause(4) made
a  special provision to the effect that if any Bill  pending
at  the commencement of the Constitution in the	 Legislature
of  a  State had, after it had been passed  by	such  Legis-
lature, been reserved for the consideration of the President
and  had  received his assent, then such law  would  not  be
called	in question though it contravened the provisions  of
cl. (2) relating to compensation.  Clause (6) provided	that
any  law of the State enacted not more than eighteen  months
before the Constitution might be submitted to the  President
for his certification, and if so certified, it could not  be
called	in  question on the ground that it  contravened	 the
provision of cl. (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_332">Art. 31</a> relating to compensation.
These  two  clauses  of	 <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_333">Art. 31</a>  were	meant  to  safeguard
legislation  which either had been passed by  Provincial  or
State  legislatures  or	 which was on  the  anvil  of  State
legislatures for the purpose of agrarian reforms.  One	such
piece  of legislation was the Bihar Land Reforms Act,  which
was  passed  in 1950.  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_334">That Act</a> received the assent  of	 the
President  as  required under cl. (6) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_335">Art.  31.</a>   It	 was
however	 challenged  before  the Patna High  Court  and	 was
struck	down  by that court on the ground that	it  violated
Art' 14	 of  the  Constitution.	 Then there  was  an  appeal
before this    Court, but while that appeal was pending, the
First Amendment	    to the Constitution was made.
We may briefly refer to what the First Amendment provided
for.   It was the First Amendment which was  challenged	 and
was upheld in Sankari Prasad's case(1).	 The First Amendment
contained  a number of provisions; but it is  necessary	 for
present	 purposes  only to refer to those  provisions  which
made changes in Part III of the Constitution.  These changes
related to Arts. 15
(1) [1952] S.C.R. 89.
</p><p id="p_226">(2) [1965] 1 S.C.R. 933
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">819</span>
and  19	 and  in addition, provided  for  insertion  of	 two
Articles,  numbered  31-A and 31-Bin Part III  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_336">Article	31-A</a>
provided  that no law providing for the acquisition  by	 the
State  of  any	estate	or of  any  rights  therein  or	 the
extinguishment	or modification of any such rights shall  be
deemed	to be void on the ground that it  was.	inconsistent
with,  or took away or abridged any of the rights  conferred
by  any provision in part Ill.	'The word "estate" was	also
defined	 for the purpose of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_337">Art. 31-A</a> Further <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_338">Article  31-B.</a>
provided for validation of certain Acts and  Regulations and
specified  such Acts and Regulations in the Ninth  Schedule,
which was for the first time added to the Constitution.	 The
Ninth  Schedule	 then  contained 13 Acts,  all	relating  to
estates , passed by various legislatures of the Provinces or
States.	 It laid down that those Acts and Regulations  would
not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void, on the
ground	that  they were inconsistent with. or took  away  or
abridged  any  of the rights conferred by any  provision  of
Part  III.   It further provided  that	notwithstanding	 any
judgment,  decree or order of any court or tribunal  to	 the
contrary, all such Acts and Regulations subject to the power
of  any	 competent  legislature to  repeal  or	amend  them,
continue in force.
</p><p id="p_227">This amendment, and in particular Arts. 31-A and 31-B  were.
immediately  challenged	 by various writ petitions  in	this
Court  and  these came to be decided on October 5,  1951  in
Sankari Prasad's case(1).  The attack on the validity of the
First Amendment was made on various grounds; but three	main
grounds which were. taken were, first 1 , that amendments to
the  Constitution  made	 under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_339">Art. 368</a> were  liable  to  be
tested under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_340">Art. 13(2);</a> secondly that in any case as  Arts.
31  A  and  31-B  insert  the  Constitution  by	 the  First.
Amendment  affected the power of the High Court	 under	<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_341">Art.
226  1</a>	and of this Court under Articles 132  and  136;	 the
amendment  required ratification under the proviso  to	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_342">Art.
368;</a>  and, thirdly that Acts. 31-A and 31 B were invalid  on
the ground that they related to matters-covered by the State
List, namely, item 18 of List 11, and could not therefore be
passed	by  Parliament.This  Court rejected  all  the  three
contentions.  It held that although ."law" would  ordinarily
include	 constitutional law, there was a  clear	 demarcation
between	 ordinary  law made in the exercise  of	 legislative
power  and  constitutional  law	 made  in  the	exercise  of
constituent power, and in the context of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_343">Art. 13</a>, "law" must
be  taken to mean rules or regulations made. in exercise  of
ordinary  legislative  power  and  not	amendments  to,	 the
Constitution  made in the exercise of constituent power;  in
consequence <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_344">Art. 13(2)</a> did not affect amendments made  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_345">Art.  3 68.</a>  It further held that Arts. 3 1 A and  31-B	 did
not curtail the power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_346">Art. 226</a> or of
this  court  under Arts. 132 and 136- and  did	not  require
ratification under the
(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 89
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">820</span>
proviso	 contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_347">Art. 368.</a>	 Finally, it was held  that-
Arts.  31.-A  and 31-B were essentially	 amendments  to	 the
Constitution  and Parliament as such had the power to  enact
such amendments.  In consequence, the First Amendment to the
Constitution was upheld as valid.
</p><p id="p_228">After	this   decision,   there   followed   sixteen	more
amendment   .to	 the  Constitution  till  we  come  to	 the
Seventeenth  Amendment, which was passed on June  20,  1964.
There does not seem to have been challenge to any  amendment
up  to	the Sixteenth Amendment, even though  two  of  them,
namely,	 the Fourth Amendment and the Sixteenth	 Amendment,,
contained  changes  in	the provisions of Part	III  of	 the
Constitution.  Further the nature of these amendments was to
add  to, or alter or delete various other provisions of	 the
Constitution  contained in Part III thereof On	December  5,
1961  came  the decision of this Court by which	 the  Kerala
Agrarain  Reforms Act (No. 4 of 1961), passed by the  Kerala
legislature,  was struck down, among other grounds, for	 the
reason	that ryotwari lands in South India were not  estates
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_348">Art. 31-A</a> and therefore acquisition of
reyotwari  land	 was not protected under <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_349">Art.  31-A</a>  of	 the
Constitution   :  [see	<a href="/doc/9285/" id="a_350">Karimbil  Kunhikoman  v.  State	  of
Kerala</a>(1)].   This decision was followed by the	 Seventeenth
Amendment on June 20, 1964.  By this amendment, changes were
made  in  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_351">Art.	31-A</a> of the Constitution and  44  Acts	were
included  in  the  Ninth  Schedule  to	give  them  complete
protection  from attack under any provision of Part  III  of
the  Constitution.   Practically all these Acts	 related  to
land tenures and were concerned with agrarian reforms.	This
amendment  was	challenged  before  this  'Court  in  Sajjan
Singh's	 case(2).  The points then urged were that  as	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_352">Art.
226</a> was likely to be affected by the Seventeenth  Amendment,
it  required ratification under the proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_353">Art. 368</a>	 and
that  the  decision  in Sankari Prasads	 case(3)  which	 had
negatived this contention required re-consideration.  It was
also  urged that the Seventeenth Amendment  was	 legislation
with  respect  to  land	 and  Parliament  bad  no  right  to
legislate   in	that  behalf,  and  further  that   as	 the
Seventeenth  Amendment	provided that the Acts	put  in	 the
Ninth  Schedule would be valid in spite of the	decision  of
the  Courts,  it  was unconstitutional..  This	Court  by  a
majority  of 3 to 2 upheld the correctness of  the  decision
in  Sankari Prasad's case(,,).	It further held	 unanimously
that the Seventeenth Amendment did not require	ratification
under the proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_354">Art. 368</a> because of its indirect effect
on  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_355">Art. 226</a>, and that Parliament in enacting the  Amendment
was  not  legislating with respect to land and that  it	 was
open  to Parliament to validate legislation which  had	been
invalid by courts.  Finally this Court held by majority
(1) [1962] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 829.	(2) [1965] 1 S.C.R. 933.
(3)  [1952] S.C.R. 89.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">821</span>
<p id="p_229">that  the power conferred by <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_356">Art. 368</a> included the power  to
take away fundamental rights guaranteed by Part HI and	that
the  power to amend was a very wide power and could  not  be
controlled  by	the literal dictionary meaning of  the	word
"amend"	 and  that  the word "law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_357">Art. 13  (2)</a>  did	 not
include	 an amendment of the Constitution made in  pursuance
of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_358">Art. 368.</a>  The minority however doubted the	 correctness
of  the view taken in Sankari Prasads case(1) to the  effect
that the word 'law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_359">Art. 13 (2)</a> did not include amendment
to  the	 Constitution  made under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_360">Art.	 368</a>  and  therefore
doubted	 the competence of Parliament to make any  amendment
to Part III of the Constitution.  One of the learned  Judges
further	 doubted  whether  making  a  change  in  the  basic
features of the Constitution could be regarded merely as  an
amendment  or would, in effect, be re-writing a part of	 the
Constitution,  and  if so, whether it could' be	 done  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_361">Art.  368.</a>   It	 was because of this  doubt  thrown  on	 the
correctness  of the view taken in Sankari  Prasad's  case(1)
that  the  present reference has been made to  this  Special
Bench.
</p><p id="p_230">As  the	 question  referred  to	 this  Bench  is  of   great
constitutional importance and affected legislation passed by
various	 States, notice was issued to the Advocates  General
of all States and they have appeared and, intervened  before
us.   Further a number of persons who were also affected  by
the Seventeenth Amendment have been permitted to  intervene.
The   arguments	 on  behalf  of	 the  petitioners  and	 the
interveners who support them may now. be briefly summarised.
It is urged that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_362">Art. 368-</a>when it provides for the amendment
of the Constitution merely' contains the procedure for doing
so and that the power to make amendment has to be found.  in
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_363">Art.  248</a> read with item 97 of List 1. It is  further  urged
that  the  word	 "amendment"  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_364">Art.  368</a>  means  that	 the
provisions  in	the  Constitution can be changed  so  as  to
important  upon	 them And that this power is  of  a  limited
character  and	does not authorise Parliament  to  make	 any
addition to, alteration of or deletion of any ,provision  of
the Constitution, including the provision contained in	Part
III.   So  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_365">Art. 368</a> authorises only those  amendments  which
have  the effect of improving the Constitution.	 Then it  is
urged  that amendment permissible under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_366">Art. 368</a> is  subject
to certain implied limitations and the these limitations are
that basic features of the Constitution cannot be amended at
all.   An attempt was made to indicate some of	these  basic
features,  as, f( example, the provisions in Part  III,	 the
federal	 structure, the republican character of	 the  State,
elected	 Parliament and State Legislatures on-the  basis  of
adult  suffrage, control by the judiciary and so on, and  it
is.  said that- an amendment under <a href="/doc/1915616/" id="a_367">Art. 3 69</a> is	 subject  to
the implied limi-
</p><p id="p_231">(1) (1952] S.C.R. 89.
</p><p id="p_232">L3Sup.CI/67-7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">822</span>
tations	 that  these basic features and others of  the	kind
cannot	be,  changed.  Thus in effect the argument  is	that
there  is  a  very  limited power  of  amendment  under	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_233">It   is	 further  urged	 that  apart  from   these   implied
limitations, there is an express limitation under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_368">Art. 13(2)</a>
and  the word "law in that Article includes an amendment  of
the  Constitution. The argument thus in the  alternative  is
that   as   the	 word  "law"  in  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_369">Art.	13(2)</a>	includes   a
constitutional	amendment, no amendment can be made in	Part
HI under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_370">Art. 368</a> which would actually take away or  abridge
the  rights  guaranteed under that Part.  In effect,  it  is
said that even if there are no implied limitations to  amend
the  Constitution under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_371">Art. 368</a>, <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_372">Art. 13(2)</a> is	 an  express
limitation  insofar  as	 the  power to	amend  Part  III  is
concerned and by virtue of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_373">Art. 13(2)</a> the rights  guaranteed
under  Part III cannot be taken away or abridged under	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_374">Art.
368</a>,  though it is conceded that Part III may be amended  by
way of enlarging the rights contained therein.
Another	 line  of  argument  is that  in  any  case  it	 was
necessary  to take action under the proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_375">Art. 368</a>	 and
as that was not done the Seventeenth Amendment is not valid.
It  is	urged that <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_376">Art. 2</a><a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_377">,26</a> is seriously  affected  by	 the
provisions  contained in the Seventeenth Amendment and	that
amounts	 to  an	 amendment of Aft. 226	and  in	 consequence
action	under the- proviso was necessary.  It is also  urged
that <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_378">Art. 245</a> was addition of a number of Acts in the  Ninth
13  (2) and therefore also it was necessary to	take  action
under  the  proviso.  It is further urged that	it  was	 not
competent  for	Parliament  to	amend  the  Constitution  by
putting a large number of Acts in the Ninth Schedule as	 the
power  to  legislate with respect to land is  solely  within
the.  competence of State Legislatures and that	 is  another
reason why the addition to the Ninth Schedule read with <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_379">Art.
31</a> B should be struck down.
</p><p id="p_234">Lastly	an argument had been advanced which we may call	 the
argument  of  fear.  It is said that if <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_380">Art.368</a> is  held  to
confer full to amend each and every part of the Constitution
as has been    held in Sankari Prasad's case(1).  Parliament
May do all kinds of things, which were never intended, under
this unfettered power and may, for example, abolish  elected
legislatures,  abolish the President or change	the  present
form of Government into a Presedential type like the  United
States.	 Constitution or do away with the federal  structure
altogether.   So it is urged that, we should,interpret	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_381">Art.
368</a> in such a way that Parliament may not be able to do- all
these things.  In effect this argument of fear has been	 put
forward to reinforce the contention that this Court should

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">823</span>
<p id="p_235">hold that there are some implied limitations on the amending
power and these implied limitations should be that there  is
no  power any where in the Constitution to change the  basic
features of the Constitution to which reference has  already
been made.  This is in brief the submission on behalf of the
petitioners and the interveners who support them.
The   submission  on behalf of the Union of  India  and	 the
States may now be summarised.  It is urged that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_382">Art. 368</a> not
only provides procedure or amendment but also contains in it
the  power to amend the Constitution.  It is  further  urged
that the word "amendment" in law does not merely mean making
such  changes  in the Constitution as would improve  it	 but
includes the power to make any addition to the Constitution,
any  alteration	 of any of the existing provisions  and	 its
substitution by another provisions, and any deletion of	 any
particular provision of the Constitution.  In .effect, it is
urged  that  even if the word "amendment" used in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_383">Art.	 368</a>
does not take in the power to abrogate the entire 'Constitu-
tion  and  replace  it	by  another  new  Constitution,	  it
certainly means that any provisions of the Constitution	 may
be  changed and this change can be in the form	of  addition
to,  alteration	 of  or deletion of  any  provision  of	 the
Constitution.  So long therefore as the Constitution is	 not
entirely  abrogated and replaced by a- new  Constitution  at
one  stroke, the power of amendment would enable  Parliament
to-  make  all	changes	 in  the  existing  Constitution  by
addition, alteration or deletion.  Subject only to co repeal
being not possible, the power of amendment contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_384">Art.
368</a> is unfettered.  It is further urged that there can be no
implied	  limitations  on  the	power  to  amend   and	 the
limitations  if any on this. power must be found hi  express
terms  in  the	Article	 providing  for-amendment.   It	  is
conceded that there may be an express limitation not  merely
in  the Article providing for amendment, but in	 some  other
part  of the Constitution.  But it is said that if  that  is
so, there must be a clear provision to that effect.  In	 the
absence	 of express limitations, therefore, there can be  no
implied limitations ,on the power to amend the	Constitution
contained  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_385">Art.  368</a> and that power	 will  take  in	 all
changes whether by way of addition, alteration or  deletion,
subject	 only to this that the power of amendment  may	riot
contain	 the,  power  to  abrogate  and	 repeal	 the  entire
Constitution and substitute it with a new one.
It  is	then  urged that there is no  express  provision  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_386">Art.368</a>	 itself	 so  far as any amendment  relating  to	 the
substance  of  the amending power is  concerned-,  die	only
limitations  in Art, 368 are as to procedure and courts	 can
only  see  that the procedure as indicated in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_387">Art.  368</a>  is
followed before an amendment can be said to be valid.  It is
further	 urged	that  the word "law", in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_388">Art.  13</a>  does	 not
include an amendment of the Constitution and only
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">824</span>
moans	law  as	 made.	under  the  legislative	  provisions
contained  in Chapter, I of Part XI read with,	Chapters  II
and III of Part V of the.  Constitution and Chapters III and
V  of Part VI thereof.	In effect it is a law which is	made
under  the Constitution which included in the word "law"  in
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_389">Art.  13(2)</a> and not an amendment to the	 Constitution  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_390">Art. 368.</a>
</p><p id="p_236">As  to	Articles  226 and 245 and the  necessity  of  taking
action under the proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_391">Art. 368</a>, it is urged that there
is no change in Arts. 226 and 245on account of any provision
in  the Seventeenth Amendment and therefore no action  under
the proviso was necessary.    it  is only direct  change  in
Arts.  226  and	 245  which  would  require  following	 the
procedure  as to ratification or at any rate such change  in
other  Articles	 which	would have the	effect	of  directly
compelling  change  in	Arts 226 and 245  and  that  in	 the
present case no such	 direct compulsion arises.
 Lastly as to the argument of fear it is urged that there is
always	a  provision with respect to  amendment	 in  written
federal	 Constitutions.	  Such a provision may be  rigid  or
flexible.   In	our  Constitution <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_392">Art. 368</a>  provides  for  a
comparatively flexible provision for amendment and there is'
no  reason to make it rigid by implying any  limitations  on
that power.  Further there Is no reason to suppose that	 all
those  things  will be done by Parliament  which  are  being
urged to deny the power under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_393">Art. 368</a> which flows naturally
from its terms.
</p><p id="p_237">Besides the above, reliance is also placed on behalf of	 the
Union  of  India and the States on the	doctrine.  of  stare
decisis.  It is urged that since the decision of this  Court
in Sankari Prasad's case(1), sixteen further amendments have
been  made  by	Parliament on the  faith  of  that  decision
involving  over	 200  Articles	of  the	 Constitution.	 The
amendments  relating  to  Part III  have  been	mainly	with
respect to agrarian reforms resulting in transfers of  title
of  millions  of  acres of land in  favour  of	millions  of
people.	  Therefore', even though Sankari  Prasad's  case(1)
has  stood  only  for fifteen years there has  been  a	vast
agrarian  revolution effected on the faith of that  decision
and this Court should not now go back on what was decided in
that  case.   Further, besides the argument based  on  state
decisis,  it is urged on the basis of certain  decisions  of
this  Court that the unanimous decision in Sankari  Prasad's
case(1)	  which	 had  stood  practically  unchallenged	 for
about'15'years till the decision in Sajjan Singh's  case(2),
should not be over-ruled unless it is found to be  incorrect
by a large majority of the Judges constituting this  Special
Bench.	 It  is urged that if the present Bench is  more  or
less  evenly divided it should not over-rule  the  unanimous
decision in' Sankari Prasad's case(1) by a Majority of one.

</p><p id="p_238">(2) [1965] 1 S.C.R. 933
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">825</span>
We shall first take Art, 368.  It is found in Part XX of the
Constitution   which   is   headed.    Amendment   of	 the
Constitution"  and is the only Article in that	Part.	That
Part  thus  provides specifically for the amendment  of	 the
Constitution, and the first question that arises is  whether
it  provides power for the amendment of the Constitution  as
well as the procedure for doing so.  It is not disputed that
the  procedure	for amendment of the Constitution is  to  be
found  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_394">Art. 368</a>, but what is in dispute is  whether	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_395">Art.
368</a> confers power also in that behalf. Now the procedure for
the amendment of the Constitution is this: The amendment  is
initiated  by the introduction of a Bill in either House  of
Parliament.   The Bill has to be passed in each House  by  a
majority  of  the total membership of that House  and  by  a
Majority of not less two-thirds of the members of that House
present	 and  voting.  After it is so passed, it has  to  be
presented  to  the  President  for  his	 assent.   On	such
presentation if the President assents to the Bill, <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_396">Art. 3-68</a>
provides  that	the  Constitution  shall  stand	 amended  in
accordance  with the terms of the Bill.	 Further there is  a
proviso	 for ratification with respect to  certain  Articles
and other provisions of the Constitution including <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_397">Art. 368</a>,
and those matters can only be amended if the Bill passed  by
the  two  Houses by necessary majority is  ratified  by	 the
legislatures  of  not less than one-half of  the  States  by
resolutions to that effect.  In such a case the Bill  cannot
be presented for his assent to the President until necessary
ratification   is  available.	But  when   the.   necessary
ratification  has been made, the Bill with respect to  these
matters is then presented to the President and on his assent
being given, the Constitution stands amended. in  accordance
with the terms of the Bill.
</p><p id="p_239">The argument is that there is no express provision in  terms
in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_398">Art.  368</a> conferring power on Parliament  to  amend	 the
Constitution, and in this connection our attention has	been
invited	 to  an analogous provision in the  Constitution  of
Ireland in <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_399">Art. 46</a>, where cl. 1 provides that any  provision
of  the Constitution, may be amended in the manner  provided
in  that  Article,  and	 then  follows	the  procedure	 for
amendment  in  clauses	2 to 5. Reference is  also  made  to
similar	 provisions  in.  other	 constitutions,	 but  it  is
unnecessary to refer to them. . It is urged that as <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_400">Art. 368</a>
has  nothing  comparable to cl.	 I of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_401">Art. 46</a> of  the  Irish
Constitution, the power to amend the Constitution is not in.
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_402">Art.  3	 68</a>  and  must .be. found  elsewhere.	We  are	 not
prepared to accept this argument.  The fact that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_403">Art. 368</a> is
not  in	 two  parts,  the first	 part  indicating  that	 the
Constitution  shall  be	 amended  in  the  manner   provided
thereafter, and the second part indicating the procedure for
amendment,  does not mean that the power to amend the  Cons-
titution is not contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_404">Art. 368</a> itself.  The very fact
that a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">826</span>
separate  Part	has  been devoted in  the  Constitution	 for
amendment thereof and there is only one Article in that Part
shows  that  both the power to amend and the  procedure	 for
amendment  are to be found in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_405">Art. 368.</a>	 Besides, the  words
"the  Constitution shall stands amended in accordance  'with
the  terms of the Bill" in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_406">Art. 368</a> clearly in	our  opinion
provide for the power to amend after the procedure has	been
followed.   It	appears that  our  Constitution-makers	were
apparently  thinking  of economy of words  and	elegance  of
language  in  enacting	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_407">Art. 368</a> in the terms  in  which  it
appears and that is why it is not in two parts on the  model
of  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_408">Art.46</a> of the Irish Constitution.  But there can in	 our
opinion.  be  not doubt, when a separate Part  was  provided
headed	"Amendment  of the Constitution" that the  power  to
amend  the Constitution must also be contained in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_409">Art.	 368</a>
which  is the only Article in that Part.  If there  was	 any
doubt  about  the-  matter, that doubt	in  our	 opinion  is
resolved  by  the words to which we  have  already  referred
namely "the Constitution shall stand amended in the terms of
the  Bill".   These words can only mean that the.  power  is
there to amend the Constitution after the procedure has been
followed.
</p><p id="p_240"> It   is  however  urged  that	the  power  to	 amend	 the
Constitution is not to be found in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_410">Art. 368</a> but is contained
in  the residuary power of Parliament in <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_411">Art. 48</a>  read	with
item  97 of List 1. It is true that <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_412">Art. 248</a> read with	item
97 of List I, insofar as it provides for residuary power  of
legislation, is very wide in its scope and the argument that
the,  power to amend the Constitution is contained  in	this
provision  appears  prima facie attractive 'in view  of	 the
width  of the residuary power.	But we fail to see why	when
there is a whole Part devoted to the amendment of the  Cons-
titution  the  power to amend should not be  found  in	that
Part,  if it can be reasonably found there and why <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_413">Art.	 368</a>
should	only  be  confined to providing	 for  procedure	 for
amendment.  It is true that the marginal note to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_414">Art. 368</a> is
"procedure  for	 amendment of the  Constitution",  but.	 the
marginal note cannot control the meaning of the words in the
Article	 itself,  and we have no doubt that the	 words	"the
Constitution  shall  stand amended in accord  the  power  of
amendment.  If we were to compare the language of cls. 2  to
5of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_415">Art. 46- of</a> the Irish Constitution which prescribes	 the
procedure for amendment, we find no words therein comparable
to  these words in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_416">Art. 368.</a>  These words clearly  are	com-
parable	 to cl.	 I of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_417">Art. 46-of</a> the Irish Constitution	 and
must  be rod as conferring power on Parliament to amend	 the
Constitution.	Besides	 it is remarkable in  contrast	that
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_418">Art.  248</a>  read with List I does not in	 terms	mention	 the
amendment  of the Constitution. while therefore there  is  a
whole Part devoted to the amendment of the Constitution,  we
do not find any specific mention of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">827</span>
amendment of the Constitution in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_419">Art. 248</a> or in any entry of
List 1.
</p><p id="p_241">It  would in the circumstances be more appropriate to	read
in  power in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_420">Art. 3 68</a> in view of the, words which  we	have
already	 referred to than in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_421">Art. 248</a> read with item  97  of
List  I.  Besides it is a historical fact to  which  we	 can
refer  that originally the intention was to  vest  residuary
power  in States, and if that intention had been  eventually
carried	 out, it would have been impossible for any  one  to
argue  that  the power to amend the Constitution was  to  be
found  in the residuary power if it had been vested  in	 the
States and not in the Union.  The mere fact that during	 the
passage	 of  the Constitution by the  Constituent  Assembly,
residuary  power was finally vested in the Union  would	 not
therefore mean that it includes the power to amend the Cons-
titution.   On a comparison of the scheme, of the  words  in
Art  368 and the scheme of the words in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_422">Art. 248</a>  read	with
item 97 of List 1, therefore, there is no doubt in our	mind
that both the procedure and power to amend the	Constitution
are to be found in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_423">Art. 368</a> and they are not to be found  in
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_424">Art.  248</a>  read with item 97 of List I	which  provides	 for
residuary legislative power of Parliament.
There  is  in our opinion another reason why  the  power  to
amend  the Constitution cannot found in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_425">Art. 248</a>  read	with
item  97 of List 1. The Constitution is the fundamental	 law
and no law passed under mere legislative power conferred  by
the Constitution can affect any change, in the	Constitution
unless there is an express power to that effect given in the
Constitution  itself.	But subject to	such  express  power
given  by  the	Constitution itself,  the  fundamental	law,
namely	the Constitution, cannot be changed by a law  passed
under	the   legislative  provisions	contained   in	 the
Constitution as all legislative acts passed under the  power
conferred   by	 the  Constitution  must  conform   to	 the
Constitution can make no change therein.  There are a number
of Articles in the Constitution, which expressly provide for
amendment by law, as,. for example, 3, 4, 10, 59(3),  65(3),
73(2),	97,  98(3), 106, 120(2), 135, 137,  142(1),  146(2),
148(3), 149, 169, 171(2), 196, 187(3), 189(3), 194(3),	195,
210(2), 221(2). 225, 229(2), 239(1), 241(3), 283(1) and (2),
285(2), 287, 306(1), 313, 345, 373, Sch.  V. cl. 7 and	Sch.
VI, cl. 21,, and so far as these Articles are concerned they
can  be	 amended  by  Parliament  by.  ordinary	  law-making
process.   But	so far as the other Articles  are  concerned
they  can only be amended by amendment of 'the	Constitution
under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_426">Art. 368.</a>	 Now <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_427">Art. 245</a> which gives power to make	 law
for  the  whole	 or any part of the territory  of  India  by
Parliament  is	"subject to the provisions of  this  Consti-
tution"	 and any law made by Parliament whether	 under	<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_428">Art.
246</a> read with List I or under <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_429">Art. 248</a> read with item 97  of
List I be subject to the provisions of the Constitution.  If
therefore  the power to amend the Constitution is  contained
in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_430">Art. 248</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">828</span>
read with item 97 of List 1, that power has to	be exercised
subject to the provisions of the Constitution and cannot  be
used   to   change   the  fundamental	law   (namely,	 the
Constitution) itself.  But it is argued that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_431">Art. 368</a>  which
provides   a   special	procedure  for	amendment   of	 the
Constitution should be read along with Arts. 245 248, and so
read  it  would	 be  open to  amend  any  provision  of	 the
Constitution by law passed under <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_432">Art. 248</a> on the ground that
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_433">Art.  248</a>  is  subject to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_434">Art. 368</a>  and	 therefore  the	 two
together  give power to Parliament to pass a law under	<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_435">Art.
248</a>   which  will  amend  even	those  provisions   of	 the
Constitution  which are not expressly made amendable by	 law
passed under the legislative power of Parliament.  This	 in-
our opinion is arguing in a circle.- If the fundamental	 law
(ie. the Constitution) cannot be I changed by any law passed
under	the  legislative  powers  contained   therein,	 for
legislation  so passed must conform to the fundamental	law,
we  fail to see how a law, passed under the residuary  power
which  is nothing, more than legislative power conferred  on
parliament   under   the  Constitution,	  can	change	 the
Constitution (namely, the fundamental law) Itself.
We,may in this connection refer to the following passage  in
The Law.and the Constitution by W. Ivor Jennings (1933	Ed.)
at p. 51 onwards :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	       "A   written   constitution   is	  thus	 the
	      fundamental  law	of a  country,	the  express
	      embodiment  of the doctrine of the  region  of
	      law.    All   public   uthorities-legislative,
	      administrative  and judical-take their  powers
	      directly	or indirectly  from  it.....Whatever
	      the  nature of the written constitution it  is
	      clear that there "is a fundamental distinction
	      between constitutional law and the rest of the
	      law........  There  is  a	 clear	 separation,
	      therefore, between the constitutional law	 and
	      the rest of the law."
</blockquote><p id="p_242">It  is because of this difference between  the.	 fundamental
law (namely, the Constitution) and the law passed under	 the
legislative  provisions of the Constitution that it  is	 not
possible  in  the absence of an express	 provision  to	that
effect in the fundamental law to ,change the fundamental law
by ordinary legislation passed thereunder, for such ordinary
legislation must always conform to the fundamental law (i.e.
the  Constitution).  If the power to amend the	Constitution
is  to be found in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_436">Art. 248</a> read with item 97 of List 1.  It
will mean that ordinary legislation passed under fundamental
law  would  amend that law and this cannot  be	done  unless
there is express provision as in <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_437">Art. 3</a> etc. to that effect
In  the	 absence of such express provisions any	 law  passed
under the legislative powers granted under the fundamental'-
law  cannot amend it.  So if we were to hold that the  power
to amend the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">829</span>
Constitution is comprised in-<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_438">Art. 248</a>, that would mean that-
no  amendment-,of the Constitution would be possible at	 all
except to the extent expressly provided in various  Articles
to  which  we  have  referred  already,	 for  the  power  to
legislate  under  <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_439">Art.	245</a> read with  <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_440">Art.  248</a>  is  itself
subject to the Constitution.  Therefore reading <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_441">Art. 368</a> and
considering  the scheme of the legislative powers  conferred
by Articles 245 and 248 read with item 97 of List I" this to
our  mind  is clear, firstly that the power  to	 amend	the,
Constitution  is  to  be  found	 in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_442">Art.  368</a>	itself,	 and
secondly, that the power to amend the Constitution can never
reside in <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_443">Art. 245</a> and <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_444">Art. 248</a> read with item 97 of List 1,
for  that  would  make any  amendment  of  the	Constitution
impossible  except  with respect to  the  express-provisions
contained in certain Articles thereof for amendment by law-.
We  may in this connection add that all this  argument	that
power  to amend the Constitution is to be found in <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_445">Art.	 245</a>
and  <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_446">Art. 248</a> read with item 97 of List I has been based  on
one    accidental   circumstance,   and	  that	  accidental
circumstance  is  that the procedure for  amendment  of	 the
Constitution   contained  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_447">Art.  368</a>	 is  more  or	less
assimilated to the procedure for making ordinary laws  under
the  Constitution.   The  argument  is	that  constitutional
amendment  is also passed by the two Houses  of	 Parliament,
and   is  assented  to	by  the	 President   like   ordinary
legislation, with this difference that a special majority is
required  for certain purposes and a special  majority	plus
ratification is required for certain other purposes.  It may
be admitted that the procedure for amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_448">Art.	 368</a>
is  somewhat similar to the procedure for  passing  ordinary
legislation under the Constitution.  Even so, as pointed out
by Sir Ivor Jennings in the passage already quoted, there is
a  clear separation between constitutional law and the	rest
of  the law and that must never be forgotten.  An  amendment
to the Constitution is a constitutional law and as  observed
in  Sankari Prasad's case(1) is in exercise  of	 constituent
power;	passing of ordinary law is in exercise	of  ordinary
legislative power and is clearly different from the power to
amend  the Constitution.  We may in this  connection  refer,
for  example, to Art.  V of other U.S.	Constitution,  which
provides  for  the, amendment thereof.	It will	 be  clearly
seen  that  the	 power	contained in Art.   V  of  the	U.S.
Constitution  is not ordinary legislative power and  no	 one
can possibly call it ordinary legislative power, because the
procedure provided for the amendment of the Constitution  in
Art.   V differs radically from the procedure  provided	 for
ordinary legislation, for example, the President's assent is
not  required constitutional amendment under Art.  V of	 the
U.S. Constitution,; Now if <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_449">Art. 368</a> also had made a  similar
departure   from   the	procedure  provided   for   ordinary
legislation, it could never have
(1)  [1952 ] 1 S. C. R. 89
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">830</span>
said  that  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_450">Art.  368</a> merely  contained	 the  procedure	 for
amendment  and	that what emerges after	 that  procedure  is
followed  is ordinary law of the same quality and nature  as
emerges	 after following the procedure for passing  ordinary
law.  If, for example, the assent of the President which  is
to  be	found  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_451">Art.	 368</a> had  not  been  there  and	 the
Constitution  would  have stood amended after the  Bill	 had
been  passed  by the two Houses by  necessary  majority	 and
after  ratification by not less than one-half of the  States
where so required , it could never have been argued that the
power  to amend the Constitution was contained in  <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_452">Art.	 245</a>
and <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_453">248</a> read with item 97 of List I and <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_454">Art. 368</a> merely con-
tained the procedure.
</p><p id="p_243">We are however of opinion that we should look at the quality
and  nature  of what is done under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_455">Art. 368</a> and not  lay  so
much stress on the similarity of the procedure contained  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_456">Art.  368</a> with the procedure for ordinary lawmaking.  If  we
thus  look at the quality and nature of what is	 done  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_457">Art.  368</a>,  we find that it is the exercise  of	 constituent
power  for the purpose of amending the	Constitution  itself
land  is  very	different  from	 the  exercise	of  ordinary
legislative  power  for	 passing  laws	which  must  be	  in
conformity  with the Constitution and cannot go against	 any
provision thereof, unless there is express provision to that
effect to which we have already referred.  If we thus  refer
to the nature and quality of what is done under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_458">Art. 368</a>, we
immediately  See  that what emerges after the  procedure  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_459">Art.  368</a> is gone through is not ordinary law which  emerges
after	the   legislative   procedure	contained   in	 the
Constitution  is gone through.	Thus <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_460">Art. 368</a>  provides	 for
the  coming  into  existence  of  what	may  be	 called	 the
fundamental  law  in  the  form	 of  an	 amendment  of	 the
Constitution and therefore what emerges after the  procedure
under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_461">Art. 368</a> is gone through is not ordinary	 legislation
but  an amendment of the Constitution which becoming a	part
of  the	 fundamental  law itself, by  virtue  of  the  words
contained  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_462">Art. 368</a> to the effect that  the	Constitution
shall  stand  amended in accordance with the  terms  of	 the
'Bill.
</p><p id="p_244">It  is	urged in this connection on behalf of the  Union  of
India  that  even  though the assent  of  the  President  is
required under Aft. 368, the ;President must assent  thereto
and cannot withhold his assent as is possible in the case of
ordinary  law in view of Art.  III of the Constitution,	 for
the words "that he withholds assent therefrom" found in Art.
III  are  not  to  be found in	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_463">Art.  368.</a>   It	 is  however
difficult to accept the argument on behalf of the Union that
the  President	cannot withhold his assent when a  Bill	 for
amendment of the Constitution is presented to him.   <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_464">Article
'368</a>  provides	that  a	 Bill  for  the	 amendment  of	the,
Constitution  shall  be presented to the President  for	 his
assent.	 It further provides
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">831</span>
that  upon  such assent by the President,  the	Constitution
shall,	stand amended.	That in our opinion postulates	that
if assent is not given, the Constitution cannot be  amended.
Whether	 a  President will ever withhold his assent  in	 our
form of Government is a different matter altogether, but  as
we road <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_465">Art. 368</a> we cannot. hold that the President is bound
to  assent  and cannot withhold his assent when a  Bill	 for
amendment  of the Constitution is presented to him.  We	 are
of opinion that 'the President can refuse to give his assent
when  a Bill for amendment of the Constitution is  presented
to him, the result being that the Bill altogether falls, for
there  is no specific provision for anything further  to  be
done,: about the Bill in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_466">Art. 368</a> as there is in Art.	III.
We  may in this. connection refer to the different  language
used  in  cl. 5 of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_467">Art. 46</a> of the Irish	 Constitution  which
says that "a Bill containing a proposal for the amendment of
this Constitution shall be signed by the President Forthwith
upon his being satisfied that the provisions of this Article
have  been complied with, in respect thereof'.	It  will  be
seen  therefore	 that if the intention kinder <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_468">Art.  368</a>	 had
been that the President cannot withhold his assent, we would
have  found  language similar in terms to that in cl.  5  of
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_469">Art. 46</a> of the Irish Constitution.
</p><p id="p_245">We thus see that in one respect at any rate <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_470">Art. 368</a> even on
its present terms differs from the power of the President in
connection with ordinary legislation under the	Constitution
and  that is if the President withholds his assent the	Bill
for  amendment of' the Constitution immediately	 falls.	  We
cannot accept that the procedure provided under the  proviso
to  <a href="/doc/158646/" id="a_471">Art. 111</a> can apply in such a case, for this much  cannot
be  disputed that so far as the procedure for  amendment  of
the Constitution is concerned we must look to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_472">Art. 368</a>	only
and  nothing  else.   In any case the  mere  fact  that	 the
procedure  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_473">Art.  368</a> is very much  assimilated.  to	 the
procedure for passing ordinary legislation is no reason for,
holding that what emerges after the procedure under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_474">Art. 368</a>
is followed is ordinary law and no more.  We repeat that  we
must  look at the quality and nature of what is	 done  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_475">Art.  368</a>, and that is, the amendment of  the  Constitution.
If  we	look at that we must bold that what emerges  is	 not
ordinary  law  passed under the Constitution  but  something
which has the effect of amending the fundamental law  itself
which  could  not be done by  ordinary	legislative  process
under the Constitution unless there is express provision  to
that  effect.	We  have already referred  to  such  express
provisions  in	various	 Articles, but <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_476">Art.  368</a>  cannot  be
treated	 as such an Article, for it deals specifically	with
the amendment of the Constitution as a whole.
It  is also remarkable to note in this connection that	the,
word  "law" which has been used in so many Articles of	'the
Consti-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">832</span>
<p id="p_246">tution	has been avoided apparently with great care in	Art.
</p><p id="p_247">368.  We again refer to the concluding words 368 which	says
that  the  "Constitution shall stand amended  in  accordance
with  the terms of the Bill.  Now it is well-known  that  in
the case of ordinary legislation as soon both Houses and has
received  the assent of the main part of Art. stand  amended
in ac it is well-known that as the Bill is passed by of	 the
President it becomes an Act.  But <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_477">Art. 368</a> provides that  as
soon as the Bill for amendment of the Constitution has	been
passed	in accordance with the procedure provided  there  in
the  Constitution shall stand amendmend in  accordance	with
the  terms  of the Bill.  These words in  our  opinion	have
significance of their own.  It is also remarkable that these
words  clearly show the difference between the,	 quality  of
what emerges after the procedure under Art., 368 is followed
and  what  happens  when ordinary  law-making  procedure  is
followed.   Under  Art.	 III, in the case of  ordinary	law-
making when a Bill is passed by the two Houses of parliament
it  is presented to the President and the  President   shall
declare	 either	 that  he assents to the  Bill	or  that  he
withholds assent therefrom.  But it is remarkable that	<a href="/doc/158646/" id="a_478">Art.
111</a> does not provide that when the Bill has been assented to
by  the President it becomes an Act' The reason for this  is
that  the  Bill assented to by the President though  it	 may
become law is still not declared by Art.  I I I to be a law,
for  such  law	is open to challenge in	 courts	 on  various
,grounds,  namely,  on	the  ground  that  it  violates	 any
fundamental rights, or on the ground that Parliament was not
competent  to pass it or on the ground that it is in  breach
of any provision of the Constitution.  On the other hand  we
find that when a Bill for the amendment of the	Constitution
is  passed  by	requisite majority and assented	 to  by	 the
President,  the	 Constitution  itself  ,declares  that	 the
Constitution  shall  stand amended in  accordance  with	 the
terms  of  the	Bill.  Thereafter what	courts	can  see  is
whether	 the  procedure	 provided  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_479">Art.  368</a>  has	been
followed,  for if that is not done, the Constitution  cannot
stand amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill.	 But
if the procedure has been followed, the Constitution  stands
amended,  and there is no question of testing the  amendment
of  the Constitution thereafter on the anvil of	 fundamental
rights	or  in	any other way as in  the  case	of  ordinary
legislation.  In view of an this we have no
doubt that- even though. by accident the procedure  provided
in  the Constitution for amendment thereof is very  akin  to
the  procedure for passing ordinary legislation,  the  power
contained  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_480">Art. 368</a> is still  not  ordinary	 legislative
power  but  constituent power for the  specific	 purpose  of
amendment of the Constitution; and it is the quality of that
power which determines the nature of what emerges after	 the
procedure  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_481">Art.  368</a> has been  followed  and  what	thus
emerges	 is  not ordinary legislation  but  fundamental	 law
which  cannot be tested,. for example, under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_482">Art.  13(2)</a>  of
the  Constitution  or  under  any  other  provision  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">833</span>
<p id="p_248">We  may briefly refer to an argument on behalf of the  Union
of  India that the amending power contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_483">Art.  368</a>  is
same sovereign power which was possessed by the	 Constituent
Assembly  when it made the Constitution and therefore it  is
not subject to any fetters of any kind.	 We do not think  it
necessary  to enter into the academic question as  to  where
sovereignty re-sides and whether legal sovereignty is in the
people and political. sovereignty in the body which has	 the
power to amend the Constitution and vice versa.	 In our view
the words of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_484">Art. 368</a> clearly confer the power to amend	 the
Constitution  and also provide the procedure for  doing	 so,
and  that  in  our  opinion is enough  for  the	 purpose  of
deciding whether the Seventeenth Amendment is valid or	not.
Further as we have already stated, the power conferred under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_485">Art. 368</a> is constituent power to change the fundamental	 law
i.e.  the Constitution, and is distinct and  different	from
the  ordinary legislative power conferred on  Parliament  by
various	 other provisions in the Constitution.	So  long  as
this  distinction is kept in mind Parliament would have	 the
power  under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_486">Art. 368</a> to amend the  Constitution  and	what
Parliament  does under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_487">Art. 368</a> is not	ordinary  law-making
which is subject to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_488">Art. 13 (2)</a> or any other Article of	 the
Constitution.  What is the extent of the power conferred  on
Parliament   and  whether  there  are  any  limitations	  on
it--express  or implied-will be considered by us  presently.
But we have no doubt, without entering into the question  of
sovereignty  and  of  whether  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_489">Art.  368</a>  confers  the	same
sovereign  power on Parliament as the  Constituent  Assembly
had when framing the Constitution, that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_490">Art. 368</a> does confer
power  on  Parliament  subject	to  the	 procedure  provided
therein for amendment of any provision of-the Constitution..
This  brings  us  to  the scope	 and  extent  of  the  power
conferred,  for amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_491">Art. 368.</a>  It is urged	that
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_492">Art.  368</a>  only	 gives	power  to  amend  the  Constitution.
Recourse  is  had  on  behalf  of  the	petitioners  to	 the
dictionary  meaning  of the word, "amendment".	It  is	said
that  amendment implies and means improvement in detail	 and
cannot	take  in  any change in the basic  features  of	 the
Constitution.  Reference in this connection may be made	 to-
the  following	meaning of the word "'amend" in	 the  Oxford
English Dictionary, namely, "to make professed	improvements
in  a,	measure	 before Parliament; formally,  to  after  in
detail, though practically it may be to alter its principle,
so  as	to  thwart ". This meaning lit	any  rate  does	 not
support	 the case of the petitioners that  amendment  merely
means  such change as results in improvement in detail.	  It
shows  that  in-law  though amendment  MAY  professedly,  be
intended to make- improvements and to alter only in  detail,
in  reality, it may make a radical change in  the  provision
which is amended.  In any case, as was pointed out in Sajjan
Singh's	 case(1)  the word "amend" or "amendment"'  is	well
under-
</p><p id="p_249">(1)  [1965] 1 S.C.R. 933.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">834</span>
<p id="p_250">stood  in law and will certainly include any change  whether
by  way	 of  addition  or  alteration  or  deletion  of	 any
provision in the Constitution.	This is no reason to suppose
that  when  the word.  "amendment" of the  Constitution	 was
being  used  in	 <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_493">Art. 368</a>, the intention  was  to  give	 any
meaning	 less than what we have stated above.  To  say	that
"amendment"  in	 law only means a change 'which	 results  in
improvement  would make amendments impossible, for what-  is
improvement  of an existing law is a matter of	opinion	 and
what,	for  example,  the  legislature	 may   consider	  an
improvement  may  not  be so considered by  others.   It  is
therefore  in  our opinion impossible to  introduce  in	 the
concept	 of  amendment	as  used in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_494">Art.  368</a>  any  idea  of
improvement  as	 to details of the Constitution.   The	word
"amendment"  used  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_495">Art. 368</a> must therefore be  given	 its
full  meaning  as  used	 in law	 and  that  .means  that  by
amendment  an existing Constitution or law can	be   changed
and this change can take the form either of addition to	 the
existing  provisions, or alteration of	existing  provisions
and  their  substitution by others or  deletion	 of  certain
provisions.  altogether.  In this connection  reference	 has
been  made-to  contrast	 certain  other	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution,  where, for example the word "amend" has	been
followed  by such words as "by way of addition, variance  or
repeal" (see Sixth Schedule, paragraph 2-1) and more or less
similar	 expressions in other Articles,of the  Constitution.
it is very difficult to say fact, that no such words  appear
in Art. make any difference, for the meaning of the word why
this  was  done.   But	the  368  does	not  in	 our,	mind
"amendmend"  in law is clearly as indicated above by us	 and
the  presence or sense, of explanatory words of	 the  nature
indicated above do not in our opinion make any difference.
The  question whether the power of amendment given  by	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_496">Art.
368</a>  also 'includes the power to abrogate  the	Constitution
completely and to replace it by an entire new  Constitution,
does  not  really  arise  in  the  present  case,  for	 the
Seventeenth  Amendment has not done any such thing and	need
not be considered.  It is enough to say that it may be	open
to doubt whether the power of amendment	  contained in	<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_497">Art.
568</a> goes to the extent of completely abrogating the  present
Constitution and substituting it by an entirely new    one.
But short of that, we are of opinion that the power to amend
includes      the  power  to  add  any	provision   to	 the
Constitution.  to  alter any  provision and  substitute	 any
other  provision in its place and to delete  any  provision.
The Seventeenth Amendment is merely in exercise of the power
of amendment a indicated above and cannot be struck down  on
the  ground  that  it goes beyond  the	power  conferred  on
Parliament to amend the Constitution by <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_498">Art. 368.</a>
The next question that arises is whether there is any  limi-
tation on the power of amendment as explained by us above.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">835</span>
<p id="p_251">Limitations may be of two kinds, namely, express or implied.
So far as express limitations are concerned, there are	none
such in' <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_499">Art. 368.</a>  When it speaks of the "amendment of this
Constitution it obviously and clearly refers to amendment of
any provision thereof, including the provisions contained in
Part III relating to fundamental rights.  Whether <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_500">Art. 13(2)</a>
is  an express limitation on the power of amendment will  be
considered  by us law, but so far as, <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_501">Art. 368</a> is  concerned
there  are  no	limitation  whatsoever	in  the	 matter	  of
substance  on  the amending power and any provision  of	 the
Constitution,  be it in Part III and any other Part, can  be
amended under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_502">Art. 368.</a>
</p><p id="p_252">The  next question is whether there are any implied  limita-
tions  on the power of amendment contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_503">Art. 368</a>,	 and
this  Wags us to the argument that there are  certain  basic
features of the Constitution which cannot be amended at	 all
and there is an implied limitation on the power of amendment
contained  in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_504">Art. 5-68</a> so far as these basic  features	 are
concerned.   We	 may in this connection refer  to  the	view
prevailing  amongst jurists in the United States of  America
as  to whether there are any plied limitations on the  power
of amendment contained in Art.	V of the U.S.  Constitution.
There are two lines of thought in this matter in the  United
States.	 Some jurists take the, view that there are  certain
implied limitations on the power to amend contained in	Art.
V  of  the  U.S. Constitution.	These are said	to  be	with
respect	  to  certain basic features, like,  the  republican
character of Government, the federal structure etc.  On	 the
other  hand,  it is  that the more  prevalent  view  amongst
jurists	 in the United States is that there are	 no  implied
limitations on the scope of the amending power in Art.	V of
the U.S. Constitution.	Willis on the Constitutional Law  of
the  United  States  of	 America  (1936-Edition	 says	that
probably  the  correct position is that the  amending  power
embraces  everything;  in  other words there  are  no  legal
limitations whatever on the power of amendment, except	what
is expressly provided, in Art.	V : (see- discussion on	 pp.
1.22   to  127).   Even	 with  respect	to   these   express
limitations,  Munro in The Government of the  United  States
(Fifth	Edition)  at  p. 77 says  that	even  these  express
limitations  can be removed and one of the ways of doing  so
is "to remove, the exception by a preliminary amendment	 and
thus  clear  the  way for further action".   Besides,  as  a
matter of fact there is no decision of the Supreme Court  of
the United States holding that there are implied limitations
on  the power of amendment contained in Art.  V of the	U.S.
Constitution  and all amendments so far made in	 the  United
States	have been upheld by the Supreme Court there  in	 the
few  cases  that  have	been taken  to-it  for	testing	 the
validity of the amendments.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">836</span>
<p id="p_253">We  have  given careful consideration to the  argument	that
certain basic features of our Constitution cannot be amended
under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_505">Art.  368</a> and have come to, the	conclusion  that  no
limitations  can be and should be implied upon the power  of
amendment  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_506">Art. 368.</a>  One. reason for coming  to	this
conclusion  is that if we were to accept that certain  basic
features  of the Constitution cannot be amended	 under	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_507">Art.
368</a>, it will lead to the position that any amendment made to
any Article of the Constitution would be liable to challenge
before courts on the ground that it amounts to amendment  of
a  basic  feature.  Parliament would thus never be  able  to
know  what  amendments it can make in the  Constitution	 and
what  it  cannot; for, till a complete	catalogue  of  basic
features  of  the  Constitution is available,  it  would  be
impossible  to	make any amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_508">Art. 368</a>  with	 any
certainty  that	 it would be upheld by courts.	If  such  an
implied limitation were to be put on the power of  amendment
contained  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_509">Art. 368</a>, it would only be the  courts  which
would  have the power to decide what are basic	features  of
the  Constitution and then to declare whether  a  particular
amendment  is  valid or not on the ground that it  amends  a
particular basic feature or not.  The .result would be	that
every  amendment  made in the Constitution would  provide  a
harvest	 of  legal wrangles so much so that  Parliament	 may
never  know what provisions can be amended and what  cannot.
The  power to amend being a constituent power cannot in	 our
opinion	 for  these reasons be held subject to	any  implied
limitations  thereon  on  the  ground  that  certain   basic
features of the Constitution cannot be amended.	 We fail  to
see  why if there was any intention to make any part of	 the
Constitution unamendable, the Constituent Assembly failed to
indicate  it  expressly in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_510">Art. 368.</a>  If, for  example,	 the
Constitution-makers  intended  certain	provisions  in	 the
Constitution,  and  Part  III  in  particular,	to  be	 not
amendable, we can see no reason why it was not so stated  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_511">Art. 368.</a>  On the clear words of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_512">Art. 368</a> which provides for
amendment  of  the Constitution which  means  any  provision
thereof,. we cannot infer an implied limitation on the power
of  amendment of any provision of the Constitution',  be  it
basic  or  otherwise.  Our conclusion  is  that	 constituent
power, like that contained,in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_513">Art. 368</a>, can only be  subject
to  express limitations and not to any	implied	 limitations
so,far	as substance of the amendments are concerned and  in
the absence of anything in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_514">Art. 368</a> making any provision  of
the Constitution unamendable, it Must be held that the power
to.  amend  in	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_515">Art. .3 68</a> reaches every  provision  of	 the

Copious references were made during the course of  arguments
to debates in Parliament and it is urged that it is open  to
this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">837</span>
Court  to look into the debates in order to  interpret	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_517">Art.
368</a>  to find out the intention of the  Constitution  makers.
We  are of opinion that we cannot and should not  look	into
the  debates that took place in the Constituent Assembly  to
determine  the interpretation of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_518">Art. 368</a> and the scope	 and
extent	of  the	 provision contained  therein.	 It  may  be
conceded  that	historical background and perhaps  what	 was
accepted  or what was rejected by the  Constituent  Assembly
while  the Constitution was being framed, may be taken	into
account	 in  finding out the scope and extent of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_519">Art.	368.</a>
But we have no doubt that what was spoken in the debates  in
the  Constituent  Assembly cannot and should not  be  looked
into- in order to interpret <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_520">Art. 368.</a>  Craies on Statute Law
(Sixth	Edition) at p. 128 says that "it is not	 permissible
in discussing the meaning of an obscure enactment, to  refer
to 'parliamentary history' of a statute, in the sense of the
debates which took place in Parliament when the statute	 was
under  consideration", and supports his view with  reference
to a large number of English cases.  The same is the view in
Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, (11th Edition) p. 26.
Crawford on Statutory Construction (1940 Edition) at p.	 340
says  that  resort may not be had to  debates  to  ascertain
legislative Intent though historical background in which the
legislation   came   to	 be  passed,  can  be	taken	into
consideration-.

<a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_521">In  A. K. Gopalan v. the State of Madras</a>(3), Kania C.J.	 re-

in  order to determine the meaning of the provisions of	 the
Constitution in dispute in that case.
</p><p id="p_258">We are therefore of opinion that it is not possible to	read
the  speeches made in the Constituent Assembly in  order  to
interpret  An. 368 or to define its extent and scope and  to
determine what it,takes in and what it does not.  As to this
historical  facts..  namely, what was accepted or  what	 was
avoided in the Constituent Assembly in connection with	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_527">Art.
368</a>, it is enough to say that we have not been able to	find
any  help  from the material relating to this.	 There	were
proposals for restricting the power of amendment under	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_528">Art.
368</a> and making fundamental rights immune from and there were
counter proposals before the Constituent assembly for making
the  power, of amendment all embracing They were all  either
dropped or negatived and in the circumstanses are of no help
in determining the interpretation of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_529">Art. 368</a> which must  be
interpreted on the words thereof as they finally found place
in  the	 Constitution, and on those words we have  no  doubt
that  there  are no implied limitations of any kind  on	 the
power to amend given therein.
</p><p id="p_259">An argument is also raised that limitations on the power  to
amend  the Constitution can be found in the preamble to	 the
Constitution.	As to that we may refer only to in  re:	 the
Berubari  Union and Exchange of Enclaves(2) with respect  to
the  value  of	the preamble to	 the  Constitution  and	 its
importance   therein.	 It  was  observed  in	 that	case
unanimously by a Bench of nine judges that "although it	 may
be correct to describe the preamble as a key to the mind  of
the Constitution-makers, it form no part of the Constitution
and  cannot  be regarded as the source	of  any	 substantive
power which the body of the Constitution alone can confer on
the  Government	 ,  expressly or by  implication.   This  is
equally	 true to prohibitions and limitations".	  The  Court
there was considering whether the preamble could in any	 way
limit  the  power  of Parliament to cede  any  part  of	 the
national  teritory and held that it was not correct  to	 say
that "the preamble  in any way limit the power of Parliament
to  cede parts of the national territory".  On a parity,  of
reasoning  we  are  of	opinion	 that  the  preamble  cannot
prohibit  or  control  in  any way  or	impose	any  implied
prohibitions  or  limitations  oft Me  power  to  amend	 the
Constitution contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_530">Art. 368.</a>

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">       839</span>
<p id="p_261">This  brings  us to the question whether the word  "law"  in
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_531">Art.  13 (2)</a> includes an amendment of the Constitution,	 and
therefore  there  is an express provision in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_532">Art.  1  3	 (2)</a>
which at least limits the power of amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_533">Art. 3 68</a>
to  this  extent that by such amendment	 fundamental  rights
guaranteed by Part 111 cannot be taken away or abridged.  We
have already pointed out that in Sankari Prasad's case(1) as
well as Sajjan Singh's case(1) it has already been held,  in
one case unanimously and in the other by majority, that	 the
word  "law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_534">Art. 13(2)</a> does not include an  amendment  of
the  Constitution,  and it is the correctness of  this	view
which  is being imputed before this Bench, <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_535">Article 13</a> is  in
three  parts.	The first part lays down that "all  laws  in
force  in  the territory of India  immediately	 before	 the
commencement  of  this	Constitution, insofar  as  they	 are
inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the
extent	of  such  inconsistency,  be  void".   Further	 all
previous constitutional,provisions were repealed by <a href="/doc/493040/" id="a_536">Art. 395</a>
which provided that "'the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and
the  Government	 of  India  Act,  1935,	 together  with	 all
enactments amending or supplementing the latter Act, but not
including  the Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction	Act,
1949, are hereby repealed."' Thus it is clear that the	word
"law"  in <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_537">Art. 13(1)</a> does not include any law in the  nature
of  a  constitutional provision, for no	 such  law  remained
after the repeal'in <a href="/doc/493040/" id="a_538">Art. 395.</a>
</p><p id="p_262">Then comes the second part of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_539">Art. 13</a>, which says that State
shall  not  make any law which takes away  or  abridges	 the
rights	 conferred  by	this  Part  and	 any  law  made	  in
contravention  of  this clause shall, to the extent  of	 the
contravention,	be void".  The third part defines  the	word
"law"  for  the	 purpose  of  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_540">Art.  13;</a>	 the  definition  is
inclusive  and	not  exhaustive.   It  is  because  of	 the
definition in cl. (3-) of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_541">Art. 13</a> being inclusive that it is
urged  that  the  word	"law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_542">Art.  13  (2)</a>	includes  an
amendment  of the Constitution also.  Now we see  no  reason
why  if the word "law" in <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_543">Art. 13(1)</a> relating to  past	laws
does not include any constitutional provision the word "law"
in  cl. (2) would take in an amendment of the  Constitution,
for  it would be reasonable to the word "law"'in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_544">Art.  13(2)</a>
includes  an  amendment	 of  the 13.  But  apart  from	this
consideration, we are of opinion that the word "law" in	 Art
13(2) could never have been intended to take in an amendment
of  the Constitution.  What <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_545">Art. 13(2)</a> means is that  a	 law
made under the constitutional provisions would, be tested on
the  anvil  of	Part III and if it takes  away	or  abridges
rights conferred by Part III it would be void to the  extent
of the contraventions.	There are many Articles in the	Con-
stitution,  which  directly for making law  in	addition  to
Articles  245, 246, 248, etc. and the three  Lists  and-Aft.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">840</span>
<p id="p_264">prohibits  the	State  from  making  any  law  under   these
provisions.   We see no difficulty in the  circumstances  in
holding	 that <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_546">Art. 13 (2)</a> when it talks of the State  making
any  law,  refers  to  the law	made  under  the  provisions
contained in Ch.  I of Part XI of the Constitution beginning
with <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_547">Art. 245</a> and also other provisions already referred  to
earlier.  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_548">Article 246</a> provides that Parliament may make laws
for the whole or any part of the territory of India and	 the
legislature  of a State may make laws for the whole  or	 any
part of the State.  <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_549">Article 246(1)</a> gives exclusive power  to
Parliament to make laws with respect to subjects  enumerated
in  List  1. <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_550">Article 246(3)</a> gives exclusive power  to  State
legislatures to make laws with respect to List II.   <a href="/doc/375101/" id="a_551">Article
248(1)</a> gives exclusive power to Parliament to make laws with
respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent	List
or  the	 State List.  We are referring to  these  provisions
merely	to show that the various provisions in Chapter I  of
Part XI provide for making laws,and these laws are all	laws
which  are  made under the legislative	power  conferred  on
Parliament or on State legislatures under the  Constitution.
Therefore when in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_552">Art. 13( )</a> it is said that the State shall
not  make  any	law (State there  including  Parliament	 and
legislature  of each State), its meaning could only take  in
laws  made  by Parliament and State legislatures  under	 the
powers conferred under Chapter I of Part XI. and also  other
provisions  already  referred to earlier.  We  have  already
held that the power to amend the Constitution is to be found
in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_553">Art. 368</a> along with the procedure and that such power  is
not  to	 be  found  in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_554">Art. 248</a> read  item  97	of  List  I.
Therefore  an  amendment  of  the  Constitution	 is  not  an
ordinary law made under the powers conferred under Chapter I
of Part XI of the Constitution and cannot be subject to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_555">Art.
13(2)</a> where the word "law" must be read as meaning law	made
under  the  ordinary  legislative power.   We  have  already
referred  to a large number of Articles where Parliament  is
given the power to make law with respect to those  Articles.
So far as this power of Parliament is concerned it is  ordi-
nary  legislative power and it will certainly be subject  to
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_556">Art. 13 (2).</a>  But there can in our opinion be no doubt	that
when  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_557">Art.  13(2)</a> prohibits the State from  making  any	 law
which  takes away or abridges rights conferred by Part	III,
it is only referring to ordinary legislative power conferred
on  Parliament and legislatures of States and  cannot  halve
any reference to the constituent power for amendment of	 the
Constitution contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_558">Art. 368.</a>
</p><p id="p_265"> We  have  already  pointed out that there  are	 no  implied
limitative  on the power to amend under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_559">Art. 368</a> and  it  is
open  to Parliament under that Article to amend any part  of
the Constitution, including Part M. It is worth	 remembering
that  a whole Part XX is devoted by the	 Constitution-makers
to the subject of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">841</span>
amendment  of the Constitution.	 If it was  their  intention
that  Part  III of the Constitution will not  be  liable  to
amendment  by  way of abridgement or  abrogation  under	 the
amending power contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_560">Art. 368</a> we see no reason why an
express	 provision to that effect was not made in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_561">Art.	368.</a>
We  cannot see what prevented the Constituent Assembly	from
making	that clear by an express provision in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_562">Art. 368.</a>	  It
is however said that it was not necessary to say so in	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_563">Art.
368</a>,  because the provision was already made in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_564">Art.  13(2).</a>
We  are	 unable to accept this contention, for	we  have  no
doubt  that <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_565">Art. 13(2</a>), when it refers to making of laws  is
only referring to the ordinary legislative power and not  to
the constituent power which results in amendment of the Con-
stitution.    In   any	case  it  seems	  to   us   somewhat
contradictory that in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_566">Art. 368</a> power should have been  given
to  amend  any	provision of the  Constitution	without	 any
limitations  but indirectly that power is limited  by  using
words  of doubtful import in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_567">Art. 13(2).</a>  It  is  remarkable
that  in  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_568">Art.	13(2)</a> there is	no  express  provision	that
amendment  of  the Constitution, under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_569">Art.  368</a>,  would  be
subject	 thereto.  It seems strange indeed that	 no  express
provision  was	made in Part XX in this matter and  even  in
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_570">Art. 13(2)</a> no express provision is made to this effect,	 and
in both places the matter is left in a state of uncertainty.
It is also remarkable that in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_571">Art. 368</a> the word "law", which
we   find  so  often  used  in	so  many  Articles  of	 the
Constitution   is   conspicuously   avoided,   and   it	  is
specifically provided that after the procedure has been gone
through	 the Constitution shall stand amended in  accordance
with  the terms of the Bill.  This language of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_572">Art.  368</a>  is
very  significant and clearly makes a distinction between  a
constitutional	Amendment and an ordinary law passed  as  an
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_573">Amending Act</a>.  The validity of a law has to be determined at
the time when the Bill actually matures into an Act and	 not
at  the	 stage while it is still a Bill.  The  provision  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_574">Art.  368</a>  has	the effect that when  a	 Bill  amending	 the
Constitution  receives	the  assent of	the  President,	 the
Constitution stands amended in accordance with the terms  of
the Bill.  The Constitution thus stands amended in terms  of
the  Bill  if  the  Bill has  been  introduced,	 passed	 and
assented  to  by  the  President  in  accordance  with	 the
procedure  laid down in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_575">Art. 368</a> and not as a result of	 the
Bill becoming an <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_576">Amendment Act</a> introducing amendment in	 the
Constitution.	The  provision that the	 Constitution  shall
stand amended in terms of the Bill was thus clearly intended
to  indicate that the amendment of the Constitution  is	 not
dependent on the Bill being treated as a law or an Act	duly
passed	by Parliament.	Thus it is clear that by  indicating
that the Constitution is to stand amended in accordance with
the  terms of the Bill, <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_577">Art. 368</a> clearly envisages that	 the
power of amendment of the Constitution stands on an entirely
different footing from an ordinary law made by Parliament in
exercise of its legislative power.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">842</span>
<p id="p_266">If  We keep in mind this difference, between  constitutional
amendment or constitutional law and an ordinary amending Act
or law, it should not be difficult to hold that when Art  13
(2),  speaks of the St-ate making a law, it is referring  to
ordinary law made under the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_578">Art. 245</a> etc
read  with  various  Lists and	various	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution where express provision to that effect has been
made   and  is	not  referring	to  the	 amendment  of	 the
Constitution  which  is made under the	'constituent  power.
Once it is held that the power to amend is found in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_579">Art. 368</a>
and is not to be found in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_580">Art. 248</a> read with item 97 of List
I,  it must follow that the power to amend the	Constitution
under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_581">Art.  368</a> is a different power  (namely,	 constituent
power)	and when <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_582">Art. 13 (2)</a> speaks of making 'law,  it	 can
only  refer  to making ordinary law,  particularly  when  we
compare	 the words of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_583">Art. 13 (2) (namely</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_584">, the	State  shall
not  make any law)</a> and the words of Arts. 245, 248, and	 250
(which	 all   speak  of  Parliament  making   law,   State-
legislatures making law, and so on).
</p><p id="p_267">Lastly,	 as  the power to amend is in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_585">Art. 368</a>	and  on	 the
words,	as  they  stand	 in  that  Article,  that  power  is
unfettered  and includes the power to amend Part III, it  is
strange	 that  that power should be limited  by	 putting  an
interpretation on the word "law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_586">Art. 13(2</a>), which  would
include	 constitutional	 law  also.   There  is	 nothing  to
suggest	 this even in the inclusive definition of the  words
"law"  and  "laws in force" in <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_587">Art. 13(3).</a>  Besides,  it  is
conceded  on behalf of the petitioners that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_588">Art.  368</a>  gives
power to amend Part 111, but that power is only to amend one
way,  namely,  towards enlargement of the  rights  contained
therein,  and not the other way, namely, for,  abridging  or
taking	away  the rights contained therein.  W.-,  must	 say
that  it  would	 require  a  very  clear  provision  in	 the
Constitution  to  read the power to amend  the	Constitution
relating  to Part III in this manner.  We cannot  find	that
clear  provision in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_589">Art. 1 3 (2).</a>  We repeat that  when	 the
Constituent  Assembly was taking the trouble of providing  a
whole  Part for amendment of the Constitution and  when	 the
words  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_590">Art.	 368</a> clearly give the  power  to  amend	 the
Constitution  and are subject to no implied limitations	 and
contain no express limitations, it is strange indeed that it
should	have  omitted to provide in that very  Article	that
Part III is not liable to amendment thereunder.	 In any case
if the power of amendment conferred by the words of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_591">Art. 368</a>
is unfettered, we must avoid any inconsistency between	that
power and the provision contained in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_592">Art. 13 (2).</a>  We  avoid
that  in  keeping with the unfettered power in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_593">Art.  368</a>  by
reading the word "law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_594">Art. 13 (2)</a> as meaning law  passed
under: ordinary legislative power and thus not including  an
amendment of the Constitution therein.	The words in  Art.II
(2)  are  in our opinion not specific and clear'  enough  to
take in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">843</span>
the  power of amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_595">Art. 368</a> and must be  confined
only to the power of ordinary law-making contained in  Arts.
245 etc., and other provisions of the Constitution read with
various Lists.	We have therefore no hesitation in  agreeing
with  the view taken in Sankari Prasad's case(1)  which	 was
upheld by the majority in Sajjan Singh's case(2).
The  next argument is that action under the proviso to	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_596">Art.
368</a>  is necessary as the Seventeenth Amendment	affects	 the
power  of the High Court contained in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_597">Art. 226.</a>	 It is	said
that  by  including various Acts in the Ninth  Schedule	 and
making	them  immune  from challenge  under  the  provisions
contained  in  Part III, the power of the High	Court  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_598">Art.  226</a>  is  affected inasmuch as the	 High  Court  cannot
strike	down any of the Acts included in the Ninth  Schedule
on  the	 ground that they take away or	abridge	 the  rights
conferred by Part III.	So it is said that there has been  a
change in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_599">Art. 226</a> and it was necessary that the Seventeenth
Amendment  should have been ratified by more than  half	 the
States under the proviso.  A similar argument was raised  in
Sankari	 Prasad's case(1) and was turned  down	unanimously.
The same argument was again raised in Sajjan Singh's case(2)
and  was  also turned down.  Now  ratification	is  required
under the proviso if the amendment seeks to make any  change
in  various  provisions	 mentioned  therein  and  one	such
provision  is <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_600">Art. 226.</a>	 The question therefore	 is  whether
the   Seventeenth Amendment makes any change in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_601">Art. 226</a> and
whether	 this change has to be a direct change in the  words
of  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_602">Art.  226</a> or whether merely because there  may  be	some
effect	by the Seventeenth Amendment on the, content of	 the
power in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_603">Art. 226</a> it will amount to change in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_604">Art. 226.</a>	  We
are  of opinion that when the proviso lays down	 that  there
must  be  ratification	when  there is	any  change  in	 the
entrenched  provisions,	  including <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_605">Art. 226</a>, it means	that
there  must be actual change in the terms of  the  provision
concerned.   If	 there is no actual change directly  in	 the
entrenched  provision, no ratification is required, even  if
any amendment of any other provision of the Constitution may
have  some  effect indirectly on the  entrenched  provisions
mentioned in the proviso.  But it is urged that there may be
such  a	 change in some other provision as  would  seriously
affect	 an  entrenched	 provision,  and  in  such  a	case
ratification  should be necessary.  This argument  was	also
dealt  with  'in  the majority judgment	 in  Sajjan  Singh's
case(2) where the doctrine of pith and substance was applied
and  it	 was  held that where the  amendment  in  any  other
Article so affects the entrenched Article as to amount to an
amendment therein, then ratification may be necessary,	even
though	the entrenched Article may not be directly  touched.
Perhaps the use of the doctrine of pith and substance

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">844</span>
<p id="p_269">in  such  a case is not quite apt.  But what  was  meant  in
Sajjan	Singh's	 case(1)  was  that  if	 there	is  such  an
amendment  of an unentrenched Article that it will  directly
affect	an  entrenched	Article	 and  necessitate  a  change
therein, then recourse must be had to ratification under the
proviso.   We may illustrate this by two examples.   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_606">Article
226</a>  lays  down inter alia that the High  Court	 shall	have
power  to  issue  writs for the enforcement of	any  of	 the
rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose.	 Now
assume	that Part III is completely deleted by amendment  of
the Constitution.  If that takes place, it will	 necessitate
an amendment of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_607">Art. 226</a> also and deletion therefrom of	 the
words "for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by
Part III".  We have no doubt that if such a contingency ever
happens and Part III is completely deleted, Parliament	will
amend  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_608">Art. 226</a> also and that will necessitate	ratification
under  the proviso.  But suppose Parliament  merely  deletes
Part  III  and	does not make  the  necessary  consequential
amendment in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_609">Art. 226</a>, it can then be said that deletion  of
Part III necessitates change in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_610">Art. 226</a> also, and therefore
in  such  a  case ratification	is  necessary,	even  though
Parliament  may not have in fact provided for  amendment  of
Art 226.
</p><p id="p_270">Take  another example.	<a href="/doc/887242/" id="a_611">Article 54</a> is an entrenched  Article
and provides for the election of the President.	 So is	<a href="/doc/1164414/" id="a_612">Art.
55</a>  which provides for the manner of election.	 <a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_613">Article  52</a>
which  lays down that there shall be a President is  on	 the
other hand not an entrenched Article.  It is said that	<a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_614">Art.
52</a>  may be altered and something else may be substituted  in
its  place and that would not require ratification in  terms
as <a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_615">Art. 52</a> is not among the entrenched Articles.  But we are
of opinion that if Parliament amends <a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_616">Art. 52</a>, it is bound to
make consequential amendments in Arts. 54 and 55 which	deal
with  the election of the President and the  manner  thereof
and  if it is so the entire amendment must be submitted	 for
ratification.  But suppose Parliament merely amends <a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_617">Art.  52</a>
and makes no change in Arts. 54 and 55 (a supposition  which
is  impossible to visualise).  In that case it would in	 our
opinion	 be right to hold that <a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_618">Art. 52</a> could not be  altered
by abolition of the office of the President without necessi-
tating	a  change in Arts. 54 and 55 and in such a  case  if
<a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_619">Art.  52</a>  alone	 is altered by Parliament,  to	abolish	 the
office of President, it will require ratification.
These two examples will show where alteration or deletion of
an  unentrenched Article would necessitate amendment  of  an
entrenched  Article, and in such a case if Parliament  takes
the  incredible	 course of amending  only  the	unentrenched
Article and not amending the entrenched Article, courts	 can
say that ratifi-
</p><p id="p_271">(1)  [1965] 1 S.C.R. 933.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">845</span>
<p id="p_272">cation	is  necessary  even for	 amending  the	unentrenched
Article,  for  it  directly necessitates,  a  change  in  an
entrenched  Article.   But short of that we are	 of  opinion
that  merely because there is some effect indirectly  on  an
entrenched  Article by amendment of an unentrenched  Article
it  is	not necessary that there should be  ratification  in
such circumstances also.
</p><p id="p_273">Besides,  let us consider what would happen if the  argument
on  behalf of the petitioners is accepted that	ratification
is  necessary whenever there is even indirect effect  on  an
entrenched  Article  by amending  an  unentrenched  Article.
Take  the  case of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_620">Art. 226</a> itself.. It gives power  to	 the
High  Court not only to issue writs for the  enforcement  of
fundamental rights but to issue them for any other  purpose.
Writs  have  thus been issued by High Courts  for  enforcing
other  rights  conferred by ordinary laws as well  as  under
other  provisions  of the Constitution, like Arts.  301	 and
</p><p id="p_274">311.   On this argument if any change is made in  Arts.	 301
and  311  there	 is bound to be an effect on  <a href="/doc/37402/" id="a_621">Art.  216</a>	 and
therefore ratification would be necessary, even though	both
Arts.  301  and	 311  are not  entrenched  in  the  proviso.
Further,  take an ordinary law which confers certain  rights
and it is amended and those rights are taken away.   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_622">Article
226</a>  would be clearly affected.	 Before the amendment  those
rights	may  be enforced through <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_623">Art. 226</a>  while  after	 the
amendment  the	rights having disappeared there	 can  be  no
enforcement  thereof.  Therefore, on this argument  even  if
there is amendment of ordinary law there would be an  effect
on <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_624">Art. 226</a> and it must therefore be amended every time even
when ordinary law is changed and the entire procedure  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_625">Art.  368</a> must be gone through including ratification  under
the  proviso.  It is however said that when ordinary law  is
amended, rights disappear and therefore there is no question
of  enforcement thereof; if that is correct with respect  to
ordinary  law,	it is in our opinion  equally  correct	with
respect to the amendment of an unentrenched provision of the
Constitution.  The answer given in Sankari Prasad's  case(1)
to this argument was that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_626">Art. 226</a> remained just the same as
it  was before, and only a certain class of cases  had	been
excluded  from the purview of Part III and the courts  could
no longer interfere, not because their powers were curtailed
in  any manner or to any extent, but because there would  be
no  occasion thereafter for the exercise of their  power  in
such  cases.  We respectfully agree with these	observations
and  are  of  opinion  that merely  because  there  is	some
indirect  effect on <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_627">Art. 226</a> it was not necessary  that	 the
Seventeenth Amendment should have been ratified by more than
one half of the States.	 It is only in the extreme case, the
examples of which we have given above, that an amendment  of
an  unentrenched  Article without  amendment  of  entrenched
<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_628">Article
(1)  [1952]</a> S.C.R. 89.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">846</span>
<p id="p_275">might be had for want of ratification, and this is what	 was
intended-  by  the  majority  judgment	in  Sajjan   Singh's
case(1), when it applied the doctrine of pith and  substance
in  these circumstances.  The argument that ratification  is
necessary  as <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_629">Art. 226</a> is indirectly affected has  therefore
no  force and must be rejected.	 This is equally  true	with
respect to the power of this Court under Arts. 132 and 136.
Then  it  is  urged  that  <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_630">Art.	 245</a>  is  enlarged  by	 the
Seventeenth  Amendment	inasmuch as State  legislatures	 and
Parliament  were freed from the control of Part III  in	 the
matter	of  certain laws affecting,  for  example.  ryotwari
lands,	and therefore as <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_631">Art. 245</a> is an	 entrenched  Article
there should have been ratification under the proviso.	This
argument in our opinion is of the same type as the  argument
with respect to the effect on <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_632">Art. 226</a> and our answer is the
same, namely, that there is no direct effect on <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_633">Art. 245</a>  by
the  amendment	and the indirect effect, if.-any,  does	 not
require	 that  there should have been  ratification  in	 the
present case.
</p><p id="p_276">It is then urged that ratification is necessary as <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_634">Art. 31-B</a>
deals  with  State legislation and in  any  case  Parliament
cannot make, any law with respect to Acts which were put  in
the Ninth Schedule and therefore Parliament could not  amend
the  Constitution  in  the manner in which it  was  done  by
making	additions in the  Ninth Schedule, both for  want  of
ratification  and for want of legislative  competence.	 The
answer	to  this  argument was	given  in  Sahkari  Prasad's
case(2) and it was observed there that-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	      "<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_635">Article	31-A</a> and <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_636">31-B</a> really seek to save  a
	      certain  class of laws and  certain  specified
	      laws   already   passed  from   the   combined
	      operation of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_637">Art. 13</a> read with other  relevant
	      Articles of Part III.  The new Articles  being
	      thus   essentially  amendments  of  the	Con-
	      stitution,   Parliament  had  the	  power	  of
	      enacting them.  That laws thus saved relate to
	      matters covered by List II does not in any way
	      affect   the  position.	It  was	 said	that
	      Parliament  could not validate a law which  it
	      had no power to enact.  The proposition  holds
	      good  where.  the	 validity  of  the  impugned
	      provision turns on whether the subject matter,
	      falls  within or without the  jurisdiction  of
	      the legislature which passed it.. But to	make
	      a	 law  which  contravenes  the  Constitution,
	      constitutionally	 valid	 is  a	 matter	  of
	      constitutional amendment and as such it  falls
	      within the exclusive power of Parliament."

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">847</span>
<p id="p_279">We   respectfully  agree  with	these  observations.	They
succinctly  put the legal and constitutional  position	with
respect to the 'validity of Arts, 3 1 A and 3 1 B.  It seems
to  us	that  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_638">Art.  3 1</a> B in  particular  is  a	 legislative
drafting  device  which	 compendiously	puts  in  one  place
amendments  which  would otherwise have been  added  to	 the
Constitution  under various Articles in Part III.  The	laws
in the Ninth Schedule have by the device of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_639">Art. 3 1</a> B	been
excepted  from	the various provisions in Part	]III,  which
affected  them	and  this exception could only	be  made  by
Parliament.   The  infirmity in the Arts put  in  the  Ninth
Schedule was apprehended to be a constitutional infirmity on
the ground that those laws might take away or abridge rights
conferred by Part HI. Such a constitutional infirmity  could
not be cured by State legislatures in any way and could only
be  cured by Parliament by constitutional  amendment.	What
Parliament  in	fact did by including various  Acts  in	 the
Ninth Schedule read with <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_640">Art. 3 1</a> B was to amend the various
provisions in Part III, which affected these Acts by  making
them  an  exception to those provisions in Part	 III.	This
could only be done by Parliament under the constituent power
it  had	 under	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_641">Art. 368</a> and there was no  question  of	 the
application  of the proviso in such a case,  for  Parliament
was amending Part III only with respect to these laws.	 The
laws  had already been passed by State legislatures  and  it
was their constitutional infirmity, if any, which was  being
cured  by  the device adopted in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_642">Art. 3 1</a> B  read  with	 the
Ninth  Schedule, the amendment 'being only of  the  relevant
provisions  of Part III which was compendiously put  in	 one
place  in  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_643">Art. 3 1</a> B.	Parliament could alone do  it  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_644">Art.  368</a>  and there was no necessity for  any	ratification
under  the  proviso,  for  amendment  of  Part	III  is	 not
entrenched in the proviso.
</p><p id="p_280">Nor  is	 there	any force in the  argument  that  Parliament
could' not validate those laws by curing the  constitutional
infirmity  because they dealt with land which is in List  11
of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution over which State
Legislatures have exclusive legislative power.	The laws had
already	 been  passed  by  State  legislatures	under  their
exclusive  powers;  what has been done	by  the	 Seventeenth
Amendment is to cure the constitutional' infirmity, if	any,
in  these laws in relation to Part III.	 That could only  be
done  by  Parliament  and in so	 doing	Parliament  was	 not
encroaching on the exclusive legislative power of the State.
The States had already passed the laws and all that was done
by the Seventeenth Amendment was to cure any  constitutional
infirmity  in  the  laws  by including	them  in  the  Ninth
Schedule read with <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_645">Art. 31-B.</a>  We must therefore reject	 the
argument    that   the	 Seventeenth   Amendment    required
ratification  because  laws put in the Ninth  Schedule	were
State  law-,.  We must equally reject the argument  that  as
these laws dealt with land, which is in the-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">848</span>
<p id="p_281">exclusive legislative power of State legislature, Parliament
could  not  cure the constitutional infirmity,	if  any,  in
these laws by putting them in the Ninth Schedule.
We now come to what may be called the argument of fear.	  It
is  urged that if <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_646">Art. 368</a> confers complete power  to  amend
each and every provision of the Constitution as we have held
that  it does-frightful consequences will follow on such  an
interpretation.	 If Parliament is clothed with such a  power
to  amend  the Constitution it may proceed to do  away	with
fundamental  rights  altogether,  it  may  abolish   elected
legislatures, it may change the present form of	 Government,
it  may	 do  away with the federal structure  and  create  a
unitary	 state	instead, and so on. It is  therefore  argued
that we should give a limited interpretation to the power of
amendment  contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_647">Art. 368</a>, as otherwise we  shall  be
giving	power  to  Parliament to  destroy  the	Constitution
itself.
</p><p id="p_282">This  argument is really a political argument and cannot  be
taken into account in interpreting <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_648">Art. 368</a> when its meaning
to our mind is clear.  But as the argument was urged with  a
good deal of force on behalf of the petitioners and was	 met
with  equal force on behalf of the Union and the States,  we
propose	 to  deal with it briefly.  Now,  if  this  argument
means  that  Parliament	 may abuse its	power  of  amendment
conferred  by  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_649">Art. 368</a>, all that need be said in  reply  is
that  mere  possibility	 of abuse cannot  result  in  courts
withholding the power if the Constitution grants it.  It  is
well-settled so far as ordinary laws are concerned that mere
possibility of abuse will not induce courts to hold that the
power  is  not	there, if the law is  valid  and  its  terms
clearly confer the power.  The same principle in our opinion
applies	 to the Constitution.  If the Constitution  gives  a
certain	 power and its terms are clear, there is  no  reason
why  that  power  should  be  withheld	simply	because	  of
possibility  of	 abuse.	 If we may say	so,  possibility  of
abuse of any power granted to any authority is always there;
and if possibility of abuse is a reason for withholding	 the
power,	no  power  whatever can ever  be  conferred  on	 any
authority,  be it "executive, legislative or even  judicial.
Therefore,  the	 so-called fear of  frightful  consequences,
which  has  been urged on behalf of the Petitioners  (if  we
hold, as we do, that the power to amend the Constitution  is
unfettered  by	any implied limitations), is no	 ground	 for
withholding the power, for we have no reason to suppose that
Parliament  on whom such power is ,conferred will abuse	 it.
Further	 even  if  it abuses  the  power  of  constitutional
amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_650">Art. 368</a> the check in such circumstances  is
not  in	 courts but is in the people who  elect	 members  of
Parliament.  The argument for giving a limited
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">849</span>
meaning	 to  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_651">Art. 368</a> because of possibility of	 abuse	must
therefore be rejected.
</p><p id="p_283">The other aspect of this argument of fear is that we  should
not  make  the Constitution too flexible so that it  may  be
open   to   the	 requisite  majority  with   the   requisite
ratification   to  make	 changes  too  frequently   in	 the
Constitution.	It  is	said that  the	Constitution  is  an
organic document for the governance of the country and it is
expected  to  endure and give stability to  the	 institution
which it provides.  That is undoubtedly so and this is. very
true  of a written federal Constitution.  But a perusal	 of.
various	 Constitutions	of the world shows  that  there	 are
usually provisions for amendment of the Constitution in	 the
Constitution itself.  This power to amend a Constitution may
be rigid or flexible in varying degrees.  Jurists have	felt
that  where the power to amend the Constitution is made	 too
rigid  and the people outgrow a particular Constitution	 and
feel  that it should be amended but cannot do so because  of
the   rigidity	 of  the  Constitution,	  they	 break	 the
Constitution,  and this breaking is more often than  not  by
violent revolution.  It is admitted by even those writers on
the  United  States Constitution who are of  the  view	that
there are certain basic features which cannot be amended and
who would thus make the U. S. Constitution even more  rigid'
than it is; that howsoever rigid the Constitution may be its
rigidity  will not stop the people from breaking it if	they
have  outgrown it and this breaking is, generally  speaking,
by violent revolution.	So, making our Constitution rigid by
putting the interpretation which the petitioners want us  to
put on it will not stop the frightfulness which is  conjured
up before us on behalf of the petitioners.  If anything,  an
interpretation which will make our Constitution rigid in the
manner	in which the petitioner want the amending  power  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_652">Art.  368</a> to be interpreted will make a violent	 revolution,
followed  by  frightfulness  of which  the  petitioners	 are
afraid,	 a nearer possibility than an  interpretation  which
will make it flexible.
</p><p id="p_284">It  is clear that our Constitution-makers wanted  to  avoid'
making the Constitution too rigid.  It is equally clear that
they  did not want to make an amendment of the	Constitution
too easy.  They preferred an intermediate course which would
make,the Constitution flexible and would still not allow  it
to be amended too easily.  That is why <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_653">Art. 368</a> provides for
special	 majorities  of the two Houses for  the	 purpose  of
amendment of the Constitution.	Besides it also provides for
ratification  by  more	than  half the	States	in  case  of
entrenched  Provisions	in the proviso.	  Subject  to  these
limitations,  the  Constitution has  been,  made  moderately
flexible  to  allow  any change when the  people  feel	that
change is necessary.  The necessity for special majorities
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">850</span>
in   each   House  separately  and,   the   necessity	for,
ratification  by more than half the States in certain  cases
appear to us to be sufficient safeguards to prevent too easy
change in the Constitution without making it too rigid.	 But
it  is said that, in the last sixteen Years, a large  number
of  amendments have been made to the constitution  and	that
shows that the power to amend is much too easy and should be
restricted   by	 judicial  interpretation.   Now,   judicial
interpretation	cannot restrict the power on the basis of  a
political  argument.  It has to interpret  the	Constitution
and   finds  it	 on  the  basis	 of   well-known,canons	  of
construction,and on the terms of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_654">Art. 368</a> in particular.  If
on those terms it is clear    we  think it is-that power  to
amend is subject to no limitations except   those   to	  be
expressly found in the Constitution, courts must give effect
to  that.  The fact that 'm the last sixteen years  a  large
number of amendments could be made and have been made is  in
our  opinion  due to the accident that one  party  has	been
returned  by electors in sufficient strength to be  able  to
command the special majorities which are required under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_655">Art.
368</a>, not only at the Centre but also in all the Stites.	 It'
is  because  of this circumstance that we have had  so	many
amendments  in	the course of the last sixteen	years.	 But
that  in  our opinion is no ground for	limiting  the  clear
words of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_656">Art. 368.</a>
</p><p id="p_285">The  power of amendment contained in a written federal	Con-
stitution is a safety valve which to a large extent provides
for stable growth and makes violent revolution more or	less
unnecessary.  It has been said by text-book writers that the
power of amendment, though it allows for change, also  makes
a Constitution long lived and stable and serves the needs of
the  people  from time to time.	 If this power to  amend  is
made  too rigid it loses its value as a safety	valve.	 The
more rigid a Constitution the more likely it is that  people
will  outgrow it and throw it over-board violently.  On	 the
other  hand, if the Constitution is flexible (though it	 may
not  be made too easy to modify it) the power  of  amendment
provides  for stability of the Constitution itself  and	 for
ordered progress of  the nation.  If therefore there had  to
be  a  choice between giving an interpretation-to  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_657">Art.	 368</a>
which  would  make  our Constitution  rigid  and  giving  an
interpretation which would make it flexible, we would prefer
to make it flexible, so that it may endure for a long period
of time and may, if necessary, be amended from time to	time
in  accordance with the progress in the ideas of the  people
for whom it is meant.  But we feel that it is not  necessary
to  go to this extent, for that would be entering  into	 the
field of politics.  As we see the terms of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_658">Art. 368</a>, we	 are
clearly	 Df  opinion that the Constitutionmakers  wanted  to
make  our  Constitution reasonably flexible and	 ,.that	 the
interpretation that we have given to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_659">Art. 368</a> is in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">851</span>
consonance with the terms thereof and the intention of those
who  made  it.	 We therefore reject the  argument  of	fear
altogether.
</p><p id="p_286">This  brings us to the argument of stare decisis  raised  on
behalf	of the Union of India and the States.  The  argument
is  put	 thus.	After the decision of the Patna	 High  Court
invalidating  the Bihar Land Reforms Act,  1950,  Parliament
passed	the  First  Amendment  to  the	Constitution.	That
Amendment  was challenged in this Court by a number of	writ
petitions  and	was upheld in Sankari  Prasad's	 case(-)  in
1951.  That case practically stood unchallenged till  Sajjan
Singh's case(2) in 1964 after the Seventeenth Amendment	 was
passed.	  Thus in the course of these fifteen years or so  a
large  number of <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_660">State Act</a>s were passed on the basis of	 the
First  Amendment by which in particular Arts. 31-A and	31-B
were introduced in the Constitution.  It is said that though
Sankari	 Prasad's case (1) has stood for less than 15  years
there  have been so many laws dealing with agrarian  reforms
passed on the basis of the First Amendment which was  upheld
by this Court that the short period for which that case	 has
stood  should not stand- in the way of this Court acting  an
the  principle	of, stare decisis.  The reason for  this  is
that  an agrarian revolution, has taken place all  over	 the
country	 after the First Amendment by State laws  passed  on
the faith of the decision of this Court in Sankari  Prasad's
case(1).   This agrarian revolution has led to	millions  of
acres  of  land	 having changed hands and  millions  of	 now
titles	having	been created.  So it is urged that  the	 un-
animous	 decision  in Sankari Prasad's	case(2),  which	 was
challenged when the Seventeenth Amendment was passed and was
upheld by majority in Sajjan Singh's case(2) should not	 now
be  disturbed as its disturbance would create chaos  in	 the
country,   particularly	 in  the  agrarian-   sector   which
constitutes  the  vast majority of the	population  in	this
country.
</p><p id="p_287">We  are	 of opinion that there is force in this	 argument  .
Though	the  period for which Sankari Prasad's	case(1)	 has
stood  unchallenged  is	 not long, the	effects	 which	have
followed in, the passing of State laws on the faith of	that
decision',  are so overwhelming that we should	not  disturb
the decision in that case.  It is not disputed that millions
of  acres  of land have changed hands and  millions  of	 new
titles in agricultural lands have been created and the State
laws  dealing with Agricultural land which have been  passed
in  the course of the last fifteen years after the  decision
in  Samkari Prasad's case(1) have brought about an  agrarian
revolution.   Agricultural  population	constitutes  a	vast
majority  of  the  population in  this	country.   In  these
circumstances  it would in our opinion be wrong to hold	 now
that

<p id="p_289">Sankari Prasad's case (1) was not correctly decided and thus
disturb all that has been done during the last fifteen years
and  create  chaos  into  the  lives  of  millions.  of	 our
countrymen  who	 have benefited by these laws  relating,  to
agrarian reforms.  We would in the circumstances accept	 the
argument on behalf of the Union of India and the States that
this is the fittest possible case in which the principle  of
stare decisis should be applied.  On this basis also,  apart
from  our  view that Sankari Prasad's case (1) was  in	fact
rightly	 decided, we would not interfere with that  decision
now.
</p><p id="p_290">But  it is urged that instead of following the principle  of
stare  decisis	which  would make die  decision	 in  Sankari
Prasad's  case(1) good for all times., we should follow	 the
doctrine of prospective over-ruling, which has been  evolved
by  some  United States courts so that everything  that	 has
been  done  up to now, including the  Seventeenth  Amendment
would  be  held good but in future it would not be  open  to
Parliament to amend Part III by taking away or abridging any
of  the rights conferred thereby and, if the argument as  to
implied	 limitations  on  the power to	amend  is  accepted,
further	 limit the power of Parliament to amend what may  be
called basic features of the Constitution.  We must say that
we  are not prepared to accept the doctrine  of	 prospective
over-ruling.  We do not know whether this doctrine which  it
is urged should be applied to constitutional amendment would
also be applied to amendments of ordinary laws.	 We find  it
difficult  to  visualise what would be the  effect  of	this
doctrine if it is applied to amendment of ordinary laws.  We
have  so far been following in this country  the  well-known
doctrine that courts declare law and that a declaration made
by a court is the law of the land and takes effect from	 the
date  the  law came into force.	 We would  on  principle  be
loath to change that well-known doctrine and supersede it by
the  doctrine of prospective over-ruling.  Further it  seems
to us that in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_661">Art. 13(2)</a> it  would
be  impossible	to apply the doctrine of  prospective  over-
ruling	in our country, particularly where a  law  infringes
fundamental rights.  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_662">Article 13(2)</a> lays down that all.	laws
taking away or abridging fundamental rights would be void to
the extent of contravention.  It has been held by this Court
in  <a href="/doc/570453/" id="a_663">Deep Chand v. The State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (2) that a	 law
made after the Constitution came into force which  infringes
fundamental   rights  is  a  stillborn	law  and  that	 the
prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_664">Art. 13(2)</a> went to the root of	 the
State power of legislation and any-law made in contravention
of  that provision was void ab initio.	This case  has	been

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">853</span>
<p id="p_291">decisions  it  is  impossible  to  apply  the  principle  of
prospective  over-ruling in this country so far as  ordinary
laws  are  concerned.  Further, if the word  "law"  in	<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_666">Art.
13(2)</a>  includes an amendment of the Constitution,  the	same
principle will apply, for that amendment would be  stillborn
if  it	infringes any fundamental rights contained  in	Part
III.   In  these circumstances, it would  be  impossible  to
apply	the   principle	 of   prospective   over-ruling	  to
constitutional	amendments also.  On the other hand, if	 the
word  "law" in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_667">Art. 13(2)</a> does not include an  amendment  of
the Constitution, then there is no necessity of applying the
principle  of  prospective  over-ruling, for  in  that	case
unless	some  limitations on the power of amendment  of	 the
Constitution are implied the amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_668">Art. 368</a>  would
not  be	 liable	 to  be tested under  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_669">Art.  13(2).</a>   We	 are
therefore unable to apply the doctrine of prospective  over-
ruling	in the circumstances.  Further as we are of  opinion
that  this is the fittest possible case in which  the  prin-
ciple  of  stare  decisis  applies,we  must  uphold  Sankari
Prasad's case (1) for this reason also.
</p><p id="p_292">Lastly	we  would  refer to the	 following  observations  in
Sajjan Singh's case(2) (at pp. 947-48) with respect to over-
ruling earlier judgments  of this Court and specially  those
which are unanimious like Sankari Prasad's case(1):-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	      "It  is  true that the Constitution  does	 not
	      place any restriction on our powers to  review

	      relating	to  the decision  of  constitutional

that-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	      "...before  a previous decision is  pronounced

	      said view is fully justified."
</blockquote><p id="p_294">These principles were applied in Sajjan Singh's case(2)	 and
it was observed that if Sankari	 Prasad's case(3) were to be
overruled, "it would lead to the inevitable consequence that
the  amendments	 made in the Constitution both in  1951	 and
1955  would  be	 rendered  invalid and	a  large  number  of
decisions dealing with the validity of the Acts included  in
the Ninth Schedule which have been pronounced by,  different
High Courts ever since the decision of this Court in Sankari
Prasad's  case(3)  was declared, would also be	exposed.  to
serious jeopardy."
</p><p id="p_295">The  majority  in that case therefore was not in  favour  of
reviewing  Sankari Prasad's case(".) even so in View of	 the
argument  raised  and  the importance  of  the	question  it
considered  the arguments against that decision and came  to
the conclusion its that that case was rightly decided We may
add that besides so many cases in the High Courts there have
been  a large number of cases in this Court to which  it  is
unnecessary   to  refer	 where	on  the	 faith	of   various
amendments made in the Constitution, particularly the First,
the  Fourth and the Sixteenth, amending fundamental  rights,
this  Court has upheld the, validity of various Acts on	 the
basis  of  these  amendments.	Further	 we  would  be	very
reluctant  to  over-rule the unanimous decision	 in  Sankari
Prasad's  case.(3)  or any other unanimous decision  by	 the
slender	 majority of one in a larger Bench  constituted	 for
the purpose.  We say this with great respect and would	hold

unanimous  judgment in Sankari Prasad's case(,) was  wrongly
decided by such a slender majority in this Special Bench.
We  therefore  hold  that  Sankari  Prasad's  cases(1)	 was
correctly  decided and that the majority,in  Sajjan  Singh's
case(2)	 WAS Correct in following that decision.   We  would
follow the decision in Sankari Prasad's case(1) even now  as
in  our	 opinion it was correctly decided.'  Following	that
decision we hold that the Seventeenth Amendment is good.
In view of this decision it is unnecessary to refer to other
arguments   raised  with  respect  to  the   two   petitions
challenging the Mysore Land Reforms Act.
</p><p id="p_297">In  our view therefore all the three petitions	should	fail

which  appear  in  the	two  judgment  just  delivered,	 the

involved.    '	Since  these  Acts  are	 protected  by	 the
Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, the validity
of   the  constitutional  amendment  is	  also	 questioned.
Therefore, a much larger field must be traversed because  of
the claim of the State that no part of the Constitution from
the Preamble to the Ninth Schedule, is beyond the  provision
for amendment contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_671">Art. 368.</a>  The article, forms the
Twentieth Part of the Constitution and is said to be a	code
by  itself in which reposes a sovereign power,	transcending
anything  elsewhere in the Constitution.  The State  submits
that  (except  as  stated  in  the  article)  there  are  no
limitations on the amending power and denies that there	 are
any  implied  restrictions.  It claims, therefore,  that  an
amendment  of  the Constitution Or of any of  its  part	 can
never be a justiciable issue if the procedure for  amendment
has been duly followed.	 In this claim no exception is made-
the Preamble, the Fundamental Rights, the guaranteed  remedy
to  uphold them all of them severally and together are	said
to  be capable of being Partially or wholly abrogated by  an
amendment.   Looked at from, this Point of view	 the  Seven-
teenth <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_672">Amendment Act</a> not only 'must be valid but also beyond
the  Power of the courts to question.  The  petitioners,  on
the  other  hand,  contend that this is	 to  deny  the	real

<p id="p_299"> The  same questions were before this Court on	two  earlier
occasions.  They arose for the first time immediately  after
the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 was adopted and
became	the subject of a decision of this Court reported  in
<a href="/doc/1706770/" id="a_673">Sri  Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of  India</a>(1).   There
Patanjali  Sastri  J.  speaking	 for  Harilal  Kania   C.J.,
Mukherjea,  Das	 and Chandrasekhara  Aiyar,  JJ.and  himself
upholds	 the First Amendment on the grounds that  the  power
conferred by Part XX is constituent, paramount and sovereign
and is, therefore, not subject to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_674">Art. 13(2)</a> which prohibits
the making of ordinary laws   tending  to  abridge  or	take
away Fundamental Rights.The   questions	 were  again  before
the Court in sajjan Singh c. State of Rajasthan(2) when	 the
Seventeenth Amendment was impugned. The authority of Sankari
Prasad's case(1) was the ministry ofof	the argument  in
support of the validity of the new amendment. This  time the
Court was not unanimous although the Court as aas a whole
did not strike down the Act. Three opinions weredelivered
by  Gajendragadkar, C.J. on behalf of Wanchoo  and  Raghubar
Dayal, JJ. and himself, by Mudholkar, J. and by me.  I found
the  reasoning in Sankari Prasad's case(1) to  be  unaccept-
able,  although for reasons which I shall give, I  refrained
from  expressing  a  final opinion.  Mudholkar,	 J.  in	 his
opinion	 supported me with additional and  forceful  reasons
but  he also did not express himself finally on the  broader
question.    I	 closed	 my  opinion  with   the   following
observations :--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	      "I  would require stronger reasons than  those
	      given  in Sankari Prasad's case(1) to make  me

	      not really fundamental but were intended to be
	      within the powers of amendment in common	with
	      the  other  parts	 of  the  Constitution	 and
	      without  the  concurrence of the	States.	  No

</p><p id="p_307">Why  was it necessary to have the Fundamental Rights at	 all
and make them justiciable ? As we seem to be forgetting	 our
own  history so soon let me say that the answer	 lies  there
the  Nationalist  Movement  and	 the  birth  of	 the  Indian
National  Congm	 in  1885  were the  direct  result  of	 the
discriminatory	treatment  of  the  Indians  in	 their	 own
country.  The demand for the guarantee of Fundamental Rights
had unfortunately to be made. then to a foreign ruler and it
appeared  in  the Constitution of India Bill framed  by	 the
Indian	National  Congress  ten years later.   All  that  is
valuable  to an Individual in civilized	 society,  including
free  speech,  imprisonment only by a  competent  authority,
free law education, etc. were claimed therein.	 Resolutions
of  the Congress since then reiterated this demand  and	 the
securing  of Fundamental Rights in any	future	Constitution
became	one of the articles of faith.  To cut the  narration
short, the main steps may only be mentioned.  Mrs.  Besant's
Commonwealth  of India Bill 1925 with its seven	 fundamental
rights	(the  precursor	 of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_688">Art. 19</a>),  the  Madras  Congress
Resolution   of	 1927--"a  constitution	 on  the  basis	  of
declaration  of rights"-- the Nehru Report--it	is  obviour,
that our first care should be to have the Fundamental Rights
guaranteed   in	 a  manner  which  will	 not  permit   their
withdrawal in any circumstancees--, the draft article in the
Nehru  Constitution  "No  person shall be  deprived  of	 his
liberty,  nor  shall his dwelling or  property	be  entered,
requisitioned or confiscated save in accordance with  law"-,
the  Independence  Resolution  of  26th	 January,   1930--We
believe	 that  it  is the inalienable right  of	 the  Indian
people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy
the  fruits of their toil and have the necessities of  life,
so  that  they may have full opportunities  of	growth"	 the
Karachi	 Resolution  on	 Fundamental  Rights,  Economic	 and
Social Change (1931), the Sapru Report (1945) which for	 the
first  time  distinguished  between  justiciable  and	non-
,justiciable  rights, the Suggestion of the Cabinet  Mission
for the constitution of an Advisory Committee on Fundamental
and   Minority	 Rights,  and,	lastly	the   Committee	  on
Fundamental  Rights of the Constituent Assembly, are just  a
few  of the steps to be remembered.  The Fundamental  Rights
and the Directive Principles were the result.
Fundamental laws are needed to make a Government of laws and
not  of men and the Directive Principles are needed  to	 lay
down the objectives of a good Government.  Our	Constitution
was  not the cause but the result of political and  personal
freedom".  Since Dicey had said that "the proclamation .  in
a Constitution or Charter of the right to personal  freedom,
or  indeed  of any other right, gives of itself	 but  slight
security that the right has more than a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">860</span>
nominal	  existence",(1)  provision  had  to  be  made	 for
guaranteeing   them   andto  make   them   justiciable	 and
enforceable.   This result is reachedby means of  Arts.	 12,
13, 32, 136, 141, 144 and 226. The The	High   Courts	 and
finally this Court have been made the Judges of whether	 any
legislative  or executive action on the part oft  the  State
considered  as comprehensively as is possible,	offends	 the
Fundamental Rights and <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_689">Art. 13(2)</a> declares that	 legislation
which  so  offends is to be deemed to be void.	It  is	thus
that  Parliament cannot today abridge or take away a  single
Fundamental  Right  even by a 'unanimous vote  in  both	 the
Chambers.  But on the argument of the State it has only	 'to
change	the  title of the same Act to an  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_690">Amendment  of	 the
Constitution  Act</a> and then a majority of the total  strength
and  a 2/3rds majority of the members present and voting  in
each  House  may  remove not only  any	of  the	 Fundamental
Rights, but the whole Chapter giving them.  And this is said
to be possible because of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_691">Art. 368</a> and its general  language
which,	it is claimed, makes no exception in its  text	and,
therefore, no exception can be implied.	 It is obvious	that
if an Act amending the Constitution is- treated as a law  it
must also be subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_692">Art. 13(2).</a>  Since
the  definition	 of  the word 'law', makes  no	exception  a
strenuous  eeffort  is	made on the basis  of  argument	 and
authority  to  establish that a constituent power  does	 not
result in a law in the ordinary sense.	Distinction is	thus
made  between laws made ordinarily that is to say, from	 day
to  day by ordinary majority and laws made occasionally	 for
the  amendment	of the Constitution by a  slightly  enhanced
majority.  In our Constitution this distinction is not valid
in the eye of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_693">Art. 13(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_308">It  is	not essential,, of course, that	 a  difference	must

England	 which	is written and statutory but it is  not	 all
found  in one place and arranged as a  written	Constitution
usually is.  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_694">The Act</a> of Settlement (1701), the Act of  Union

Incitement   to	 Disaffection  Act  (1934),  His   Majesty's
Declaration of Abdication Act (1936), the Regency Act (1937)
and  the  various Acts setting up different  ministries	 are
examples of what will pass for constitutional law under	 our
system(1).   The  Bill	of  Rights  (1689)  lays  down	 the
fundamental rule in England that taxation may not be  levied
without the consent of Parliament which in our	Constitution
has  its counterpart in <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_696">Art. 265.</a>  In our Constitution	also
the  laws  relating  to delimitation  of  constituencies  or
allotment of seats to such constituencies made or purporting
to  be	made under <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_697">Art. 327</a> or <a href="/doc/873755/" id="a_698">Art. 328</a>, by  reason  of	 the
exclusion of the powers of the courts to question them,	 are
rendered  constitutional  instruments.	 Other	examples  of
constitutions  which,  in addition to  constitution  proper,
contain certain ordinary legislation, having  constitutional
qualities, also exist. (2)
What  then is the real distinction between ordinary law	 and
the law made in the exercise of constituent power?  I  would
say under the scheme of our Constitution none at all.	This
distinction  has been attempted to be worked out by  several
authors.   It  is not necessary to quote them.	 Taking	 the
results	 obtained by Willoughby(3) it may be said  that	 the
fact that a Constitution is written as a Constitution is  no
distinction because in Britain constitutional law is of both
kinds	and   both  parts  coexist.   The  test	  that	 the
Constitution  requires	a different kind  of  procedure	 for
amendment,  also  fails because in Britain Parliament  by  a
simple	majority makes laws and also  amends  constitutional
statutes.   In our Constitution too, in spite of  the  claim
that  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_699">Art.  368</a>	 is a code (whatever is meant  by  the	word
,code, here), Arts. 4, 11 and 169 show that the amendment of
the   Constitution  can	 be  by	 the  ordinary	law   making
procedure.  By this method one of the legislative limbs in a
State  can  be removed or created.  'This  destroys  at	 one
stroke the claim that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_700">Art. 368</a> is a code arid also that	 any
special	  method  of  amendment	 of  the   Constitution	  is
fundamentally necessary.
</p><p id="p_311">(1)  The list is raken from K. C. Wheare's: "The Statute  of
Westminster  and Dominion Status" (4th Edn) p. 8. Dicey	 and
others give different list.

Spain  and Sweden among others.	 The Constitution of  Spain,
in  particular is in several Instruments.  The	Constitution

constitutional instruments.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">862</span>
<p id="p_314">The next test that the courts must apply the Constitution in
preference  to the ordinary law may also be rejected on	 the
ansalogy of the British practice.  There, every statute	 has
equal standing.	 Therefore, the only difference can be	said
to   arise  from  the  fact  that.constitutional  laws	 are
generally  amendable  under  a	process	 which	in   varying
degrees,  is more difficult or elaborate.  This may  give  a
distinct  character  to the law of the Constitution  but  it
does not serve to distinguish it from the other laws of	 the
land for purposes of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_701">Art. 13(2).</a>  Another difference is that
in   the  written  constitutions  the  form  and  power	  of
Government  alone are to be found and not rules	 of  private
law as is the case with ordinary laws.	But this is also not
an   invariable	  rule.	  The  Ame  Constitution   and	 our
Constitution  itself  are  outstanding	examples  There	 are
certain	 other	differences  of degree, such  as  that	nary
_legislation may be tentative or temporary, more detailed or
secondary,   while  the	 Constitution  is  intended  to	  be
permanent,   general  and  primary.   Because	it   creates
limitations    on    the   ordinary    legislative    power,
constitutional law in a sense is fundamental law, but if the
legislative  and  constituent processes can become  one,  Ls
there any reason why the result should be regarded as law in
the one case and not in the other ? On the whole, therefore,
as observed in the American Jurisprudence
	      "It  should be noticed however that a  statute
	      and a constitution, though of unequal  dignity
	      are  both laws and each rests on the  will  of
	      the people........"
</p><p id="p_315">A Constitution is law which is intended to be, for all	time
and is difficult to change so that it may not be subject  to

caprice or passion"(2).
</p><p id="p_316">I  agree with the authors cited before us that the power  of
amendment  must be possessed by the State.  I do not take  a
narrow view of the word "amendment" as including only  minor
changes	 within the general framework.	By an amendment	 new
matter	may be added, old matter removed or altered.  I	 alm
concede	  that	 the  reason  for  the	amendment   of	 the
Constitution  is a political matter although I do not go  as
far  as	 some  Justice of the Supreme court  of	 the  United
States did in Coleman v. Miller(3) that the whole process is
"political   in	 its  entirely	from  submission  until	  an
Amendment  becomes  part  of the  Constitution	and  is	 not
subject to judicial guidance, control or interference at any
point." There are fundamental differences between our Con-

</p><p id="p_319">Here I make a difference between Government and State  which
I  shall  explain presently.  As  Willoughby(4)	 points	 out
constitutional law ordinarily limits Government but not	 the
State  because a constitutional law is the creation  of	 the

the  State from limiting itself.  The rights and  duties  of
the individual and the manner in which such rights are to be
exercised  and enforced ;ire ordinarily to be found  in	 the
laws though some of the Constitutions also fix them.  It  is
now  customary	to  have  such	rights	guaranteed  in	 the
Constitution.	Peaslee,(5) writing in 1956 says that  about
88% of the national Constitutions contain clauses respecting
individual  liberty and fair legal process;  83%  respecting
freedom	 of  speech and the press; 82%	respecting  property
right;	80% respecting rights of assembly  and	association;
80%  respecting rights of conscience and religion; 79%	res-
pecting secrecy of correspondence and inviolability of domi-

health	 and  motherhood;  and	35%  respecting	  the	non-
retroactivity  of laws.	 In some of the Constitutions  there
is an attempt to put a restriction against the State seeking
to whittle down the rights conferred on the individual.	 Our

<p id="p_329">down  by  the Constitution.  There is nothing,	however,  to
prevent	 the State from placing certain matters outside	 the
amending  procedure(').	 Examples of this exist	 in  several
Constitutions  of  the world : see <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_707">Art. 5</a>  of  the  American
Constitution; <a href="/doc/97935/" id="a_708">Art. 95</a> of -the Constitution of France,;	<a href="/doc/97935/" id="a_709">Art.

the Italian Constitution, to mention only a few.
When  this  happens  the  ordinary  procedure  of  amendment
,ceases to apply.  The unlimited competence (the  kompetenz-
kompetenz of the Germans) does not flow from the  amendatory
process.  Amendment can then be by a fresh constituent body.
To attempt to do this otherwise is to attempt a	 revolution.
I do not known why the word "revolution", which I have	used
before,	 should evoke in some persons an image	of  violence
and  subversion.   The whole American Constitution  was	 the
result of a bloodless revolution and in a sense so was ours.
The  adoption of the whole Constitution and the adoption  of
an  amendment to the Constitution have much in	common.	  An
amendment  of  the  Constitution has  been  aptly  called  a
Constitution in little and the same question arises  whether
it  is	by a legal process or by revolution.   There  is  no
third alternative.  An amendment, which repeals the  earlier
Constitution,  unless legal, is achieved by revolution.	  As
stated in the American Jurisprudence :
</p><p id="p_330">"An attempt by the majority to change the fundamental law in
violation  of self-imposed restrictions is  unconstitutional
and revolutionary".(')
There  are illegal and violent revolutions and	illegal	 and
peaceful revolutions.  Modification of Constitution can only
be  by the operation of a certain number of wills acting  on
other  wills.  The pressure runs through a  broad  spectrum,
harsh at one end and gentle at the other.  But whatever	 the
pressure  may  be, kind or cruel, the revolution  is  always
there if the change is not legal.  The difference is one  of
method, not of kind.  Political thinking starts from the few
at the top and works downward more often than in the reverse
direction.   It is wrong to think that masses alone,  called
"the people" after Mazini, or "the proletariate" after Marx,
'begin a revolutionary change.	Political changes are always
preceded  by  changes  in thought in a	few.   They  may  be

illegality   committed	 by  the  Government   against	 the
Constitution as evolution.  I am mindful of the observations
of Justice Holmes, that-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">	      "We need education in the obvious to learn  to
	      transcend	 our  own convictions and  to  leave
	      room  for	 much that we hold dear to  be	done
	      away with short of revolution, by the  orderly
	      change of law."(1)
But  the problem we are faced with is not an orderly  change
of law but of a claim to a revolutionary change against	 the
vitals of the Constitution.  In such a case the apprehension
is  that democracy may be lost if there is no liberty  based
on  law	 and law based on equality.  The protection  of	 the
fundamental  Rights is necessary so that we may not walk  in
fear of democracy itself.

let me now explain what I mean by that distinction and	what
the  force of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_716">Art. 13(2)</a> in that context is.  I shall  begin
first  by  reading the pertinent article.  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_717">Article  13	(2</a>),
which I quoted earlier, may again be read here:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">	      "13...............................

	      this   clause   shall,  to   the	 extent	  of
	      contravention, be void."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	      The definition of the State in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_718">Art. 12</a> reads
	      "12.    In  this	Part,  unless  the   context

	      States  and  all local  or  other	 authorities
	      within  the  territory of India or  under	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_334">The  State  is the sum total of all the agencies  which	 are
also individually mentioned in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_719">Art. 12</a> and by the definition
all   the   parts  severally  are  also	 included   in	 the
prohibition.  Now see how 'law' is defined:

</p><p id="p_337">(a)  "law"  includes  any ordinance, order,  bye-law,  rule,
regulation,  notification,  custom or usage  having  in	 the
territory of India the force of law;"
</p><p id="p_338">In  Sajjan Singh's case(1) I said that if amendments of	 the
constitution  were meant to be excluded from the word  "law"
it  was	 the  easiest thing to add  to	the  definition	 the
further	 words	"but shall not include an amendment  of	 the
Constitution". it 'LS argued now before us that this wag not
necessary  because  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_720">Art. 368</a> does not  make  any  exception.
This  argument came at all stages like a refrain and is	 the
real  cause of the obfuscation in the opposite view.   Those
who  entertain this thought do not pause to consider  :	 why
make a prohibition against the State? As Cooley said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	      "there  never  was a  republican	Constitution
	      which  delegated	to  functionaries  all	 the
	      latent  powers  which  lie  dormant  in  every
	      nation  and  are	boundless  in  extent.	 and
	      incapable of definition.",
If the State wields more power than the functionaries  there
must  be a difference between  the.  State and its  agencies
such  as  Government, Parliament, the  Legislatures  of	 the
States and the local and other authorities.  Obviously,	 the
State  means  more  than any of there or  all  of  them	 put
together.   By	making	the State  subject  'to	 Fundamental
Rights it is clearly stated in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_721">Art. 13 (2)</a> that any' ,of the
agencies  acting alone or all the agencies, acting  together
are  not above the Fundamental Rights.	Therefore, when	 the
House  .of the People or the Council of States introduces  a
Bill-  for  the abridgement of the  Fundamental	 Rights,  it
ignores the injunction against it and even if the two Houses
pass  the Bill the injunction is next operative against	 the
President since the expression "Government of India" in	 the
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_722">General	 Clauses Act</a> means the President of India.  This  is
equally true of ordinary laws and laws seeking to amend	 the
Constitution.	The meaning of the word "State" will  become
clear  if I draw attention at this stage to <a href="/doc/1742969/" id="a_723">Art. 325</a> of	 the
Constitution of Nicargua, which reads as follows:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	      "325.  The agencies of the Government, jointly
	      or separately, are, for-bidden to suspend	 the

<p id="p_339">the  State  acting either in its  executive  or	 legislative
capacity.  Ile of the Executive is more important than	even
the  Legislature.   In modem politics run  on  parliamentary
democracy  the Cabinet attains a position of dominance	over
the  Legislature.   The Executive, therefore,  can  use	 the
Legislature as a means of securing changes in the laws which
it desires.  It happened in Germany under Hitler.  The	fact
has been noticed by numerous writers. for example, Wade	 and
Philips(1),  Sir Ivor Jennings(2) , Dawson(3), Keith(4)	 and
Ramsay Muir(5).	 Dawson in particular said that a Cabinet is
no  longer  responsible to the Commons but the	Commons	 has
become instead responsible to the Government.  Ivor Jennings
added  that  if a Government had majority  it  could  always
secure	the  legislation.  The others pointed out  that	 the
position  of the Cabinet towards Parliament tends to  assume
more  or  less dictatorial powers and that  was	 why  people
blamed	Government, this is to say, the Cabinet rather	than
Parliament for ineffective and harsh laws.
This  is true of our country also  regarding  administration
and  Station.  Fortunately, this is avoided at least  in  so
far  as	 the Fundamental Rights	 are  concerned.   Absolute,
arbitrary  power  in defiance of  Fundamental  Rights  exist
nowhere	 under	our Constitution, not even  in	the  largest
majority.   The	 people's representatives have,	 of  course,
inalienable  and  undisputable	right to  alter,  reform  or
abolish the Government in any manner they think fit, but the
declarations  of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens	 are
the  inalienable  rights of the people.	 Ile extent  of	 the
power  of  the	rulers	at any	time  is,  measured  by	 the
Fundamental Rights.  It is wrong to think of them as  rights
within the Parliament's giving or taking.  Our	Constitution
enables	 an  individual	 to oppose  successfully  the  whole
community  and	the  State and claim his  rights.   This  is
because	 the Fundamental Rights are I so  safe-guarded	that
within	 the  limits  set  by  the  Constitution  they	 are
inviolate.  The Constitution has itself said what protection
has been created round the person and property of the  citi-
zens and to what extent this protection may give way to	 the
general good. it is wrong to invoke the Directive Principles
as   if	 there	is  some  antinomy  between  them  and	 the
Fundamental  Rights.  The Directive Principles lay down	 the
routes of State but such action must avoid the	restrictions
stated	in  the	 Fundamental Rights.   Prof.   Anderson	 (6)
taking	the constitutional amendments, as they have been  in
our country, considered the Directive principles to be	more
potent than the Fundamental

Fundamental-  Rights.  with- the guaranteed  remedies.	 The
Directive Principles are not justiciable but the Fundamental
Rights are' made justiciable.  This gives a judicial control
and check over State action even within the four corners  of
the  Directive Principles.  It cannot be conceived  that  in
following  the Directive Principles the	 Fundamental  Rights
(say  for example, the equality clause) can be ignored.	  If
it  is	attempted,  then . the action is  capable  of  being
struck	down.	In  the same way, if  an  amendment  of	 the
Constitution is law for the reasons explained by me, such an
amendment  is  also open to challenge under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_724">Art. 32</a>,  if  it
offends	 against  the  Fundamental Rights  by  abridging  or
taking	them away.  Of course, it is always open  to  better
Fundamental Rights.  A law or amendment of the	Constitution
would offend the Fundamental Rights only when it attempts to
abridge or take them away.
</p><p id="p_344">The  importance of Fundamental Rights in the world of  today
cannot be-lost sight of.  On December 10, 1948, the General.
Assembly  of  the  United  Nations  adopted  the   Universal
Declaration  of Human Rights without a dissent.	 This  draft
was made after the Third Committee of the United Nations had
devoted	 85 meetings to it.  The Declaration represents	 the
civil, political and religious liberties for which men	have
struggled  through  the centuries and those new	 social	 and
economic  rights  of the Individual which  the	Nations	 are
increasingly  recognising in their Constitutions.   Some  of
these  were  proclaimed	 during the  French  Revolution	 and
areincluded  in the declarations of Nations taking pride  in
the  dignity  and  liberty  of	the  Individual.   They	 are
epitomized  in	the Preamble, and more	fully  expressed  in
Parts  III and IV of our Constitution.	 These	Declarations
wherever found are intended to give a key to social progress
by  envisaging	rights to work, to education  and  to'social
insurance.
</p><p id="p_345">The Nations of the world are now in the second stage,  where
Covenants  are	being signed on the-part of  the  States  to
respect such rights.  United Nations Human Rights Commission
has worked to produce two drafts-one dealing, with civil and
political  rights  and the other with economic,	 social	 and
cultural rights., The third stage is still in its infancy in
which  it is hoped to provide for the enforcement  of  these
rights	on an international basis.  The Regional Charter  of
the Human Rights under which there is established already  a
European  Commission  of  Human Rights	to  investigate	 and
report on violations of Human Rights, is a significant	step
in  that direction.  After 1955 the European Commission	 has
become	competent  to receive  complaints  from	 individuals
although   the	 enforceability	 of  Human  Rights   on	  an
international  basis is still far from being  achieved.	  If
one compares the Uni
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">869</span>
versal Declaration with Parts III and IV of our Constitution
one   finds  remarkable	 similarity  in	 the  two.   It	  is
significant  that  our Committee on Fundamental	 Rights	 was
deliberating  when the This Committee of the United  Nations
was  deliberating  on the.  Universal Declaration  of  Human
Rights.	  Both	are  manifestos	 of  man's  inviolable	 and
fundamental freedoms.
</p><p id="p_346">While the world is anxious to secure Fundamental Rights	 in-
ternationally,	 it  is	 a  little  surprising	 that	some
intellectuals  in our country, whom we may call "classe	 non
classe"	 after Hegel, think of the Directive  Principles  in
our  Constitution  as if they were superior  to	 Fundamental
Rights.	 As a modern philosopher(1) said such people 'do lip
service' to freedom thinking all the time in terms of social
justice	 "with 'freedom' as a by-product".   Therefore,	 in.
their  scheme  of things Fundamental Rights become  only  an
epitheton  ornans.  One does not know what they	 believe  in
the  communistic millennium of Marx or	the  individualistic
Utopia of Bastiat.  To them an amendment of the	 Fundamental
Rights	is  permissible	 if it can be said to  be  within  a
scheme of a supposed socioeconomic reform, however, much the
danger	to liberty, dignity and freedom of  the	 Individual.
There  are  others who hold to liberty and freedom  of	the.
Individual  under all conditions.  Compare the	attitude  of
Middleton  Murray who would have Communism  provided  "there
was   universal	 freedom  of  speech,  of  association,	  of
elections  and	of  Parliament"	 To  such  the	liberty	 and
dignity	 of the Individual are inviolable.  Of	course,	 the
liberty	 of  the individual under our  Constitution,  though
meant to be fundamental, is subject to such restrictions  as
the  .	needs  of  society  dictate.   These  are  expressly
mentioned  in  the Constitution itself in the hope  that  no
further limitations would require to be imposed at any time.
I  do  not  for a moment suggest  that	the  question  about
reasonableness, expediency or desirability of the amendments
of  the	 Constitution  from  a	political  angle  is  to  be
considered  by	the courts.  But what I do say is  that	 the
possession of the necessary majority does not put 'any party
above	the  constitutional  limitations  implicit  in	 the
Constitution.	It is obvious that the Constituent  Assembly
in  making  the	 Fundamental  Rights  justiciable  was	 not
justisfied  with reliance on the sense of self-restraint  or
public opinion(2) on which the majority in Sajjan Singh's(3)
case  does.  This is not argument of fear: The	question  to
ask  is : can a party, which enjoys 2/3rds  majority  today,

difference between the constitutional and the Ordinary	laws
made thereafter ?
</p><p id="p_350">The  liberty of the Individual has to be fundamental and  it
has been so declared by the people.  Parliament today is not
the constituent body as the Constituent Assembly was, but is
a  constituted body which must bear true, allegiance to	 the
Constitution   'as  by	law  established.   To	change	 the
Fundamental part of the Individual's liberty is a usurpation
of  constituent	 functions be-cause they  have	been  placed
outside the scope of the- power of constituted.	 Parliament.
It is obvious that Parliament need not now legislate at all.
It  has	 spread the umbrella of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_726">Art. 31-B</a> and .has  only  to
add,  a	 clause that all legislation  involving	 Fundamental
Rights	would  be  deemed  to  be  within  that	  protection
hereafter.   Thus  the only  palladium	against	 legislative
dictatorship may be removed by a 2/3rds majority not only in
praesanti  but,	 defuturo.  This can hardly  be	 open  to  a
constituted Parliament.
</p><p id="p_351">Having established, that there is no difference between	 the
ordinary legislative and the amending processes in so far as
cl.(2)	of Aft. 13 is concerned, because both being laws  in
their  true character, come within the prohibition  created,
by  that,  clause against the State and that  the  Directive
Principles cannot be invoked to destroy Fundamental  Rights.
I  proceed  now to examine whether the English	and  Amercan
precedents  lay down any principle applicable to  amendments
of  our	 Constitution.	In, Britain the question  whether  a
constitutional	amendment is valid or not at  arise  because
the  courts are powerless' Parliamentary  Sovereignty  under
the  English Constitution means that Parliament	 enjoys	 the
right  to make or unmake any law whatever  and no  person or
body has any right to question the legislation.	 The  utmost
and  absolute  despotic	 power belongs	to  Parliament.	  It
"make, confirm, enlarge, restrain, abrogate, repeal,  revise
and   expand   law  concerning	matters	 of   all   possible
denominations".	 What Parliament does, no authority on earth
can  undo.   The  The Queen, each House	 of  Parliament	 the
constituencies and the law  courts have in the past  claimed
independent   legislative  powers  but	these	claims	 are
unfounded.    It  is  impossible  to  compare	the   Indian
Parliament  with the Brittsh Parliament as the	former	con-
codedly	 in the ordinary legislation is subject to  judicial
review,	 both  on the ground of competence  arising  from  a
federal	 structure And the existence of Fundamental  Rights.
The question of competence in the matter of amendment of the
Constitution  depends  upon, firstly,  compliance  with	 the
procedure  laid	 down in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_727">Art. 368</a> and,	secondly,  upon	 the
question whether,the.process is in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">871</span>
any  manner  restricted by the	Fundamental  -Rights.	Such
questions   cannot   obviously	 arise	 in   the    British
Parliament(').
</p><p id="p_352">The example  of the Constitution of the United States cannot
also  serve  any  purpose although the	greatest  amount  of
support	 was sought to be derived from the decisions of	 the
Supreme	 Court and the institutional writings in the  United
States.	   The	 power	of  amend  in  the   United   States
Constitution  flows from Art.  V. (1).	It must	 be  noticed
that  the  power  is  clearly not  made	 equal	to  ordinary
legislative  process.	One salient point of  difference  is
that  the President is nowhere in' this scheme	because	 his
negative  does not run.(') The amendment is thus not of	 the
same quality as ordinary legislation.
</p><p id="p_353">The Supreme Court of the United States has no doubt  brushed
aside  objections to amendments of the Constitution  on	 the
score  of  incompetence, but has refrained from	 giving	 any
reasons.   In the most important of them,  which  questioned
the  18th Amendment, the Court only stated its	conclusions.
After  recalling  the  texts  of  the  Article	under  which
Amendments may be made and of the 18th Amendment proposed by
the  Congress  in  1917 and proclaimed as  ratified  by	 the
States in 1919, the Court announced :
</p><p id="p_354">"4.  The  prohibition  of  the	manufacture,  sale,   trans-
portation,  importation,  and  exportation  of	intoxicating
liquors	 for  beverage	purposes, as embodied  in  the	18th
amendment,  Is within the power to amend reserved by <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_728">Art.  5</a>
of the Constitution." (emphasis supplied) (4)
One would have very much liked to know why this	 proposition
was laid down in the terms emphasised above if the effective
exercise of the. power depended upon a particular  procedure
which  was immaculately followed.  The silence of the  Court
about  its reasons has been noticed in the same judgment  by
Mr. Justice
(1)  Dicey gives three supposed limitations on the power  of
Parliament.   Of  these one that language has been  used  in
Acts  of  Parliament which implies that one  Parliament	 can
make  laws  which  cannot  be  touched	by  any	  subsequent
Parliament,  is	 not  true.  The best examples	are  Act  of
treaties with Scotland and Ireland but these same Acts	have
been  amended later.  Francis Bacon found this claim  to  be

ratification may be proposed by the Congress, provided	that

<p id="p_357">Mckenna.   In feser v. Garnett(1) the Court was hardly	more
expressive.  The only question considered by the Court was
"The  first  contention	 is  that  the	power  of  amendment
conferred  by  the' Federal Constitution, and sought  to  be
exercised, does not dxtend to this Amendment, because of its
character." (emphasis supplied).
</p><p id="p_358">This was repelled by Brandeis, J on behalf of the  unanimous
court  on the grx)und that the- Amendment was  in  character
and  phraseology  similar  to the  15th	 Amendment  and	 was
adopted by following the same method.  As the,lsth Amendment
had been accepted for half a century the suggestion that  it
was  not  in  accordance  with law, but	 as  a	war  measure
validated by acquiescence was not accepted.
It  is	significant, however, that at the time of  the	18th
Amendment,  the	 arguments were (a)  that  'amendment'	was'
limited	 to  the correction of error in the framing  of	 the
Constitution, (b) Article V did not comprehend the  adoption
of  additional	or supplementary  provisions,  (c)  ordinary
legislation  could  not be embodied. in	 the  constitutional
amendment,  and	 (d) Congress could not	 'propose  amendment
which  pared  the  sovereign power of the States.   None  of
these at I guin ents was accepted.  At the time of the	19th
Amendment, which increased the franchise in the States,	 the
narrow	ground was that a State which had not  ratified	 the
Amendment  would be, deprived of its equal suffrage  in	 the
Senate	because	 its representatives in that body  would  be
persons	 not of its choosing, i.e. persons,chosen by  voters
whom  the  State  itself  had not  authorised  to  vote	 for
Senators.  This argument was rejected.	However, in  Dillion
v.  Gloss(2) the Supreme Court held that Congress  had	the,
power  to  a  time limit for ratification  because  Art.   V
implied that application must be within some reasonable time
after.	the proposal".	The fixation of 7 years was held  by
the Court to be reasonable.

of  the	 Lt.  Governor.	  Mandamus  was	 asked	against	 the

courts have thus entered the political thicket'.The question
of delimitation of constituencies cannot, of, course,  arise
before courts under our Constitution because of <a href="/doc/1797219/" id="a_731">Art. 329.</a>
Baker  v. Carr(1) makes the Court sit in judgement over	 the
possession  and distribution of politcal power which  is  an
essential  part of a Constitution.  The magical	 formula  of
"political questions" is losing ground and it is to be hoped
that  a change may be Soon. coming.  Many of the attacks  on
the  amendments were the result of a  misunderstanding	that
the  Constitution Was a compact between States and that	 the
allocation of powers was not to be changed at all.  This was
finally decided by Texas v. White (2) as far back as 1869.
The main question of implied limitations has evoked a  spate
of  writings.  Bryce(s), Weaver(4), Mathews(5),	 Burdick(6),
Willoughby(7),	Willis(8), Rottshaefer(9),  Orfield(10)	 (to
name  only  a  few) are of the opinion that  there  are	 no,
implied limitations, although, as Cooley points out, "it  is
sometimes expressly declared-what indeed is implied  without
the declaration that everything in the declaration of rights
contained   is	excepted  out  of  the	general	 powers	  of
Government,   and  all	laws  contrary	thereto	  shall	  be
void(11)."  Ex-press  checks  there  are  only	three.	 Two
temporary  checks  were operative till 1808 and	 dealt	with
interference with importation of slaves and the levying of a
direct tax without apportionment among then States according
to population.	Permanent check that now remains is equality
of  representation  of States in the Senate.   Some  writers
suggest	 that this, check may also be-removed in two  moves.
By the- first the Article can be, amended and by the  second
the  equality  removed. When this happens it  will  be	seen
whether	 the  Supreme  Court invokes any  doctrine  such  as
achieving. indirectly what cannot be done directly.
It will, of course, be completely out of place in a judgment
to discuss the. views of the several writers and so I  shall
confine	 myself to the observation of Orfield to whom  again
and again counsel for the State turned either for support or
inspiration.   Accord.	ing to him, there  are'	 no  implied
limitations unless the Courts adopt

that  view and therefore no limitations on the substance  of
the amendments except the Equality Clause.  His view is that
when  Congress	is  in	the  amending  process,	 it  is	 not
legislating but exercising a peculiar power bestowed by Art.
V.  I  have already shown that under  our  Constitution	 the
amending   process  is	a  legislative	process,  the	only
difference  being  a special majority and the  existence  of
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_732">Art.  13(2).</a>  Orfield brushes aside the argument  that	this
would destroy the very concept of the Union which, as  Chief
Justice.   Marshall had said, was  indestructible.   Orfield
faces boldly the question whether the whole Constitution can
be overthrown by an amendment and answers yes.	But he	says
that the amendment must not be in violation of the  Equality
Clause.	 This seems to be a great concession.  He makes this
exception but Munro(-'), who finds it difficult to  conceive
of  an unamendable constitution suggests that it  should  be
possible  to  begin with that clause and then  the  door  to
amendments  would  be wide open.  Of  course,  the  Supreme,
Court has not yet faced an amendment of this. character	 and
it  has	 not  yet denied jurisdiction to  itself.   In	the.
United States the Constitution works because, as observed by
Willis,	 the  Supreme Court is allowed to do "'the  work  of
remolding  the	Constitution  to keep it  abreast  with	 new
conditions  and	 new  times,  and  to  allow  the   agencies
expressly endowed with the; amending process to act only  in
extraordinary  emergencies  or	when,  the  general  opinion
disagrees  with the  opinion of the Supreme Court."  In	 our
country	 amendments,  so far have bean made  only  with	 the
object	of negativing the Supreme Court,decisions, but	more
of it later.
</p><p id="p_374">I have referred to Orfield although there are greater  names
than  his expounding the same views.  I have refrained	from
referring  to  the  opposite  view which  in  the  words  of
Willoughby   has  been	"strenuously  argued  by   reputable
writers" although Willis discourteously referred to them  in
his book.  My reason for not doing so is plainly this.	 The
process	 of amendment in the United States is clearly not  a
legislative  process and there is no provision like <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_733">Art.  13
(2)</a> under which "laws" abridging or taking away	 Fundamental
Rights	can be declared void.  Our liberal Constitution	 has
given  to the Individual all that he should have-freedom  of
speech, of association, of assembly, of religion, of  motion
and  locomotion, of property and trade and  profession.	  In
addition  it  has made the State incapable of  abridging  or
taking	away these rights to the extent guaranteed, and	 has
itself	shown how far the enjoyment of those rights  can  be
curtailed.  It; has given a guaranteed right 'to the  person
affected to move the Court.-, I-le guarantee is worthless if
the rights are capable of being taken away.  This makes	 our
Constitution unique and the American precedents cannot be of
much assistance.

According  to  Vedel,  a  prohibition  in  the	Constitution
against its own amendment has a political but not  juridical
value,	and from the juridical point of view, a	 declaration
of absolute constitutional immutability cannot be  imagined.
The  constituent  power being supreme, the State  cannot  be
fettered  even	by itself.  He notices,	 however,  that	 the
Constitution   of  1791	 limited  the  power  of   amendment

Constitutions,	all very much alike, while the British	have
slowly	changed	 their entire structure from  a	 monarchical
executive  to an executive from Parliament and have  reduced
the  power of the House of Lords.  Cambell-Bannerman  former
Prime  Minister	 of  England summed  up	 the  difference  to
Ambassador M. de Fleurian thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">	      "....  Quand nous faisons une Revolution, nous
	      ne ditruisons
	      pas notre maison, nous en conservons avec soin
	      la  facade,  et, derriere cette  facade,	nous
	      reconstruisons  une  nouvelle  maison.   Vous,
	      Francais, agissez autrement; vous jetez bas le
	      vieil  edifice et vous reconstruisez  la	mime
	      maison  avec une autre facade et sous  un	 nom
	      different."  (When we make a Revolution we  do
	      not  destroy an house, we save with  care	 the
	      facade and behind construct a new house.	You,
	      Frenchmen,  act differently.  You	 throw	down
	      the  old edifice and you reconstruct the	same
	      house  with  a different facade  and  under  a

</blockquote><p id="p_378">M.de Fleurian agreed that there was a lot of truth in  it
(ll ya du vrai dans cette boutade) (2).
</p><p id="p_379">But of course to a Frenchman brought up in a legal system in
which the Courts do not declare even an ordinary statute  to
be  invalid,  the  idea	 of  the  unconstitutionality  of  a
constitutional	amendment does not even occur.	 France	 and
Belgium	  have	 created  no   machinery   for	 questioning
legislation and rely on moral and political sanctions.	Even
an  English  lawyer and less so an American lawyer  find  it
difficult to understand how the legality of an amendment  of
the Constitution can ever be questioned.  It

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">877</span>
<p id="p_381">appears	 to them that the procedure for the amendment  being
gone through there is no one to question and what emerges is
the  Constitution as valid as the old Constitution and	just
as  binding.   The matter, however, has to be looked  at  in
this  way.   Where the Constitution is	overthrown  and	 the
Courts lose their position under the old Constitution,	they
may  not  be  able  to	pass on	 the  validity	of  the	 new
Constitution.  This is the, result of a revolution pure	 and
simple.	 Where the new Constitution is not accepted and	 the
people	have  not acquiesced in the change  and	 the  courts
under the old Constitution function, the courts can  declare
the  new  Constitution to be void.  Perhaps  even  when	 the
people acquiesce and a new Government comes into being,	 the
courts may still declare the new Constitution to be  invalid
but  only  if moved to do so.  It is only  when	 the  courts
begin  to  function  under the new  Constitution  that	they
cannot consider the vires of that Constitution because	then
they  owe their existence to it.  I agree with Or  field  in
these  observations taken from his book.  He, however,	does
not include amendments of the Constitution in these  remarks
and  expressly	omits them.  His opinion seems	to  indicate
that in the case of amendments courts are completely free to
see  that the prescribed constitutional mode, of  alteration
is complied with and the alteration is within the permissive
limits	to which the Constitution wishes the  amendments  to
go.   This is true of all amendments but particularly of  an
amendment  seeking to repeal the courts' decision and  being
small  in dimension, leaves the courts free to consider	 its
validity.   The	 courts derive the power from  the  existing
terms  of  the Constitution and the amendment  fails  if  it
seeks to overbear some existing restriction on legislation.
What  I have said does not mean that Fundamental Rights	 are
not  subject  to  change  or  modification.   In  the	most
inalienable  of	 such  rights a	 distinction  must  be	made
between	 possession of a right and its exercise.  The  first
is fixed and the latter controlled by justice and necessity.
Take for example <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_734">Art. 21 :</a>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">	      "No  person shall be deprived of his  life  or
	      personal liberty except according to procedure
	      established by law".
</blockquote><p id="p_382">Of  all	 the rights, the right to one's life,  is  the	most
valuable.   This  article of  the  Constitution,  therefore,
makes. the right fundamental.  But the inalienable right  is
curtailed by a murderer's conduct as viewed under law.	 The
deprivation, when it takes place, is not of the right  which
was  immutable but of the continued exercise of	 the  right.
Take  a Directive Principle which is not enforceable at	 law
but where the same result is reached.  The right to  employ-
ment is a directive principle.	Some countries even view  it
as  a  Fundamental Right.  The exercise,  however,  of	that
right  must  depend upon the capacity of Society  to  afford
employment to all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">878</span>
and sundry.  The possession of this right cannot be confused
with  its exercise.  One right here is positive and  can  be
enforced  although its, exercise can be curtailed  or  taken
away, the other is a right which, the State must try to give
but  which cannot be enforced.	The Constitution  permits  a
curtailment  of	 the  exercise of most	of  the	 Fundamental
Rights by stating the limits of that curtailment.  But	this
power  does  not permit the, State itself, to take  away  or
abridge the right beyond the limits set by the Constitution.
It  must  also	be  remembered	that  the  rights  of	one%
individual  are	 often	opposed by  the	 rights	 of  another
individual   and   thus	  also	 become	  limitative.	 The
Constitution in this way" permits the Fundamental Rights  to
be controlled in their exercise but prohibits their erasure.
It  is	argued that such approach makes Society	 static	 and
robs the State of its sovereignty.  It is submitted that  it
leaves	revolution  as	the holy alternative  if  change  is
necessary.   This is not  right.  The whole Constitution  is
open  to amendment only two dozen articles are	outside	 the
reach  of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_735">Art. 368.</a>  That too because the  Constitution	 has
made  them  fundamental.   What is being  suggested  by	 the
counsel	 or  the State is itself a  revolution,	 because  as
things are that method of,amendment is illegal.	 There is  a
legal method.  Parliament must act in a different way  reach
the Fundamental Rights.	 The State must reproduce the  power
which  it has chosen to put under a restraint.	Just as	 the
French	or the Japanese,etc. cannot change the	articles  of
their  Constitution which are, made free, from the power  of
amendment and' must call a convention or a constituent body,
so   also  we'	India  cannot  abridge	or  take  away	 the
Fundamental   Rights  by  the  ordinary	 amending   process.
Parliament   must   amend  <a href="/doc/1915616/" id="a_736">Art.	 369</a>  to   convoke   another
Constituent  Assembly pass a law under item 97 of the  First
List of Schedule VII to call a Constituent Assembly and then
that  assembly	may  be able to abridge	 or  take  away	 the
Fundamental Rights if desired.	It cannot be done otherwise.
The  majority in Sajjan Singh's case(1)	 suggested  bringing
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_737">Art.  32</a>  under	 the Proviso to improve	 protection  to	 the
Fundamental  Rights.  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_738">Article 32</a> does not stand in  need  of
this Protection.  To abridge or take away that article	(and
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_739">the  same  is  true  of	 all  other  Fundamental  Rights)</a>  a
constituent  body  and not a constituted body  is  required.
Parliament  today  is  a constituted  body  with  powers  of
legislation which include amendments of the Constitution  by
a  special majority but only so far as <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_740">Art. 13	(2)</a>  allows.
To bring into existence a constituent body is not impossible
as, I had ventured to suggest during the hearing and which I
have now more fully explained here.It may be said that. this
is  not	 necessary  because  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_741">Art.  368</a>	can  be	 amended  by
Parliament  to confer on itself constituent powers over	 the
Fundamental  Rights.  This would he wrong and against-	<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_742">Art.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">879</span>
<p id="p_383">powers	in this way and do indirectly which it	is  intended
not   to  de.  directly.   The	State  does  not  lose	 its
sovereignty.  but as it has chosen. to create,	self-imposed
restrictions through one constituent body those restrictions
cannot	be ignored by a constituted body which	makes  laws.
Laws  so  made can affect those parts  of  the	Constitution
which are outside the restriction in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_743">Art. 13 (2)</a> but any'law
(legislative  or  mendatory)  passed by	 such  a  body	must
conform	 to  that article.  To be able to abridge,  or	take
away  the Fundamental Rights which give so  many  assurances
and  guarantees	 a  fresh  Constituent	Assembly  must	 be,
convoked.   Without  such  action  the	protection  of	 the
Fundamental Rights must remain immutable and any attempt  to
abridge or take them away in any other way must be  regarded
as revolutionary.
</p><p id="p_384">I  shall  now  consider the amendments	of  the	 Fundamental
Rights	made since the adoption of the Constitution, with  a
view to illustrating my meaning.  Part III is divided  under
different  headings.   They are (a), General  (b)  Right  to
Eqility (c) Right to Freedom (d) Right against	exploitation
</p><p id="p_385">(e)   Right  to	 Freedom  of  Religion	(f)   Cultural	 and
Educational  Rights  (g)  Right to  Property  (h)  Right  to
Constitutional Remedies.  I shall first deal with amendments
of topics other than the topic (g)- Right to Property.	'The
articles  which are amended in the past are Art 15 &amp; and  19
by the 1st Amendment (18th June 1951) and Art, 16 by the 7th
Amendment (19th October 1956).	The 16th Amendment added the
words  "the  sovereignty  and integrity	 of  India  to	some
clauses.   As  that  does  not	abridge	 or  take  away	 any
Fundamental  Right, I shall not refer to the 16th  Amendment
hereafter.   That Amendment was valid.	The changes so	made
may   be  summarized.	In  <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_744">Art.  15</a>,  which   deals   with.
prohibition  or	 discrimination on the ground  of  religion,
race,  caste, sex or place of birth, clause (3) allowed	 the
State  to make special provision for women and children.   A
new clause was added which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">	      "(4) Nothing in this article or in clause	 (2)
	      of  <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_745">article  29</a> shall prevent the	 State	from
	      making   any   special   provision   for	 the
	      advancement of any socially and  educationally
	      backward	classes	 of  citizens  or  for	 the
	      Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes".
</blockquote><p id="p_386">It  is argued by counsel for the State that by	lifting	 the
ban  to	 make  special- provision for  backward	 classes  of
citizens,   there  is  discrimination  against	the   higher
classes.   This	 is the view which classes in  a  privileged
position who had discriminated against the backward ,classes
for centuries, might indeed take.  But I cannot accept	this
contention.   The Constitution is intended to secure to	 all
citizens  "Justice,  social,  economic	and  political	 and
Equality of status and opportunity" (vide the Preamble)	 and
the Directive Principles include <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_746">Art. 38</a> which provides:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">880</span>
<p id="p_387">.lm15
"38  The  State shall strive to promote the welfare  of	 the
people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a
social	 order	in  which  justice,  social,  economic	 and
political, shall inform all the institutions of the national
life."
</p><p id="p_388">To   remove  the  effect  of  centuries	 of   discriminatory
treatment  and to raise the down-trodden to an equal  status
cannot	be regarded ,as discriminatory against any one.	  It
is  no doubt true that in State of Madras  v..	Champakam(1)
the  reservation  of seats for Backward	 Classes,  Scheduled
Castes	and  Tribes in public educational  institutions	 was
considered  invalid.   Articles 16(4) and  340	had  already
provided  for special treatment for these backward  ,classes
and <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_747">Art. 46</a> had provided that the State shall promote,	with
special care their educational and economic interests.	With
all  ,due  respects the question  of  discrimination  hardly
arose  because	in view of these provisions  any  reasonable
attempt	 to raise the status of the backward  classes  could
have been upheld on the principle of classification.  In any
event,	the  inclusion of this clause to <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_748">Art.  16</a>  does	 not
abridge or take away any one's Fundamental Rights unless the
view be taken that the backward classes for ever must remain
backward.
</p><p id="p_389">By  the First Amendment the second and the sixth clauses  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_749">Art.  19</a>  were	also  amended.	The  original  cl.  (2)	 was
substituted by a new clause and certain words were added  in
clause	(6).   The  changes may be  seen  by  comparing	 the
unamended and the amended clauses side by side :
	 "19( 1) All citizens shall have the right-

The amendment was necessary because in Romesh Thapar v State
of  Madras(2)  it  was	held  that  disturbances  of  public
tranquallity did not come within the expression	 "undermines

<p id="p_394">rity of the State".  Later the Supreme Court itself observed
in the <a href="/doc/792995/" id="a_750">State of Bihar v. Shailabala Devi</a>(1) that this  Court
did  not intend to lay down that an offence  against  public
order  could  not in any case come within  that	 expression.
The changes related to (a) "friendly relations with  foreign
States",  (b)  "public	order" and  (c)	 "incitement  to  an
offence"  and  the words ."undermines the  security  of	 the
State  or tends to, overthrow the State". were	replaced  by
the  words "in the interests of the security of the  State".
This change could be made in view of the existing provisions
of  the	 clause as the later decision of  this	Court  above
cited  'clearly show that "public order" and "incitement  to
offence"  were	already	 comprehended.	 The  amendment	 was
within the permissible limits as it did not abridge or	take
away any Fundamental Right.

section which read

which  the  original  clause (6)  created  some	 exceptions)
allowed the State to make laws imposing, in the interests of
the general public, reasonable restrictions on the  exercise
of  the right conferred by the sub-clause.  A  law  creating
restrictions   can,   of  course,  be	made   outside	 the

right  in  the state was required in the  interests  of	 the
general	 public, then the exercise of the right to  practise
profession  or to carry on an occupation, trade or  business
could  be  suitably  curtailed.	  It  cannot  be  said	that

already	 set  out elsewhere and considered.   Ownership	 and
exchange  of  property are thus recognised by  the  article.
The word "property" is is not defined and I shall  presently
consider  what may be included in 'property'.  Whatever	 the
nature of property, it is clear that by the first clause  of
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_761">Art.  3	 1</a>  the right to property may be  taken	 away  under
authority  of law.  This was subject to one condition  under
the original <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_762">Art. 3 1</a>, namely, that the law must either	 fix
the   compensation  for	 the  deprivation  or  specify	 the
principles on which and the manner in which compensation was
to,  be	 determined and given.	This was the  heart  of	 the
institution  'of property as understood by  the	 Constituent
Assembly.  The rest of the article only gave  constitutional
support against the second clause, to legislation already on
foot  in  the States.  This created a Fundamental  Right  in
property.  The question may now be
885,
asked,:why-  was  it necessary to make	such  a	 Fundamental
Right at all ?
</p><p id="p_426">There  is no natural right in property and as Burke said  in
his Reflections, Government is not made in virtue of natural
rights, which may and do exist in total independence of	 it.
Natural	 rights	 embrace  activity  outside  the  status  of
citizen.  Legal rights are required for free existence as  a
social	being  and  the State undertakes  to  protect  them.
Fundamental Rights are those rights which the State enforces
against	  itself.   Looking  at	 the  matter   briefly	 but
historically, it may be said that the Greeks were not  aware
of  these distinctions for as Gierke(1) points out they	 did
not  distinguish  between  personality	as  a  citizen	 and
personality  as a human being.	For them the Individual	 was
merged	in the citizen and the citizen in the State.   There
was personal liberty and private law but there was no  sharp
division  between the different kinds of laws.	 The  Romans
evolved this gradually not when the Roman Republic  existed,
but when the notion of a Fiscus developed in the Empire	 And
the  legal personality of the Individual was separated	from
his  membership	 of the State.	It was then that  the  State
began  to  recognize  the rights of the	 Individual  in	 his
dealings with the State.  It was Cicero(2) who was the first
to declare that the' primary duty of the Governor of a State
was  to secure to each individual in the possession  of	 his
property.  Here we may see a recognition of the ownership of
property as a Fundamental Right.  This idea wasso  engrained
in early social philosophy that we find Locke opining in his
Civil Government' (Ch. 7) that "Government has no other	 end
but the preservation of property".  The concepts of liberty,
equality and religious freedom were well-known.	 To them was
added  the  concept  of property  rights.   Later  the	list
included   "equalitas,	 libertas   ius	  securitatis,	 ius
defensionis and ius puniendi.  The concept of property right
gained further support from Bentham and Spencer and Kant and
Hegel(3).   The	 term  property	 in  its  pristine   meaning
embraced  only	land  but it soon came to  mean	 much  more.
According to Noyes(4)_
	      "Property is any protected right or bundle  of
	      rights  (interest	 or thing) with	 direct,  or
	      indirect	regard to any external object  (i.e.
	      other  than  the	person	himself)  which	  is
	      material	or quasi material (i.e. a  protected
	      ,process)	  and  which  the  then	 and   there
	      Organisation  of Society permits to be  either
	      private  or public, which is connoted  by	 the
	      legal  concepts of occupying,  possessing	 or,
	      using".

The right is enforced by excluding entry or interference  by
a per. son not legally entitled.  The position of the  State
vis a vis the individual is the subject of Arts. 19 and	 31,
31-A and 31-B.
</p><p id="p_428">Now in the enjoyment, the ultimate right may be an  interest
which  is  connected  to  the object  through  a  series  of
intermediaries	in which each 'holder' from the last to	 the
first  'holds  of' 'the holder' before him.  Time  was	when
there  was  a  lot of 'free property'  which  was  open	 for
appropriation.	  As   Noyes(')	 puts  it,   "all   physical
manifestations	capable	 of being  detected,  localised	 and
identified"  can be the objects of property.  One  exception
now made by all civilized nations is that humanbeings are no
longer	appropriable.	If any free property  was  available
then  it could be brought into possession and  ownership  by
mere  taking.  It has been very aptly said that all  private
property  is  a	 system	 of  monopolies	 and  the  right  to
monopolise  lies  at the foundation of	the  institution  of
property.  Pound(-) in classifying right in rem puts private
property along with personal integrity [right against injury
to  life,  body	 and health  (bodily  or  mental),  personal
liberty	 (free motion and locomotion)], Society and  control
of  one's  family  and dependents.   An	 extremely  valuable
definition of ownership is to be found in the Restatement of
the Law of Property where it is said :
</p><p id="p_429">"It  is	 the totality of rights as to any  specific  objects
which  are  accorded by law, at any time  and  place,  after
deducting social reservations".
</p><p id="p_430">This is the core from which some rights may be detached	 but
to which they must return when liberated.
</p><p id="p_431">The right to property in its primordial meaning involved the
acquisition, of 'a free object by -possession and conversion
of this possession into ownership by the protection of State
or the ability to exclude interference.	 As the notion of  a
State grew, the right of property was strong or we according
to  the	 force	of  political  opinion	backing	 it  or	 the
legislative  support of the State.  The	 English  considered
the  right  as the, foundation	of  society.   Blackstone(&amp;)
explained it on religious; and social ground% claiming
universality  for it and called it the right of the  English
people.	  William'   Paley(4),although	 he   thought	 the
institution paradoxical and unnatural  found   it  full	  of
advantage and Mackintosh in his famous diatribe against	 the
French	Revolution  described  it  as  the   "sheet-anchorof
society".   This in"stitution' appeared in the Magna  Carta,
in  the American Declaration of Independence and the  French
Declaration of Rights of Man.  Later we find it in many

<p id="p_434">Constitutions described as Fundamental, general and  guaran-
teed(1).
</p><p id="p_435">Our Constitution accepted the theory that Right of  Property
is  a fundamental right.  In my opinion it was an  error  to
place it in that category.  Like the original <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_763">Art. 16</a> of the
Draft  Bill  of the Constitution which	assured	 freedom  of
trade,	commerce  and intercourse within  the  territory  of
India  as  a fundamental right but was	later  removed,	 the
right  of  property should have been placed in	a  different
chapter.   Of all the fundamental rights it is the  weakest.
Even  in the most democratic of Constitutions, (namely,	 the
West German Constitution of 1949) there was a provision that
lands, minerals and means of production might be  socialised
or  subjected  to  control.  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_764">Art.  31</a>,	if  it	contemplated
socialization  in  the	same way in India  should  not	have
insisted  so plainly upon payment of compensation.   Several
speakers warned Pandit Nehru and others of the danger of the
second clause of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_765">Art. 31</a>, but it seems that the	 Constituent
Assembly was quite content that under it the Judiciary would
have no say in the matter of compensation.  Perhaps the dead
hand of<a href="/doc/1084525/" id="a_766"> s. 299</a> of the Constitution Act of 1935 was upon	 the
Constituent  Assembly.	Ignored were the resolutions  passed
by  the National Planning Committee of the  Congress  (1941)
which	had   advocated	 the  co-operative   principle	 for
exploitation of land, the Resolution of 1947 that land	with
its  mineral resources and all other means of production  as
well  as  distribution and exchange must belong	 to  and  be
regulated  by  the  Community, and the	warning	 of  Mahatma
Gandhi that if compensation had to be paid we would have  to
rob  Peter to pay Paul(2) In the Constituent  Assembly,	 the
Congress (Which wielded the majority then, as it does today)
was  satisfied	with  the Reprt	 of  the  Congress  Agrarian
Reforms	 Committee 1949 which declared itself in  favour  of
the elimination of all intermediaries between the State	 and
the tiller and imposition of prohibition against subletting.
The  Abolition Bills were the result.  Obviously the  Sardar
Patel Committee on Fundamental Rights was not prepared to go
far.   In  the debates that followed,  many  amendments	 and
suggestions to alter the draft article protecting  property,
failed.	  The  attitude was summed up by Sardar	 Patel.	  He
conceded that land would be required for public purposes but
hopefully  added : "not only land but so many  other  things
may  have to be acquired.  And the State will  acquire	them
after paying compensation and not expropriate thenm". (3)

Asaete rights) cannot be abolished but if the State requires
the owner must surrender the property and he is compensated.

<p id="p_437">What  was then the theory about Right- to Property  accepted
by  the Constituent Assembly ? Again I can only describe  it
historically.  Grotius(1) had treated the right as  acquired
right  (ius  quaesitum) and ownership (dominium)  as  either
serving	 individual  interests (vulgare) or for	 the  public
good (eminens).	 According to him, the acquired right had to
give  way to eminent domain (ex vi auper-eminentis  dominii)
but  there must be public interest (publicautilitas) and  if
possible  compensation.	  In-- the  social  contract  theory
also  .	 the contract included protection of  property	with
recognition  of the power of the ruler to act in the  public
interest  and emergency.  Our constitutional theory  treated
property rights as inviolable except through law for  public
good  and on payment of compensation.  Our Constitution	 saw
the  matter  in	 the  way  of  Grotius	but  overlooked	 the
possibility that just compensation may. not be possible.  It
follows	 almost	 literally the German jurist  Ulrich  Zasius
(except	 in one respect) : Princeps non potest auferee	mihi
rem mean sive iure gentium, sive civile sit facta mea.
All  would,  have  been well if	 the  Courts  had  construed
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_767">Article 31</a> differently.	 However, the decisions of the	High
Courts	and the Supreme Court, interpreting  and  expounding
this  philosophy took a different view of  compensation.   I
shall  refer  only to some of them., First  the	 Patna	High
Court  in.  <a href="/doc/219225/" id="a_768">Kameshwar v. Bihar</a>(2) applied <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_769">Art. 14</a> to  strike
down   the   Reforms  Act  in  Bihar  holding	it   to	  be
discriminatory.	 This need not have occasioned an  amendment
because	 the  matter could have been righted, as  indeed  it
wag,  by,an appeal to the Supreme Court [see <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_770">State of  Bihar
v.  Kameshwar</a>(3)].The Constitution  (First  Amendment)	Act,
1951  followed.	 It left <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_771">Art. 31</a> intact but added two  fresh
articles, Arts.	 31-A and 31-B which are respectively headed
"saving	 of laws providing for acquisition of estates  etc."
and "Validation of certain Acts and Regulations" and added a
schedule  (Ninth) to be read with Art 31-B  naming  thirteen
Acts  of  the State Legislatures.  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_772">Article 31-A</a>	 was  deemed
always	to  have  been	inserted and  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_773">Art.  31-B</a>  wiped	 out

The  West Bengal Land Development and Planning Act and	some
others	could have been thought of in this  connection.	  By
this device, which can be extended easily to other  spheres,
the  Fundamental Rights can be completely emasculated  by  a
2/3  majority,	even though they cannot be  touched  in	 the
ordinary  way  by a unanimousvote of the same body  of	men!
The  State Legislatures may drive a coach and  pair  through
the  Fundamental Rights and the Parliament by  2/3  majority
will  then put them outside the jurisdiction of the  courts.
Was  it	 really intended that the  restriction	against	 the
State  in Arts. 13(2) might be overcome by the two  agencies
acting hand in hand ?
</p><p id="p_449"> <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_779">Article  3 1</a> A dealt with the acquisition by the  State  of
an  .estate' or of any rights therein or the  extinguishment
or  modification  of any such rights.  A law  of  the  State
could do these with the President's assent, although,it took
away  or  abridged  any	 of  the  rights  conferred  by	 any
provisions  of Part Ill.  The words 'estate' and 'rights  in
relation  to  an estate' were defined.	 The  constitutional
amendment  was	challenged in Sankari  Prasad's	 case(1)  on
various	 grounds  but was upheld mainly on  two	 grounds  to
which I objected in Sajjan Singh's case(2).  I have shown in
this judgment, for reasons which I need not repeat and which
must  be  read	in addition to what I said  on	the  earlier
occasion, that I disagree respectfully but strongly with the
view  of  the Court in those two cases.	  This	touches	 the
first part of the amendment which created <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_780">Art.31-A.</a> I do not
and  cannot  question  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_781">Art.31-A</a>	 because  (a)  it  was	 not
considered at the hearing of this case, and (b) it has stood
for  a	long  time as part of  the  Constitution  under	 the
decision  of  this Court and has been acquiesced in  by	 the
people.	  If I was free I should say that the amendment	 was
not  legal and certainly not justified by the reasons  given
in the earlier cases of this Court.  Under the original <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_782">Art.
31</a>,  compensation  had	to be paid for	acquisition  by	 the
State.	This was the minimum requirement of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_783">Art. 31 (1)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_784">(2)</a>  and  no  amendment	 could	be  made  by  a	 constituted
parliament   to	 avoid	compensation.	A  law	made  by   a
constituted Parliament had to conform to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_785">Art. 13(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_786">Art.
31</a> could not be ignored.
</p><p id="p_450">In 1954 the Supreme Court in a series of cases drew the dis-
tinction between <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_787">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_788">Art. 31</a>, particularly  in

	      question	in any court on the ground that	 the
	      compensation  provided  by  that	law  is	 not
	      adequate".
</blockquote><p id="p_452">The opening words of the former second clause were  modified
to  make them more effective but the muzzling of  courts  in
the matter of adequacy of the compensation was the important
move.  As Basu says :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">	      "It  is  evident that the	 1955  amendment  of
	      clause (2) eats	into  the  vitals   of	 the

	      demonstrate  a drift from the meetings of	 the
	      American	concept	 of  private  Property	 and
	      judicial review to which our Constitution	 was
	      hitherto tied, to that of socialism."(1)
It  is	appropriate  to recall here  that  as  expounded  by
Professor  Beard  (2) (whose views offended Holmes  and	 the
Times  of New York but which are now being recognised  after
his  further explanation(3) the Constitution of	 the  United
States	is  an economic document prepared by  men  who	were
wealthy or allied with property rights, that it is based  on
the  concept  that the fundamental rights  of  property	 are
anterior  to  Government and morally beyond  the,  reach  of
popular majorities and that the Supreme Court of the  United
States preserved the property rights till the New Deal	era.
</blockquote><p id="p_453">The,  threat at that time was to enlarge the  Supreme  Court
but  not  to amend the Constitution.  It  appears  that	 the
Indian Socialists charged with the idea of Marx, the  Webbs,
Green,	Laski  and  others  viewed  property  rights  in   a
different  way.	  Pandit  Nehru once said  that	 he  had  no
property  sense,meaning	 that he did not value	property  at
all.   The Constitution seems to have changed  its  property
significantly.	In addition to avoiding

<p id="p_456">the concept of just compensation, the amendment added a	 new
clause (2A) as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">	      "(2A)  Where  a law does not provide  for	 the

	      possession of, any property to the State or to

	      any person of his property."
</blockquote><p id="p_457">This  narrowed the field in which compensation was  payable.
In addition to this, clause (1) of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_795">Art. 31-A</a> was substituted
and  was  deemed to be always substituted by  a	 new  clause
which provided:

in clause (2) (b) after the words 'tenure-holder' the  words

towards	 private  property  was made  longer  and  curiously
enough	it  was done retrospectively from the  time  of	 the
Constituent  Assembly and so to speak, in its name.   As  to
the   retrospective  operation	of   these,   Constitutional
amendment.  I entertain considerable doubt... A	 Constituent
Assembly makes a new Constitution for itself.  Parliament is
not even a Constituent Assembly and to. abridge	 fundamental
rights	in  the	 name of the  Constituent  Assembly  appears
anomalous.   I am reminded of the conversation between	apo-
leon  and Abe . Sieyes, the, great jurist whose	 ability  to
draw  up one Constitution after another has been  recognised
and  none of whose efforts lasted for long.   When  Napoleon
asked him "what has survived ?" Abe Sieyes answered "I	have
survived".   I	wonder if the Constituent Assembly  will  be
able  to  say the same thing  What it had  written  or	the,
subject of property rights, appears to have been written  on
water.	 The  Fourth Amendment served to do  away  with	 the
distinction  made by this Court between Arts. 19 and 31	 and
the  theory of just compensation.  The Fourth Amendment	 has
not been challenged before us.	Nor was it challenged at any
time  before.  For the reasons for which I have declined  to
consider the First Amendment I	refrain from considering the
validity  of  the  Fourth Amendment.  It  may,	however,  be
stated here that if I was free to consider it,, I would have
found great difficulty in accepting that the  constitutional
guarantee could be abridged in this way.
</p><p id="p_464">I may say here that the method I have followed in not recon-
, sidering an amendment which has stood for a long time, was
also invoked by the Supreme Court of United: States in Leser
v.   Garnett(1).  A  constitution  works  only	because	  of
universal  recognition.	 This recognition may. be  voluntary
or forced where people have lost liberty of speech.  But the
acquiescence  of the people is necessary for the working  of
the  Constitution.   The  examples  of	our  neighbours,  of
Germany, of Rhodesia and others illustrates the	 recognition
of Constitutions by acquiescence.. It is obvious that it  is
good  sense and sound policy for the 'Courts to	 decline  to
take 'up an amendment for consideration after a considerable
lapse  of  time when it was not challenged  before,  or	 was
sustained on an earlier occasion after challenge.

<p id="p_465">It  is	necessary to pause here and see	 what  the  property
rights	have  become under the	repeated  and  retrospective
amendments  of the Constitution.  I have already  said	that
the Constitution started with the concept of which,  Grotius
may'  be  said to be the author, although his  name  is	 not
particularly  famous  for  theories  of	 constitutional	  or
municipal  laws.   The	socialistic  tendencies	 which	 the
amendments  now manifest take into consideration some  later
theories  about	 the  institution of  property.	  When	the-
original  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_800">Art. 31</a> was moved by Pandit Jawaharlal  Nehru,  he
had described it as a compromise between various  approaches
to  the question and said that it did justice  and  equality
not  only  to the individual but also to the  community'  He
accepted  the principle of compensation but compensation  as
determined  by the Legislature and not the  Judiciary.	 His
words were
	      "The  law should do it.  Parliament should  do
	      it.   There  is no reference in  this  to	 any
	      judiciary	 coming	 into  the  picture.	Much
	      thought  has  been given to it and  there	 has
	      been  much  debate as to where  the  judiciary
	      comes  in.  Eminent lawyers have told us	that
	      on  a  proper  construction  of  this  clause,
	      normally	speaking  the judiciary	 should	 not
	      come   in.    Parliament	fixes	either	 the
	      compensation itself or the principle governing
	      that  compensation  and  they  should  not  be
	      challenged except for one reason, where it  is
	      thought  that there has been a gross abuse  of
	      the  law,	 where, in fact, there	has  been  a
	      fraud  on	 the  Constitution.   Naturally	 the
	      judiciary comes in to see if there has been  a
	      fraud on the Constitution or not."(1)
He  traced  the	 evolution of  property	 and  observed	that
property  was becoming a question of credit, of	 monopolies,
that  there  were  two	approaches,  the  approach  of	 the
Individual and the approach of the community.  He  expressed
for  the for protection of the indi vidual's rights.(2)	 The
attitude changed at the time of the First Amendment.  Pandit
Nehru  propheised that the basic problem would	come  before
the  House  from time to, time.	 That it has,  there  is  no
doubt,	just  as  there	 is no	doubt  that  each  time	 the
individual's rights have suffered.
</p><p id="p_466">Of  course,  the growth of collectivist theories  have	made
elsewhere  considerable inroads into the right of  property.
In Russia there is no private ownership of. land and even in
the Federal Capital Territory of Australia, the ownership of
land  is  with	the  Crown and	the  individual	 can  get  a
leasehold  right only.	Justification for this is  found  in
the fact that the State must benefit from

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">895</span>
<p id="p_467">the  rise in the value of land.	 The paucity of land and  of
dwelling houses have led to the control of urban  properties
and  creation  of  statutory tenancies.	 In  our  country  a
ceiling	 is put on agricultural land held by an	 individual.
The Supreme Court, in spite of this, has not frustrated	 any
genuine legislation for agrarian reform.  It has upheld	 the
laws   by  which  the  lands  from  latifundia	 have	been
distributed  among  the	 landless.  It	seems  that  as	 the
Constitutions of Peru, Brazil, Poland, Latvia, Lethuania and
Mexico	contain provisions for such reforms, mainly  without
payment	 of compensation, our Parliament has taken the	same
road.	Of course, the modem theory regards the	 institution
of proper on a functional basis(1) which means that property
to  be	productive must be property  distributed.   As	many
writers	 have said property is now a duty more than a  right
and  ownership	of  property entails  a	 social	 obligation.
Although Duguit(2), who is ahead of others, thinks that	 the
institution  of	 property has undergone	 a  revolution,	 the
rights	of the Individual are not quite gone,  except  where
Communism  is firmly entrenched.  The rights  are  qualified
but  property belongs still to the owner.   The	 Seventeenth
Amendment,  however,  seems to take us far away,  from	even
this  qualified concept, at least in so far as "estates"  as
defined by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_801">Art. 31-A.</a>  This is the culmination of a process.
Previous to the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act the
Constitution  (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 had given  power
indirectly  by	altering  entry No. 42	in  List  III.	 The
entries may be read side by side :
</p><p id="p_468">"42.	   (Before Amendment) (After Amendment)
Principles   on	 which	compensation  for  Acquisition	 and
requisitioning,	  of   pro	    property   acquired	  or
requisitioned  for perty. the purposes of the Union or of  a
State  or for any other public purpose is to be	 determined,
and the form and the manner in which such compensation is to
be given."
</p><p id="p_469">This  removed the last reference to compensation in  respect
of acquisition and requisition.	 What this amendment  began,
the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964  achieved
in   full.    The  Fourth  Amendment  had   added   to	 the
comprehensive definition of 'right in relation to an estate,
the  rights  of raiyats and under-raiyats.   This  time	 the
expression 'estate' in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_802">Art. 31</a> A was amended retrospectively
by a new definition which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">	      "the expression "estate" shall, in relation to

	      The  only saving of compensation is now to  be
	      found  in the second proviso added  to  clause
	      (1) of the article which reads
	      "Provided	 further that, where any  law  makes
	      any provision for the acquisition by the State
	      of  any estate. and where any  land  comprised

indirectly  in	an  Explanation	 at the	 end  of  the  Ninth
Schedule, in respect of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955.  By
this  explanation  the	provisions of this  Tenancy  Act  in
conflict	 with	     the	proviso		last
last quoted are declared to be void.
</p><p id="p_471">The  sum  total of this amendment is that  except  for	land
within	the  ceiling,all other land can be  acquired  ed  or
rights therein extinguished or modified without compensation
and no. challenge to the law can be made under Arts. 14,  19
or  31	of the Constitution.  The same is also true  of	 the
taking over: of 'the management of any property by the State

<p id="p_477">said  very truly-"Loyality to a petrified opinion never	 yet
broke a chain or freed a human soul"
</p><p id="p_478">I am apprehensive that the erosion of the right to  property
may  be	 practised against other Fundamental Rights.   If  a
halt  is  to  be  called,  we  must  declare  the  right  of
Parliament  to	abridge	 or take  away	Fundamental  Rights.
Small inroads lead to larger inroads and become as  habitual
as before our freedom won The history of freedom is not only
how  freedom is achieved but how it is preserved.  I  am  of
opinion that an attempt to abridge or take away	 Fundamental
Rights by a constituted Parliament even through an amendment
of  the Constitution can be declared void.  This  Court	 has
the  power  and	 jurisdiction to make  the  declaration.   I
dissent	  from	the  opposite  view  expressed	 in   Sajjan
Singh's(1) case and I overrule that decision.
It remains to consider what is the extent of  contravention.
Here  I must make it clear that since the First, Fourth	 and
Seventh	 Amendments  are  not  before me  and  I  have	not,
therefore, questioned them, I must start with the provisions
of Arts. 31, 31-A, 31-B, List III and the Ninth Schedule  as
they  were immediately preceding the Seventeenth  Amendment.
I  have elsewhere given a summary of the inroads  made	into
property  rights  of individuals and Corporations  by  these
earlier	 amendments.   By this amendment the  definition  of
'estate' was repeated for the most part but was extended  to
include:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">	      "(ii) any land held under ryotwari settlement;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_53">	      (iii) any	 land  held  or	 let  for   purposes
	      ancillary	  thereto,  including  waste   land,
	      forest  land,  land for pasture  or  sites  of
	      buildings	 and  other structures	occupied  by
	      cultivators  of land,  agricultural  labourers
	      and village artisans."
</blockquote><p id="p_479">Further reach of acquisition or requisition without adequate
compensation and without a challenge under Arts. 14, 19	 and
31  has	 now  been  made possible.   There  is	no  kind  of
agricultural estate or land which cannot be acquired by	 the
State  even  though it pays an illusory	 compensation.	 The
only  exception is the second proviso added to <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_808">Art.  31-A(1)</a>
by which, lands within the ceiling limit applicable for	 the
time being to a person personally cultivating his land,	 may
be  acquired  only on paying compensation at  a	 rate  which
shall not be less than the-market value.  This may prove: to
be  an illusory protection.  The ceiling may be	 lowered  by
legislation.   The  State may leave the person an  owner  in
name and acquire all his. other rights.	 The latter question
did come before this Court in two cases-<a href="/doc/1657891/" id="a_809">Ajit Singh v.  State
of Punjab</a> (2)
(1) (1965] 1 &amp; C. R. 933

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">899</span>
<p id="p_480">and  <a href="/doc/556997/" id="a_810">Bhagat  Ram and Ors. v. State of Punjab, and  Ors</a>.	 (1)
decided	 on  December  2, 1966.	 My brother  Shelat  and,  I
described the device as a fraud upon this proviso but it  is
obvious	 that a law lowering the ceiling to  almost  nothing
cannot	be declared a fraud on the Constitution.   In  other
words, the agricultural landholders hold land as tenants-at-
will.	To achieve this a large number of Acts of the  State
Legislatures have been added to the Ninth Schedule to  bring
them under the umbrella of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_811">Art. 31-B.</a>  This list may grow.
In my opinion the extension of the definition of 'estate' to
include	 ryotwari and agricultural lands is an	inroad	into
the  Fundamental Rights but it cannot be questioned in	view
of  the	 existence of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_812">Art. 31-A(1) (a)</a> as  already  amended.
The  constitutional  amendment	is a law  and  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_813">Art.  31	 (I)</a>
permits	 the  deprivation of property by authority  of	law.
The  law may be made outside the Constitution or within	 it.
The word 'law' in this clause includes both ordinary law  or
an  amendment of the Constitution.  Since "no law  providing
for  the  acquisition by the State of any estate or  of	 any
rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of	 any
such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it
is  inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of	 the
rights	conferred  by  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_814">Art. 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_815">Art. 19</a>	 or  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_816">Art.  31</a>",	 the
Seventeenth Amendment when it gives a new definition of	 the
word   'estate	cannot	be  questioned	by  reason  of	 the
Constitution  as  it exists.  The new definition  of  estate
introduced  by	the  amendment is beyond the  reach  of	 the
courts not because it is not law but because it is "law" and
falls within that word in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_817">Art. 31 (1) (2) (2-A)</a> and <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_818">Art. 31-
A(1).</a>  1, therefore, sustain the new definition, not on	 the
erroneous  reasoning in Sajjan Singh's case (2 ) but on	 the
true construction of the word 'law' as used in Arts.  13(2),
31(1)(2-A) and 31-A(1).	 The above reason applies a fortiori
to  the	 inclusion of the proviso which preserves  (for	 the
time being) the notion of compensation for deprivation of  a
cultural  property.  The proviso at least  saves  something.
It  prevents the, agricultural lands below the ceiling	from
being appropriated without payment of pro-per  compensation.
It  is	clear,that the proviso at least cannot	be  held  to
abridge	 or take away fundamental rights.  In the  result  I
uphold	the second section of the Constitution	(Seventeenth
Amendment) Act, 1964.
</p><p id="p_481">This  brings me to the third section of the Act.  That	does
no  more than add 44 <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_819">State Act</a>s to the Ninth Schedule.	 The
object	of  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_820">Art.  31-B</a>, when it was  enacted,  was  to	save
certain <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_821">State Act</a>s notwithstanding judicial decision to	 the
contrary.   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_822">These  Act</a>s were already protected by  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_823">Art.	 31.</a>

hended to derogate from the Fundamental Rights.	 The power
under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_824">Art. 368</a>, whatever it may be, was given to amend	 the
Constitution.	Giving.	 protection  to	 statutes  of  State
Legislatures  which  offend  the Constitution  in  its	most
fundamental part, can hardly merit the description amendment
of the Constitution in fact in so cases it is not even known
whether	 the statues in question stand in need of such	aid.
The  intent  is to silence the courts and not to  amend	 the
Constitution.	If  these Acts were', not  included  in	 the
Schedule they would have to face the Fundamental Rights	 and
rely  on  Arts. 31 and 31-A to save them.   By	this  device
protection  far in excess of 'these articles is afforded  to
them.  This in my judgment is not a matter of amendment at
all.   The power which is given is for the specific  purpose
of  amending the Constitution and not to confer validity  on
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_825">State  Act</a>s  against the rest of the Constitution.   If	 the
President's  assent  did  not do this, no  more	 would	this
section.  I consider s.. 3 of the Act., to be invalid as  an
illegitimate  exercise of the powers . of amendment  however
generous.  Ours is the only Constitution in the world  which
carries	 a  long  list of ordinary laws	 which	it  protects
against	 itself,.  In the result I declare<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_826"> s. 3</a> to be  ultra

of  the	 Constitution.	 The  article  gives  power  to	  no
particular  person  or persons.	 All the  named	 authorities
have to act according to the letter	  of the article  to
achieve the result.  The procedure of, amendment, if it	 can
be  called a 'power at all is a legislative power but it  is
sui generi and outside the three lists in Schedule 7 of	 the
Constitution.	'It  does  'not' have to  depend.  upon	 any

members	 present  and voting with a majority  of  the  total

addition to the second requirement, ratification by at least
one,half of the legislatures of the States must be forthcom-
ing.   Besides these methods, <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_828">Art. 13(2)</a> puts an embargo  on
the legislative power of the State and consequently upon the
agencies  of  the  State.  By its means	 the  boundaries  of

amendment   is	peculiarly  American.	But  even   in	 the
Constitution  of the United States of America  some  matters

Constitution  provides for minorities,	religions,  socially
and  educationally  backward peoples, for  ameliorating	 the
condition   of	 depressed  classes,  for   removing   class
distinctions,  titles,	etc.  This reservation was  made  so
that in the words of Madison(3), men of factious tempers, of
local  prejudices, or sinister designs may not by  intrigue,
by  corruption, or other means , first obtain the  suffrages
and then betray the interests of the people.  It was to plug
the  loophole  such  as	 existed in  s.	 48  of	 the  Weimar
Constitution(  4) that <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_831">Art. 13 (2)</a> was. adopted. of  course,

an effective instrument to control and adjust the  Movements
of  the machinery when out of order or in danger  of  self-d

not to derogate from the power of making laws [see  articles
5  to  11, 289(2)].  All these articles	 are  transitory  in
nature and cease to operate when provision is made by law on
the subject.  None of them can be regarded as conferring
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_142">905</span>
the  power  of	'amendment of  the  Constitution.   Most  of
articles continue until provision is made by law made by the
Parliament.   But  some	 of them continue  until  or  unless
provision is made by the State Legislature (see articles 189
(3),  194 (3), 195, 210(2), 229(2), 300(1), 345) or  by	 the
appropriate  legislature (see articles 225,  241(3));  these
articles  do not confer a power of amendment, for the  State
legislature  cannot  amend the Constitution.   Many  of	 the
above-mentioned	 articles  and	also  other  articles	(see

delegate powers of making laws to the legislature.  None  of
these articles gives the power of amending the Constitution.
It  is	said  that <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_854">art. 248</a> and List 1 item 97	of  the	 7th
Schedule read with <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_855">art. 246</a> give the Parliament the power of
amending  the  Constitution.  This argument  does  not	bear
scrutiny.   <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_856">Art.  248</a> and List I item 97 vest  the  residual
power  of legislation in the Parliament.  Like other  powers
of legislation, the residual power of the Parliament to make
laws  is by virtue of <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_857">art. 245</a> subject to the provisions  of
the Constitution.  No law made under the residual power	 can
derogate  from the Constitution or amend it.  If such a	 law
purports to amend the Constitution, it will 'be void.  Under
the  residual  power of legislation, the Parliament  has  no
power to make any law with respect to any matter  enumerated
in  Lists II and III of the 7th Schedule but under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_858">art.	 368</a>
even  Lists  II and III can be amended.	 The  procedure	 for
constitutional	amendments under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_859">art. 368</a> is different	from
the  legislative  procedure  for  passing  laws	 under	 the
residual   power  of  legislation.   If	  a   constitutional
amendment could be made by recourse to the residual power of
legislation and the ordinary legislative procedure, <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_860">art. 368</a>
would  be  meaningless.	  The power  of	 amending  the	Con-
stitution is to be found in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_861">art. 368</a> and not in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_862">art. 248</a> and
List I item 97.	 Like other Constitutions, our	Constitution
makes express provisions for amending the Constitution.
The  heading  of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_863">art. 368</a> shows that it is a  provision	 for
amendment  of the Constitution, the marginal note refers  to
the  procedure for amendment and the body shows that if	 the
procedure is followed, the Constitution shall stand  amended
by the power of the article.
</p><p id="p_518">Chapter	 VIII of the Australian Constitution consists  of  a
single section (S. 128).  The heading is "Alteration of	 the
Constitution".	 The marginal note is "Mode of altering	 the
Constitution".	 The  body  lays  down	the  procedure	 for
alteration.   The  opening words are  :	 "This	Constitution
shall  not  be	altered except	in  the	 following  manner".
Nobody	has  doubted  that the section gives  the  power  of
amending the Constitution.  Wynes in his book on Legislative
Executive and Judicial Powers in Australia, third edition,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">906</span>
p.   695,  stated  "The	 power,	 of  amendment	extends	  to
alteration  of	this  Constitution' which  includes <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_864"> S.	 128</a>
itself.	 It is true that<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_865"> S.   128</a>  is negative in form,	 but
the power is impled by the terms of	the section."
<a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_866">Article 5</a> of the United States Constitution provides that  a
proposal  for amendment of the constitution by the  Congress

Devanter,  J,  in Rhode Island v. Palmer(1): <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_868">Art  .368</a>	uses

innumerable articles.  No one has doubted so far that  these
articles  are  amendable.   Part  III  is  a  part  of	 the
Constitution and is equally amendable.
</p><p id="p_520">It is argued that a <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_872">Constitution Amendment Act</a>.is a law	 and
therefore  the	power  of amendment given  by  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_873">art.  368</a>  is
limited by art. 13(2)., <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_874">Art. 13(2)</a> is in these terms:--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">	      "13(1).......................................
	      (2)   The	 State shall not make any law  which

	      extent of the contravention, be void."
</blockquote><p id="p_521">Now  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_875">art. 3 68</a> gives, the power of amending each  and  every
provision  of the Constitution <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_876">Art. 13 (2)</a> is a part of	 the
Constitution and is within the reach of the amending  power.
In other words art 13 (2) is subject to the overriding power

<p id="p_522">prohibitory injunction in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_879">art. 13(2)</a> is not directed against

(2)</a> does not forbid the making of a constitutional amendment
abridaing or taking away any right confesed by Part III.
Let us now view the matter from a narrower angle.  The	con-
tention is that a constitutional amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_881">art. 368</a> is
a law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_882">art. 13.</a> 1 am inclined to  think
that this narrow contention must also be rejected.
In  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_883">art.  13</a>  unless the context  otherwise  provides  'law'
includes  any ordinance, order, bye-law,  rule,	 regulation,
notification,  custom  or usage having in the  territory  of
India  the force of law [<a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_884">article 13(3).(a)].</a>  The  inclusive
definition  of	law  in <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_885">art. 13 (3)  (c)</a>  neither  expressly
excludes  nor  expressly  includes  the	 Constitution  or  a
constitutional amendment.
</p><p id="p_523">Now  the term law' in its widest and generic sense  includes
the Constitution and a constitutional amendment.  But in the
constitution this term is employed to designate an  ordinary
statute	 or  legislative  act in  contradistinction  to	 the
Constitution	or   a	 constitutional	  amendment.	 The
Constitution  is  the basic law providing the  framework  of
government  and	 creating the organs for the making  of	 the
laws.  The distinction between the Constitution and the laws
is so fundamental that the Constitution is not regarded as a
law  or	 a  legislative act.   The  Constitution  means	 the
Constitution  as amended.  An amendment made  in  conformity
with  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_886">art.  368</a>	 is  a part of	the.   Constitution  and  is
likewise not a law.
</p><p id="p_524">The  basic theory of our Constitution is that it  cannot  be
changed by a law or legislative Act.  It is be-cause special
provision is made by articles 4, 169, Fifth Schedule Part  D
and   Sixth  Schedule  para  21	 that  some  parts  of	 the
Constitution are amendable by ordinary laws.  But by express
provision  no  such  law is deemed to  be  a  constitutional
amendment.  Save as express.1y provided in articles 4,	169,
Fifth Schedule Part D and Sixth Schedule para 21, no law can
amend  the  Constitution, and a law which purports  to	make
such an amendment is void.
</p><p id="p_525">In Marbury v. Madison(1), Marshall, C.J., said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">	      "It   is	a  proposition	too  plain   to	  be
	      contested, that the Constitution controls	 any
	      legislative Act repugnant to it; or, that	 the
	      legislature  may alter the Constitution by  an
	      ordinary Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_56">	      Between these alternatives there is no  middle
	      ground.  The Constitution is either a superior
	      paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means,
	      or it is on a level with

</blockquote><p id="p_526"> Ordinary legislative Acts, and, like other Acts, is  alter-
able when the legislature shall please to alter it.  If	 the
former	part of the alternative be true, then a	 legislative
Act contrary to the Constitution is not law; if the,  latter
part   be  true,  then	written	 constitutions	are   absurd
attempts, on the part of the people, to limit a power in its
own nature illimitable.
</p><p id="p_527">Certainly  all those who have framed  written  constitutions
contemplate  them as forming the fundamental  and  paramount
law  of the nation, and, consequently, the theory  of  every
such  government  must be, that an Act of  the	Legislature,
repugnant  to  the Constitution, is void.   This  theory  is
essentially  attached  to  a written  constitution,  and  is
consequently to be considered, by this court, as one of	 the
fundamental principles of our society."
</p><p id="p_528">It  is	because a <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_887">Constitution Amendment Act</a> can  amend	 the
Constitution  and  is  not a law that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_888">art.  368</a>	 avoids	 all
reference  to  law making by the Parliament.  As soon  as  a
bill is passed in conformity with <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_889">art. 368</a> the	Constitution
stands amended in accordance with the terms of the bill.
The  power of amending the Constitution is not	an  ordinary
law making power.  It is to be found in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_890">art. 368</a> and not  in
articles 245, 246 and 248 and the Seventh Schedule.
Nor  is	 the procedure for amending the	 Constitution  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_891">art.  368</a>  an  ordinary law making  procedure.	 The  common
feature	 of  the  amending process under art,  368  and	 the
legislative procedure is that a bill must be passed by	each
House  of Parliament and assented to by the  President.	  In
other  respects the amending process under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_892">art. 368</a> is	very
different   from   the	ordinary   legislative	 proms.	   A
constitution  amendment	 Act  must be initiated	 by  a	bill
introduced  for that purpose in either House of	 Parliament.
The  bill must be passed in each House by not less than	 two
thirds	of  the members present and  voting,  the  requisite
quorum	in  each  House	 being	a  majority  of	 its   total
membership;  and  in  cases coming under  the  proviso,	 the
amendment  must be ratified by the legislature of  not	less
than one half of the States.  Upon the bill so passed  being
assented  to  by  the President,  the  Constitution  stands.
amended	 in  accordance	 with the terms of  the	 bill.	 The
ordinary  legislative  process	is  much  easier.   A	bill
initiating a law may be passed by a majority of the  members
present and voting at a sitting of each House or at a  joint
sitting of the Houses, the quorum for the meeting of  either
House being one tenth of the total number of members of	 the
House.	 The  bill  so passed on being assented	 to  by	 the
President  becomes a law.  A bill though passed by  all	 the
members of both Houses cannot take effect as a

	      Constitution   amendment	Act  unless  it	  is

<p id="p_537">In  our Constitution, the expression "law" does not  include

</p><p id="p_538">I find no conflict between articles 13(2) and 368.  The	 two

on   laws;  it	makes  no  express  exception  regarding   a
constitutional amendment, because a constitutional amendment
is not a law and is outside its purview.  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_901">Art. 368</a>  occupies
the  field  of	constitutional	amendments.   It  does	 not

gives the power of amending itself, and if express power for
amending  the  provisions of Part III were  needed,  such  a
power could be taken by an amendment of the article.
It  is	said that the non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_903">art.  35</a>  shows

</p><p id="p_539">The next contention is that there are implied limitations on
the amending power.  It is said that apart from <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_905">art. 13	 (2)</a>
there  are expressions in Part III which indicate  that	 the
amending power ,cannot touch Part III.	Part III is headed "
fundamental  rights".  The right to move the  Supreme  Court
for  enforcement  of the rights conferred by  this  Part  is
guaranteed  by	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_906">art. 32</a> and cannot be  suspended  except  as
otherwise provided for by the Constitution (<a href="/doc/393253/" id="a_907">art. 32(4)).</a>  It
is  said  that	the  terms  "fundamental"  and	 "guarantee"
indicate  that	the  rights conferred by  Part	HI  are	 not
amendable.  The argument overlooks the dynamic character  of
the  Constitution.  While the Constitution is static, it  is
the fundamental law of the country, the rights conferred  by
Part  III  are,	 fundamental, the right	 under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_908">art.  32</a>  is
guaranteed, and the principles of State policy enshrined  in
Part  IV are fundamental 'm the governance of  the  country.
But  the Constitution is never at rest; it changes with	 the
progress  of  time.   <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_909">Art. 368</a> provides the  means  for	 the
dynamic	 changes in the Constitution.  The scale  cf  values
embodied in Parts III and IV is not immortal.  Parts III and
IV  being  parts  of the Constitution are  not	immune	from
amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_910">art. 368.</a>
</p><p id="p_540">Demands	 for safeguards of the rights embodied in  Part	 III
and IV may be traced to the Constitution of India Bill 1895,
the  Congress  Resolutions  between  1917  and	1919,	Mrs.
Beasan's  Commonwealth of India Bill of 1925, the Report  of
the Nehru Committee set up under the Congress Resolution  in
1927, the Congress
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">			    911</span>
Resolution of March. 1931 and the Sapru Report of 1945.	 The
American bill of rights,the constitutions of other countries
the  declaration of human rights by the United	Nations	 and
other declarations and charters gave impetus to the  demand.
In  this  background the Constituent  Assembly	embodied  in
preamble to the Constitution the resolution to secure to all
citizens social, economic and political justice, liberty  of
thought, expression, belief, faith and worship, equality  of
status	and opportunity and fraternity assuring the  dignity
of   the  individual  and  the	unity  of  the	nation	 and
incorporated safeguards as to some human rights in Parts III
and  IV of the Constitution after separating them  into	 two
parts  on  the Irish model.  Part III contains	the  passive
obligations  of the State.  It enshrines the right of  life,
personal liberty, expression, assembly, movement, residence,
avocation,  property, culture and education,  constitutional
remedies, and protection against exploitation and  obnoxious
penal  laws.  The State shall not deny these rights save  as
provided  in the Constitution.	Part IV contains the  active
obligations  of the State.  The State shall secure a  social
order in which social, economic and political justice  shall
inform	all the institutions of national life.	 Wealth	 and
its  source of production shall not be concentrated  in	 the
hands of the few but shall be distributed so as to  subserve
the  common  good,  and there shall  be	 adequate  means  of
livelihood for all and equal pay for equal work.  The  State
shall  endeavour  to  secure  the  health  and	strength  of
workers,  the right to work, to education and to  assistance
in  cases  of want, just and humane conditions	of  work,  a
living	wage  for workers, a uniform civil  code,  free	 and
compulsory  education  for children.  The State	 shall	take
steps	to   organize  village	 panchayats,   promote	 the
educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of
the  people,  raise the level of nutrition and	standard  of
living,	 improve  public health. organize  agricultural	 and
animal	husbandry separate the judiciary from executive	 and
promote international peace and security.
The  active obligations of the State under Part IV  are	 not
justiciable.  If a law made by the State in accordance	with
the fundamental directives of Part IV comes in conflict with
the  fundamental rights embodied in Part II the law  to	 the
extent	of repugnancy is void.	Soon after the	Constitution
came  into force, it became apparent that laws for  agrarian
and other reforms for implementing the directives of Part IV
were  liable  to  be  struck  down  as	they  infringed	 the
provisions  of Part III.  From time to	time  constitutional
amendments  were  proposed  with  the  professed  object  of
validating  these laws, superseding certain judicial  inter-
pretations  of	the Constitution and curing defects  in	 the
original  Constitution.	  The First, Fourth,  Sixteenth	 and
Seventeenth   Amendments  made	important  changes  in	 the
fundamental rights.  The First amendment introduced cl.	 (4)
in <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_911">art. 15</a> enabling the State to make special provisions for
the benefit of the socially and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">912</span>
educationally  backward	 class	of  citizens,  the,scheduled
castes and the scheduled tribes in derogation of articles 15
and 29,(2) with a view to implement <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_912">art. 46</a> and to supersede
the decision in <a href="/doc/149321/" id="a_913">State of Madras v. Champakam</a>(1), substituted
a  new cl. (2) in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_914">art. 19</a> with retrospective effect  chiefly
with  a	 view to be in public order within  the	 permissible
restrictions  and  to  supersede  the  decisions  in  Romesh
Thappar	 v.  State of Madras('), Brij Bhushan  v.  State  of
Delhi(-'),,  amended cl. (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_915">art. 19</a> with a view to	free
state trading monopoly from the test of reasonable ness	 and
to supersede the decision in <a href="/doc/553290/" id="a_916">Moti Lal v. Government of State
of Uttar Pradesh</a>().  Under the stress of the First amendment
it  is	now  suggested	that  Champakam's  case('),   Romesh
Thappar's   case(')  and  Motilal's(4)	case  were   wrongly
decided,  and the amendments of articles 15 and 19  were  in
harmony	 with  the original Constitution and  made  no	real
change in it.  It is to be, noticed however that before	 the
First amendment no attempt was made to overrule these cases,
and  but for the amendments, these judicial  interpretations
of  the Constitution would have continued to be the  law  of
the land.  The Zamindari Abolition Acts were the subject  of
bitter	attack	by  the zamindars.   <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_917">The  Bihar	 Act</a>  though
protected by cl. 6 of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_918">art. 31</a> from attack under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_919">art. 31</a>	 was
struck down as violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_920">art. 14</a> by the Patna High  Court
(see  the  <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_921">State of Bihar v.  Maharajadhiraj  Sri  Kameshwar

more  Acts  in the Ninth Schedule, as some of the  Acts	 had
been  struck down as unconstitutional.	The validity of	 the
Seventeenth amendment was upheld in Sajjan Singh's  case(').
Since 1951, numerous decisions of this Court have recognised
the   validity	 of  the  First,  Fourth   and	 Seventeenth
amendments.   If the rights conferred by Part III cannot  be
abridged  or  taken away by constitutional  amendments,	 all
these amendments would be invalid.  The Constitution  makers
could  not have intended that the rights conferred  by	Part
TIT could not be altered for giving effect to the policy  of
Part TV.  Nor was it intended that defects in Part III could
not   be   cured  or  that  possible  errors   in   judicial
interpretations	 of  Part  III could  not  be  rectified  by
constitutional amendments.
</p><p id="p_547">There  are, other indications in the Constitution  that	 the
fundamental rights are not intended to be inviolable.	Some
of  the articles make express provision for  abridgement  of
some  of the fundamental rights by law (see articles  16(3),
19(1) to (6), 22(3), 23(2), 25(2), 28(2), 31(4) to (6),	 33,

the  Parliament	 can  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_943">art. 368</a> amend  <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_944">art.  1</a>  of	 the
Constitution  so as to enable the cession of a part  of	 the
national  territory  to a foreign power, The  Court  brushed
aside  the  argument that "in the transfer of the  areas  of
Berubari to Pakistan the fundamental rights of thousands  of
persons	 are  involved." The case is an	 authority  for	 the
proposition  that  the Parliament can lawfully make  a	con-
stitutional amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_945">art. 368</a> authorising cession  of
a part of the national territory and thereby destroying	 the

</p><p id="p_556">It  is next argued that the people of India in	exercise  of
their  sovereign  power have placed the	 fundamental  rights
beyond	the reach of the amending power.  Reliance is  place
on  the	 following  passage in	the  judgment  of  Patanjali
Sastri, J., in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_947">A. K. Gopalan V.	   The State of Madras</a>(2):

</blockquote><p id="p_557">I  find	 nothing  in  the  passage  contrary  to  the	view
unequivocally  expressed  by the same learned Judge  in	 Sri
Sankari	 Prasad	 Singh Deo's(3) case  that  the	 fundamental
rights	are amendable.	The power to frame the	Constitution
was  vested in the Constituent Assembly by<a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_948"> s. 8</a> (1 ) of	 the
Indian	Independence  Act, 1947.  'The	Constitution  though

<p id="p_559">solemnly declared that all power and authority of  sovereign
independent India, its constituent parts, and organs and the
Government  were derived from the people.  The	preamble  to
the  Constitution declares that the people of India  adopts,
enacts	and gives to themselves the Constitution.   In	form
and in substance the Constitution emanates from the  people.
By the Constitution. the people constituted themselves	into
a republic.  Under the republic all public power is  derived
from  the  people and is exercised by  functionaries  chosen
either	 directly  or  'indirectly  by	the   people.	 The
Parliament can exercise only such powers as are delegated to
it  under the Constitution.  The people acting	through	 the
Constituent Assembly reserved for themselves certain  rights
and liberties and ordained that they shall not be  curtailed
by  ordinary legislation.  But the people by the  same	Con-
stitution also authorised the Parliament to make  amendments
to, the Constitution.  In the exercise of the amending power
the  Parliament has ample authority to abridge or take	away
the fundamental rights under Part III.
</p><p id="p_560">It  is	urged that the word 'amend' imposes  the  limitation
that   an   amendment  must  be	 an   improvement   of	 the
Constitution.  Reliance is placed on the dictum in Livermore
v. E. C. Waite(1): "On, the other hand, the significance  of
the  term  'amendment' implies such an	addition  or  change
within	the lines of the original instrument as will  effect
an improvement, or better carry out the purpose for which it
was  framed." Now an attack on the eighteenth  amendment  of
the  U.S.  Constitution based on this  passage	was  brushed
aside  by  the	U.S. Supreme Court in the  decision  in	 the
National   Prohibition(2)   case.   The	  decision   totally
negatived the contention that "an amendment must be confined
in its scope to, an alteration or improvement of that  which
is  already contained in the Constitution and cannot  change
its  basic  structure, include new grants of  power  to	 the
Federal Government nor relinquish, in the State those  which
already	  have	 been  granted	to  it",   see	 Cooley	  on
Constitutional	Law, Chapter III <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_949">Art. 5</a>, pp. 46 &amp; 47. 1	 may
also  read a passage from Corpus Juris Secundum	 Vol.	XVI,
title 'Constitutional Law, p. 26 thus : "The term 'amendment
a-,  used  in the constitutional article giving	 Congress  a
power  of  proposal  includes  additions  to,  as  well	  as
corrections  of,  matters.  already treated,  and  there  is
nothing there which suggests that it is used in a restricted
sense."
</p><p id="p_561"><a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_950">Article 368</a> indicates that the term "amend" means  "change".
The  proviso is expressed to apply to amendments which	seek
to make any "change" in certain articles.  The main part  of
<a href="/doc/528655/" id="a_951">art. 368
(1)  102</a> Cal. 11 3-25 L.R.A. 312.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_154">916</span>
<p id="p_563">thus  gives  the power to amend or to make  changes  in	 the
Constitution.	A change is not necessarily an	unprovement.
Normally  the  change is made with the object of  making  an
improvement,  but  the experiment may fail  to	achieve	 the
purpose.   Even	 the plain dictionary meaning  of  the	word
"amend"	 does not support the contention that  an  amendment
must  take  an improvement, see	 Oxford	 English  Dictionary
where  the  word  "amend"  is defined thus  :  "4.  to	make
professed  improvements	 (in a measure	before	Parliament);
formally  to alter 'in detail, though practically it may  be
to  alter its principle so as to thwart it." The  1st,	4th,
16th  and. 17th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_952">Amendment Act</a>s made changes in Part  III  of
the  Constitution.  All the changes are authorized  by	art.
</p><p id="p_564">368.
It  is	argued	that under the	amending  power,  the  basic
features  .,of the Constitution cannot be amended.   Counsel
said that they could not give an exhaustive catalogue of the
basic  features,  but sovereignty, the	republican  form  of
government the federal structure and the fundamental  rights
were  some of the features.  The Seventeenth  Amendment	 has
not derogated from the sovereignty, ,the republican form  of
government  and	 the federal structure,	 and  'the  question
whether they can be touched by amendment does not arise	 for
decision.  For the purposes of these cases, it is sufficient
to say- that the fundamental rights are within the reach  of
the amending power.
</p><p id="p_565">It  is	said that in the course of the last 16	years  there
have  been numerous amendments in our  Constitution  whereas
there  have  been  very	 few  amendments  of  the   American
Constitution  during 'the last 175 years.  Our condition  is
not  comparable	 with  the American.  The  dynamics  of	 the
social	revolution  in our country may	require	 more  rapid
changes.   Moreover every part of our Constitution  is	more
easily	amendable than the American.  Alan Gledhill  in	 his
book  "The Republic of India", 1951 Edition, pp. 74 &amp;  75  ,
said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">	      "The   Indian  Founding,	Fathers	 were	less
	      determined    than   were	   their    American
	      predecessors  to	impose	rigidity  on   their
	      Constitution.....................	 The  Indian
	      Constitution  assigns  different	degrees	  of
	      rigidity to its different parts, but any	part
	      of  it  can be more easily  amended  than	 the
	      American Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_566">It  is	said  that the Parliament is abusing  its  power  of
amendment  by  making  too many frequent  changes.   If	 the
Parliament  'has  the  power- to make  the  amendments,	 the
choice	of making- any particular amendment must be left  to
it.  Questions of policy cannot be debated in ' this  Court.
The possibility of, abuse of a power  is not the test of its
existence.  In Webb v. Outrim(1) lord
(1)  [1907] A.C. 81.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_155">917</span>
<p id="p_567">Hobhouse said, "If they find that on the due construction of
the Act a legislative power falls within<a href="/doc/504161/" id="a_953"> s. 92</a>, it would  be
quite  wrong of them to deny its existence because  by	some
possibility  it	 may  be abused, or limit  the	range  which
otherwise  would be open to the Dominion Parliament".	With
reference to the doctrine of implied prohibition against the
exercise  of power ascertained in accordance  with  ordinary
rules of construction, Knox C.J., in the Amalgamated Society
of  Engineers  v. The Adelaide Steams  Company	Limited	 and
others(1)  said,  "It  means  the  necessity  of  protection
against the aggression of some outside and possibly  hostile
body.  :It  is	based  on distrust,  lest  powers,  if	once
conceded  to the least degree, might be abused to the  point
of  destruction.  But possible abuse of powers is no  reason
in British law for Emiting the natural force of the language
creating them
The  historical	 background in which  the  Constitution	 was
framed	shows that the ideas embodied in Part III  were	 not
intended to be immutable.  The Constituent Assembly was corn
of  representatives of the provinces elected by,the  members
of  the	 lower	houses of the  provincial  legislatures	 and
representatives	 of the Indian States elected  by  electoral
colleges  constituted by the rules.  The draft	Constitution
was released on February 26, 1948While the Constitution	 was
on the anvil it was envisaged the, future Parliaments  would
be elected on the basis of adult suffrage.  Such a provision
was later incorporated in <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_954">art. 326</a> of the Constitution.	  In
a special article written on August 15, 1948, Sir B., N. Rau
remarked:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">	      "It seems rather illogical that a constitution
	      should  be settled by a simple majority by  an
	      assembly elected indirectly on a very  limited
	      franchise and that it should not be capable of
	      being amended in the same way by a  Parliament
	      elected-and perhaps for the most Part  elected
	      directly	by adult suffrage", (see B. N.	Rau'
	      India's	Constitution  in  the  making,	 2nd
	      Edition p. 394).
</blockquote><p id="p_568">The  conditions	 in  India were	 rapidly  changing  and	 the
country was in a state of flux politically and economically.
Sir  B.	 N.  Rau therefore recommended that  the  Parliament
should	be  empowered  to  amend  the  Constitution  by	 its
ordinary  law  making process for at least  the	 first	five
years.	 Earlier,  para 8 of the Suggestions of	 the  Indian
National  Congress  of	May  12, 1946 and  para	 15  of	 the
Proposal  of the Cabinet Mission of May 16, 1946 had  recom-
mended	similar powers of revision by the Parliament  during
the  initial years or at stated intervals.  The	 Constituent
Assembly   did	not-  accept  these   recommendations.	  On
September  17,	1949  an amendment (No. 304)  moved  by	 Dr.
Deshmukh providing

for  amendment	of the Constitution at any time by  a  clear
majority  in  each house of Parliament was  negatived.	 The
Assembly  was conscious that future Parliaments, elected  on
the  basis of adult suffrage would be  more  representative,
but they took the view that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_955">art. 368</a> provided a sufficiently
flexible   machinery   for  amending  all  part-,   of	 the
Constitution.	The  Assembly never entertain  the  proposal
that any part of the Constitution including Part III  should
be beyond the reach of the, amending power.  As a matter  of
fact, Dr. Deshmukh proposed an amendment (No. 212)  habiting
any  amendment	of the rights with respect  to	property  or
otherwise  but	on  September  17,  1949  he  withdrew	this
proposal  (we Constituent Assembly Debates  Vol.  IV  pp.  1
642-43).
</p><p id="p_570">The best exposition of the Constitution is that which it has
received   from	 contemporaneous  judicial   decisions	 and
enactments.   We find a rare unanimity of view among  Judges
and   legislators   from  the  very  commencement   of	 the
Constitution  that  the fundamental rights  are	 within	 the
reach  of  the	amending power.	 No one	 in  the  Parliament
doubted	  this	proposition  when  the	Constitution   First
Amendment  Act	of 1951 was passed.  It is  remarkable	that
most of the members of this Parliament were also. members of
the Constituent Assembly.  In, S. Krishnan and Others v. The
state  of Madras(1), a case decided on May 7, 1951 Bose,  J.
said:

amendment.   This view was acted upon in all the  subsequent
decisions and was reaffirmed in Sajjan Singh's case(3).	 Two

agreed with the rest of the Court in upholding the  validity
of the amendments.

Revolutionary, social and economic changes have taken  place
on  the	 strength  of  the  First,  Fourth  and	 Seventeenth

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">921</span>
come   to   the	 conclusion  that  the	 validity   of	 the
constitutional amendments was rightly upheld in Sri  Sankari

no reason for over-ruling them.
</p><p id="p_581">The  First, Fourth and Seventeenth amendment Acts  are	sub-
jected	to  bitter  attacks  because  they  strike  it	 the
entrenched  property  rights.	But  the  abolition  of	 the

Constitution.	Such  a	 naked power  of  amendment  of	 the
Constitution  is not given to the Judges.  The argument	 for
the  petitioners  suffers from a double fallacy,  the  first
that the Parliament has no power to amend Part III so as  to
abridge or take away the entrenched property rights, and the
second that the Judges have the power to make such an amend-
ment.
</p><p id="p_583">I  may add that if the First and the Fourth  amendments	 are
valid, the Seventeenth must necessarily be valid.  It is not
possible to say that the First and Fourth amendments  though
originally invalid have now been validated by  acquiescence.
If  they  infringed <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_979">art. 13(2</a>),t they were void	 from  their

its validity has been upheld by this Court in Sajjan Singh's
case.  If the First and the Fourth Amendments are  validated
by acquiescence, the Seventeenth is equally validated.
Before concluding this judgment I must refer to some of	 the
speeches made by the members of the Constituent Assembly  in
the  course  of debates on the	draft  Constitution.   These
speeches  cannot  be  used  as	aids  for  interpreting	 the
Constitution.  <a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_980">See State of Travancore-Cochin and others  v.
The Bombay Co. Ltd</a>.('-). Accordingly, I do not rely on	them
as aids to construction.  But I propose to refer to them, as
Shri  A K. Sen relied heavily on the speeches of Dr.  B.  R.
Ambedkar.   According to him, the speeches of  Dr.  Ambedkar
show  that  he	did not regard	the  fundamental  rights  as
amendable.    This  contention	is  not	 supported  by	 the
speeches.   Sri Sen relied on the following passage  in	 the
speech of Dr. Ambedkar on September 17, 1949
	      "We  divide the articles of  the	Constitution
	      under three categories.  The first category is
	      the  one which consists of articles which	 can
	      be, amended by Parliament by a bare  majority.
	      The second set of articles are articles  which
	      require  two-thirds majority.  If	 the  future
	      Parliament  wishes  to  amend  any  particular
	      article  .which is not mentioned in  Part	 III
	      or-  <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_981">art. 304</a>, all that is necessary for	them
	      is  to  have two-thirds  majority.   They	 can
	      amend it.
</p><p id="p_587">	      Mr. President : Of Members present.
</p><p id="p_588">	      Yes.  Now, we have no doubt put articles in  a
	      third  .category	where for  the	purposes  of
	      amendment the .mechanism is somewhat different
	      or  double.  It requires two  thirds  majority
	      plus ratification by the, States."(2)
I understand this passage to mean that according to Dr.	 Am-
bedkar an amendment of the articles mentioned in  Part.	 III
and  368 requires two-thirds majority plus  ratification  by
the  States He seems to have assumed (as reported) that	 the
provisions of Part III fall within the. proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_982">art. 368.</a>
But  he	 never said that part III was s	 not  amendale.	  He
maintained consistently that  all   the	 articles   of	 the
Constitution are amendable under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_983">art. 368</a>    On November  4,
1948, be. said :

	      are placed in another group.  Articles  placed

	      the   Constitution  and  can  be	amended	  by

	      only  in	those Articles which are  placed  in

	      provisions   contained  in  the	Draft	make
	      amendment difficult.  It is proposed that	 the
	      Constitution  should be amendable by a  simple
	      majority	at  least  for	some.  years.	 The
	      argument is subtle and ingenious.	 It is	said
	      that this Constituent Assembly is not  elected
	      on adult suffrage while the future  Parliament
	      will be elected on adult suffrage and yet	 the
	      former  has been given the right to  pass	 the
	      Constitution  by a simple majority while	'the
	      latter has been denied the same right.  It  is
	      paraded as one of the absurdities of the Draft
	      Constitution.   I	 must repudiate	 the  charge
	      because it is without foundation.	 To know how
	      simple   are  the	 provisions  of	 the   Draft
	      Constitution   in	 respect  of  amending	 the
	      Constitution   one  has  only  to	 study	 the

	      makers  of  Constitution can never  afford  to
	      ignore.	In one place, he has said:- 'We	 may
	      consider each generation as a distinct nation,
	      with a right, by the will of the majority,  to
	      bind   themselves,  but  none  to	  bind	 the
	      succeeding    generation,	  more	 than	 the
	      inhabitants  of another country.	 In  another
	      place,   he   has	  said:	  'The	 idea	that
	      institutions  established for the use  of	 the
	      nation cannot be touched or modified, even  to
	      make them answer their end, because of  rights
	      gratuitously  supposed  in those	employed  to
	      manage  the min the trust for the public,	 may
	      perhaps  be a Salutary provision	against	 the
	      abuses  of  a  monarch,  but  is	most  absurd
	      against  the nation itself.  Yet	our  lawyers
	      and priests generally inculcate this doctrine,
	      and  suppose that preceding  generations	held
	      the earth more freely than we do; had a  right
	      to   impose   laws  on  us,   unalterable	  by
	      ourselves, and

	      that we, in the like manner, can make laws and
	      impose  burdens on future	 generations,  which
	      they  will  have no right to alter;  in  fine,
	      that the earth belongs to the dead and not the
	      living.  I admit that what Jefferson has	said
	      is  not merely true, but is  absolutely  true.
	      There  can be no question about it.   Had	 the
	      Constituent   Assembly  departed	 from	this
	      principle	 laid  down by	Jefferson  it  would
	      certainly	  be  liable  to  blame,   even	  to
	      condemnation.   But I ask, has it?  Quite	 the
	      contrary.	   One	has  only  to  examine	 the
	      provision	 relating  to the amendment  of	 the
	      Constitution.   The  Assembly  has  not	only
	      refrained from putting a seal of finality	 and
	      infallibility   upon  this   Constitution	  by
	      denying  to the people the right to amend	 the
	      Constitution  as	in Canada or by	 making	 the
	      amendment	 of the Constitution subject to	 the
	      fulfilment   of	extraordinary	terms	 and
	      conditions as in America of Australia but	 has
	      provided a most facile procedure for  amending
	      the  Constitution.   I challenge	any  of	 the
	      critics of the Constitution to prove that	 any
	      Constituent  Assembly  anywhere in  the  world
	      has,  in	the  circumstances  in	which	this
	      country  finds itself, provided such a  facile
	      procedure	 for the amendment of the  Constitu-
	      tion.  If those who are dissatisfied with	 the
	      Constitution   have  only	 to  obtain  a	 2/3
	      majority and if they cannot obtain even a two-
	      thirds  majority in the parliament elected  on
	      adult   franchise	 in  their   favour,   their
	      dissatisfaction  with the Constitution  cannot
	      be   deemed  to  be  shared  by  the   general
	      public.'(1)
	      On November 11, 1948, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru
	      said:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_69">	      "And  remember this, that while we  want	this
	      Constitution to be as solid and as permanent a
	      structure	 as  we can  make  it,	nevertheless
	      there  is	 no  permanence	 in   Constitutions.</blockquote>
<p id="p_590">	      There should be a certain flexibility.  If you

</blockquote><p id="p_603">It is necessary at this stage to set out briefly the history
of Arts. ..31-A and 31-B.  These Articles were added to	 the
Constitution  with  retrospective  effect by  s.  4  of	 the
Constitution  (First Amendment) Act, 1951.  Soon  after	 the
promulgation  of  the Constitution, the political  party  in
power,	commanding  as	it did a majority of  votes  in	 the
several State legislatures as well as in Parliament, carried
out  radical  measures of agrarian reform in Bihar,  may  be
referred to as Zamindari Abolition Acts.  Certain zamindars,
feeling themselves aggrieved, attacked the validity of those
Acts  in courts of law on the ground that  they	 contravened
the 'fundamental rights conferred on them by Part III of the
Constitution.	The  High Court of Patna held that  the	 Act
passed iii Bihar was unconstitutional while the High  Courts
of   Allahabad	and  Nagpur  upheld  the  validity  of	 the
corresponding  legislation  in	Uttar  Pradesh	and   Madhya
Pradesh respectively (See Kameshwar Uttar Pradesh and Madhya
Pradesh by enacting   legislation which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_167">929</span>
v.   State of Bihar(1) and <a href="/doc/629631/" id="a_998">Surya Pal v. U.P.  Government</a>(1).
The   parties  aggrieved by these respective  decisions	 had
filed appeals by special leave before this Court.At the same
time  petitions had also been preferred before	this   Court
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_999">Art.  32</a>	 by certain  other  Zamindars,	seeking	 the
determination of the same issues It was atstage that  the
Union Government, with a view to put an endall	      this
litigation and to remedy what they considered to be  certain
defects	 brought to light in the work of  the  Constitution,
brought	 forward a bill to amend the  Constitution,  which,.
after  undergoing  amendments in  various  particulars,	 was
passed	by the require majority as the	Constitution  (First
Amendment) Act, 1951 by which Arts. 31-A and 31-B were added
to  the	 Constitution.	 That was the first  step  taken  by
Parliament  to	assist the process of legislation  to  bring
about agrarian reform, by introducing Articles 31-A and	 31-
B.   The  second  step in the same direction  was  taken  by
Parliament in 1955 by amending <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_1000">Art. 31-A</a> by the Constitution
(Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955.. The object of this  amendment
was  to widen the scope of agrarian reform and to confer  on
the  legislative  measures adopted in that  behalf  immunity
from   a   possible  attack  that  they	  contravened'	 the
fundamental  rights  of	 citizens.   In	 other	words,	 the
amendment  Protected the legislative measures in respect  of
certain	  other	 items	of  agrarian  and   social   welfare
legislation,  which  affected  the  proprietary	 rights	  of
certain citizens.  At the time when the first amendment	 was
made,  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_1001">Art. 31-B</a> expressly provided that none, of the,	Acts
and  Regulations specified in the 9th Schedule, nor  any  of
the  provisions thereof, shall be deemed to be void or	ever
to   have  become  void	 on  the  ground  that	 they	were
inconsistent  with  or	took: away or abridged	any  of	 the
rights	 conferred   by	 Part  III,  and   it	added	that
notwithstanding	 any judgment, decree or order of any  Court
or  tribunal  to  the contrary, each of the  said  Acts	 and
Regulations  shall  subject to the power  of  any  competent
legislature to repeal or amend, continue in force.  At	this
time, 19 Acts were listed in Schedule 9, and they were	thus
effectively validated.	One more Act was added to this	list
by  the	 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1002">Amendment Act</a> of 1955, so that as a result  of	 the
second amendment, the Schedule contained 20 Acts which	were
validated.
</p><p id="p_604">It  appears that notwithstanding these	amendments,  certain
other  legislative measures adopted by different States	 for
the  purpose of giving effect to the agrarian policy of	 the
party in power, were effectively challenged.  For  instance,
the <a href="/doc/9285/" id="a_1003">Karimbil Kunhikoman v. State of Kerala</a>(3), the  validity
of  the	 Kerala	 Agrarian Relations Act	 (IV  of  1961)	 was
challenged  by writ petitions filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1004">Art. 32</a>, and as  a
result of the majority decision of this Court, the whole Act
was struck down. The decision of this

(3)[1962] Supp.	 1 S.CR. 829..
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_168">930</span>
<p id="p_605">Court was pronounced on December 5, 1961.  In A. P. Krishna-
swami Naidu v. The State of Madras(1) the  constitutionality
of the Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1005">Land) Act</a>
(146.  58 of 1961) was the subject matter of debate, and  by
the decision of this Court pronounced, on March 9, 1964,  it
was  declared  that the whole Act was invalid.	 It  appears
that  the  Rajas  than	Tenancy Act  III  of  1955  and	 the
Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling and Holdings) Act 27
of  1961  had  been  similarly	declared  invalid,  and	  in
consequence,  Parliament  thought  it necessary	 to  make  a
further amendment in Art: 31-B so as to gave the validity of
these  Acts which had been struck down and of other  similar
Acts  which were likely to be challenged.  With that  object
in view, the impugned Act has enacted<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_1006"> S. 3</a> by which 44	Acts
have  been added to Schedule 9. It is therefore	 clear	that
the  object  of	 the  First,  Fourth  and  the	 Seventeenth
Amendments  of	the  Constitution  was	to  help  the  State
Legislatures  to give effect to measures of agrarian  reform
in  a  broad and comprehensive sense in the interests  of  a
very  large  section of Indian ,citizens  whose	 social	 and
economic   welfare  closely  depends  on  the	persuit	  of
progressive agrarian policy.
</p><p id="p_606">The first question presented for determination in this	case
is  whether  the impugned Act, in so far as it	purports  to
take away or abridge any of the fundamental rights conferred
by   Part   III	 .or  the  Constitution,falls	within	 the
prohibition  of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1007">Art. 13 (2)</a> which provides that "the  State,
'shall,	 not make any law which takes away or  abridges	 the
rights	 conferred  by	this  Part  and	 any  law  made	  in
contravention  of  this clause shall to the  extent  of	 the
Contravention,	be void".  In other words, the argument,  of
the  petitioners  was  that  the law  to  which	 Art,  13(2)
applies, would include a law passed by Parliament by  virtue
of its constituent power to amend the Constitution, and	 so,
its  validity will have. to be tested by <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1008">Art. 13(2)</a>  itself.
It was contended that the State" includes Parliament  within
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_1009">Art. 12</a> and "law" must include, a constitutional  amendment.
It  was	 said that it was the deliberate  intention  of	 the
framers	 of the Constitution, who realised the	sanctity  of
the  fundamental rights conferred by Part III, to make	them
immune from interference not only by ordinary laws passed by
the legislatures in the country but also from constitutional
amendments.   In my opinion, there is no substance  in	this
argument.-   Although	"law"	must   ordinarily    include
constitutional law, there is 'a juristic distinction between
ordinary  law  made  in exercise of  legislative  power	 and
constitutional law which is Made in exercise of	 constituent
power.	In a written federal form of Constitution there is a
clear  and  well-known distinction between the	law  of	 the
Constitution and ordinary law made by the legislature on the
basis of separation of powers and
(1)[1964]7 S.C.R.82.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_169">			    931</span>
<p id="p_607">pursuant to the power of law-making conferred by the Consti-
tution	(See Dicey on 'Law of the Constitution, Tenth:	Edn.
p. 110, Jennings, 'Law and the Constitution' pp. 62-64,	 and
'American  Jurisprudence', 2nd Edn.  Vol. 16, p.  181).	  In
such   a   written  Constitution,  the	amendment   of	 the
Constitution  is  .a substantive, constituent act  which  is
made  in the exercise, of the sovereign power which  created
the  Constitution and which is effected by a special  means,
namely,	 by a predesigned fundamental procedure	 unconnected
with  ordinary legislation.  The amending power	 under	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1010">Art.
368</a> is hence sui generis and cannot be, compared to the law-
making	power of Parliament pursuant to <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1011">Art. 246</a>  read	with
List  I	 and 111.  It follows that the expresSion  "law"  in
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1012">Art.  13(2)</a>  of	 the Constitution  cannot  be  construed  as
including  an  amendment  of the Constitution  which  is  by

but  must  mean law made by Parliament	in  its	 legislative
capacity :pursuant to the powers of law-making given by	 the
Constitution itself  under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1013">Art. 246</a> read with Lists I and In
of the 7th Schedule.  It is also clear, on the same line  of
reasoning,  that 'law' in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1014">Art. 13(2)</a> cannot be construed  so
as  to include 'law' made by Parliament under Arts. 4,	169,
392,  5th  Schedule Part D and 6th Schedule para  2  1.	 The
amending power of Parliament exercised under these  Articles
stands	on  the same as the  constitutional  amendment	made
under  Art.  U8 so far as <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1015">Art. 13(2)</a> is concerned  and	does
not fall within the definition of law within the meaning  of
this last article.
</p><p id="p_608">It is necessary to add that the definition of 'law' in	<a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_1016">Art.
13(3)</a> does not include in terms a constitutional  amendments
though	it includes "any Ordinance,, order,  bye-law,  rule,
regulation,  notification, custom or usage ". It  should  be
noticed	 that  The  language. of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1017">Art. 3	 6  8</a>  is  perfectly
general	 and empowers Parliament to amend  the	Constitution
without	 any exception Whatsoever.  H I ad it been  intended
by  the	 Constitution-makers  that  the	 fundamental  rights
guaranteed  under Part III should be completely outside	 the
scope  of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1018">Art. 368</a>, it is reasonable to  assume  that	they
would  have made an express  provision to that	effect.	  It
was  stressed by the petitioners during the course 'of	the,
argument that Part III is headed as 'Fundamental Rights" and
that  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1019">Art.  32 "</a>guarantee's' the right to move	the  Supreme
Court  by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of  rights
conferred by Part M. But the expression "fundamental" in the
phrase	"Fundamental  Rights"  means that  such	 rights	 are
fundamental  vis-a-vis the laws of the legislatures and	 the
acts of the executive authorities mentioned in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_1020">Art. 12.</a>	  It
cannot be suggested, that the expression "fundamental" lifts
the  fundamental  rights  above	 the  Constitution   itself.
Similarly,  the	 expression "guaranteed' in <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_1021">Art.  32(1)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/393253/" id="a_1022">32(4)</a>  means  that the right to move the Supreme  Court	 for
enforcement of fundamental rights without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_170">932</span>
exhausting  the, normal channels through the High Courts  or
the  lower courts is guaranteed.  This expression also	does
not place the fundamental rights above the Constitution.
I  proceed  to consider the next question  arising  in	this
case, the scope of the amending power under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1023">Art. 368</a> of	 the
Constitution.  It is contended on behalf of the	 petitioners
that  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1024">Art. 368</a> merely lays down the procedure for  amendment
and  does not vest the amending power as such in any  agency
constituted under that article.	 I am unable to accept	this
argument  as  correct  Part XX	of  the	 Constitution  which
contains  only <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1025">Art. 368</a> is described as a Part dealing	with
the  Amendment	of  the	 Constitution  and  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1026">Art.  368</a>  which
prescribes the procedure for amendment of the  Constitution,
begins by saying that an amendment of this Constitution	 may
be  initiated  in  the	manner	therein	 indicated.   In  MY
Opinion,  the expression "amendment of the Constitution"  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1027">Art.  368</a> plainly and unambiguously means amendment  of	 all
the  provisions of the Constitution.  It is unreasonable  to
suggest that what <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1028">Art. 368</a> provides is only the mechanics of
the  procedure to be followed in amending  the	Constitution
without indicating which provisions of the Constitution	 can
be   amended   and  which  cannot.    Such   a	 restrictive
construction  of the substantive part of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1029">Art. 368</a>  would  be
clearly	 untenable.  The significant fact , that a  separate
Part has been devoted in the Constitution for "amendment  of
the Constitution and there is only one Article in that	Part
shows  that  both the power to amend and  the  procedure  to
amend  are  enacted  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1030">Art. 368.</a>   Again,  the	 words	"the
Constitution  shall  stand amended in  accordance  with	 the
terms  of  the	Bill" in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1031">Art. 368</a>  clearly  contemplate	 and
provide for the power to amend after the requisite procedure
has  been followed.  Besides, the words used in the  proviso
unambiguously  indicate	 that the substantive  part  of	 the
article	 applied to all the provisions of the  Constitution.
It is on that basic assumption that the proviso prescribes a
specific  procedure  in	 respect of the	 amendment  of	,the
articles mentioned in cls. (a) to (e) thereof.	Therefore it
must  be held that when <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1032">Art. 368</a> confers on  Parliament	 the
right to amend the Constitution the power in question can be
exercised over all the provisions of the Constitution.	 How
the  power  should  be exercised, has to  be  determined  by
reference  to  the  question  as  to  whether  the  proposed
amendment  falls under the substantive part of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1033">Art. 368</a>,  or
whether it attracts the procedure contained in the proviso.
It  was	 suggested  for the petitioners that  the  power  of
amendment  is  to  be  found in Arts. 246  and	248  of	 the
constitution  read   with  item	 97 of List  I	of  the	 7th
Schedule.  I do not think that it is possible to accept this
argument.  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1034">Article 246</a> stats that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_171">933</span>
Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect  to
matters	 enumerated in List I in the Seventh  Schedule,	 and
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_1035">Art. 248</a>, similarly, confers power on Parliament to make any
law  with  respect  to	any matter  not	 enumerated  in	 the
Concurrent List or State List.	But the power of  law-making
in  Arts. 246 and 248 is "subject to the provisions of	this
Constitution".	  It   is  apparent  that   the	  power	  of
constitutional amendment cannot fall within these  Articles,
because it is illogical and a contradiction in terms to	 say
that  the  amending power can be exercised and at  the	same
time it is "subject to the provisions of, the Constitution".
It was then submitted on behalf of the petitioners that	 the
amending power under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1036">Art. 368</a> is subject to the doctrine  of
implied limitations.  In other words, it was contended	that
even if <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1037">Art. 368</a> confers the power of. amendment, it was not
a  general  but	 restricted  power  confined  only  to	 the
amendable  provisions of the Constitution, the	amendability
of  such  provision  being  determined	by  the	 nature	 and
character  of the respective provision.	 It was argued,	 for
instance, that the amending power cannot be used to  abolish
the  compact  of  the Union or	to  destroy  the  democratic
character of the Constitution teeing individual and minority
rights.	  It was said that the Constitution was a  permanent
compact	 of  the States, that the federal character  of	 the
States was individual, and that the existence of any. of the
States	as part of the federal Compact Cannot4be put an	 end
to  by	the power of amendment.	 It was also said  that	 the
chapter of fundamental rights of the Constitution cannot  be
the subject-matter of any amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1038">Art. 368.</a>  It	 was
contended  that the preamble to the  Constitution  declaring
that  India was a sovereign democratic republic	 was  beyond
the  scope  of the amending Power. it,	was  suggested	that
other basic, features of the Constitution were the  Articles
relating   to.	distribution  of  legislative  powers,	 the
Parliamentary  form of Government and the  establishment  of
Supreme Court and the High, Courts in the various States.  .
I  am  unable to accept this argument as  correct.   If	 the
Constitution-makers considered that there were certain basic
features  of  the Constitution which were permanent  it.  is
must  unlikely that they should not have expressly  said  in
Art  368 that these basic features were. not amendable.	  On
the   contrary,	 the  Constitution-makers   have   expressly
provided.  that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1039">Art. 368</a> itself should be amendable  by	 the
process indicated in the proviso to that Article.  This cir-
cumstance is significant and suggests. that all the articles
of  the Constitution are amendable either under the  proviso
to  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1040">Art. 368</a> or under the main part of that Article.  In  MY
opinion,  there	 is  no	 room for  an.	implication  in	 the
construction  of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1041">Art. 368.</a>  So far as the federal  character
of the Constitution is concerned, it was held by this  Court
in <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_1042">State of West Bengal v. Union of
Cl/67-14
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_172">934</span>
India</a>(1) that the federal structure is not an essential	 pan
of  our	 Constitution and there is no  compact	between	 the
States	and  them is no dual citizenship in  India.  It	 was
pointed	 out in that case that there was  no  constitutional
guarantee  against   the  alteration of	 boundaries  of	 the
States.	  By  An. 3 the Parliament is by law  authorised  to
form  a new State by redistribution of the territory  of  a.
State or by uniting two or more States or parts of States or
by uniting any territory to a part of any State, to increase
the area of any State, to diminish the area of any State  to
alter the boundaries of any State, and to alter the name  of
any  State.   In In Re The Berubari Union  and	Exchange  of
Enclaves (2) it was argued that the Indo-Pakistan  agreement
with  regard  to Berubari could not be implemented  even  by
legislation under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1043">Art. 368</a> because of the limitation imposed
by  the	 preamble  to  the Constitution	 and  that  such  an
agreement  could  not be implemented by a  referendum.	 The
argument was rejected by this Court and it was held that the
preamble  could	 not,  'in i any way,  limit  the  power  of
Parliament  to	cede parts of the  national  territory.	  On
behalf	of  the	 petitioners the argument  was	s  that	 the
chapter on fundamental rights was the basic feature, of	 the
Constitution and cannot be the	   subject  of the  amending
power under Art 368.  It was  argued  that the	freedoms  of
democratic life are secured by the chapter   on	 fundamental
rig its and dignity of the individual cannot be preserved if
any of the fundamental rights is altered or diminished.	  It
is  not	 possible to accept this argument as  correct.	 The
concepts  of liberty and equality are changing	and  dynamic
and hence the notion of permanency or immutability cannot be
attached  to any of the fundamental rights.   The  Directive
Principles   of	  Part	IV  are	 as   fundamental   as	 the
constitutional	rights	embodied  in Part III  and  <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_1044">Art.  37</a>
imposes a constitutional duty upon the States to apply these
principles  in making laws.  Reference should in  particular
be made to <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_1045">Art. 39(b)</a> which enjoins upon the State to direct
its  policy towards securing that the ownership and  control
of   the  material  resources  of  the	community   are	  so
distributed  as best to subserve the common good.  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_1046">Art. 3  8</a>
imposes a duty upon, the State to promote the welfare of the
people by securing and protecting as effectively as it	may,
a  social  order  in which  justice,  social,  economic	 and
political, shall inform all the institutions of the national
life.  I have already said that the language of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1047">Art. 368</a>  is
clear and unambiguous in support of, the view that there  is
no  implied limitation on the amending power.  In  Principle
also   it   aPPears  unreasonable  to	suggest	  that	 the
Constitution-makers  wanted to provide that the	 fundamental
rights	guaranteed  by	the  Constitution  should  never  be
touched by way of, amendment.  In modern democratic  thought
I there are two main trends-- the liberal idea of individual

<p id="p_609">protecting the individual and the democratic idea proper pro
claiming  the equality of rights and popular  sovereignty  .
The gradual extension of the idea of equality from political
to economic and social fields in the modern State has led to
the  problems of social security,  economic	    planning
and industrial welfare legislation.  The implementation	 and
harmonisation of these. somewhat conflicting principles is a
dynamic	  task.	   The	adjustment   between   freedom	 and
compulsion, between the rights of individuals and the social
interest  and  welfare	must necessarily  be  a	 matter	 for
changing  needs	 and  conditions.  The	proper	approach  is
therefore  to  look  upon  the	fundamental  rights  of	 the
individual  as conditioned by the social responsibility,  by
the  necessities  of  the  Society,  by	 the  balancing	  of
interests  and not as pre-ordained and	untouchable  private
rights.

It must :not be forgotten that the fundamental right guaran-
teed- by <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_1048">Art. 31</a>, for. instance. is not absolute.  It should
be  not that cl. (4) of that Article, provides an  exception
to  the	 requirements of cl. (2).  'Clause (4)	relates	 'to
Bills- of a State Legislature relating to public acquisition
which were pending at the-commencement of fhe  Co'stitution.
If  such  a  Bill has been passed and  assented	 to  by	 the
President, the Courts shall have no jurisdiction to question
the validity of such law on the of contravention of cl. (2),
ie.,   on  the	ground	that  it  does	not-   provide	 for
compensation  or that it has been enacted without  a  public
purpose.  Clause (6) of the, Article is another exception to
cl.  (2)  and  provides for ouster of  jurisdiction  of	 the
Courts.	 While cl. (4) relates to Bills pending in the State
Legislature  at the encement of the Consistitution, cl.	 (6)
relates	 to  Bills enacted by the State within IS  I  months
before commencement of the Constitution i.e., Acts providing
for  public acquisition which were enacted not earlier	than
July  26,  1948.  If the President certifies' 'such  an	 Act
within	3 months from the commencement of the  Constitution,
the Courts shall have no jurisdiction to invalidate that Act
on  the ground of contravention of cl. (2) of  that  Article
Similarly,   the  scheme  of  Art  19  indicates  that	 the
fundamental  rights guaranted by sub-cls. (a) to (g) of	 cl,

contained  in cls. (2) to (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1049">Art. 19.</a>  In  other  words,

state that the purposes for which fundamental rights can  be

</p><p id="p_616">In construing <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1052">Art. 368</a> it is moreover essential to  remember
the  nature  and  subject-matter  of  that  Article  and  to

in  point  of quality an adjunct of sovereignty.  It  is  in
truth  the exercise of the highest sovereign :power  in	 the
State.	 If the amending power is an adjunct of	 sovereignty
it  does  not  Admit  of  any  limitations.   This  view  is
expressed by Dicey in "Law of the Constitution", 10th  Edn.,
at page 148 as follows
	      "Hence the power of amending the	constitution
	      has  been	 placed, so to	speak,	outside	 the
	      constitution,  and that the legal	 sovereignty
	      of  the United States resides in	the  States'

	      legislatures in three-fourths , of the  states
	      all of the powers of the national-  government
	      could be surrendered to the States, or all  of
	      the  reserved  powers of the States  could  be
	      transferred to the federal government.  It  is
	      only public opinion acting upon these agencies
	      which  places  any  check	 upon  the  amending
	      power.   But  the alternative to	this  result
	      would  be	 to  recognize-	 the  power  of	 the
	      Supreme  Court to veto the will of the  people
	      expressed	  in  a	  constitutional   amendment
	      without any possibility of the reversal of the
	      court's action except through revolution."

<p id="p_618">The matter has been clearly put by George Vedel in Manuel
Elementaire De Droit Constitutionnel (Recueil Sirey) at page
117 as follows :
</p><p id="p_619">"Truly	speaking  no  constitution prohibits  for  ever	 its
amendment or its amendment in all its aspects.
But  it can prohibit for example, the  amendment  (revision)
during	a certain time (the Constitution of 1791) or it	 can
prohibit the amendment (revision) on this or that point	 (as
in  the Constitution of 1875) which prohibits  amendment  of
the   republican   form	 of  Government	 and   the   present
Constitution follows the same rule.
</p><p id="p_620">But  this prohibition has only a political but no  juridical
value.	In truth from the juridical viewpoint a	 declaration
of   absolute  ,  constitutional  immutability	 cannot	  be
imagined.  The Constituent power being the supreme power  in
the   state  cannot  be	 fettered,  even  by  itself.	 For
example,<a href="/doc/97935/" id="a_1053">article	 95</a>  of our  constitution  stipulates,	"The
republican  form  of Government cannot be the subject  of  a
proposal for amendment.
</p><p id="p_621">But  juridically the obstacle which this provision  puts  in
the way of an amendment of the republican form of government
can be lifted as follows.
</p><p id="p_622">It is enough to abrogate, by way of amendment (revision) the
<a href="/doc/97935/" id="a_1054">article	 95</a>  cited, above.  After this, the  obstacle  being
removed,  a  second amendment can deal with  the  republican
form of Government.
</p><p id="p_623">In   practice,	this  corresponds  to  the  idea  that	 the
constituent  assembly  of today cannot bind  the  nation  of
tomorrow."
</p><p id="p_624">the argument of implied limitation was advanced by Mr. N. C.
Chatterji and it was contended that item No. 3 of the  Indo-
Pakistan  Agreement  providing for a  division	of  Berubari
Union  between India and Pakistan was outside the  power  of
constitutional	amendment  and	that the  preamble  to	the,
Constitution  did not permit the dismemberment of India	 but
preserved  the	integrity of the territory  of	India.	 The
argument  was  rejected by this Court and it was  held	that
Parliament  acting  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1055">Art. 368</a> can make a  law  to	give
effect to and implement the Agreement in question or to pass
a law amending <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_1056">Art. 3</a> so as to cover cases of cession of the
territory  of  India  and thereafter make a  law  under	 the
amended <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_1057">Art. 3</a> to implement the Agreement.
(1)  [1960] 3 S.C.R. 250.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_178">940</span>
<p id="p_625">There is also another aspect of the matter to be taken	into
account.   If the fundamental rights are unamendable and  if
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1058">Art. 368</a> does not include any such power it follows that the
amendment  of, say, <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_1059">Art. 31</a> by insertion of Arts.  31-A	 and
31-B  can  only	 be made by a violent  revolution.   It	 was
suggested   for	 the  petitioners  that	 an  alteration	  of
fundamental   rights  could  be	 made  by  convening   a-new
Constituent  Assembly outside the frame-work of the  present
Constitution, but it is doubtful if the proceeding,., of the
new Constituent Assembly will have, 'any legal validity, for
the  reason  is that if the Constitution  provides  its	 own
method	of amendment, any other method of amendment  of	 the
Constitution   will  be	 unconstitutional  and	void.	 For
instance,  in  George  S.  Hawke  v.  Harvey  C.  Smith,  as
Secretairy  of State of Ohio(1) it was held by	the  Supreme
Court  of  the U.S.A. that Referendum provisions.  of  State
Constitutions'	and  statutes  cannot  be  applied  in	 the
'ratification  or  rejection of amendments  to	the  Federal
Constitution without violating the requirements of <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_1060">Article 5</a>
of such Constitution and that such ratification shall be  by
the  legislatures of the-several states, or  by	 conventions
therein, as Congress shall decide.  It was held in that case
that the injunction was properly issued against the  calling
of a referendum election on the act of the legislature of  a
State  ratifying an amendment to the  Federal  Constitution.
If, therefore, the petitioners are right in their contention
that  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_1061">Art. 31</a> is not amendable within the frame-work of	 the
present Constitution, the only other recourse for making the
amendment  would, as I have already said, be  by  revolution
and  not  through, peaceful means, It cannot  be  reasonably
supposed.  that the Constitution-makers contem- plated	that
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_1062">Art. 31</a> or any other article on fundamental rights should be
altered by a-violent revolution and not by peaceful  change.
It was observed in Feigenspan v. Bodine (2)
	      "If  the plaintiff is right in its  contention
	      of  lack	of power to  insert  the  Eighteenth
	      Amendment into the United States	Constitution
	      because of its subject matter. it follows that
	      there  is no way to incorporate it and  others
	      of  like character into the  national  organic
	      law,  except, through revolution.	  This,	 the
	      plaintiff	  concedes,   is   the	  inevitable
	      conclusion  of  its contention.	This  is  so
	      starting a proposition that the judicial	mind
	      may  be pardoned for not readily	acceding  to
	      it,  and	for  insisting that  only  the	most
	      convincing    reasons   will   justify	'its
	      acceptance."
</p><p id="p_626">I  am,	therefore, of the opinion that the  petitioners	 Are
unable	to make good their argument on this aspect  of:	 the
case.
</p><p id="p_627">It  was then contended for the petitioners,that there  would
be
anomalies  if  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1063">Art. 368</a> is interpreted to  have	 no  implied
limita-

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_179">941</span>
<p id="p_629">tions.	It was said that the more important articles of	 the
Constitution  can be amended by the procedure  mentioned  in
the  substantive  part of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1064">Art. 368</a> but	the  less  important
articles  would require ratification by the legislatures  of
not  less than half of the States under the proviso to	that
Article.  It was argued that the fundamental rights and also
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1065">Art.  32</a> could be amended by the majority of  two-thirds  of
the  members  of Parliament but <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1066">Art. 226</a> cannot	 be  amended
unless	there  was ratification of the legislatures  of	 not
less than half- of the States, It was pointed out that Arts.
54  and	 55 were more difficult to amend but  not  <a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_1067">Art.	 52.</a>
Similarly, Art.' 162 required ratification of the States but
not  <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_1068">Art. 163</a> which related to the 'Council of Ministers  to
aid  and  advise  the  Governor	 in  the  exercise  of	 his
functions.   In	 my  opinion  the  argument  proceeds  on  a
misconception.	The scheme of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1069">Art. 368</a> is not to divide	 the
Articles  of  the Constitution into  two  categories,  viz.,
important and not so important Article.	 It was contemplated
by  the Constitution-makers that the amending power  in	 the
main  part  of	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1070">Art. 368</a> should extend	to  each  and  every
article of the Constitution but in the case of such articles
which  related to the federal principles or the relation  of
the   States  with  the	 Union,	 the  ratification  of	 the
legislatures of at least half the States should be  obtained
for  any amendment.  It was also contended that if <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1071">Art.	 368</a>
was  construed without any implied limitation  the  amending
power  under that Article could be used for  subverting	 the
Constitution.	Both  Mr.  Asoke,  Sen	and  Mr.   Palkiwala
resorted to the method of reduction ad absurdem 'MI pointing
out the abuses that might occur if there were no limitations
on  the	 power to amend.  It was suggested  that  Parliament
may,   by   a	constitutional	 amendment,   abolish	 the
parliamentary system of government or repeal the chapter  of
fundamental rights or divide India into. two States, or even
reintroduce  the rule of a monarch.  It..  is  inconceivable
that  'Parliament  should  utilise the	amending  power	 for
bringing about any of these contingencies.  It is,  however,
not  permissible,  in the first place, to assume that  in  a
matter	of constitutional amendment there will be  abuse  of
power  and  then utilise it as a test for  finding  out	 the
scope  of  the	amending power.	  This	Court  has  declared
repeatedly  that the possibility of abuse is not to be	used
as  a test of the existence or extent of a legal power	[See
for  example, <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_1072">State of West Bengal v. Union of India</a>(1),  at
page  407].   In the second place, the amending power  is  a
power,	of  an altogether different kind from  the  ordinary
governmental power and if an abuse occurs,, it occurs at the
hands of Parliament and the State Legislatures	representing
an  extraordinary  majority of the people, so that  for	 all
practical  purposes it may be said to be the people,  or  at
least.	the highest agent of the people, and one  exercising
sovereign powers.  It is therefore
(1)  [1964]1 S.C.R. 371.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_180">942</span>
<p id="p_630">anomalous   to	speak  of  'abuse'  of	a  power   of	this
description.  In the last analysis, political machinery	 and
artificial  limitations	 will not protect  the	people	from
themselves.   The perpetuity of our democratic	institutions
will depend not upon special mechanisms or devices, nor even
upon  any  particular  legislation,  but  rather  upon	 the
character  and intelligence and the good conscience  of	 our
people	themselves.   As  observed  by	Frankfurter,  1.  in
American Federation of Labour v. American Sash &amp; Door Co.(1)
	      "But  a democracy need rely on the  courts  to
	      save  it	from  its own unwisdom.	  If  it  is
	      alert-and	 without  alertness  by	 the  people
	      there  can be no enduring democracy unwise  or
	      unfair legislation can readily be removed from
	      the  statute books.  It is by  such  vigilance
	      over its representatives that democracy proves
	      itself"
</p><p id="p_631">I pass on to consider the next objection of the	 petitioners
that the true purpose and object of the impugned Act was  to
legislate in respect of land and that legislation 1n respect
of land falls within the jurisdiction of State	legislatures
under Entry 18 of List 11, and the argument was. that  since
the  State  Legislatures alone can make laws in	 respect  of
land, Parliament had no right to pass the impugned Act.	 The
argument  was based on the assumption that the impugned	 Act
purports to be, and in fact is, a piece of land legislation.
It  was urged. that the scheme of Arts. 245 and 246  of	 the
Constitution 'clearly showS that Parliament has no right  to
make a law in respect of land, and since the impugned Act is
a  legislative measure in relation to land, it is in  Valid.
In  my opinion, the argument is based upon a  misconception.
Whet the impugned Act purports to do is not to make any land
legislation  but  to protect and  validate  the	 legislative
measures  in  respect  of agrarian  reforms  passed  by	 the
different State Legislatures in the country by granting them
immunity from attack based on the plea that they  contravene
fundamental   rights.	The  impugned  Act  was	 passed	  by
Parliament  in exercise of the amending power  conferred  by
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1073">Art.  368</a> and it is impossible to accept the  argument	that
the  constitutional  power of amendment can be	fettered  by
Arts.  245  and	 246 or by the legislative  Lists.   It	 was
argued for, the petitioners that Parliament cannot  validate
a law Which it has no Power to enact.  The proposition holds
good where the validity on impugned Act turns on whether the
subject-matter	falls within or without the jurisdiction  of
the  legislature which passed it.  But to make a  law  which
contravenes  the  Constitution constitutionally valid  is  a
matter	of  constitutional amendment, and as such  it  falls
within	the  exclusive power of Parliament  and	 within	 the
amending  power conferred by <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1074">Art. 368.</a>	I am accordingly  of
the opinion that the petitioners are unable to
(1)  335 U.S. 538,556.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_181">943</span>
<p id="p_632">substantiate  their argument on this aspect of the case.   I
should like to add that in Lesser v. Garnett(1), in National
Prohibition Cases(2 ) and in United States v. Sprague(3),  a
similar	  argument  Was	 advanced  to  the  effect  that   a
constitutional amendment was not valid if it was in the form
of  legislation.   But	the argument  was  rejected  by	 the
Supreme Court of the U.S.A. in all the three cases.
It  remains  to deal with the objection of  the	 petitioners
that  the  newly  inserted articles 31-A  and  31-B  require
ratification of the State legislatures under the proviso  to
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1075">Art. 368</a> of the Constitution because these articles  deprive
the  High  Courts of the power to  issue  appropriate  writs
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1076">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution.  I do not "think  there
is  any substance in this argument.  The impugned  Act	does
not  purport  to change the provisions of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1077">Art.	226</a>  and  it
cannot be, said even to have that effect directly or in	 any
substantial measure.  It is manifest that the newly inserted
articles do I not either in terms or in effect seek to	make
any  change in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1078">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution.   <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_1079">Article	31-A</a>
aims   'at   saving  laws  providing  for   the	  compulsory
acquisition by the State of a certain kind-of property	from
the  operation	of  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_1080">article 1 3</a>	 read  with  other  relevant
articles  in  Part  III,  while	 <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1081">article  31-b</a>	purports  to
validate  certain  specified  Acts  g  Regulations,  already
passed,	 which, but for such a; provision , would be  liable
to be impugned under <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_1082">Art. 13</a> It is therefore' not correct to
say that the powers of High Courts to issue writs is, in'any
way, affected. The jurisdiaction 'of the High Courts remains
just the same as it Was before.	 Only'a certain	 category-of
cases has been excluded from the purview of Part III and the
High  Courts  can  no longer intervene,	 not  because  their
Jurisdiction or powers have been curtailed in any manner  or
to. any but because there would be no occasion hereafter for
the  exercise  of  their power in such	cases.	 As  I	have
already	 said,	the  effect  of	 the  impugned	Act  on	 the
jurisdiction of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1083">Art. 226</a> of the, Con-
stitution is not direct but only incidental in character and
therefore the contention " of the petitioners on this  point
against the validity of the impugned Act must be rejected.
It  is	well-settled  that  in	examining  a  constitutional
question  of  this character, it is legitimate	to  consider
whether	 the impugned legislation is a legislation  directly
in  respect of the subject-matter covered by any  particular
article	 of  the Constitution or whether  touches  the	said
articles only incidentally or indirectly.  <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_1084">In A. K.  Gopalan

to    reject	the   contention   that	  the	 order	  of

the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_1092">Art. 19(1).</a>  At page 100 of the report,
Kania, C.J., stated as follows :

<p id="p_637">	      Although	this argument is advanced in a	case

	      without  any pre-conceived notions.  So  read,
	      it  clearly means that the legislation  to  be
	      examined must be directly in respect of one of
	      the  rights mentioned in the sub-clauses.	  If
	      there is a legislation directly attempting  to
	      control  a citizen's freedom of speech or	 ex-
	      pression,	 or his right to assemble  peaceably
	      and  without arms, etc., the question  whether

	      for  instance,  for  punitive  or	  preventive

falls  under  the substantive part of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1108">Art. 368</a>	because	 the
object of the impugned Act is to amend the relevant Articles
in Part III which confer fundamental rights on citizens	 and
not -to change the power of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1109">Art. 226.</a>
In this connection I should like to refer to another  aspect
of  the	 matter.   The question about the  validity  of	 the
Constitution  (First Amendment) Act has been considered	 by,
this Court in <a href="/doc/1706770/" id="a_1110">Sri Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India
and  State of Bihar</a>(6).	 In that case, the validity  of	 the
said  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1111">Amendment Act</a> was challenged, firstly, on	 the  ground
that the newly inserted Arts. 31 -A and 31-B sought  to make
changes	 in Arts. 132 and 136 in Ch.  IV of Part V and	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1112">Art.
226</a>  in Ch.  V of Part VI.  The second ground was  that	 the
amendment  was invalid because it related to legislation  in
respect	 of  land.  It was also urged, in the  third  place,
that  though  it  may be open to  Parliament  to  amend	 the
provisions  in	respect of fundamental rights  contained  in
Part ITT, the amendment made in that behalf would have to be
tested	in  the	 light of provisions of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1113">Art.  13(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.  The  argument was that the law to which	<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1114">Art.
13(2)</a>  applied would include a law passed by  Parliament  by
virtue	of its constituent power to amend the  Constitution,
and  so, its validity will have to be tested by	 <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1115">Art.  13(2)</a>
itself.	 All these arguments were rejected by this Court and
it  was	 held  in that case  that  the	Constitution  (First
Amendment)  Act was legally valid.  The same question  arose
for consideration in <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_1116">Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a>	 (7)
with regard to the validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth
Amendment)  Act,  1964.	 In that case,	the  petitioners  in

<p id="p_644">	      Writ  Petitions in this Court  contended	that
	      the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment)'	 Act
	      was constitutionally invalid since the  powers
	      Prescribed  by  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1117">Art. 226</a> which is in  Ch.	  V,
	      Part VI of the Constitution Were likely to  be
	      affected	by  the Seventeenth  Amendment,	 and
	      therefore	 the  special  procedure  laid	down
	      under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1118">Art. 368</a> should have been followed.	  It
	      was  further contended in that case  that	 the
	      decision	of this court in Sankari  Prasads(1)
	      case   should  be	 reconsidered.	 'Both	 the
	      contentions  were re-, rejected by this  Court
	      by'  a majority Judgment and it was held	that
	      the  Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment)	 Act
	      amended the fundamental rights solely with the
	      object of assisting the State Legislatures  to
	      give effect to the socioeconomic policy of the
	      party  inpower and its effect on <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1119">Art. 226</a>	 was
	      incident	and insignificant and  the  impugned
	      Act therefore fell under the substantive	part
	      of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1120">Art. 368</a> and did not attract the proviso to
	      that  article.  It was further held.  by	this
	      Court that there Was no justification for	 re-
	      considering  Sankari  Prasad's(1)	 case.	  On
	      behalf of the respondents it was submitted  by
	      the  Additional Solicitor- Generat  that	this
	      was a very strong	    case    for	    the
	      application of the principle of stare decisis. In
	      my  opinion, this contention must be  accepted
	      as  correct.If  the  arguments  urged  by	 the
	      petitioners are to prevail it would leadto the
	      inevitable  consequence  that  the  amendments
	      made  to the Constitution both in 1951 and  in
	      1955  would be rendered invalid and.  a  large
	      number of decisions dealing with the  validity
	      of the Acts included in the 9th Schedule which
	      were pronounced by this Court ever since,	 the
	      decision in Sankari Prasad's(1) case was	dec-
	      lared,  would also-have to be  overruled.	  It
	      was  also	 pointed out  that  Parliament,	 the
	      Government  and the people have acted on	the,
	      faith of the decision of this Court in Sankari
	      Prasad's(1)  case and titles to property	have
	      been   transferred,  obligations	 have	been
	      incurred	and rights have been acquird in	 the
	      implementation of the legislation included  in
	      the 9th Schedule.
</p><p id="p_645">	      The,  effect  of land reform  legislation	 has
	      been clearly summarised in ch.  VIII of  Draft
	      Outline on Fourth Plan as follows
	      "Fifteen	years  ago when the First  Plan	 was
	      being  formulated, intermediary  tenures	like
	      zamindaris, jagirs and inams covered more than
	      40  per  cent of the area.  There	 were  large
	      disparities  in  the ownership  of  land	held
	      under ryotwari tenurer which covered the other
	      60  per cent area; and' a substantial  portion
	      of the land was cultivated through tenants at-
	      will  and	 share-croppers-who paid  about	 one
	      half the produce as rent.	 Most holdings	were
	      small  and  fragmented. Besides, there  was  a
	      large  population	 of  landless	agricultural

<p id="p_647">	      tives of the land policy were the abolition of
	      intermediary  tenures, reform of	the  tenancy
	      system,  including  fixation of fair  rent  at
	      one-fifth	 to one-fourth of the  grossproduce,
	      security of I tenure for the tenant,  bringing
	      tenants  into  direct  relationship  with	 the
	      State and investing in them ownership of land.
	      A ceiling on land holding was also  recmmended
	      so  that	some  surplus  land,  may  be	made
	      available	 for redistribution to the  landless
	      agricultural workers.  Another important	part
	      of,  the	progamme     was  consolidation	  of
	      agricultural holdings and increse in the size-
	      of  the operational unit to an economic  scale
	      through cooperative methods.
</p><p id="p_648">	      Aboiition	 of Intermediaries.-During the	past
	      15  years, progress has been made	 in  several
	      directions.  Theprogramme for the abolition of
	      intermediaries	has   been    carried	 out
	      practically  all over, the country.  About  20
	      million tenants of former intermediaries	came
	      into  direct relationship with the  State	 and
	      became   owners  of  their  holdings.    State
	      Governments are now engaged in the  assessment
	      and payment of compensation.  There were	some
	      initial delays but a considerable progress hag
	      been  made in this direction in  recent  years
	      and it is hoped that the issue of compensatory
	      bonds will be completed in another two years.
	      Tenancy  Reform.-TO deal with the	 problem  of
	      tenants-at-will  in the ryotwari areas and  of
	      'sub'-tenants  in the zamindari areas, a	good
	      deal  of	legislation  has  been	enacted.   .

	      bringing	them into direct relation  with	 the
	      State   and   converting	them   into   owners
	      have'been	 made  in  several  States.   As   a
	      result,  about  3 million tenants	 and  share-
	      croppers have acquired ownership of 'More than
	      7 million acres.
</p><p id="p_650">	      Ceiling on Holdings.  Laws imposing ceiling on
	      agri,cultural  holdings bave been	 enacted  in
	      all-  the	 States.In the former  Punjab  area,
	      however the State Government has the power  to
	      settle  tenants  on  land	 in  excess  of	 the
	      permissible  limit although it has not  set  a
	      ceiling on  ownership.  According to available
	      reports over 2 million acres of surplus  areas
	      in  excess  of the ceiling limits	 have,	been
	      declared	  or   taken   possession   of	  by
	      Government."
</p><p id="p_651">It  is	true  that the principle of stare  decisis  may	 not
strictly  apply	 to, a decision on a  constitutional  point.
There  is  no restriction in the Constitution  itself  which
prevents this Court from reviewing its earlier decisions  or
even to depart from them in the interest of public good.  It
is  true  that	the  problem  of  construing  constitutional
provisions cannot be adequately solved by merely adopting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_186">948</span>
the  literal construction of the words used in, the  various
articles.  The Constitution is an organic document and it is
intended  to  serve as a guide to the solution	of  changing
problems  which	 the Court' may have to face  from  time  to
time.	It  is manifest that in a  progressive	and  dynamic
society	 the character of these problems is bound to  change
with the inevitable consequence that the relevant words used
in  the	 Constitution  may also	 change	 their	meaning	 and
significance.	Even so., the Court is reluctant  to  accede
to,  the  suggestion that its earlier  decisions  should  be
frequently  reviewed or departed from.	In such a  case	 the
test should be : what is the nature of the error alleged  in
the earlier decision, what is its impact on the public	good
and  what is the compelling character of the  considerations
urged  in  support  of	the contrary view.   It	 is  also  a
relevant factor that the earlier decision has been  followed
in,  a large number of cases, that titles to  property	have
passed	and  multitude of rights and obligations  have	been
created	 in  consequence of the earlier	 decision.   I	have
already	 dealt	with  the merits of the	 contention  of	 the
petitioners with regard to the validity of the impugned	 Act
and  I have given reasons for holding that the impugned	 Act
is  constitutionally  valid  and  the  contentions  ,of	 the
petitioners are unsound.  Even on the assumption that it  is
possible  to  take  a different view and to  hold  that	 the
impugned  Act is unconstitutional I am of opinion  that	 the
principle  of state decisis must be applied to	the  present
case   and   the   plea	 made  by   the,   petitioners	 for
reconsideration	 of Sankari Prasad(1) case and the  decision
in   <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_1121">Sajjan  Singh  v.	State  of  Rajasohan</a>(2)	 is   wholly
unjustified and must be rejected.
</p><p id="p_652">In  Writ Petition No. 202 of 1966, it was contended  by	 Mr.
Nambyar	  that	the  continuance  of  the  Proclamation	  of
Emergency   under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1122">Art. 352</a> of the Constitution was  a  gross
violation  of  power  because the emergency  had  ceased  to
exist.	 It was also contended	that <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1123">Art. 358</a> should  be  so
construed  as to confine its operation on to legislative  or
executive action relevant to the Proclamation of  Emergency.
It was submitted that the Mysore State was rot a border area
and  the  land	reform	legislation of	that  State  had  no
relevant-connection  with the Proclamation of Emergency	 and
the  fundamental  rights  conferred by	<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1124">Art.  19</a>  cannot  be
suspended  so far as the petitions are concerned.  I do	 not
think  that it is necessary to express any opinion on  these
points	because	 the Writ Petition must fail  on  the  other
grounds	 which I have already discussed above.	It  is	also
not  necessary for me to express an opinion on the  doctrine
of prospective overruling of legislation.
For  the  reasons already expressed I hold  that  all  these
petitions fail and should be dismissed, but there will be no
order as to
Petitions dismissed.
