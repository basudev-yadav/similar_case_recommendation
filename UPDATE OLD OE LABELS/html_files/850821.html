ACT:
Defence	 of India Rules, 1962, sub-r. 4 of r. 30 and  Bombay
Conditions  of Detention Order, 1951-Book written by  detenu
in jail-Request to send it out of jail for publication-State
Government  whether can refuse request -High  Court  whether
can he moved under Constitution of India, <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Art. 226.</a>



HEADNOTE:
The  first  respondent	was detained by	 the  Government  of
Maharashtra  under  r.	30(1) (b) of the  Defence  of  India
Rules,	1962.  The conditions of detention under sub-rule  4
of  r. 30 of -the said rules were prescribed to be the	same
as  those  under the Bombay Conditions of  Detention  Order,
1951.	While so detained the first respondent wrote a	book
of scientific interest and sought permission from The  State
Government  to	send it out of jail  for  publication.	 The
request having been rejected he filed a writ petition  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution praying for a direction to	 the
State  Government to permit him to send out  the  manuscript
for  Publication.  The High Court held that The book was  in
no way prejudicial to the defence of India etc., and allowed
the  petition.	 The  State  Government	 by  special   leave
appealed to this Court.
It was contended on behalf of the, appellant that the  first
respondent not being a free person could exercise only	such
privileges  a,-,  were	conferred on him  by  the  order  of
detention,  and	 the Bombay Conditions of  Detention  Order,
1951 which regulated the terms of the respondent's detention
did not confer on him any privilege or right to write a book
and send it out of the prison for publication.
HELD  : (i) It cannot be said that the Bombay Conditions  of
Detention  Order,  1951	 which	lays  down  the	  conditions
regulating  the	 restrictions on the liberty  of  a  detenu,
conferred  only	 certain privileges on the detenu.  If	this
argument  were to be accepted it would mean that the  detenu
could  be  starved  to	death, if  there  was  no  condition
providing  for giving food to the detenu.  In the matter  of
liberty of a subject such a construction shall not be  given
to  the	 said rules and regulations  unless  for  compelling
reasons. [7O8 C-D]
(ii) The  said conditions regulating the restriction on	 the
personal liberty of a detenu are not privileges conferred on
him, but are the conditions subject to which his liberty can
be  restricted.	  As  there is no condition  in	 the  Bombay
Conditions  of Detention Order, 1951, prohibiting  a  detenu
from writing a book or sending it for publication, the State
of  Maharashtra in refusing to allow the same infringed	 the
personal  liberty of the first Respondent in  derogation  of
the law whereunder he was detained. [708 E]
(iii)	  The effect of the President's order under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_3">Art. 359</a>
of  the	 Constitution was that the right to  move  the	High
Court  or  the Supreme Court remained suspended	 during	 the
period of emergency if a person was deprived of his personal
liberty under the Defence of India Act, 1962, or any rule or
order  made  thereunder.  If a person was  deprived  of	 his
personal  liberty  not under the Act or rule or	 order	made
thereunder  but in contravention thereof his right  to	move
the said courts in that regard would not be suspended.	[705
C-D]
703
Since the State Government's refusal to allow publication of
the  first  respondent's  book	was  in	 contravention	 and
derogation  of the 'law under which he was detained  he	 had
the right to move the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Art. 226</a> and the said
High  Court  was empowered to issue an appropriate  writ  or
direction  to the said Government to act in accordance	with
law.

</p><p id="p_5">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Subba  Rao  J. Prabbakar Pandurang Sanzgiri,  who  has	been
detained by the Government of Maharashtra under<a href="/doc/31002969/" id="a_5"> S.  30(1)(b)</a>
of the Defence of India Rules, 1962, in the Bombay  District
Prison in order to prevent him from acting in a manner	pre-
judicial  to  the  defence  of	India,	public	safety	 and
maintenance$   of  public  order,  has	written,  with	 the
permission  of the said Government, a book in Marathi  under
the  title  "Anucha  Antarangaat" (Inside  the	Atom).	 The
learned	 Judges of the High Court, who had gone through	 the
table  of contents of the book. expressed their	 opinion  on
the book thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "............   we  are  satisfied  that	 the
	      manuscript  book	deals  with  the  theory  of
	      elementary  particles  in -in  objective	way.
	      The  manuscript  does  not  purport  to  be  a
	      research	work  but it purports to be  a	book
	      written with a view to educate the people	 and
	      disseminate   knowledge	regarding    quantum
	      theory."
</blockquote><p id="p_6">The book is, therefore, purely of scientific interest and it
cannot possibly cause any prejudice to the defence of India,
public safety or maintenance of public order.  In September,
1964,  the detenu applied to the Government  of	 Maharashtra
seeking	 permission to send the manuscript out of  the	jail
for  publication;  but the Government by its  letter,  dated
March  27, 1965, rejected the request.	He again applied  to
the  Superintendent, Arthur Road Prison, for  permission  to
send   the  manuscript	out  and  that	too  was   rejected.
Thereafter,  he	 filed	a petition under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Art.	226</a>  of	 the
Constitution in the High Court of Maharashtra at Bombay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">704</span>
for directing the State of Maharashtra to permit him to send
out  the  manuscript  of the book written  by  him  for	 its
eventual publication.  The Government of Maharashtra in	 the
counter-affidavit did not allege that the publication of the
said book would be prejudicial to the objects of the Defence
of  India  Act,	 but averred that  the	Government  was	 not
required by law to permit the detenu to publish books  while
in detention.  The High Court of Bombay held that the  civil
rights	and liberties of a citizen were in no way curbed  by
the  order of detention and that it was always open  to	 the
detenu	to  carry on his activities  within  the  conditions
governing his detention.  It further held that there were no
rules  prohibiting a detenu from sending a book outside	 the
jail with a view to get it published.  In that view the High
Court  directed the Government to allow the manuscript	book
to  be	sent  by the detenu to his  wife  for  its  eventual
publication.   The  State of Maharashtra has  preferred	 the
present appeal against the said order of the High Court.
The contentions of the learned Additional Solicitor  General
may  be briefly stated thus : When a person is	detained  he
loses  his  freedom;  he  is  no  longer  a  free  man	and,
therefore,  he	can  exercise only such	 privileges  as	 are
conferred  on  him by the order of  detention.	 The  Bombay
Conditions  of	Detention Order, 1951. which  regulates	 the
terms  of the first respondent's detention, does not  confer
on him any privilege or right to write a book and send it   out
of the prison for publication.	In support of his contention
he   relies  upon  the observations of Das, J., as  he	then
was, in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_7">A.     K. Gopalan v. State of Madras</a>(1) wherein	 the
learned	 Judge	has expressed the view, in  the	 context  of
fundamental  rights, that if a citizen loses the freedom  of
his person by reason of a lawful detention, he cannot  claim
the  rights under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_8">Art. 19</a> of the Constitution as the  rights
enshrined  in the said article are only the attributes of  a
free man.
</p><p id="p_7">Mr.  Garg, learned counsel for the detenu, raised before  us
the  following two points : (1) a restriction of the  nature
imposed by the Government on the detenu can only be made  by
an order issued by the appropriate Government under cls. (f)
and  (h)  of  sub-r. (1) of r. 30 of the  Defence  of  India
Rules,	1962, hereinafter called the Rules, and that too  in
strict	compliance with s. 44 of the Defence of	 India	Act,
1962,  hereinafter called the Act, and that as the  impugned
restriction  was  neither made by such an order nor  did  it
comply with<a href="/doc/31002969/" id="a_9"> s. 44</a> of the Act, it was an illegal	 restriction
on his personal liberty; and (2) neither the detention order
nor the
(1)  [1950] S.C.R. 88, 291.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">705</span>
<p id="p_8">conditions   of	  detention   which   governed	 the   first
respondent's detention enabled the Government to prevent the
said respondent from sending his manuscript book out of	 the
prison	for  publication and, therefore, the  order  of	 the
Government  rejecting the said respondent's request in	that
regard was illegal.
</p><p id="p_9"><a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_10">Article	 358</a> of the Constitution suspends the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_11">Art.  19</a> of Part III of the Constitution during	 the  period
the proclamation of emergency is in operation; and the order
passed	by  the	 President under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_12">Art. 3 5  9</a>  suspended	 the
enforcement, inter alia, of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_13">Art. 21</a> during the period of the
said emergency.	 But the President's order was a conditional
one.   In  effect it said that the right to  move  the	High
Court  or  the Supreme Court remained suspended	 if  such  a
person	had been deprived of his personal liberty under	 the
Defence	 of  India  Act, 1962, or any  rule  or	 order	made
thereunder.   If  a  person was de  lived  of  his  personal
liberty not under the Act or a rule or order made thereunder
but  in	 contravention thereof, his right to move  the	said
Courts in that regard would not be suspended.  The question,
therefore.  in this case is whether the	 first	respondent's
liberty has been restricted in terms of the Defence of India
Rules	whereunder   he	 was  detained.	  If   it   was	  in
contravention of the said Rules, he would have the right  to
approach the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution.
In exercise of the Dower conferred on the Central Government
by<a href="/doc/74567286/" id="a_15"> s. 3</a> of the Act, the Central Government made the  Defence
of  India  Rules.   Under s. 30 of  the	 Rules	the  Central
Government or the State Government, if it is satisfied	with
respect	 to  any person that in order to  prevent  him	from
acting	in any manner prejudicial to the  matters  mentioned
therein,  it  is  necessary  so to do,	may  make  an  order
directing  that	 he be detained.  Under subr. 4	 thereof  he
shall be liable to be detained in such place and under	such
conditions as to maintenance, discipline and the  punishment
of the offence and the breaches of discipline as the Central
Government or the State Government, as the case may be,	 may
from time to time determine.  In exercise of the power	con-
ferred	under  sub-r.  (4)  of	r.  30	of  the	 Rules,	 the
Government of. Maharashtra determined that the conditions as
to  maintenance, discipline and the punishment	of  offenses
and  breaches of discipline governing persons ordered to  be
detained in any place in the State of Maharashtra, shall  be
the  same  as those contained in the  Bombay  Conditions  of
Detention  Order, 1951.	 The Bombay Conditions of  Detention
Order,	1951, does not contain any condition as regards	 the
writing of books by a detenu or sending them out of jail for
publication.  Briefly stated, the scheme of the said
p.   C. and I./65-2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">706</span>
provisions  is	that  a	 person	 can  be  detained  if	 the
appropriate Government is satisfied that in order to prevent
him  from doing the prejudicial acts mentioned in r.  30  of
the Rules it is necessary to detain him in prison subject to
the  conditions imposed in the manner prescribed  in  sub-r.
(4) of r. 30 of the Rules.  To put it in a negative form, no
restrictions other than those prescribed under sub-r. (4) of
r.  30	can  be imposed on a  detenu.	If  the	 appropriate
authority  seeks to impose on a detenu a restriction not  so
prescribed, the said authority will be interfering with	 the
personal  liberty  of the detenu in derogation	of  the	 law
whereunder he is detained.  If that happens, the High Court,
in  terms  of  Art 226 of the  Constitution,  can  issue  an
appropriate writ or direction to the authority concerned  to
act in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_10">We have gone through the provisions of the Bombay Conditions
of  Detention  Order, 195 1. There is no provision  in	that
Order dealing with the writing or publication of books by  a
detenu.	  There is, therefore, no restriction on the  detenu
in respect of that activity.  Sub-rule (iii) of r. 17 of the
said Order reads
	      "All  letters to and from	 security  prisoners
	      shall  be censored by the Commissioner or	 the
	      Superintendent, a% the case may be.  If in the
	      opinion	 of   the   Commissioner   or	 the
	      Superintendent,  the dispatch or	delivery  of
	      any letter is likely to be detrimental to	 the
	      public interest or safety or the discipline of
	      the  place  of  detention,  he  shall   either
	      withhold	such letter, or despatch or  deliver
	      it  after deleting any  objectionable  portion
	      therefrom.   In  respect of the  censoring  of
	      letters	 of    security	   prisoners,	 the
	      Commissioner   or	 the  Superintendent   shall
	      comply	with   any   general   or    special
	      instructions issued by Government."
</p><p id="p_11">The  Maharashtra Government has not relied upon	 this  rule.
In  deed, in the counter-affidavit its case was not that  it
prohibited the sending of the book for publication under the
said sub-rule, but that it was not required by law to permit
the  detenu to publish books while in detention; nor was  it
its case before the High Court that the publication of	this
book  was  detrimental to public interest or safety  or	 the
discipline of the place of detention.  Prima facie the	said
sub-rule applies only to letters to and from security priso-
ners  and does not regulate the sending out of prison  books
for  publication.  Indeed, the learned Additional  Solicitor
General does not rely upon this provision.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">707</span>
<p id="p_12">Let  us	 now consider the validity of the  argument  of	 the
learned	 Additional Solicitor General.	He relies  upon	 the
following observations of Das, J., as he then was, in A.  K.
Gopalan's case(1), at p. 29 1.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "If  a  man's person is free, it is  then	 and
	      then  only that he can exercise a	 variety  of
	      other  auxiliary	rights, that is to  say,  he
	      can,  within  certain limits,  speak  what  he
	      likes,  assemble	where  he  likes,  form	 any
	      associations  or unions, move about freely  as
	      his  'own inclination may direct,' reside	 and
	      settle  anywhere	he likes  and  practise	 any
	      profession  or carry on any occupation,  trade
	      or  business.   These are	 attributes  of	 the
	      freedom  of the per-son and  are	consequently
	      attached to the person."'
Relying upon these observations it is argued that freedom to
publish	 is  only  a component part of that  of	 speech	 and
expression  and that in the light of the said  observations,
as  the detenu ceased' to be free in view of his  detention,
he  cannot  exercise his freedom to publish  his  book.	  In
other  words,  as he is no longer a free man, his  right  to
publish	 his  book, which is only an attribute	of  personal
liberty, is lost.  The principle accepted by Das, J., as  he
then was, does not appear to be the basis of the  conclusion
arrived	 at by the other learned Judges who agreed with	 his
conclusion.   Different	 reasons are given  by	the  learned
Judges	fro  arriving at the same conclusion.  As  has	been
pointed	 out by this Court in the second Kochunni's  case(2)
the  views of the learned Judges may be	 broadly  summarized
under the following heads : (1) to invoke <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_16">Art. 19(1)</a> of	 the
Constitution,  a law shall be made directly infringing	that
right; (2) Arts. 21 and 22 constitute a self-contained code;
</blockquote><p id="p_13">and  (3)  the  freedoms in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_17">Art. 19</a>  postulate  a  free	man.
Therefore,  it	cannot be said that the said  principle	 was
accepted  by all the learned Judges who took part in  A.  K.
Gopalan's case(").  The apart, there are five distinct lines
of  thought in the matter of reconciling <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_18">Art. 21</a>  with	<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_19">Art.
19</a>,  namely, (1) if one loses his freedom by  detention,  he
loses all the other attributes of freedom enshrined in	<a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_20">Art.
19;  (2)</a>  personal  liberty in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Art. 21</a>	is  the	 residue  of
personal  liberty  after excluding the	attributes  of	that
liberty	 embodied  in  <a href="/doc/1723400/" id="a_22">Art. 19;	 (3)</a>  the  personal  liberty
included in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_23">Art. 21</a> is wide enough to include some or all of
the freedoms mentioned in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_24">Art. 19</a>, but they are two distinct
fundamental  rights  -a law to be valid shall  not  infringe
both the rights; (4) the expression "law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_25">Art. 21</a> means a
valid  law  and, therefore, even if a  person's	 liberty  is
deprived by law of detention, the said law
(1) [1950] S.C.R. 88.
</p><p id="p_14">(2) [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">708</span>
<p id="p_15">shall  not  infringe  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_26">Art. 19;</a> and <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_27">(5)</a> <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_28">Art.  21</a>	 applies  to
procedural law, whereas <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_29">Art. 19</a> to substantive law  relating
to personal liberty.  We do not propose to pursue the matter
further or to express our opinion one way or other.  We have
only  mentioned	 the  said  views  to  show  that  the	view
expressed  by  Das, J., as he then was, in A.  K.  Gopalan's
case(1) is not the last word on the subject.
In this case, as we have said earlier, we are only concerned
with  the  question whether the restriction imposed  on	 the
personal liberty of the first respondent is in terms of	 the
relevant  provisions of the Defence of India  Rules.   Here,
the  first  respondent's  liberty is  restricted  under	 the
Defence of India Rule's subject to conditions determined  in
the  manner prescribed in Sub-r. (4) of r. 30  thereof.	  We
find  it  difficult to accept the argument that	 the  Bombay
Conditions  of	Detention Order, 1951, which lays  down	 the
conditions  regulating the restrictions on the liberty of  a
detenu, conferred only certain privileges on the detenu.  If
this  argument were to be accepted, it would mean  that	 the
detenu could be starved to death, if there was no  condition
providing  for giving food to the detenu.  In the matter  of
liberty of a subject such a construction shall not be  given
to  the	 said rules and regulations, unless  for  compelling
reasons.   We,	therefore,  hold that  the  said  conditions
regulating  the	 restrictions on the personal liberty  of  a
detenu	arc  not privileges conferred on him,  but  are	 the
conditions  subject to which his liberty can be	 restricted.
As  there  is  no  condition in	 the  Bombay  Conditions  of
Detention  Order, 1951, prohibiting a detenu from writing  a
book or sending it for publication, the State of Maharashtra
infringed  the personal liberty of the first  respondent  in
derogation of the law whereunder he is detained.
The appellant, therefore, acted contrary to law in  refusing
to send the manuscript book of the detenu out of the jail to
his wife for eventual publication.
</p><p id="p_16">In the view we have taken, another argument advanced by	 Mr.
Garg, namely, that the restriction can only be imposed by an
order made under<a href="/doc/31002969/" id="a_30"> s. 30</a> (f) or (h) of the Rules and that	 too
in  strict  compliance	with<a href="/doc/31002969/" id="a_31"> s. 44</a> of the Act  need  not  be
considered.   That  question  may  arise  if  and  when	  an
appropriate condition is imposed restricting the liberty  of
a detenu in the matter of sending his books for publication.
We  do	not  express our view on this question	one  way  or
other.
</p><p id="p_17">In  the	 result,  the  order passed by	the  High  Court  is
correct. The appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
