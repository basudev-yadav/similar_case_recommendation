HEADNOTE:
     A First  Information Report alleging loss of legitimate
revenues due  to the  railway  by  defrauding  it  with	 the
connivance of railway officials either by loading pearl coke
without being booked according to railway rules in the empty
wagons after  the manganese  ore in  them were	unloaded  at
Adityapur in  Tatanagar, a railway siding of the Tata Iron &amp;
Steel Co.  Ltd. or  by diverting  without regular booking of
tanks containing  furnace oil, was lodged on March 11, 1977,
consequent upon	 which a  case was  registered at  Tatanagar
G.R.P.S. disclosing  offences under  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_13">sections 420</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_14">120B</a>,	 <a href="/doc/1359568/" id="a_15">418</a>
and <a href="/doc/1629021/" id="a_16">368</a> Indian Penal Code and <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_17">sections 105</a>/<a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_18">106</a> of the Indian
Railways Act,  against	9  persons.  One  S.  R.  I.  Rizvi,
Inspector  of	Railway	 Police,  S.  E.  Railway  Tatanagar
commenced investigation	 into the offences under the general
supervision of	R. P. Singh S.P. Railway Police appellant in
Crl. Appeal  No. 300/79	 and Respondent 6 in Crl. Appeal No.
301/79. The  D.I.G. Railway  Police who	 was  the  immediate
superior of  Respondent 6,  wrote a  letter to	the  D.I.G.,
C.I.D., Bihar  on May 11. 1977 requesting him to entrust the
investigation to  the Central  Bureau of  investigation, but
the Inspector  General of  Police, Bihar,  as per his letter
dated June  24, 1977,  declined the request. In the meantime
on June	 16, 1977  on a	 complaint from	 one Mr.  Rusi	Modi
representative of  TISCO, at Patna to the Chief Secretary to
the Government	alleging harassment  of TISCO  officials  by
respondent 6  and  requesting  for  appropriate	 steps,	 the
cabinet took the decision to transfer respondent 6. One Shri
R.  H.	 Modi  who   was  required   to	 appear	 before	 the
Investigating Officer, made some enquiry by his letter dated
November 4  1977 which	was copied  to	some  higher  police
officers  including   Respondent  2,  Inspector	 General  of
Police, Bihar,	acting on  the copy of that letter requested
Respondent 3,  Addl. I.G., C.I.D. to look into the complaint
of
17
Mr.  Modi.   The  third	  respondent  sent   a	 telegraphic
communication  to   Respondent	6  informing  him  that	 the
investigation of  the aforesaid offences had been taken over
by  the	  C.I.D.  The	Commissioner,  South  Chhota  Nagpur
Division, Ranchi,  on a	 request made  by the  Secretary  to
Government of  Bihar (Home)  Police department enquired into
the allegations made by officers of TISCO against respondent
6  and,	  after	 consultations	with  D.I.G.,  Railway,	 the
immediate superior  of Respondent  6  submitted	 his  report
dated December 27, 1977 giving a clean chit to Respondent 6.
In the	meantime, there	 was another application from M.L.As
and M.L.Cs  seven in  all addressed to the Inspector General
of  Police,  Vigilance,	 Bihar	making	serious	 allegations
against the  investigation made	 by  the  C.I.D.  under	 the
supervision of	respondent 3,  whereupon the Chief Secretary
to Government  of  Bihar  submitted  a	note  to  the  Chief
Minister  on  August  28,  1978	 suggesting  that  the	case
involved in  the matter	 be  handed  over  to  the  CBI	 for
inquiry. This  note was	 approved and  signed by  the  Chief
Minister on  the  same	day.  In  the  meantime,  the  Chief
Secretary by  his letter  dated September  2, 1978  directed
respondent 3  to send  all papers  of the  case with  a note
indicating the	stage of  investigation,  to	him  and  in
compliance  therewith	respondent  3  sent  all  papers  of
investigation till then done to the Chief Secretary with his
covering letter	 dated September  11, 1978. The CBI declined
to  undertake  the  investigation  and	suggested  that	 the
Inspector General,  Vigilance Department  may  be  asked  to
conduct	  the	investigation.	 The   recommendation	made
accordingly by	the Chief  Secretary on February 8, 1979 was
accepted by  they Chief	 Minister on  February 27, 1979. In-
between on  January 18	1979, even  though the	papers	were
still with  the Chief  Secretary respondent  3 directed	 the
investigating officer  respondent  4  to  submit  the  final
report. When  the Chief	 Secretary came	 to know about it he
wrote to  respondent 2 deprecating the conduct of respondent
3 in  pushing through the matter, though the papers were not
with him  and he  was orally  instructed not  to submit	 the
final  report.	 As  under   the  direction  and  orders  of
respondent 3,  respondent  4  had  already  submitted  final
report on February 6, 1979, a communication was addressed to
respondent 5. Superintendent of Railway Police who had taken
over charge  from respondent  6 to  move the  court  not  to
accept the  final report  and await  report of	Police after
completion of  the further  investigation which was directed
by the	Government in the case. The matter was placed before
the Addl.  Chief Judicial  Magistrate on  February 24,	1979
along with  report of the Assistant Public Prosecutor not to
accept the  final report of "no case" filed by respondent 4,
whereupon the  learned Magistrate  passed an  order to await
report on  further investigation and adjourned the matter to
23-3-1979 for further orders.
     On March  5, 1979,	 J. A.	C. Saldanha respondent 1 and
one of	the officials  named in the First Information Report
filed a	 Writ Petition	in the	High Court  questioning	 the
validity, legality  and correctness  of	 the  order  of	 the
Additional Chief  Judicial Magistrate..	 A full Bench of the
High Court  by its  Judgment dated  May 14, 1979 quashed the
order inter  alia holding  that the  direction given  by the
Chief Secretary	 with the  concurrence of the Chief Minister
for handing  over investigation of the case to the Inspector
General Vigilance  was illegal	in  as	much  as  the  I.G.,
Vigilance  could   not	be   entrusted	in   law  with	 the
investigation of the case registered with the railway police
and  consequently  the	learned	 Additional  Chief  Judicial
Magistrate was	in error  in postponing the consideration of
the final report already submitted by respondent 4 till such
unauthorised investigation was completed.

     Allowing the appeal by the State, the Court
^
     HELD :  1. A  combined reading  of <a href="/doc/1067480/" id="a_19">sections 2(h)</a>, <a href="/doc/1741324/" id="a_20">2(r)</a>,
<a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_21">36</a>, <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_22">156</a> and <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_23">173(8)</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 read
with <a href="/doc/1160197/" id="a_24">sections  1</a>, <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_25">3</a>,  <a href="/doc/474290/" id="a_26">12</a>, and  <a href="/doc/1721388/" id="a_27">22</a> of Indian Police Act, 1861
would indicate	that the  State Government was not precluded
from directing	further investigation  in the  case in which
one investigating  officer had	submitted his 'final report'
under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_28">section 173(2)</a> of the Code, but on which the Court had
not passed  any	 order.	 <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_29">Section  156</a>  enables	the  officer
incharge of  a Police  Station to  investigate	without	 the
order of  a Magistrate	into  a	 cognizable  case  committed
within the  area of  the police	 station. Under	 <a href="/doc/1544908/" id="a_30">section  36</a>
police officers	 superior in rank to an officer in charge of
a police  station may  exercise the  same powers, throughout
the local  area to  which  they	 are  appointed	 as  may  be
exercised by  such officer within the limits of his station.
<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_31">Section 173(8)</a>	enables an  officer-in-charge of  the Police
Station to undertake for their investigation in a case where
he has	already submitted  a report under sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_32">section 173</a>  and if  in course of such further investigation
he collects  additional oral or documentary evidence, he has
to  forward   the  same	  in  the  prescribed  form  to	 the
Magistrate. [27 G, 28 A, C-D, 32 G]
     2. The  officer directed  by the  State  Government  to
carry on  the investigation  is Inspector General Vigilance.
He is  undoubtedly an  officer superior	 in rank, may not be
departmentwise administrative  hierarchy, to  an officer  in
charge of  police station.  Inter se  departmental  division
such as	 Inspector General  of Police  or Inspector  General
Vigilance, Or  Additional Inspector  General C.I.D.  may  be
merely a  division of work for administrative efficiency but
the Inspector  General of Police could not by any stretch of
imagination be said not to be an officer superior in rank to
an officer in charge of a police station. [28 D-F]
     Rule 7(a)	of the Bihar Police Manual provides that the
police force of the entire State is under the overall charge
of Inspector General of Police and for the help of Inspector
General and  for the  convenience of  carrying out  the work
connected   with    the	  different   branches	 of   police
administration,	 Deputy	  Inspector  General  and  Assistant
Inspector-General of  the rank	of Superintendent are posted
at headquarters.  The use of the word 'rank' in<a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_33"> s. 36</a> of the
Code comprehends  the hierarchy	 of police  officers. It  is
equally clear  that Inspector  General of  Police will	have
jurisdiction over  the whole of the State. Division of work,
but not	 demarcating any local area indicates that Inspector
General, Vigilance,  will have	jurisdiction extending	over
the whole  of the  State and this equally becomes clear from
the Notification  dated June  6, 1973,	issued by  the State
Government in exercise of the power under clause (s) of sub-
section (1)  of<a href="/doc/430429/" id="a_34"> s.  4</a> of  the 1908  Code declaring  that  in
respect of  certain offences  the Vigilance Department shall
be deemed  to be  a police  station having  its jurisdiction
throughout the	whole State  of Bihar. Even apart from this,
Inspector General  appointed by	 the  State  Government	 has
jurisdiction over the whole of the State unless the contrary
is indicated.  If he  is thus an officer superior in rank to
an officer in charge of a police station he could in view of
s. 36  exercise the  powers of	an officer  in charge  of  a
police station	throughout the	local area  to which  he was
appointed meaning  thereby the whole of Bihar State as might
be exercised  by an  officer in	 charge of  a police station
within the  limits of his police station. It was to him that
the investigation  of the case was ordered to be handed over
by the State Government. [28 G-H, 29 A-4]

     <a href="/doc/796217/" id="a_35">R. P. Kapoor and Ors. v. Sardar Partap Singh Kairon and
Ors</a>., [1961] 2 SCR 143 at 153-154; applied.
     3. The  State of Bihar is governed by the <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_36">Indian Police
Act</a>, 1861. A combined reading of <a href="/doc/1160197/" id="a_37">sections 1</a>, <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_38">3</a>, <a href="/doc/474290/" id="a_39">12</a> and <a href="/doc/1721388/" id="a_40">22</a> of
the Act	 makes it  clear that  (a) investigation comprehends
detection of  crime; (b)  General police district covers the
entire State  and (c)  the  superintendence  of	 the  police
throughout a general-police district shall vest in and shall
be exercised  by the State Government to which such district
is subordinate. Inspector General, Vigilance being appointed
for the	 whole of  the State, is a police officer considered
to be  on duty for all purposes of the Act and it is open to
the State  Government to employ him as police officer in any
part of the general district. [29 F, 30 A-C]
     4. The general power of superintendence as conferred by
<a href="/doc/1883938/" id="a_41">section 3</a>  of the Police Act 1861 would comprehend the power
to exercise  effective control	over the actions performance
and discharge  of duties  by the members of the police force
throughout the	general district. The word 'superintendence'
would imply  administrative control  enabling the  authority
enjoying such power to give directions to the subordinate to
discharge its  administrative duties  and functions  in	 the
manner indicated in the order. It is only when a subordinate
authority subject  to superintendence  is discharging duties
and functions  of a quasi-judicial character under a statute
that the  inhibition of	 abdication of	such  power  can  be
invoked. But  where the subordinate subject to such power of
superintendence	  of	the    superior	   is	 discharging
administrative	and   executive	 function,  obligations	 and
duties the  power of  superintendence would  comprehend	 the
authority to  give directions  to  perform  the	 duty  in  a
certain manner,	 to refrain from performing one of the other
duty, to  direct some  one else	 to perform  the duty and no
inhibition or  limitation can  be read	in this power unless
the section  conferring such  power prescribes	one. Such is
the scope  and ambit of power conferred by<a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_42"> s. 3</a> on the State
Government of  superintendence over  the entire police force
of the State. [30 E-H]
     Makeshwar Nath  Srivastava v.  State of  Bihar  &amp;	Ors.
[1971] 3 S.C.R. 863 followed.
     5. Unless	the power  is limited  or fettered  or taken
away by some specific provision to the contrary, the general
power of  superintendence would	 comprehend power  to  issue
directions, orders  for performance  of duty  in  a  certain
manner,	 directing   some  one	else  to  discharge  certain
function,  refrain   from  performing	certain	 duty,	etc.
Superintendence	 connotes   supervision	 which	 implies   a
hierarchy, viz. supervisor and the one supervised. It would,
therefore, mean	 keeping a  check, watch  over the  work  of
another	 who   may  be	a  subordinate	in  a  hierarchy  of
authority. It  would also comprehend that supervision is not
merely a  negative thing  so as to keep a watch but it would
imply giving  of direction, guidance, even instructions, and
in a  given case  and in a given situation asking one who is
being supervised to forbear from doing a thing and directing
someone else to do that thing. [31 G-H, 32 A-B]
     Rajkumar v. Ramsundar A.I.R. 1932 P.C. 69, referred to.
     6. Superintendence would comprehend the power to direct
further investigation if the circumstances so warrant. There
is  nothing  in	 the  police  Act  to  indicate	 the  narrow
construction of the word "superintendence" in <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_43">section 3</a> to
<a href="/doc/1753734/" id="a_44">20</a>
mean 'general  supervision' of	the management of the police
department and	does not  vest	the  State  Government	with
authority to  decide what  the police alone is authorised to
decide. [32 D-E]
     7. Sub-section  (8) of  <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_45">section 173</a>  of the Code is not
the source  of power  of  the  State  Government  to  direct
further investigation.	<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_46">Section 173(8)</a> enables an officer in
charge of a police station to carry on further investigation
even after  a report  under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_47"> s. 173(2)</a> is submitted to Court.
But if	State  Government  has	otherwise  power  to  direct
further investigation  it is  neither curtailed, limited nor
denied by <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_48"> s. 173(8)</a>  more so,	when  the  State  Government
directs an  officer superior in rank to an officer in charge
of police  station thereby enjoying all powers of an officer
in charge  of a	 police station	 to further  investigate the
case. Such  a situation	 would be  covered by  the  combined
reading of<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_49"> s. 173(8)</a> with<a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_50"> s. 36</a> of the Code. [32 F-H, 33 A]
     8. There  is no  warrant  or  invoking  the  principle,
namely "if a statute directs a thing to be done in a certain
way that thing shall not, even if there be no negative words
be done	 in any	 other way"  because <a href="/doc/1308475/" id="a_51">section  5</a> of  the code
provides that nothing in the code shall, in the absence of a
specific provision  to the  contrary, affect  any special or
local law  for the  time being in force, or any special form
of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being
in force. <a href="/doc/1883938/" id="a_52">Section 3</a> of the Police Act does not prescribe any
special	 procedure   for  investigation	  contrary  to	 one
prescribed in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_53"> the Code</a>. It merely provides for conferment of
certain power  which, when exercised, would project into the
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54"> of the Code</a> which confers power on the officer in
charge of a police station to carry on further investigation
under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_55"> s.  173(8)</a> after	submission of  a report and that too
without any  permission	 of  the  Magistrate.  There  is  no
conflict  between   the	 two  provisions.  Power  to  direct
investigation or further investigation is entirely different
from the  method and  procedure	 of  investigation  and	 the
competence of  the person  to investigate.  <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_56">Section 3</a> of the
Act deals  with the powers of the State Government to direct
further	 investigation	into  the  case.  Undoubtedly,	such
direction will be given to a person competent to investigate
the offence  and the  police officer in rank superior to the
police officer	in charge  of the  police station, Inspector
General, Vigilance,  has been  directed to  carry on further
investigation. An Officer superior to rank to an officer-in-
charge of  a police station could as well exercise the power
of further  investigation under	<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_57"> s. 173(8)</a>  in view  of	 the
provision embodied in<a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_58"> s. 36</a> of the Code. If that be so, such
superior   officer   could   as	  well	 undertake   further
investigation on his own and it is immaterial and irrelevant
that he	 does it  at the instance or on the direction of the
State Government.  Such a  direction in	 no way corrodes his
power to further investigate on his own. [33 G-H, 34 <a href="/doc/673450/" id="a_59">A-D]
     State of Gujarat v. Shantilal Mangaldas and Ors</a>. [1969]
3 SCR  341 at  372, ex-parte  Stephens [1876] Ch.D., 659 and
<a href="/doc/1155640/" id="a_60">Patna Improvement  Trust v.  Smt.  Lakshmi  Devi  and  Ors</a>.,
[1963] Suppl 2 SCR 812; referred to.
     9. The  power of  the Magistrate  under <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_61"> s.  156(3)</a>  to
direct further investigation is clearly an independent power
and does  not stand  in conflict with the power of the State
Government. The power conferred upon the Magistrate under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_62"> s.
156(3)</a>	can  be	 exercised  by	the  Magistrate	 even  after
submission of  a report	 by the	 investigating officer which
would mean  that it  would be  open to the Magistrate not to
accept the  conclusion	of  the	 investigating	officer	 and
direct
21
further investigation.	This provision	does not  in any way
affect the  power of  the investigating	 officer to  further
investigate the case and even after submission of the report
as provided  in<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_63"> s.  173(8)</a>. Therefore, the High Court was in
error in  holding that	the State  Government in exercise of
the power  of superintendence  under<a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_64"> s.	 3</a> of the Act lacked
the power to direct further investigation into the case. [34
E-F]
     10.  The  contention  that	 the  action  of  the  Chief
Secretary in suggesting that the investigation be taken over
by the	C.B.I. and  the acceptance  of the same by the Chief
Minister suffered  from legal  malice in as much as both had
no jurisdiction, authority or power to make such an order to
transfer investigation	or to  direct further  investigation
when a	report was  already submitted  by the  investigating
officer to  the Court  competent to  take cognizance  of the
case is not correct. [38 B-C]
     If the Chief Secretary as the highest executive officer
at the	State level exercising power of superintendence over
the police  of the  State posted  in general police district
would  have   powers  to  suggest  change  of  investigating
machinery in the circumstances disclosed in the letter dated
May 11,	 1977, of  the D.I.G.,	Railway, the  report of	 the
Commissioner  of   South  Chhotanagpur	 Division,  and	 the
complaint of MLAs./MLCs., his action could not be said to be
without power  or authority.  If he  had acted	otherwise, a
charge of  inaction or	failure or default in performance of
his duty  as the  highest chief	 executive officer  would be
squarely laid at his door. He acted in the best tradition of
the Chief  executive officer  in  public  interest  and	 for
vindication of	truth and  in an honest and unbiased manner.
Afterall, if  he had even the remotest bias against any one,
he could  have as  well	 suggested  in	agreement  with	 the
earlier investigation  done by	respondent 6  and the report
submitted by  him for  submitting the  charge-sheet  that  a
charge-sheet should  be filed.	In fact, the Chief Secretary
with utmost  candour, with  a view to vindicating the honour
of the	administration, proposed  ascertainment of  truth at
the hands  of CBI,  a body  beyond reproach  as far as local
politics  is   concerned,  and	 that  is   unchallengeable.
[38 F-H, 39 A-B]
     11. The  Police officers should refrain from addressing
communications to  the Courts on pending matters required to
be determined  judicially. In  the instant  case, though the
conduct of  the Superintendent	of Police,  in informing the
learned Additional Judicial Magistrate about the decision of
the Government	to continue the investigation, by the letter
dated  February	  15,  1979  is	 not  proper,  it  makes  no
difference in the matter because the Magistrate acted not on
that letter,  but on  an application  made by  the Assistant
Public Prosecutor  in charge  of the  case and	that is	 the
legally accepted  mode of obtaining a judicial order. [39 C-
E]
     12. The  power of	the Police  to	investigate  into  a
cognizable offence  is ordinarily  not to be interfered with
by the	Judiciary. There  is a clear cut and well demarcated
sphere of activity in the field of crime detection and crime
punishment.  Investigation   of	 an  offence  is  the  field
exclusively reserved  for the  executive through  the police
department, the	 superintendence over  which  vests  in	 the
State Government. The executive which is charged with a duty
to keep vigilance over law and order situation is obliged to
prevent crime  and if  an offence  is alleged  to have	been
committed it  is its  bounden duty  to investigate  into the
offence and bring the offender to book. Once it investigates
and finds
22
an offence  having been	 committed it is its duty to collect
evidence for  the purpose  of proving the offence. Once that
is completed and the investigating officer submits report to
the Court  requesting the  Court to  take congizance  of the
offence under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_65"> s. 190</a>  of the Code its duty comes to an end.
On a  cognizance of the offence being taken by the Court the
police function	 of investigation comes to an end subject to
the provision  contained in <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_66"> s. 173(8)</a>,	 there commences the
adjudicatory function  of the judiciary to determine whether
an offence  has been  committed and  if so,  whether by	 the
person or  persons charged  with the  crime by the police in
its report  to the  Court, and	to award adequate punishment
according to  law for the offence proved to the satisfaction
of the	Court.	There  is  thus	 a  well  defined  and	well
demarcated function  in the field of crime detection and its
subsequent  adjudication   between  the	  police   and	 the
Magistrate. [39-G-H, 40 A-D]
     King Emperor  v. Khwaja  Ahmad, [1944] L.R. 71 I.A. 203
at 213; followed.
     13. Court	should be  quite loathe	 to interfere at the
stage of  investigation, a  field of  activity reserved	 for
Police and  the executive.  In the  instant case,  the	High
Court  in   exercise  of   the	extraordinary	jurisdiction
committed a  grave error by making observations on seriously
disputed questions  of facts  taking its cue from affidavits
which in  such a situation would hardly provide any reliable
material. The  High Court was clearly in error in giving the
direction virtually  amounting to  a mandamus  to close	 the
case before  the investigation	is complete.  The High Court
virtually has  usurped the  jurisdiction of  the Magistrate.
The case  is not  a stage  where the  Court is	called up to
quash the  proceeding as disclosing no offence, but the case
is at  a stage	where further investigation into the offence
is sought  to be thwarted by interference in exercise of the
extraordinary jurisdiction. [41 B-D, 42 F-H]
     S. N.  Sharma v. Bishan Kumar Tiwari, [1970] 3 SCR 946;
applied.
     14. If  an information  is lodged at the Police station
and  an	 offence  is  registered,  the	mala  fides  of	 the
informant  would   be  of   secondary  importance   if	 the
investigation produces unimpeachable evidence disclosing the
evidence. [43 D-E]
     [The Court	 directed the  allegations of mala fide made
against Respondent  6 be  expunged for	the purpose  of this
appeal.]
     Observation
     15. In  Parliamentary democracy elected representatives
have a duty to perform and their vigilance in performance of
duty without  anything shown as unbecoming of them cannot be
unilaterally chastised. [38 A]

     DESAI, J.-Reverence  and anxiety to the same degree, if
not more, to shoot at sight even a remote intrusion into the
field preserved	 for  judiciary	 must  inform  the  judicial
approach whenever  assistance of  the judicial	machinery is
sought for  an unwarranted  encroachment into  the field  of
activity reserved  for the  other branch of Government, more
so, when  extraordinary power conferred on the High Court to
issue prerogative  writ in  aid of  justice  is	 invoked  to
thwart a  possible detection  of a  suspected  offence.	 How
dangerous it is to rush in where one should be wary to tread
is amply  demonstrated by  the facts  revealed in  these two
appeals.
</p><p id="p_9">     Factual matrix  will highlight  the situation.  Thought
the point  canvassed centres round the limit of jurisdiction
to interfere with the investigation of an offence registered
at a  police station,  to pin-point the contention, relevant
facts may  be stated  with circumspection,  as the  case  is
subjudice because  any overt or covert expression of opinion
on the	facts in  controversy awaiting	adjudication may  be
censured as judicial impropriety.
</p><p id="p_10">     Tata Iron	&amp; Steel Co. Ltd., ('TISCO' for short), has a
railway siding	at Adityapur in Tatanagar. A ferro Manganese
Plant has  been set  up by  TISCO at  Joda,  for  which	 the
nearest railway	 head is  Banaspani in Orissa. TISCO has its
iron ore  and manganese	 mines at  Naomundi.  Ore  is  being
transported  from   Banaspani  and  Naomundi  to  Tatanagar,
delivery  point	  being	 railway   yard	 at  Adityapur.	 The
allegation is  that some  of the  empty wagons after ore was
delivered at  Adityapur Railway	 Station Yard  on the return
journey to  Banaspani/Naomundi were  loaded with  pearl coke
without being  booked according to railway rules and without
the issuance  of railway receipts with the connivance of the
local railway officials and the railway was defrauded of its
legitimate revenue. It was also alleged that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">24</span>
some tanks  containing furnace	oil  were  diverted  without
regular booking	 which also  resulted in  deprivation of the
legitimate revenue  to the  Railway. Adityapur	railway yard
was not,  according to the railway administration, a booking
station and  hence no  booking staff  was posted  there and,
therefore, wagons  could not have been booked from Adityapur
railway yard  and there	 was considerable  variation in	 the
number of  wagons booked  from	Tatanagar  and	received  at
Banaspani as  set out  in first information report. On these
allegations a  first information  report was lodged on March
11, 1977, consequent upon which an offence was registered at
Tatanagar G.R.P.S.  under <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_67">sections  420</a>/<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_68">120-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_69">418</a>  and <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_70">368</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_71">

Act against  9 persons.	 One S.R.I. Rizwi, Inspector Railway
Police, S.E.  Railway,	Tatanagar,  commenced  investigation
into the  offence under	 the  general  supervision  of	R.P.
Singh,	Superintendent,	 Railway  Police,  respondent  6  in
Criminal Appeal	 No. 301  of  1979  (appellant	in  Criminal
Appeal No.  300/79).  Ordinarily,  the	investigation  would
proceed in  a traditionally  routine manner  by	 the  police
machinery  but	it  has	 taken	none-too-commendable  zigzag
course because of the personalities involved in the case and
which  should  have  been  the	most  irrelevant  factor  to
influence the decisions of various persons involved in these
appeals. It  appears that the D.I.G., Railway Police who was
the immediate  superior of  respondent 6,  wrote a letter to
the then  D.I.G., C.I.D.  Bihar, on  May 11, 1977 requesting
him to	entrust	 the  investigation  of	 the  aforementioned
offences  to   Central	Bureau	 of  Investigation  but	 the
Inspector General  of Police, Bihar, as per his letter dated
June 24,  1977, declined  the request.	In the mean time one
Shri Rusi  Modi, resident  representative of  TISCO at Patna
appears to  have written  a personal  letter to	 Shri  Saran
Singh, the  then Chief	Secretary of  the  State  of  Bihar,
complaining about the harassment suffered by the officers of
TISCO pursuant	to the	investigation carried  on by railway
police under  the supervision of respondent 6 and requesting
him to	take whatever  steps the  Chief Secretary considered
appropriate to	curb  the  enthusiasm  of  respondent  6  in
carrying on  the investigation	of the	offences. It appears
from the reply affidavit filed by M. J. Basha, an officer of
TISCO, that  on June  16, 1977,	 the very  day the  resident
representative	handed	 over  his   letter  to	  the  Chief
Secretary, Cabinet  took the decision to transfer respondent
</p><p id="p_11">6. It  is necessary  to refer  to this	fact to	 evaluate  a
submission that	 even though respondent 6 was transferred he
directed a  charge-sheet to  be submitted  despite the	fact
that the  investigation was incomplete and that this conduct
would provide  demonstrable proof  of his  malice  and	mala
fides. It  appears that one Shri R. H. Modi who was required
by the	investigating officer to appear before him made some
enquiry by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">25</span>
his letter  dated November  4, 1977,  which appears  to have
been copied to some higher police officers and in the margin
of this	 letter there  is an  endorsement by  respondent  2,
Inspector General  of Police, Bihar requesting respondent 3,
Addl. I.G.,  C.I.D., to	 look into the complaint made by Mr.
Modi. Immediately  thereupon the  third	 respondent  sent  a
telegraphic communication to respondent 6 informing him that
the investigation  of the  aforementioned offence  has	been
taken over  by the  C.I.D. It appears that on a request made
by the	Secretary  to  Government  of  Bihar  (Home)  Police
Department, the	 Commission, South  Chhota Nagpur  Division,
Ranchi, enquired  into the  allegations made  by officers of
TISCO against  respondent 6  and  after	 consultations	with
D.I.G., Railway, the immediate superior of respondent 6, and
submitted his report dated December 27, 1977, in which it is
stated that  there was	no ulterior  motive on	the part  of
respondent 6  in instituting  a	 case  and  that  there	 was
"material strong  enough to  institute a  case and taking up
the investigation  and that  it could  not be  said that the
case  was   instituted	in   order  to	 harass	 the   TISCO
management".  The   Government	of  Bihar  appears  to	have
received an application signed by MLAs. and MLCs., 7 in all,
addressed to  Inspector General of Police, Vigilance, Bihar,
making serious	allegations against  the investigation	done
under the  supervision of respondent 3 and suspecting a foul
play possibly  with a  view to	covering  up  the  case	 and
requested the  Government  to  get  the	 investigation	done
through I.G.,  Vigilance. Such	a complaint  appears to have
been made  to the  then Prime Minister of India as also some
question appears  to have been asked in Parliament. The then
Chief Secretary	 submitted a  note to  the Chief Minister on
August 28,  1978,  with	 reference  to	the  letter  of	 the
MLAs./MLCs. suggesting	that the case involved in the matter
be handed  over to  the C.B.I.	for enquiry.  Approving this
note and suggestion, the then Chief Minister signed the note
on the	same day.  In  the  mean  time	Chief  Secretary  on
September 2,  1978, directed respondent 3 to send all papers
of  the	  case	with   a  note	 indicating  the   stage  of
investigation to  him and in compliance therewith respondent
3 sent	all papers  of investigation  till then	 done to the
Chief Secretary	 under his  covering letter  dated September
11, 1978.  C.B.I. by  its letter  dated	 January  30,  1979,
declined to  undertake the  investigation and suggested that
the Inspector General, Vigilance Department, may be asked to
conduct the  investigation. The	 Chief Secretary  thereafter
submitted a  further note  to the Chief Minister on February
8, 1979,  stating therein  'hat	 the  C.B.I.  is  not  in  a
position  to   take  up	  the  investigation  and  that	 the
I.G.,Vigilance,	 is   recommended  for	 investigation	and,
therefore, the	Chief Minister	was  requested	to  pass  an
appropriate order  directing I.G., Vigilance to get the case
investigated by the Vigilance Department 3-868SCI/79
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">26</span>
under his personal control. This recommendation was accepted
by the	Chief Minister	on February 27, 1979. In between, on
January 18, 1979, even though the papers were still with the
Chief Secretary,  respondent 3	directed  the  investigating
officer respondent  4 to  submit the  final report. When the
Chief Secretary came to know about it he wrote to respondent
2 deprecating the conduct of respondent 3 in pushing through
the matter  though the	papers were  not with him and he was
orally instructed  not to  submit the final report. As under
the direction  and orders  of respondent 3, respondent 4 had
already submitted  the final  report on	 February 6, 1979, a
communication was addressed to respondent 5, Superintendent,
Railway Police,	 one Mr.  Mohammad Sulaiman,  who had  taken
over in the mean time from respondent 6 who was transferred,
to move	 the Court  not to accept the final report and await
report	of  the	 police	 after	completion  of	the  further
investigation which  was directed  by the  Government in the
case. The  matter was placed before the Addl. Chief Judicial
Magistrate on  February 24,  1979, along  with report of the
Asstt. Public  Prosecutor not  to accept the final report as
hereinabove stated  whereupon the  learned Magistrate passed
the following order:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "After hearing  both the  parties, I	consider  it
     proper  to	  await	 report	 on  further  investigation.
     Therefore, put  up	 on  23-3-1979	for  further  orders
     awaiting report on further investigation".</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">     On March  5, 1979, J.A.C. Saldanha, original petitioner
(respondent  1)	  filed	 a   petition  in   the	 High  Court
questioning the	 validity, legality  and correctness  of the
order of the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_13">     A full  bench of  the High	 Court by its judgment dated
May 14,	 1979, quashed	the order,  inter alia, holding that
the  direction	 given	by  the	 Chief	Secretary  with	 the
concurrence  of	  the  Chief   Minister	 for   taking	over
investigation  of   the	 case	by  the	  Inspector-General,
Vigilance was  illegal inasmuch as the I.G., Vigilance could
not be	entrusted in  law with the investigation of the case
registered with	 the railway  police  and  consequently	 the
learned Addl.  Chief Judicial  Magistrate was  in  error  in
postponing  consideration   of	the   final  report  already
submitted by  the fourth  respondent till  such unauthorised
investigation was  completed. The  High Court  gave  various
directions to  the learned  Addl. Chief	 Judicial Magistrate
how to	dispose of the case. Two appeals have been preferred
by special  leave, one	by the State of Bihar, and the other
by original  respondent 7  (respondent 6  herein), the	then
Superintendent of Police, Railway.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">27</span>
<p id="p_14">     Two substantial questions arise in these appeals: (1a).
Whether the State Government was competent to direct further
investigation in  a criminal  case in  which  a	 report	 was
submitted by the investigating agency under<a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_74"> s. 173(2)</a> of the
Code of	 Criminal Procedure,  1973 (`Code' for short) to the
Magistrate having  jurisdiction to  try	 the  case  ?  (1b).
Whether the  Magistrate having	jurisdiction to try the case
committed an  illegality in  postponing consideration of the
report submitted to him upon a request made by Asstt. Public
Prosecutor in  charge of  the case till report on completion
of further  investigation directed  by the  State Government
was  submitted	 to  him;   and	 (2)   whether,	  when	 the
investigation was  in progress	the High Court was justified
in interfering	with the  investigation and  prohibiting  or
precluding  further   investigation  in	  exercise  of	 its
extraordinary	jurisdiction   under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_75">Art.   226</a>   of	 the

with investigation  of a cognizable case. <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_80">Section 156(1)</a> and
(2) are relevant and may be extracted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  "156(1) Any  officer in charge of a police station

<p id="p_16">     <a href="/doc/1544908/" id="a_81">Section 36</a>	 confers power	of an officer in charge of a
police station on all police officers superior in rank to an

<p id="p_17">     <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_82">Section 173</a>  provides for	submission of a report by an

<p id="p_18">     The first	question is whether the State Government was
precluded from	directing further  investigation in the case
in which  one investigating  officer had  submitted a report
under<a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_84"> s.  173(2)</a> of  the Code but on which the Court had not
passed any order ?
</p><p id="p_19">     <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_85">Section 156</a>  enables the  officer in charge of a police
station to  investigate without	 the order  of a  Magistrate
into a	cognizable case	 committed within  the area  of	 the
police station.
</p><p id="p_20">     The officer  directed by  the State Government to carry
on the	investigation is Inspector-General, Vigilance. He is
undoubtedly  an	  officer  superior   in  rank,	 if  not  in
departmentwise administrative  hierarchy, to  an officer  in
charge of  a police  station. Inter se departmental division
such as	 Inspector-General of  Police or  Inspector-General,
Vigilance, or  Additional Inspector-General,  C.I.D. may  be
merely a division of work for administrative efficiency, but
the Inspector-General  of Police could not by any stretch of
imagination be said not to be an officer superior in rank to
an officer in charge of a police station. While interpreting
s. 551<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_86">	of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1908 ('1908 Code'
for short),  which was	in pari	 materia with <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_87"> s. 36</a>  of the
Code, this  Court in  R. P.  Kapoor &amp;  Ors. v. Sardar Partap
Singh Kairon  &amp; Ors.,(1)  observed that the Addl. Inspector-
General of  Police was,	 without  doubt,  a  police  officer
superior in  rank to  an  officer  in  charge  of  a  police
station. Rule  7(a) of the Bihar Police Manual provides that
the police  force of  the entire  State is under the overall
charge of  Inspector-General of	 Police and  for the help of
Inspector General  and for  the convenience  of carrying out
the work  connected with  the different	 branches of  police
administration,	 Deputy	  Inspector  General  and  Assistant
Inspectors-General of  the rank of Superintendent are posted
at headquarters. The use of the word 'rank' in<a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_88"> s. 36</a>
<a href="/doc/907152/" id="a_89"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">29</span></a>
of the Code comprehends the hierarchy of police officers. It
is equally  clear that Inspector-General of Police will have
jurisdiction over  the whole of the State. Division of work,
but not demarcating any local area indicates that Inspector-
General, Vigilance,  will have	jurisdiction extending	over
the whole  of the  State and this equally becomes clear from
the Notification  dated June  6, 1973,	issued by  the State
Government in exercise of the power under clause (s) of sub-
s. (1) of<a href="/doc/430429/" id="a_90"> s. 4</a> of the 1908 Code declaring that in respect of
certain offences the Vigilance Department shall be deemed to
be a  police station  having its jurisdiction throughout the
whole State  of Bihar.	Even  apart  from  this,  Inspector-
General appointed  by the  State Government has jurisdiction
over  the   whole  of  the  State  unless  the	contrary  is
indicated. If  he is  thus an officer superior in rank to an
officer in charge of a police station he could in view of<a href="/doc/1544908/" id="a_91"> s.
36</a> exercise  the powers	 of an officer in charge of a police
station throughout  the local area to which he was appointed
meaning thereby	 the  whole  of	 Bihar	State  as  might  be
exercised by an officer in charge of a police station within
the limits  of his  police station.  It was  to him that the
investigation of  the case  was ordered to be handed over by
the State Government.
</p><p id="p_21">     It was, however, contended that State Government has no
power to  direct further investigation, that being the power
of the	officer in  charge of  a police station under sub-s.
(8) of<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_92"> s. 173</a> of the Code, or the power of the Magistrate to
direct further	investigation under  sub-s. (3)	 of<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_93"> s.	156</a>,
and, therefore,	 the State  Government under  orders of	 the
Chief  Minister	  was  not   competent	to   direct  further
investigation in the case.
</p><p id="p_22">     The State	of Bihar  is governed  by the  <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_94">Indian Police

defined to  embrace any	 presidency, State  or place, or any
part of	 any presidency,  State or  place, in  which the Act

provides that  every police  officer shall, for all purposes

title shows,  was enacted  to re-organise  the police and to
make it	 a more	 efficient instrument for the prevention and
detection of  crime. Investigation  comprehends detection of
the crime.  General police-district covers the entire State.
Inspector-General, Vigilance,  being appointed for the whole
of the	State, is  a police officer considered to be on duty
for all purposes of the Act in the whole of the State and it
is open	 to the	 State Government  to employ  him as  police
officer in  any part  of the  general district.	 This  would
effectively answer  the	 contention  of	 respondent  1	that
Inspector-General,  Vigilance,	 being	only  in  charge  of
bribery and  corruption cases,	could not be directed by the
State Government in exercise of its executive administrative
function to  take over investigation of a cognizable offence
registered at  railway police  station because	when he	 was
directed to  take over	the investigation it would mean that
he was	employed as  a police officer in that police station
for the detection of the crime.
</p><p id="p_24">     However, even  apart from	this,  what  is	 the  scope,
content and  ambit of  the power  of general superintendence
conferred on the State Government over the police throughout
the general  police-district meaning thereby the whole State
?
</p><p id="p_25">     The general power of superintendence as conferred by<a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_102"> s.
3</a> would	 comprehend the	 power to exercise effective control
over the actions, performance and discharge of duties by the
members of the police force throughout the general district.
The  word   'superintendence'  would   imply  administrative
control enabling  the authority	 enjoying such power to give
directions   to	   the	 subordinate	to   discharge	 its
administrative duties  and functions in the manner indicated
in the	order. It  is  only  when  a  subordinate  authority
subject	 to   superintendence  is   discharging	 duties	 and
functions of a quasi-judicial character under a statute that
the inhibition	of abdication  of such power can be invoked.
But  where   the  subordinate	subject	 to  such  power  of
superintendence	  of	the    superior	   is	 discharging
administrative	and  executive	functions,  obligations	 and
duties, the  power of  superintendence would  comprehend the
authority to  give directions  to  perform  the	 duty  in  a
certain manner,	 to refrain from performing one or the other
duty, to  direct some  one else	 to perform  the duty and no
inhibition or  limitation can  be read	in this power unless
the section  conferring such  power prescribes	one. Such is
the scope  and ambit of power conferred by<a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_103"> s. 3</a> on the State
Government of  superintendence over  the entire police force
of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">31</span>
State. This  is borne  out by  a decision  of this  Court in
<a href="/doc/186178065/" id="a_104">Makeshwar Nath	Srivastava v.  State of	 Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.(1). In
that case upon a disciplinary inquiry an Inspector of Police
was served  a notice  by the  Inspector-General	 of  Police,
Bihar, to  show cause  why he should not be dismissed. After
taking	into   consideration  the   representation  of	 the
delinquent, the	 I.G.  Police,	Bihar,	passed	order  dated
September 30,  1958, exonerating  the delinquent  of all the
charges held  proved against him by the inquiry officer. But
on an  entirely	 untenable  extraneous	ground	he  directed
reversion of  the delinquent  from the	post of Inspector of
Police	to   the  post	 of  Sub-Inspector  of	Police.	 The
delinquent preferred  an appeal	 to the Government which was
dismissed and  the delinquent  filed a	writ petition in the
High Court,  Patna, which  was allowed with a direction that
the appeal of the delinquent be heard by the Government over
again. The  State Government  thereupon issued	notice under
rules 851  (b) and  853A of  the  Bihar	 and  Orissa  Police
Manual, 1930,  to the  delinquent calling  upon him  to show
cause why  he should  not  be  dismissed  from	service	 and
ultimately  the	  delinquent  was  dismissed  by  the  State
Government. The	 writ petition filed by him was dismissed in
limine by  the High  Court. In	appeal to  this Court by the
delinquent, the	 order of the State Government was sought to
be sustained on behalf of the State Government by contending
that under its general power of superintendence conferred by
s. 3  of the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_105">Police Act</a> it would be open to pass an order of
dismissal even	in an  appeal preferred	 by  the  delinquent
against his  reversion to  the subordinate  post by the I.G.
Police. Setting	 aside this  order of dismissal by the State
Government this Court held that as rule 851 (b) provides for
appeal and disciplinary proceedings, presumably both, at the
instance of  the officer  punished or the Department and the
rule being  statutory having  been  framed  in	exercise  of
powers conferred  by<a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_106"> s. 46(2)</a> of the Police Act, there would
be no  question of State Government exercising general power
of superintendence  under<a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_107"> s.  3</a> of  the Act.  It was further
observed that  the exercise  of	 such  power  is  ordinarily
possible when  there is	 no provision  for an  appeal unless
there are  other provisions  providing for it. It would thus
transpire that	where the  power is  limited or	 fettered or
taken away  by some  specific provision to the contrary, the
general power  of superintendence  would comprehend power to
issue directions,  orders  for	performance  of	 duty  in  a
certain manner, directing some one else to discharge certain
function,  refrain   from  performing	certain	 duty,	etc.
Superintendence	 connotes   supervision	 which	 implies   a
hierarchy, viz.,  supervisor  and  the	one  supervised.  It
would, therefore, mean keeping a check,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">32</span>
watch over  the work  of another  may be  a subordinate in a
hierarchy  of  authority.  It  would  also  comprehend	that
supervision is	not merely  a negative thing so as to keep a
watch but it would imply giving of direction, guidance, even
instructions, and  in a	 given case and in a given situation
asking one  who is being supervised to forebear from doing a
thing and  directing some  one else  to do  that  thing.  In
'Words and  Phrases', Permanent	 Edition, Vol. 40A, the word
'superintendence' has  been generally stated to mean the act
of superintending,  care and  oversight for  the purpose  of
direction and  with authority to direct. To take an analogy,
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_108">Art. 227</a>  of the Constitution prior to its amendment by 42nd
Amendment  conferred  on  every	 High  Court  the  power  of
superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the
territory in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction and
this power was held to embrace within its width, inter alia,
the power  to direct  subordinate courts  and  tribunals  to
carry out  its orders,	to direct  inquiry with	 a  view  to
taking	 disciplinary	action	 for   cases   of   flagrant
maladministration of justice (see Rajkumar v. Ramsunder).(1)
     The    High     Court    construed	   the	  expression
'superintendence' in <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_109"> s. 3</a>  of	the  Act  to  mean  'general
supervision of	the management	of the police department and
does not  vest the State Government with authority to decide
what the  police alone	is authorised  to decide'.  There is
nothing in the Act to indicate such a narrow construction of
the word 'superintendence'. Nothing was pointed out to us to
put  a	 narrow	 construction	on  this  general  power  of
superintendence	 conferred   under  the	 Act  on  the  State
Government and	there is  no justification  for limiting the
broad  spectrum	  of  power   comprehended   in	  power	  of
superintendence.    Accordingly	    superintendence    would
comprehend the	power to direct further investigation if the
circumstances so  warrant and  there is	 nothing in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_110"> the Code</a>
providing to  the contrary  so as  to limit  or fetter	this
power. Sub-s. (8) of<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_111"> s. 173</a> was pressed into service to show
that the power of further investigation after the submission
of a  report under <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_112"> s. 173(2)</a>  would be	 with the officer in
charge of  a police station. Sub-s. (8) of<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_113"> s. 173</a> is not the
source of  power of  the State	Government to direct further
investigation. <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_114">Section	173(8)</a> enables	an officer in charge
of a  police station  to carry on further investigation even
after a report under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_115"> s. 173(2)</a> is submitted to Court. But if
State Government  has  otherwise  power	 to  direct  further
investigation it is neither curtailed, limited nor denied by
s. 173(8),  more so,  when the	State Government  directs an
officer superior  in rank  to an officer in charge of police
station thereby	 enjoying all powers of an officer in charge
of a police station to further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">33</span>
investigate the	 case. Such  a situation would be covered by
the combined  reading of <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_116"> s. 173(8)</a>  with<a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_117"> s. 36</a> of the Code.
Such  power   is  claimed  as  flowing	from  the  power  of
superintendence over police to direct a police officer to do
or not	to do  a certain  thing	 because  at  the  stage  of
investigation  the  power  is  enjoyed	as  executive  power
untrammeled by	the judiciary. It was incidentally submitted
that it	 is an	undisputed dictum of law that when a statute
requires a  thing to be done in a certain manner it shall be
done in that manner alone and the Court would not expect its
being done  in some  other manner  (see <a href="/doc/673450/" id="a_118">State  of Gujarat v.
Shantilal Mangaldas  &amp; Ors</a>.(1)	Expounding the submission it
was stated  that sub-s.	 (8) of<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_119"> s. 173</a> clearly indicates the
power of  further investigation after submission of a report
and that  power is  conferred on  the officer in charge of a
police station only and, therefore, the State Government was
incompetent to	direct further investigation. It was further
contended that	in view	 of the	 provision contained  in <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_120"> s.
173(8)</a> it would not be open to the Court to so interpret the
word 'superintendence'	in<a href="/doc/1883938/" id="a_121"> s.  3</a> of  the Police	 Act  as  to
empower the  State Government  to direct investigation being
done  by   some	 one  other  than  the	statutory  authority
envisaged by <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_122"> s. 173(8)</a> because such an interpretation would
derogate from  the principle  that where a thing is required
by a  statute to  be done  in a	 particular way	 it shall be
deemed to have prohibited that thing being done in any other
way. In	 Ex-parte Stephen's(2), the principle is stated that
if a  statute directs  a thing	to be  done in a certain way
that thing shall not, even if there be no negative words, be
done in	 any other  way. Subba	Rao, J. in <a href="/doc/1155640/" id="a_123">Patna Improvement
Trust v. Smt. Lakshmi Devi &amp; Ors</a>.(3), spelt out the combined
effect of the aforementioned principles thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	  "A general Act must yield to a special Act dealing
     with a  specific subject-matter  and  that	 if  an	 Act
     directs a	thing to  be done  in a	 particular way,  it
     shall be  deemed to  have prohibited  the doing of that
     thing in any other way".</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">     There is no warrant for invoking this principle because
s. 5<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_124"> of the Code</a> provides that nothing in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_125"> the Code</a> shall, in
the absence  of a specific provision to the contrary, effect
any special or local law for the time being in force, or any
special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form
of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being
in force.  <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_126">Section 3</a>  of the  Act  does	 not  prescribe	 any
special	 procedure   for  investigation	  contrary  to	 one
prescribed in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_127"> the Code</a>. It merely provides for conferment of
certain power which, when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">34</span>
exercised, would  project into	the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_128">	of the	Code</a>
which confers  power on	 the officer  in charge	 of a police
station to  carry on  further investigation  under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_129"> s. 173(8)</a>
after submission  of a	report	and  that  too	without	 any
permission of  the Magistrate.	There is no conflict between
the two provisions. Power to direct investigation or further
investigation is  entirely different  from  the	 method	 and
procedure of  investigation and the competence of the person
to investigate.	 <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_130">Section 3</a>  of the  Act as interpreted by us
deals with  the powers	of the	State Government  to  direct
further	 investigation	into  the  case.  Undoubtedly,	such
direction will be given to a person competent to investigate
the offence  and as has been pointed out, the police officer
in rank	 superior to  the police  officer in  charge of	 the
police station,	 to wit,  Inspector-General, Vigilance,	 has
been directed  to carry on further investigation. An officer
superior in rank to an officer-in-charge of a police station
could as  well exercise	 the power  of further investigation
under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_131"> s.  173</a> (8) in view of the provision embodied in<a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_132"> s. 36</a>
of the	Code. If  that be so, such superior officer could as
well undertake	further investigation  on his  own and it is
immaterial and irrelevant that he does it at the instance or
on the	direction of  the State Government. Such a direction
in no  way corrodes  his power to further investigate on his
own.
</p><p id="p_27">     The power	of the	Magistrate under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_133"> s. 156(3)</a> to direct
further investigation  is clearly  an independent  power and
does not  stand in  conflict with  the power  of  the  State
Government as  spelt out  hereinbefore. The  power conferred
upon the  Magistrate under<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_134"> s. 156(3)</a> can be exercised by the
Magistrate  even   after  submission  of  a  report  by	 the
investigating officer which would mean that it would be open
to the	Magistrate not	to  accept  the	 conclusion  of	 the
investigating officer and direct further investigation. This
provision does	not in	any way	 affect	 the  power  of	 the
investigating officer  to further  investigate the case even
after submission  of the  report as  provided in <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_135"> s. 173(8)</a>.
Therefore, the	High Court  was in error in holding that the
State Government in exercise of the power of superintendence
under<a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_136"> s.  3</a> of	the Act	 lacked the  power to direct further
investigation into  the case. In reaching this conclusion we
have kept out of consideration the provision contained in<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_137"> s.
156(2)</a> that  an investigation  by an  officer-in-charge of a
police station,	 which expression  includes  police  officer
superior in  rank to  such officer,  cannot be questioned on
the  ground   that  such   investigating  officer   had	  no
jurisdiction to	 carry on  the investigation; otherwise that
provision would	 have been  a short answer to the contention
raised on behalf of respondent 1.
</p><p id="p_28">     The   High	  Court	  found	  circumstances	  in   which
investigation was  directed to	be taken  by the  Inspector-
General of Vigilance as peculiar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">35</span>
and unconventional. There are some tell-tale facts disclosed
in the	 record which would totally dispel any doubt in this
behalf. After  respondent 3  took over	the investigation in
circumstances far  more curious and unintelligible than what
the High  Court found  in respect  of the direction given by
the State  Government, respondent 3 directed his subordinate
officer respondent 4 to carry on further investigation under
his supervision.  It would  not be  out of  place to briefly
narrate the  circumstances in  which respondent	 3 took over
investigation of this case. On a complaint received from one
R. H.  Modi, Managing  Director of  TISCO in  respect of  an
intimation calling  him to appear at the police station, the
Inspector-General of  Police, Bihar, requested respondent 3,
Addl. inspector-General,  C.I.D., to look into the complaint
of Mr. Modi whereupon respondent 3 seized the opportunity to
take over  the investigation  from  railway  police.  It  is
suggested that	this routine  direction	 to  look  into	 the
complaint of  R. H.  Modi by  Inspector-General of Police to
Addl. Inspector-General,  C.I.D., purports  to be  an  order
transferring the investigation from Railway Police to C.I.D.
It is  stretching credulity  to	 extreme  to  interpret	 the
direction  to  look  into  the	complaint  as  one  ordering
transfer of investigation. The High Court was in error in so
interpreting such  an innocuous	 endorsement.  This  is	 how
respondent  3	arrogated  to	himself	 the   authority  to
investigate this  case and even when papers of investigation
were called  from him  by the Chief Secretary and were lying
with him  which would  indicate	 that  for  the	 time  being
respondent 3  was not  to take	any action in the matter, he
proceeded to  direct that  a report  exonerating the persons
whose names  were set out in the first information report be
filed in  the Court.  This would  imply	 that  the  decision
reached by  the Superintendent, Railway Police, respondent 6
and his subordinate Inspector Rizvi who had concluded that a
charge-sheet  had   to	be   filed,  was   unacceptable	  to
respondents  3	 and  4	  and  in   the	 guise	 of  further
investigation, they  re-opened the  investigation to explain
away certain  peculiar features	 of the	 case  of  which  at
present no note need be taken. It appears that the manner in
which respondent  3 usurped and his subordinate respondent 4
carried on  the investigation,	attracted the  attention  of
MLAs/MLCs. and	seven of  them submitted  a complaint  dated
August 28, 1978, to the State Government, Inspector General,
Vigilance, and others, complaining therein that the officers
of TISCO were bringing tremendous pressure to camouflage the
issues disclosed  in investigation  of respondent 6 and that
he has	been got transferred at the instance of the officers
of TISCO  which prima  facie appeals  inasmuch as the day on
which the resident representative of TISCO wrote a letter of
request to  do something in the matter addressed to the then
Chief Secretary,  the same  day Council of Ministers appears
to have	 decided to  transfer respondent 6. The coincidence,
if not curious, is certainly revealing.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">36</span>
<p id="p_29">MLAs./MLCs. made  certain allegations  against respondent  3
which may  be ignored  for the	time being  but	 two  things
transpire from	his  complaint	which  are  of	considerable
importance. It	appears that  TISCO has a special preference
for retired highly placed State and Union level officers and
attracts them  on salary  which none of them drew throughout
his service.  Mahabir Singh,  the retired Inspector-General,
Police, Bihar, has been appointed as Chief Security officer;
H. F. Pinto, after his retirement from the post of Secretary
to Railway  Board, was	employed by  TISCO. That  is equally
true of	 one N.	 K. Gupta, retired Superintendent of Police,
Tatanagar area	who got	 employment with  TISCO and  no	 one
other than the D.I.G., Railway, against whom not a little of
allegation is  made in	this case,  has	 complained  in	 his
letter dated  May 11,  1977, that  TISCO authorities appoint
retired	 railway   and	police	 officers  with	 a  view  to
influencing railway  officers and others. He also complained
that TISCO  authorities are reported to be trying their best
to  seal   all	sorts	of  irregularities   and  might	  be
manufacturing documents	 with break  neck speed	 in defence.
This emanates  from a person who at least has been spared of
any allegation	by respondents	1, 3  and 4  and even  those
supporting them.  The complaint	 made by  MLAs./MLCs. merely
vouchsafes the suspicion voiced by D.I.G., Railway, way back
on May	11, 1977.  This complaint  was made  by	 MLAs./MLCs.
undoubtedly belonging  to the ruling party but that does not
detract from its credibility. If on such a complaint made by
elected representatives	 of the	 people of the State, and in
the background	of what	 D.I.G., Railway,  had suspected and
which was  confirmed in the report made by the Commissioner,
South Chhota  Nagpur Division, an officer not connected with
the police  establishment and  free from  any allegation  of
bias, the  Chief Secretary, decided to draw attention of the
Chief Minister	to take	 some action  in the matter so as to
transfer the  investigation to	the C.B.I., a body free from
local political influence, there is hardly any justification
for calling the circumstances unconventional or unusual. And
this step  was taken  by the  Chief Secretary  way  back  on
August 28,  1978. This is a material date. Even at that time
the Chief  Secretary only  prepared a note pointing out what
was the	 situation and why it had become necessary to direct
C.B.I. investigation  in the  case. The last sentence in the
note  dated   August  28,  1978,  is  that  along  with	 the
investigation of  the case  "C.B.I. may also be requested to
make enquiries	whether any  senior police officer concerned
with these two cases is involved in corruption or not". That
effectively and	 conclusively answers  the  futile  exercise
undertaken  by	 the  High  Court  to  come  to	 an  utterly
unsustainable conclusion  that the  case did not involve any
corruption or  bribery and,  therefore, I.G.  Vigilance	 was
incompetent  to	  undertake  investigation   of	 the   case.
Misappropriation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">37</span>
of public funds has been complained in the first information
report	registered   on	 March	11,  1977.  A  suspicion  of
corruption is  voiced by  the Chief Secretary. This note was
approved meaning  thereby that	the suggestion	therein made
was accepted  by the  Chief Minister  on the  same day, i.e.
August 28,  1978. The  acceptance of  the note	by the Chief
Minister would	tantamount to  taking over the investigation
from respondent 3 and his subordinates and to transfer it to
C.B.I. It  is immaterial  whether C.B.I. accepted it or not.
Pursuant to  this decision  within 5 days, i.e. on September
2, 1978,  the Chief  Secretary wrote  to respondent 3 asking
him to	send all  the papers  of investigation	to him	in a
sealed envelope.  Respondent 3 was also directed to submit a
brief note  with respect  to the case under investigation to
ascertain the  stage of	 investigation. This  direction	 was
received  by  respondent  3  on	 September  7,	1978.  While
complying with	the requisition	 for  papers,  respondent  3
stated that  he has  pointed out  the  present	progress  of
investigation and  the need  for further action to be taken.
It means  investigation was  not complete  even according to
respondent 3.  He also	requested  the	Chief  Secretary  to
return the  papers to him. Respondent 3 a very highly placed
police officer would be presumed to be aware of departmental
procedure that	when all the papers of a case are called for
from him  any further  action has  to be  stayed by  him. In
administrative hierarchy  one does  not go  on passing	stay
orders	and   it  would	 be  too  naive	 to  accept  such  a
suggestion.  There   is	 nothing  to  show  on	record	that
thereafter  any	 further  investigation	 has  been  done  by
respondent 3  or his  subordinates. Subsequent	thereto,  on
November  20,	1978,  respondent   3  requested  the  Chief
Secretary for the return of the records if they were no more
required so  that further  steps could	be taken to complete
the investigation.  Two unassailable conclusions emerge from
this note  of respondent  3: (1)  that the investigation was
not complete;  and (2)	that the same could not be completed
without	 the   records	which	were  then  with  the  Chief
Secretary. However,  without any rhyme or reason and without
the record  and without	 the slightest further investigation
with  an  unseemly  hurry  respondent  3,  with	 a  view  to
forestalling any  action by  the higher	 officers, viz., the
Chief Secretary	 and the  Chief Minister,  directed a  final
report to  be submitted saying that no offence is disclosed.
The narration  of facts	 are so	 telltale that	any  further
comment is  uncalled for. We consider the observation of the
High  Court   that  the	  entrustment  of   the	  case	 for
investigation to Vigilance Department is rather peculiar and
unconventional, as  unwarranted	 and  unsustainable  on	 the
facts hereinabove  narrated and	 discussed.  Similarly,	 the
aspersion  cast	  on  the  complaint  of  MLAs/MLCs.,  lacks
judicial  propriety   in  that	they  were  stigmatised	 and
adversely commented  upon at  their back without calling for
any explanation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">38</span>
from	them.	 In    parliamentary	democracy    elected
representatives have  a duty  to perform and their vigilance
in performance	of duty without anything shown as unbecoming
of them cannot be unilaterally chastised. We say no more.
</p><p id="p_30">     It was  next contended  that the  addition of the Chief
Secretary in suggesting that the investigation be taken over
by the	C.B.I. and  the acceptance  of the same by the Chief
Minister suffers  from legal  malice inasmuch  as the  Chief
Secretary  and	the  Chief  Minister  had  no  jurisdiction,
authority or  power  to	 make  such  an	 order	to  transfer
investigation or  to direct  further  investigation  when  a
report	was   already	submitted   by	 respondent   4	  as
investigating  officer	 to  the  Court	 competent  to	take
cognizance of  the case.  It was,  therefore, submitted chat
even though  no personal  mala fides  is attributed  to	 the
Chief Secretary,  once he  lacked  jurisdiction	 to  re-open
investigation his  note would  show legal  malioe. Reference
was made  to Shearer  v. Shields(1),  wherein it is observed
that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  "Between malice in fact and malice in law there is
     a broad  distinction  which  is  not  peculiar  to	 any
     particular	 system	  of  jurisprudence.  A	 person	 who
     inflicts an injury upon another person in contravention
     of the law is not allowed to say that he did so with an
     innocent mind; he is taken to know the law, and he must
     act within	 the law.  He may,  therefore, be  guilty of
     malice in	law, although,	so far	as the	state of his
     mind is  concerned, he  acts ignorantly,  and  in	that
     sense innocently".
</blockquote><p id="p_31">This was  affirmed by  this Court in <a href="/doc/1473632/" id="a_138">Bhut Nath Mete v. State
of West Bengal</a>.	  (2)
     As pointed	 out above,  if the  Chief Secretary  as the
highest executive  officer at  the  State  level  exercising
power of superintendence over the police of the State posted
in general  police district  would have	 powers	 to  suggest
change	of  investigating  machinery  in  the  circumstances
disclosed in  the letter  dated May 11, 1977, of the D.I.G.,
Railway,  the	report	of   the   Commissioner	  of   South
Chhotanagpur Division,	and the complaint of MLAs./MLCs, his
action could  not be  said to be without power or authority.
In our	opinion, if  he had  acted otherwise,  a  charge  of
inaction or failure or default in performance of his duty as
the highest  chief executive  officer would be squarely laid
at his	door. He  acted in  the best  tradition of the Chief
executive officer  in public interest and for vindication of
truth and  in an honest and unbiased manner. Afterall, if he
had even the remotest bias against any one, he could have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">39</span>
as  well   suggested   in   agreement	with   the   earlier
investigation done by  respondent 6 and the report submitted
by him	for submitting	the chargesheet	 that a charge-sheet
should	be   filed.  In	  fact,	 in  the  background  herein
discussed, the	Chief Secretary	 with utmost candour, with a
view  to  vindicating  the  honour  of	the  administration,
proposed ascertainment	of truth  at the  hands of C.B.I., a
body beyond  reproach as far as local politics is concerned.
The High  Court was,  therefore, in  our opinion, clearly in
error in  casting aspersions  on the Chief Secretary and the
observation "whether  respondent No. 2 is lying or the Chief
Secretary is  feeding us  with false  facts is	not for this
Court to  determine......."is an  observation belied  by the
record and unwarranted in the circumstances of the case. The
contention is wholly unmerited.
</p><p id="p_32">     A grievance was made that there was serious impropriety
in the	Superintendent of Railway Police, Mohammad Sulaiman,
directly addressing a letter to the learned Additional Chief
Judicial Magistrate  on February  15,  1979,  informing	 him
about  the  decision  of  the  Government  to  continue	 the
investigation  and,  therefore,	 not  to  accept  the  final
report. It  is true  that the police officers should refrain
from addressing	 communications	 to  the  Court	 on  pending
matters required  to be determined judicially and we express
our disapproval	 of  this  conduct.  However,  it  makes  no
difference in  this case  because the  learned	Addl.  Chief
Judicial Magistrate  acted not	on the letter dated February
15, 1979, but on an application made by the Assistant Public
Prosecutor in  charge of  the case  and that  is the legally
accepted mode of obtaining a judicial order.
</p><p id="p_33">     The next contention is that the High Court was in error
in exercising  jurisdiction under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_139">Art. 226</a>  at a stage when
the Addl.  Chief Judicial Magistrate who has jurisdiction to
entertain and  try the	case has  not passed upon the issues
before him,  by	 taking	 upon  itself  the  appreciation  of
evidence involving facts about which there is an acrimonious
dispute between	 the parties  and giving a clean bill to the
suspects against  whom	the  first  information	 report	 was
filed. By  so directing	 the learned  Addl.  Chief  Judicial
Magistrate the judgment of the High Court virtually disposed
of the case finally. As we are setting aside the judgment of
the High  Court with  the result that the case would go back
to the	learned Additional  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,  it
would be  imprudent for	 us to make any observation on facts
involved in the case.
</p><p id="p_34">     There is  a clear	cut and	 well demarcated  sphere  of
activity  in   the  field   of	crime  detection  and  crime
punishment.  Investigation   of	 an  offence  is  the  field
exclusively reserved  for the  executive through  the police
department, the superintendent over which vests in the State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">40</span>
Government. The	 executive which  is charged  with a duty to
keep vigilance	over law  and order  situation is obliged to
prevent crime  and if  an offence  is alleged  to have	been
committed it  is its  bounden duty  to investigate  into the
offence and bring the offender to book. Once it investigates
and finds an offence having been committed it is its duty to
collect evidence  for the  purpose of  proving the  offence.
Once that is completed and the investigating officer submits
report to  the Court requesting the Court to take cognizance
of the offence under<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_140"> s. 190</a> of the Code its duty comes to an
end. On a cognizance of the offence being taken by the Court
the police function of investigation comes to an end subject
to the provision contained in<a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_141"> s. 173(8)</a>, there commences the
adjudicatory function  of the judiciary to determine whether
an offence  has been  committed and  if so,  whether by	 the
person or  persons charged  with the  crime by the police in
its report  to the  Court, and	to award adequate punishment
according to  law for the offence proved to the satisfaction
of the	Court.	There  is  thus	 a  well  defined  and	well
demarcated function  in the field of crime detection and its
subsequent  adjudication   between  the	  police   and	 the
Magistrate. This  has  been  recognised	 way  back  in	King
Emperor v.  Khwaja Nazir  Ahmad(1), where  the Privy Council
observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  "In India, as has been shown, there is a statutory
     right on  the part	 of the	 police to  investigate	 the
     circumstances of  an alleged  cognizable crime  without
     requiring any  authority from  the judicial authorities
     and  it   would,  as   their  Lordships  think,  be  an
     unfortunate result	 if it	should be  held possible  to
     interfere with those statutory rights by an exercise of
     the inherent  jurisdiction of  the Court. The functions
     of the  judiciary and the police are complementary, not
     overlapping, and  the combination of individual liberty
     with a  due observance  of law  and order is only to be
     obtained by  leaving each to exercise its own function,
     always, of course, subject to the right of the Court to
     intervene in  an appropriate  case when  moved under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_142"> s.
     491</a> of  the Criminal  Procedure Code to give directions
     in the  nature of	habeas corpus. In such a case as the
     present, however,	the court's  functions begin  when a
     charge is preferred before it, and not until then".</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">     This view	of the Judicial Committee clearly demarcates
the functions  of the  executive and  the judiciary  in	 the
field of  detection of crime and its subsequent trial and it
would appear  that the	power of  the police  to investigate
into a cognizable offence is ordinarily not to be interfered
with by the judiciary.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">41</span>
<p id="p_36">     Some attempt  was	made  to  impress  us  with  utterly
irrelevant factors as to how much freight TISCO is paying to
the railways every year and even the amount which may become
payable in  view of  the disputed  facts was  also paid some
time prior to the filing of the first information report. We
would refrain from making even an implied observation on any
facts involved	in the	dispute. The  case is not at a stage
where the  court is  called upon to quash the proceedings as
disclosing no  offence but  the case  is at  a	stage  where
further investigation  into the	 offence  is  sought  to  be
thwarted by  interference in  exercise of the extra-ordinary
jurisdiction.	Apart	 from	reiterating    the   caution
administered way  back in Khawaja Nazir Ahmad's (supra) case
that unless  an extra-ordinary	case of gross abuse of power
is made	 out by those in charge of investigation as noted in
<a href="/doc/644972/" id="a_143">S.N. Sharma v. Bipen Kumar Tiwari &amp; Ors</a>.(1) the Court should
be quite  loathe to interfere at the stage of investigation,
a field	 of activity  reserved for police and the executive.
It would be advantageous to extract what this Court observed
in S.N. Sharma's case:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "It  appears	to  us	that,  though<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_144">  the  Code</a>  of
     Criminal Procedure gives to the police unfettered power
     to investigate  all cases	where they  suspect  that  a
     cognizable offence	 has been  committed, in appropriate
     cases an  aggrieved person	 can always seek a remedy by
     invoking the  power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_145">Art. 226</a> of
     the Constitution  under which,  if the High Court could
     be convinced  that the  power of investigation has been
     exercised by a police officer mala fide, the High Court
     can always	 issue a  writ of  mandamus restraining	 the
     police officer from misusing his legal powers".
</blockquote><p id="p_37">Not only  such a  case is not made out but the High Court by
an utter  misconception of  its jurisdiction almost directed
the Magistrate	before whom the papers are pending to act in
a manner  as enjoined  by the High Court. How the High Court
has usurped  the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate, the
following passage  from the judgment of the High Court would
be illustrative.  After setting	 aside the impugned order of
the  learned   Magistrate  dated   February  24,  1979,	 and
remitting the case to the learned Magistrate, the High Court
gave the following direction:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "He will  now proceed to consider the final report
     submitted by  the Police  (C.I.D.). I  should, however,
     like  to	observe	 for  the  benefit  of	the  learned
     Magistrate that  he will bear in mind that mere failure
     to follow rules and regulations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">42</span>
     is neither	 cheating nor  breach of trust. He will also
     bear in  mind while  applying himself to the case diary
     with all  thoroughness whether there is any material to
     show that	the Railways  have  suffered.  In  order  to
     constitute offence cheating causation of damage or harm
     to a  person in  body, mind,  reputation or property is
     essential.	 The  learned  Magistrate  will	 direct	 his
     attention to  this aspect	of the	matter. Loss  to the
     Railways cannot  be presumed  merely from	the fact  of
     irregular booking. The learned Magistrate will consider
     the effect of issuing of despatch advice and forwarding
     notes by  Tisco at	 the time  of despatch of goods. The
     learned Magistrate	 will also  bear in  mind that	mere
     failure to	 pay does  not amount  to cheating for, mere
     breach of	contract is  not cheating.  The attention of
     the learned  Additional Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  is
     particularly drawn	 to the	 cases of Harkrishna Mahatab
     v. Emperor	 (AIR 1930  Patna 209),	 <a href="/doc/1421462/" id="a_146">Major Robert Stuart
     Wauchope v.  Emperor</a> (AIR	1933 Calcutta  800) and	 the
     <a href="/doc/225561/" id="a_147">State of  Kerala v.  A. Prasad  Pillai and Another</a> (AIR
     1973  SC	326).  To   my	mind   that  Railway  as  an
     organisation profited  rather than	 lost by the unusual
     procedure adopted	in relation  to Tisco.	The  learned
     Magistrate will  also consider  whether the  whole case
     diary reveals  any material  indicating that any public
     servant had  enriched himself  either by  bribery or by
     breach or	by breach  of faith. After going through the
     case  diary  thoroughly  the  learned  Magistrate	will
     decide dehors  the recommendation	of Superintendent of
     Railway Police, respondent No. 7 and C.I.D. whether any
     offence had  been committed  and if  so  which  accused
     should be put on trial".</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">     Is there  anything more  required to  write  the  final
epitaph	 and  say  amen	 by  the  learned  Additional  Chief
Judicial Magistrate  after the	finding is  recorded by	 the
High Court,  more especially  finding of  fact that  railway
organisation has  profited rather  than lost  by the unusual
procedure ? It is a clear case of usurpation of jurisdiction
vested in  the learned	Addl. Chief  Judicial Magistrate  to
take or	 not to	 take cognizance  of a	case on the material
placed before  him. The High Court in exercise of the extra-
ordinary jurisdiction  committed a  grave  error  by  making
observations on seriously disputed questions of facts taking
its cue	 from affidavits  which in  such a  situation  would
hardly provide	any reliable  material. In  our opinion	 the
High Court  was clearly	 in error  in giving  the  direction
virtually amounting  to a  mandamus to close the case before
the investigation is complete. We say no more.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">43</span>
<p id="p_39">     There  are	  some	serious	  allegations  made  against
respondent 6  by the  original petitioner  and some  of them
were repeated with vehemence even at the hearing before this
Court. We  do not propose to examine them on merits save and
except saying  that once the investigation was taken over by
respondent 3  and the conclusion reached by respondent 6 and
his subordinate	 investigating officer	to file	 the charge-
sheet was  not acted  upon, the	 stage at which the case was
brought to  the High  Court did	 not call  for investigation
into the  mala fides  of  respondent  6,  appellant  in	 the
cognate appeal.	 After making  him a  respondent in the High
Court an  opportunity was  taken to  cast aspersions against
his character.	His whole attitude in registering an offence
and  directing	investigation  into  the  offence  has	been
questioned though  an independent  officer not even remotely
connected with police department, the Commissioner of Chhota
Nagpur Division	 found substance  in the  first	 information
report, in  the investigation  done by	respondent 6 and his
conclusion, which again was affirmed by D.I.G., Railway, not
shown to  be biased.  The High Court interfered at the stage
where investigation  was to  be taken  up by  an independent
agency and,  therefore, the  so called	bias of respondent 6
becomes wholly	irrelevant. It must, however, be pointed out
that if	 an information	 is lodged at the police station and
an offence  is registered,  the mala  fide of  the informant
would  be  of  secondary  importance  if  the  investigation
produces unimpeachable	evidence disclosing the offence. We,
therefore, consider  the aspersions cast on the character of
respondent 6  and the allegations of mala fides made against
him virtually  accepted by  the High  Court in	entirety  as
uttery irrelevant  and the  same may  be treated as expunged
for the purposes of this appeal.
</p><p id="p_40">     We accordingly  allow Criminal Appeal 301/79, quash and
set aside  the order of the High Court and restore the order
passed by  the	learned	 Addl.	Chief  Judicial	 Magistrate,
Jamshedpur, dated  February 24,	 1979. In view of this order
it is  not necessary  to pass any final order in the cognate
appeal (Criminal Appeal 300/79) preferred by respondent 6.
