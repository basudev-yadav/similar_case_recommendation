`CBSE' or the `appellant'). When he got the mark sheet he was disappointed 


with his marks. He thought that he had done well in the examination but his 


answer-books   were   not   properly   valued   and   that   improper   valuation   had 


resulted in low marks. Therefore he made an application for inspection and 


re-evaluation of his answer-books. CBSE rejected the said request by letter 


dated 12.7.2008. The reasons for rejection were:

         maintain confidentiality of both manner and method of evaluation.

evaluation   of   answer-sheets,   in   regard   to   the   examinations   held   by   it   was

evaluating his answer-books and issue a fresh marks card on the basis of re-


evaluation;     (c)   for   a   direction   to   CBSE   to   produce   his   answer-books   in 


regard   to   the   2008   Secondary   School   Examination   so   that   they   could   be 


properly   reviewed   and   fresh   marks   card   can   be   issued   with   re-evaluation 


marks;   (d) for quashing the communication of CBSE dated 12.7.2008 and 


for a direction to produce the answer-books into court for inspection by the 


first respondent. The respondent contended that <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_2">section 8(1)(e)</a> of Right to 


<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a>, 2005 (`<a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_4">RTI Act</a>' for short) relied upon by CBSE was not 


applicable and relied upon the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">RTI Act</a> to claim inspection.

CBSE submitted that 12 to 13 lakhs candidates from about 9000 affiliated 


schools   across   the   country   appear   in   class   X   and   class   XII   examinations

books only for a period of three months after which they are disposed of. It 


was submitted that if candidates were to be permitted to seek re-evaluation 


of   answer   books   or   inspection   thereof,   it   will   create   confusion   and   chaos, 


subjecting its elaborate system of examinations to delay and disarray. It was 


stated   that   apart   from   class   X   and   class   XII   examinations,   CBSE   also 


conducts   several   other   examinations   (including   the   All   India   Pre-Medical 


Test,   All   India   Engineering   Entrance   Examination   and   Jawahar   Navodaya 


Vidyalaya's   Selection   Test).   If   CBSE   was   required   to   re-evaluate   the 


answer-books or grant inspection of answer-books or grant certified copies 


thereof,   it   would   interfere   with   its   effective   and   efficient   functioning,   and 


will also require huge additional staff and infrastructure.   It was submitted 


that   the   entire   examination   system   and   evaluation   by   CBSE   is   done   in   a 


scientific   and   systemic   manner   designed   to   ensure   and   safeguard   the   high 


academic standards and at each level utmost care was taken to achieve the 


object   of   excellence,   keeping   in   view   the   interests   of   the   students.   CBSE 


referred to the following elaborate procedure for evaluation adopted by it :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        "The examination papers are set by the teachers with at least 20 years of 

        teaching   experience   and   proven   integrity.   Paper   setters   are   normally 

        appointed from amongst academicians recommended by then Committee 

        of courses of the Board.   Every paper setter is asked to set more than one 

        set of question papers which are moderated by a team of moderators who 

        are  appointed  from the  academicians  of the  University or from  amongst 

        the   Senior   Principals.   The   function   of   the   moderation   team   is   to   ensure 

        correctness and consistency of different  sets of question  papers with the 

        curriculum   and   to   assess   the   difficulty   level   to   cater   to   the   students   of 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                6</span>



different  schools in different  categories.  After assessing the  papers from 

every point of view, the team of moderators gives a declaration whether 

the   whole   syllabus   is   covered   by   a   set   of   question   papers,   whether   the 

distribution of difficulty level of all the sets is parallel and various other 

aspects   to   ensure   uniform   standard.   The   Board   also   issues   detailed 

instructions for the guidance of the moderators in order to ensure uniform 

criteria for assessment. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">
</blockquote><p id="p_18">The evaluation system on the whole is well organized and fool-proof. All 

the   candidates   are   examined   through   question   papers   set   by   the   same 

paper setters. Their answer books are marked with fictitious roll numbers 

so   as   to   conceal   their   identity.   The   work   of   allotment   of   fictitious   roll 

number is carried out by a team working under a Chief Secrecy Officer 

having   full   autonomy.   The   Chief   Secrecy   Officer   and   his   team   of 

assistants   are   academicians   drawn   from   the   Universities   and   other 

autonomous educational bodies not connected with the Board. The Chief 

Secrecy   Officer   himself   is   usually   a   person   of   the   rank   of   a   University 

professor.   No   official   of   the   Board   at   the   Central   or   Regional   level   is 

associated with him in performance of the task assigned to him. The codes 

of fictitious roll numbers and their sequences are generated by the Chief 

Secrecy   Officer   himself   on   the   basis   of   mathematical   formula   which 

randomize the real roll numbers and are known only to him and his team. 

This ensures complete secrecy about the identification of the answer book 

so much so, that even the Chairman, of the Board and the Controller of 

Examination   of   the   Board   do   not   have   any   information   regarding   the 

fictitious roll numbers granted by the Chief Secrecy Officer and their real 

counterpart numbers. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">
At   the   evaluation   stage,   the   Board   ensures   complete   fairness   and 

uniformity by providing a marking scheme which is uniformity applicable 

to   all   the   examiners   in   order   to   eliminate   the   chances   of   subjectivity. 

These   marking   schemes   are   jointly   prepared   at   the   Headquarters   of   the 

Board in Delhi by the Subject Experts of all the regions. The main purpose 

of the marking scheme is to maintain uniformity in the evaluation of the 

answer books. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">
The   evaluation   of   the   answer   books   in   all   major   subjects   including 

mathematics,   science   subjects   is   done   in   centralized   "on   the   spot" 

evaluation   centers   where   the   examiners   get   answer   book   in   interrupted 

serial orders. Also, the answer books are jumbled  together as a result of 

which the examiners, say in Bangalore may be marking the answer book 

of  a  candidate  who  had  his examination   in  Pondicherry,   Goa,  Andaman 

and  Nicobar  islands,  Kerala,  Andhra  Pradesh,   Tamil   Nadu  or  Karnataka 

itself   but   he   has   no   way   of   knowing   exactly   which   answer   book   he   is 

examining.   The   answer   books   having   been   marked   with   fictitious   roll 

numbers   give   no   clue   to   any   examiner   about   the   state   or   territory   it 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                       7</span>



       belongs to. It cannot give any clue about the candidate's school or centre 

       of   examination.   The   examiner   cannot   have   any   inclination   to   do   any 

       favour to a candidate because he is unable to decodify his roll number or 

       to know as to which school, place or state or territory he belongs to.  


       The examiners check all the questions in the papers thoroughly under the 

       supervision   of   head   examiner   and   award   marks   to   the   sub   parts 

       individually not collectively. They take full precautions and due attention 

       is given while assessing an answer book to do justice to the candidate. Re-

       evaluation is administratively impossible to be allowed in a Board where 

       lakhs of students take examination in multiple subjects. 


       There are strict instructions to the additional head examiners not to allow 

       any shoddy work in evaluation and not to issue more than 20-25 answer 

       books for evaluation to an examiner on a single day.  The examiners are 

       practicing teachers who guard the interest of the candidates.  There is no 

       ground   to   believe   that   they   do   unjust   marking   and   deny   the   candidates 

       their due. It is true that in some cases totaling errors have been detected at 

       the stage of scrutiny or verification of marks. In order to minimize such 

       errors   and   to   further   strengthen   and   to   improve   its   system,   from   1993 

       checking   of   totals   and   other   aspects   of   the   answers   has   been   trebled   in 

       order to detect and eliminate all lurking errors. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">
       The results of all the candidates are reviewed by the Results Committee 

       functioning   at   the   Head   Quarters.   The   Regional   Officers   are   not   the 

       number of this Committee. This Committee reviews the results of all the 

       regions   and   in   case   it   decides   to   standardize   the   results   in   view   of   the 

       results shown by the regions over the previous years, it adopts a uniform 

       policy for the candidates of all the regions. No special policy is adopted 

       for   any   region,   unless   there   are   some   special   reasons.   This   practice   of 

       awarding standardized marks in order to moderate the overall results is a 

       practice   common   to   most   of   the   Boards   of   Secondary   Education.   The 

       exact   number   of   marks   awarded   for   the   purpose   of   standardization   in 

       different   subjects   varies   from   year   to   year.   The   system   is   extremely 

       impersonalized and has no room for collusion infringement. It is in a word 

       a scientific system."

<p id="p_22">


CBSE   submitted   that   the   procedure   evolved   and   adopted   by   it   ensures 


fairness   and   accuracy   in   evaluation   of   answer-books   and   made   the   entire 


process   as   foolproof   as   possible   and   therefore   denial   of   re-evaluation   or 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                 8</span>



inspection or grant of copies cannot be considered to be denial of fair play or 


unreasonable restriction on the rights of the students. 





</p><p id="p_23">5.      A Division Bench of the High Court heard and disposed of the said 


writ petition along with the connected writ petitions (relied by West Bengal 


Board   of   Secondary   Education   and   others)   by   a   common   judgment   dated 


5.2.2009.   The   High   Court   held   that   the   evaluated   answer-books   of   an 


examinee  writing   a   public  examination   conducted   by   statutory   bodies   like 


CBSE   or   any   University   or   Board   of   Secondary   Education,   being   a 


`document,   manuscript   record,   and   opinion'   fell   within   the   definition   of 


"information"   as   defined   in   <a href="/doc/1516599/" id="a_6">section   2(f)</a>   of   the   RTI   Act.   It   held   that   the 


provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_7">RTI Act</a> should be interpreted  in a manner which would 


lead towards dissemination of information rather than withholding the same; 


and in view of the right to information, the examining bodies were bound to 


provide   inspection   of   evaluated   answer   books   to   the   examinees. 


Consequently it directed CBSE to grant inspection of the answer books to 


the   examinees   who   sought   information.   The   High   Court   however   rejected 


the prayer made by the examinees for re-evaluation of the answer-books, as 


that   was   not   a   relief   that   was   available   under   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_8">RTI   Act</a>.     <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_9">RTI   Act</a>   only 


provided a right to access information, but not for any consequential reliefs.

appeal by special leave.

which provided that no candidate shall claim or be entitled to re-evaluation

either with the student or the examiner; and that the information sought by 


any examinee by way of inspection of his answer books, will not fall under

holding   the   `information',   that   is,   the   evaluated   answer-books,   and   the 


inspection of answer-books sought by the examinee being exercise of `right 


to information' as defined under the Act, the examinee as a citizen has the 


right   to   inspect   the   answer-books   and   take   certified   copies   thereof.   It   was 


also   submitted   that   having   regard   to   <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_18">section   22</a>   of   the   RTI   Act,   the 


provisions   of   the   said   Act   will   have   effect   notwithstanding   anything 


inconsistent in any law and will prevail over any rule, regulation or bye law 


of the examining body barring or prohibiting inspection of answer books.

      To   ensure   the   continued   participation   of   the   people   in   the   democratic

      Government   and   the   basis   thereof.   Democracy,   therefore,   expects 

      openness and openness is a concomitant of a free society. Sunlight is the 

      best disinfectant. But it is equally important to be alive to the dangers that 

      lie ahead. It is important to realise that undue popular pressure brought to 

      bear on decision-makers is Government can have frightening side-effects. 

      If   every   action   taken   by   the   political   or   executive   functionary   is 

      transformed into a public controversy and made subject to an enquiry to 

      soothe popular sentiments, it will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the 

      independence of the decision-maker who may find it safer not to take any 

      decision. It will paralyse the entire system and bring it to a grinding halt.

any   material   in   any   form   which   includes   records,   documents,   opinions,

his   answers   in   an   answer-book   and   submits   it   to   the   examining   body   for

evaluation and inspection contained in Bye-law No.61, are akin to Rule 104 


considered in Maharashtra State Board. As a consequence if an examination 


is governed only by the rules and regulations of the examining body which 


bar   inspection,   disclosure   or   re-evaluation,   the   examinee   will   be   entitled 


only   for   re-totalling   by   checking   whether   all   the   answers   have   been 


evaluated   and   further   checking   whether   there   is   no   mistake   in   totaling   of 


marks   for   each   question   and   marks   have   been   transferred   correctly   to   the

evaluation   of   answer-books   sought   by   the   candidates   in   view   of   the   bar 


contained in the rules and regulations of the examining bodies. It is also not 


a   relief   available   under   the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_66">RTI   Act</a>.   Therefore   the   question   whether   re-


evaluation should be permitted or not, does not arise for our consideration. 


What   arises   for   consideration   is   the   question   whether   the   examinee   is 


entitled   to   inspect   his   evaluated   answer-books   or   take   certified   copies 


thereof. This right is claimed by the students, not with reference to the rules

inspect   them   and   take   certified   copies   thereof.   <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_68">Section   22</a>   of   RTI   Act 


provides that the provisions of the said Act will have effect, notwithstanding 


anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being 


in   force.   Therefore   the   provisions   of   the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_69">RTI   Act</a>   will   prevail   over   the 


provisions   of   the   bye-laws/rules   of   the   examining   bodies   in   regard   to 


examinations. As a result, unless the examining body is able to demonstrate 


that   the   answer-books   fall   under   the   exempted   category   of   information 


described in clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_70">section 8(1)</a> of RTI Act, the examining body will 


be bound to provide access to an examinee to inspect and take copies of his 


evaluated answer-books, even if such inspection or taking copies is barred 


under the rules/bye-laws of the examining body governing the examinations. 


Therefore,   the   decision   of   this   Court   in  Maharashtra   State   Board  (supra) 


and the subsequent decisions following the same, will not affect or interfere 


with the right of the examinee seeking inspection of answer-books or taking 


certified copies thereof.

transaction   where   one   person   (beneficiary)   places   complete   confidence   in 


another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs, business or transaction/s. 


The   term   also   refers   to   a   person   who   holds   a   thing   in   trust   for   another 


(beneficiary).   The   fiduciary   is   expected   to   act   in   confidence   and   for   the 


benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in 


dealing with the beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the 


beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust 


or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to the entrusted thing, 


the fiduciary has to act in confidence and expected not to disclose the thing 


or information to any third party. There are also certain relationships where 


both the parties have to act in a fiduciary capacity treating the other as the 


beneficiary. Examples of these are : a partner vis-`-vis another partner and 


an employer  vis-`-vis employee. An employee who comes into possession 


of   business   or   trade   secrets   or   confidential   information   relating   to   the 


employer in the course of his employment, is expected to act as a fiduciary 


and cannot disclose it to others. Similarly, if on the request of the employer 


or official superior or the head of a department, an employee furnishes his 


personal details and information, to be retained in confidence, the employer, 


the official superior or departmental head is expected to hold such personal 


information in confidence as a fiduciary, to be made use of or disclosed only

completed a course  of study  or a period of training in accordance with its 


curricula,   to   a   process   of   verification/examination/testing   of   their 


knowledge, ability or skill, or to ascertain whether they can be said to have 


successfully   completed   or   passed   the   course   of   study   or   training.   Other 


specialized Examining Bodies may simply subject candidates to a process of 


verification by an examination, to find out whether such person is suitable 


for a particular post, job or assignment. An examining body, if it is a public 


authority   entrusted   with   public   functions,   is   required   to   act   fairly, 


reasonably,   uniformly   and   consistently   for   public   good   and   in   public 


interest. This Court has explained the role of an examining body in regard to 


the process of holding examination in the context of examining whether it 


amounts to `service' to a consumer, in <a href="/doc/615635/" id="a_76">Bihar School Examination Board vs.

       or avails of any service from the Board for a consideration. On the other 

       hand,   a  candidate  who  participates  in  the  examination  conducted  by the 

       Board, is a person who has undergone a course of study and who requests 

       the Board to test him as to whether he has imbibed sufficient knowledge to 

       be fit to be declared as having successfully completed the said course of 

       education; and if so, determine his position or rank or competence vis-a-

       vis other examinees. The process is not therefore availment of a service by 

       a   student,   but   participation   in   a   general   examination   conducted   by   the 

       Board to ascertain whether he is eligible and fit to be considered as having 

       successfully completed the secondary education course. The examination 

       fee   paid   by   the   student   is   not   the   consideration   for   availment   of   any 

       service,   but   the   charge   paid   for   the   privilege   of   participation   in   the

fiduciary   withholding   information   relating   to   the   beneficiary,   from   the 


beneficiary himself. One of the duties of the fiduciary is to make thorough 


disclosure   of   all   relevant   facts   of   all   transactions   between   them   to   the 


beneficiary, in a fiduciary relationship. By that logic, the examining body, if 


it is in a fiduciary relationship with an examinee, will be liable to make a full 


disclosure  of the evaluated answer-books to the examinee  and at the same 


time, owe a duty to the examinee not to disclose the answer-books to anyone 


else.   If   A   entrusts   a   document   or   an   article   to   B   to   be   processed,   on 


completion of processing, B is not expected to give the document or article 


to   anyone   else   but   is   bound   to   give   the   same   to   A   who   entrusted   the 


document   or   article   to   B   for   processing.   Therefore,   if   a   relationship   of 


fiduciary and beneficiary  is assumed  between the examining body and the 


examinee with reference to the answer-book, <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_78">section 8(1)(e)</a> would operate

second is the marks/assessment by the examiner. When an examinee seeks 


inspection   of   his   evaluated   answer-books   or   seeks   a   certified   copy   of   the 


evaluated   answer-book,   the   information   sought   by   him   is   not   really   the 


answers he has written in the answer-books (which he already knows), nor 


the total marks assigned for the answers (which has been declared). What he 


really seeks is the information relating to the break-up of marks, that is, the 


specific   marks   assigned   to   each   of   his   answers.   When   an   examinee   seeks 


`information' by inspection/certified copies of his answer-books, he knows 


the   contents   thereof   being   the   author   thereof.   When   an   examinee   is 


permitted   to   examine   an   answer-book   or   obtain   a   certified   copy,   the 


examining body is not really giving him some information which is held by 


it in trust or confidence, but is only giving him an opportunity to read what 


he had written at the time of examination or to have a copy of his answers. 


Therefore, in furnishing the copy of an answer-book, there is no question of 


breach of confidentiality, privacy, secrecy or trust. The real issue therefore is 


not   in   regard   to   the   answer-book   but   in   regard   to   the   marks   awarded   on 


evaluation   of   the   answer-book.   Even   here   the   total   marks   given   to   the 


examinee in regard to his answer-book are already declared and known to 


the examinee. What the examinee actually wants to know is the break-up of 


marks given to him, that is how many marks were given by the examiner to 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                  38</span>



each   of   his   answers   so   that   he   can   assess   how   is   performance   has   been 


evaluated   and   whether   the   evaluation   is   proper   as   per   his   hopes   and 


expectations. Therefore, the test for finding out whether the information is 


exempted   or   not,   is   not   in   regard   to   the   answer   book   but   in   regard   to   the 


evaluation by the examiner. 
</p>
<p id="p_107">



</p><p id="p_108">26.     This takes us to the crucial issue of evaluation by the examiner. The 


examining   body   engages   or   employs   hundreds   of   examiners   to   do   the 


evaluation   of   thousands   of   answer   books.   The   question   is   whether   the 


information relating to the `evaluation' (that is assigning of marks) is held 


by   the   examining   body   in   a   fiduciary   relationship.   The   examining   bodies 


contend that even if fiduciary relationship does not exist with reference to 


the   examinee,   it   exists   with   reference   to   the   examiner   who   evaluates   the 


answer-books. On a careful examination we find that this contention has no 


merit.   The   examining   body   entrusts   the   answer-books   to   an   examiner   for 


evaluation   and   pays   the   examiner   for   his   expert   service.   The   work   of 


evaluation   and   marking   the   answer-book   is   an   assignment   given   by   the 


examining   body   to   the   examiner   which   he   discharges   for   a   consideration. 


Sometimes,   an   examiner   may   assess   answer-books,   in   the   course   of   his 


employment,   as   a   part   of   his   duties   without   any   specific   or   special 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                               39</span>



remuneration. In other words the examining body is the `principal' and the 


examiner is the agent entrusted with the work, that is, evaluation of answer-


books. Therefore,  the examining body is not in the position of a fiduciary 


with reference to the examiner. On the other hand, when an answer-book is 


entrusted to the examiner for the purpose of evaluation, for the period  the 


answer-book   is   in   his   custody   and   to   the   extent   of   the   discharge   of   his 


functions relating to evaluation, the examiner is in the position of a fiduciary 


with reference to the examining body and he is barred from disclosing the 


contents of the answer-book or the result of evaluation of the answer-book to 


anyone other than the examining body. Once the examiner has evaluated the 


answer books, he ceases to have any interest in the evaluation done by him. 


He does not have any copy-right or proprietary right, or confidentiality right 


in regard to the evaluation. Therefore it cannot be said that the examining 


body holds the evaluated answer books in a fiduciary relationship, qua the 


examiner.

evaluated   answer-books   in   a   fiduciary   relationship.   Not   being   information 


available to an examining body in its fiduciary relationship, the exemption 


under <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_79">section 8(1)(e)</a> is not available to the examining bodies with reference

have to permit inspection sought by the examinees.

Re : Question (iv)


</p><p id="p_112">28.     When   an   examining   body   engages   the   services   of   an   examiner   to 


evaluate the answer-books, the examining body expects the examiner not to 


disclose   the   information   regarding   evaluation   to   anyone   other   than   the 


examining   body.   Similarly   the   examiner   also   expects   that   his   name   and 


particulars would not be disclosed to the candidates whose answer-books are 


evaluated   by   him.   In   the   event   of   such   information   being   made   known,   a 


disgruntled examinee who is not satisfied with the evaluation of the answer 


books, may act to the prejudice of the examiner by attempting to endanger 


his  physical  safety.  Further,  any  apprehension on the  part  of the examiner 


that   there   may   be   danger   to   his   physical   safety,   if   his   identity   becomes 


known to the examinees, may come in the way of effective discharge of his 


duties.   The   above   applies   not   only   to   the   examiner,   but   also   to   the 


scrutiniser, co-ordinator, and head-examiner who deal with the answer book. 


The answer book usually contains not only the signature and code number of 


the examiner, but also the signatures and code number of the scrutiniser/co-


ordinator/head examiner. The information as to the names or particulars of 


the   examiners/co-ordinators/scrutinisers/head   examiners   are   therefore 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                               41</span>



exempted from disclosure under <a href="/doc/1535548/" id="a_81">section 8(1)(g)</a> of RTI Act, on the ground 


that if such information is disclosed, it may endanger their physical safety. 


Therefore,   if   the   examinees   are   to   be   given   access   to   evaluated   answer-


books either  by permitting  inspection or by granting  certified  copies, such 


access will have to be given only to that part of the answer-book which does 


not   contain   any   information   or   signature   of   the   examiners/co-


ordinators/scrutinisers/head   examiners,   exempted   from   disclosure   under 


<a href="/doc/1535548/" id="a_82">section   8(1)(g)</a>   of   RTI   Act.   Those   portions   of   the   answer-books   which 


contain information regarding the examiners/co-ordinators/scrutinisers/head 


examiners or which may disclose their identity with reference to signature or 


initials,   shall   have   to  be   removed,   covered,   or   otherwise   severed   from  the 


non-exempted part of the answer-books, under <a href="/doc/580445/" id="a_83">section 10</a> of RTI Act. 




</p><p id="p_113">29.     The   right   to   access   information   does   not   extend   beyond   the   period 


during which the examining body is expected to retain the answer-books.  In 


the   case   of   CBSE,   the   answer-books   are   required   to   be   maintained   for   a 


period   of   three   months   and   thereafter   they   are   liable   to   be   disposed 


of/destroyed. Some other examining bodies are required to keep the answer-


books   for   a   period   of   six   months.   The   fact   that   right   to   information   is 


available  in regard to answer-books does not mean that answer-books will 


have  to  be maintained   for  any  longer  period   than  required  under the  rules

and regulations of the public authority. The obligation under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_84">RTI Act</a> is 


to   make   available   or   give   access   to  existing   information  or   information 


which is expected to be preserved or maintained. If the rules and regulations 


governing   the   functioning   of   the   respective   public   authority   require 


preservation of the information for only a limited period, the applicant for 


information   will   be   entitled   to   such   information   only   if   he   seeks   the 


information when it is available with the public authority. For example, with 


reference to answer-books, if an examinee makes an application to CBSE for 


inspection or grant of certified copies beyond three months (or six months or 


such   other   period   prescribed   for   preservation   of   the   records   in   regard   to 


other   examining   bodies)   from   the   date   of   declaration   of   results,   the 


application   could   be   rejected   on   the   ground   that   such   information   is   not 


available. The power of the Information Commission under <a href="/doc/1758911/" id="a_85">section 19(8)</a> of 


the RTI Act to require a public authority to take any such steps as may be 


necessary  to   secure   compliance   with   the   provision   of   the   Act,  does   not 


include a power to direct the public authority to preserve the information, for 


any period larger than what is provided under the rules and regulations of the 


public authority.

the part of every public authority to maintain the information for a minimum 


period of twenty years and make it available  whenever an application was 


made in that behalf. This contention is based on a complete misreading and 


misunderstanding   of   <a href="/doc/22288/" id="a_87">section   8(3)</a>.   The   said   sub-section   nowhere   provides 


that   records   or   information   have   to   be   maintained   for   a   period   of   twenty 


years. The period for which any particular records or information has to be 


maintained  would depend  upon the relevant  statutory  rule or regulation  of 


the   public   authority   relating   to   the   preservation   of   records.   <a href="/doc/22288/" id="a_88">Section   8(3)</a> 


provides that information relating to any occurrence, event or matters which 


has taken place and occurred or happened  twenty  years before the date  on 


which any request is made under <a href="/doc/1910806/" id="a_89">section 6</a>, shall be provided to any person 


making   a   request.   This   means   that   where   any   information   required   to   be 


maintained and preserved for a period beyond twenty years under the rules 


of   the   public   authority,   is   exempted   from   disclosure   under   any   of   the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_133">33.     Some High Courts have held that <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_106">section 8</a> of RTI Act is in the nature 


of an exception to <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_107">section 3</a> which empowers the citizens with the right to 


information,   which   is   a   derivative   from   the   freedom   of   speech;   and   that 


therefore <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_108">section 8</a> should be construed strictly, literally and narrowly. This 


may   not   be   the   correct   approach.   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_109">The   Act</a>   seeks   to   bring   about   a   balance 


between two conflicting interests, as harmony between them is essential for 


preserving democracy. One is to bring about transparency and accountability 


by providing  access to information under the control  of public authorities. 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                               48</span>



</blockquote><p id="p_123">The other is to ensure that the revelation of information, in actual practice, 


does not conflict with other public interests which include efficient operation 


of   the   governments,   optimum   use   of   limited   fiscal   resources   and 


preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information. The preamble to the 


Act specifically states that the object of the Act is to harmonise these two 


conflicting   interests.   While   <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_110">sections   3</a>   and   <a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_111">4</a>   seek   to   achieve   the   first 


objective,   <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_112">sections   8</a>,   <a href="/doc/1053993/" id="a_113">9</a>,   <a href="/doc/580445/" id="a_114">10</a>   and   <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_115">11</a>   seek   to   achieve   the   second   objective. 


Therefore when <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_116">section 8</a> exempts certain information from being disclosed, 


it should not be considered to be a fetter on the right to information, but as 


an equally important provision protecting other public interests essential for 


the fulfilment and preservation of democratic ideals. 




</p><p id="p_124">34.     When trying to ensure that the right to information does not conflict 


with several other public interests (which includes efficient operations of the 


governments,   preservation   of   confidentiality   of   sensitive   information, 


optimum use of limited fiscal resources, etc.), it is difficult to visualise and 


enumerate   all   types   of   information   which   require   to   be   exempted   from 


disclosure in public interest. The legislature has however made an attempt to 


do   so.   The   enumeration   of   exemptions   is   more   exhaustive   than   the 


enumeration of exemptions attempted in the earlier Act that is <a href="/doc/1669859/" id="a_117">section 8</a> of 


Freedom   to   <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_118">Information   Act</a>,   2002.   The   Courts   and   Information

Commissions enforcing the provisions of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_119">RTI Act</a> have to adopt a purposive 


construction,   involving   a   reasonable   and   balanced   approach   which 


harmonises the two objects of the Act, while interpreting <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_120">section 8</a> and the 


other provisions of the Act.

<p id="p_125">


</p><p id="p_126">35.     At   this   juncture,   it   is   necessary   to   clear   some   misconceptions   about 


the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_121">RTI   Act</a>.   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_122">The   RTI   Act</a>   provides   access   to   all   information  that   is  


available and existing. This is clear from a combined reading of <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_123">section 3</a> 


and the definitions of `information' and `right to information' under clauses 


</p><p id="p_127">(f) and (j) of <a href="/doc/277989/" id="a_124">section 2</a> of the Act. If a public authority has any information in 


the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics, an applicant may 


access such information, subject to the exemptions in <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_125">section 8</a> of the Act. 


But   where   the   information   sought   is   not   a   part   of   the   record   of   a   public 


authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under 


any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not 


cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such non-


available information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public authority 


is   also   not   required   to   furnish   information   which   require   drawing   of 


inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide 


`advice' or `opinion' to an applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any 


`opinion' or `advice' to an applicant. The reference to `opinion' or `advice'

in   the  definition   of  `information'   in  <a href="/doc/1516599/" id="a_126">section   2(f)</a>   of  the  Act,   only   refers   to 


such material available in the records of the public authority. Many public 


authorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and 


opinion   to   the   citizens.   But   that   is   purely   voluntary   and   should   not   be 


confused with any obligation under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_127">RTI Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_129">36.     <a href="/doc/1758911/" id="a_128">Section 19(8)</a> of RTI Act has entrusted the Central/State Information 


Commissions,   with   the   power   to   require   any   public   authority   to   take   any 


such steps as may be necessary to secure the compliance with the provisions 


of the Act. Apart from the generality of the said power, clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1758911/" id="a_129">section 


19(8)</a> refers to six specific powers, to implement the provision of the Act. 


Sub-clause   (i)   empowers   a   Commission   to   require   the   public   authority   to 


provide access to information if so requested in a particular `form' (that is 


either  as   a  document,  micro   film,  compact  disc,   pendrive,   etc.).   This  is   to 


secure compliance with <a href="/doc/1322680/" id="a_130">section 7(9)</a> of the Act. Sub-clause (ii) empowers a 


Commission   to   require   the   public   authority   to   appoint   a   Central   Public 


Information   Officer   or   State   Public   Information   Officer.   This   is   to   secure 


compliance   with   <a href="/doc/698257/" id="a_131">section   5</a>   of   the   Act.   Sub-clause   (iii)   empowers   the 


Commission to require a public authority to publish certain information or 


categories of information. This is to secure compliance with <a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_132">section 4(1)</a> and 


(2) of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_133">RTI Act</a>. Sub-clause (iv) empowers a Commission to require a public 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                               51</span>



authority   to   make   necessary   changes   to   its   practices   relating   to   the 


maintenance, management and destruction of the records. This is to secure 


compliance   with   clause   (a)   of   <a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_134">section   4(1)</a>   of   the   Act.   Sub-clause   (v) 


empowers   a   Commission   to   require   the   public   authority   to   increase   the 


training   for   its   officials   on   the   right   to   information.   This   is   to   secure 


compliance with <a href="/doc/698257/" id="a_135">sections 5</a>, <a href="/doc/1910806/" id="a_136">6</a> and <a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_137">7</a> of the Act. Sub-clause (vi) empowers a 


Commission   to   require   the   public   authority   to   provide   annual   reports   in 


regard to the compliance  with clause  (b) of <a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_138">section 4(1)</a>. This is to ensure 


compliance with the provisions of clause (b) of <a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_139">section 4(1)</a> of the Act. The 


power under <a href="/doc/1758911/" id="a_140">section 19(8)</a> of the Act however does not extend to requiring a 


public authority to take any steps which are not required or contemplated to 


secure   compliance   with   the   provisions   of   the   Act   or   to   issue   directions 


beyond the provisions of the Act. The power under <a href="/doc/1758911/" id="a_141">section 19(8)</a> of the Act 


is intended to be used by the Commissions  to ensure compliance  with the 


Act,   in   particular   ensure   that   every   public   authority   maintains   its   records 


duly catalogued and indexed in the manner and in the form which facilitates 


the   right   to   information   and   ensure   that   the   records   are   computerized,   as 


required under clause (a) of <a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_142">section 4(1)</a> of the Act; and to ensure that the 


information enumerated in clauses (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_143">sections 4(1)</a> of the Act are 


published and disseminated, and are periodically updated as provided in sub-

sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_144">section 4</a> of the Act. If the `information' enumerated 


in   clause   (b)   of   <a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_145">section   4(1)</a>   of   the   Act   are   effectively   disseminated   (by 


publications in print and on websites and other effective means), apart from 


providing   transparency   and   accountability,   citizens   will   be   able   to   access 


relevant   information   and   avoid   unnecessary   applications   for   information 


under the Act.

</p><p id="p_131">37.     The right to information is a cherished right. Information and right to 


information are intended to be formidable tools in the hands of responsible 


citizens to fight corruption and to bring in transparency and accountability. 


The provisions of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_146">RTI Act</a> should be enforced strictly and all efforts should 


be   made   to   bring   to   light   the   necessary   information   under   clause   (b)   of 


<a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_147">section   4(1)</a>     of   the   Act   which   relates   to   securing   transparency   and

affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting 


bogged   down   with   the   non-productive   work   of   collecting   and   furnishing 


information.   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_150">The   Act</a>   should   not   be   allowed   to   be   misused   or   abused,   to 


become   a   tool   to   obstruct   the   national   development   and   integration,   or   to 


destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it 


be   converted   into   a   tool   of   oppression   or   intimidation   of   honest   officials 


striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of 


the   staff   of   public   authorities   spends   75%   of   their   time   in   collecting   and 


furnishing   information   to   applicants   instead   of   discharging   their   regular 


duties.   The   threat   of   penalties   under   the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_151">RTI   Act</a>   and   the   pressure   of   the
