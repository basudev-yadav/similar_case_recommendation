            discussed hereinabove, there should be no difficulty  
            in so far as action for passing off is concerned.  It

            prior   user   even   against   the   registered   user.   The  




                                                  
            difficulty   would   be   in   respect   of   action   for  
            infringement of trademark, inasmuch as in view of

            the basis of having registration in his favour.   In  
            my respectful view, this would lead to anomalous  
                  
            situation.  If an action for passing off is by a prior  
            user, the Court would be permitted to go into the  
            issues including the issue of validity of registration  
                 
            of   the   defendant's   trademark   and   even   grant   an

            mark   is   not   registered   and   against   the   person  
            whose   mark   is   registered.     However,     if   an  
      


            injunction is sought by a proprietor of a registered  
            trademark,   in   view   of   the   view   taken   by   the

</p><p id="p_28">            Maxheal  Pharmaceuticals   v.  Shalina   Laboratories

            plaintiff's  registration   and   will   have   to   grant   an  
            injunction merely for asking.   In view of the view  
            taken   by   the   Division   Bench,   which   binds   the  
            learned   single   Judges   of   this   Court,   this   Court

     analogous to the principle that an interlocutory relief that can be 
     granted by a Court must be germane to the main relief and only as 
     an aid to the final relief that can be granted and the Court cannot 





     grant any interlocutory relief which it cannot grant as final relief.

     not to be registered in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_32">Section 35</a> of the

     Therefore  the said presumption operates at all times from the date 
     of   registration   till   the   registration   is   cancelled   and   there   is   no 





     question of the said presumption being rebutted at any time prior to

     interpreting the provisions of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_50">Designs Act</a> 1911, held that such a 
   



     plea can be taken in a suit for infringement of a registered design. In 
     <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_51">Section 22</a> (3) of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_52">Designs Act</a> 2000, it is provided that in any suit

     certificate and which presumption could be rebutted only when the 





     mark was rectified by the appropriate authority having jurisdiction to

     raised   at   an   interlocutory   stage.   The   provisions   of   the   Act   are 
                        
     required to be interpreted in such a manner that the objects of the 
     Act are fulfilled.  Accepting the view that the plea of invalidity can 
     be raised in an infringement action will result in destroying what 
      


     was granted by the Act by providing for registration and will amount 
   



     to   putting   the   clock   back   to   pre-1875   position.   If   such   a   plea   is 
     allowed to be taken at the interlocutory stage in an infringement 
     action, the effect of registration will stand destroyed and there will 





     not be any difference between a suit for infringement of a trademark 
     and a suit for passing off. Various Courts,   including the Supreme 
     Court have held that the two actions (one for the infringement and 





     the other for passing off ) are different.

<p id="p_76">     (e)         <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_71">The Act</a> of 1958 was preceded by the Act of 1940, which 
     contained the words "if valid".   An amendment was moved to the 




                                         
     1940 Act to delete the words "if valid".  A legislative intent can be 
                         
     gathered from the notes and the clause which stated that it sought 
     to   omit   the   words  "if  valid"  so  as to  bar  any Court   to go  into  a 
                        
     question   of   validity   of   registration.     <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_72">Under   the   Act</a>   of   1958,   the 
     words   "if   valid"   were   introduced   again.     The   legislative   intent   is 
     clear that the words "if valid" are referable to the Court enforcing 
      


     the registration.  Thus it cannot be said that the words "if valid" and 
   



     "prima facie" are superfluous.  They are meant to grant power to the 
     Court to examine validity of the registration.
</p>




<p id="p_77">     (f)           However, once registration is granted, it is desirable that 
     the   holder   thereof   should   continue   to   exercise   its   right   till   the 





     registration   is   set   aside   without   having   to   face   legal   hurdles   in 
     enforcement.  Though the words "prima facie", "valid" are used, the 
     registration of trade mark will have to be taken as a very strong 
     evidence in favour of the validity.

<p id="p_79">     (h)           Since  this Court  has always demanded extremely high 
     degree of proof from a challenger regarding validity of registration 
     of   trade   mark   and   in   almost   all   cases   the   injunctions   have   been 




                                         
     granted on the basis of the trade mark, it has thus become a practice 
                         
     of this Court not to lightly accept challenge to the validity of the 
     trade mark. While using the discretion to grant injunction on the 
                        
     basis of the registration of trade mark, this Court has almost always 
     granted such injunction; it is in this context that this Court has held 
      

     that it is the practice of the Court to grant injunction on the basis of 
     the registration.

<p id="p_80">     (i)           It is one thing to say that at an interlocutory stage, once 





     the suit is brought on the basis of the infringement of registration of 
     trade mark, injunction should normally be granted than to say that 
     the injunction must be granted and the defendant cannot argue that 





     the trade mark is not valid.       Even if such argument is advanced, 
     the Court can always use its discretion to hold that in a given case 
     the  heavy burden is not discharged and rely upon practice of this 
     Court   in   generally   not   granting   the   injunction,  but   to  completely 
     shut out an enquiry will be contrary to the statute.

     required   for   registration   and   has   acquired   distinctiveness.   The 
     scheme of the Act clearly shows that the plea of invalidity cannot be 
     considered at an interlocutory stage in a suit for infringement. It is 





     further to be noted that if such plea is allowed then instead of the 
     Defendant     being   required   to   discharge   the   burden   of   proving 
     invalidity,   the   Plaintiff     whose   mark   is   registered   will   have   to

     conformity with the final decision of the IPAB. The very fact that the 
     civil court is required to pass a  decree in conformity with the final 





     decision of the IPAB shows that the civil court cannot touch upon or 
     deal   with   the   question   of   validity   of   registration.   The   civil   court 
     trying   an   infringement   Suit,   does   not   have   any   jurisdiction   to 





     consider the validity of registration at all, even at the final hearing

     1940 included the words "if valid" and they were deleted in 1946 in

     examine   challenge  to  the  validity  of the  registration   of the  trade 
     mark granted by the Registrar in British India.  However, the 1958 
     Act again introduced those words; meaning thereby, the power to 





     examine the question of validity of the registration of trade mark 
     was given back to the Court.

     plainly read, means registration will be a prima facie evidence. The 
     expression   'prima   facie'   is   too   well-settled   to   be   expounded.     To 




                                          
     substitute the words 'prima facie' with 'conclusive evidence', would 
                         
     be re-writing   the section. <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_202">Section 28</a> uses   the phrase 'if valid'.   If 
     the registration was to be the 'conclusive', it was not necessary to 
                        
     introduce   the   phrases   'if   valid'   and   'prima   facie'.     In     series   of

     Pradesh   High   Court   and   Gujrat   High   Court   have   given   plain 
     meaning to these phrases to come to the conclusion that registration 
   



     will be a prima facie evidence of its validity and not a conclusive 
     evidence.

     the   proprietor   of   a   registered   trademark   rests   on   two   grounds. 
     Firstly, that it is a practice of this Court to grant such injunction, and

     note   how   this   'practice'   originated.     The   origin   lies   in   a   passage 




                                                          
     quoted by Vimadalal, J. in the case of <a href="/doc/1326002/" id="a_203">Hindustan Embroidery Mills 
     v.   K.  Ravindra  &amp;  Co</a>.2   from the  book by Kerly on Trademarks. 
     Vimadalal J. referred to a passage from  the book which stated that 




                                                         
     it is not the practice to consider the validity of registration of mark 
     on a motion for interlocutory injunction and while the mark remains 
     in   the   register   even   though   wrongly,   it   is   desirable   that   others 




                                               
     should not imitate it.  Thereafter the Division Bench in the case of 
                          
     M/s.Maxheal   Pharmaceuticals   (India)   and   others  v.   Shalina 
     Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.3   referred to the decision of Vimadalal, J. 
</p>                         
<p id="p_149">     and observed that Vimadalal, J. has pointed out that it is not "the 
     practice   of   this   Court"   to   consider   validity   of   a   trademark   on   a 
      

     motion for interlocutory injunction.   The Division Bench attributed 
     the   phrase   'practice   of   this   Court'   to   Vimadalal   J.,   though 
   



     Vimadalal,J. had not used the phrase 'the practice of this Court'.  He 
     had   only   referred   to   Kerly   on   Trademarks   which   contained   a 





     passage   that   it   is   a   'practice'   not   to   consider   the   validity   of   the 
     registration.     However,   the   observations  of   the   Division   Bench   in 
     Maxheal have now been followed in various orders, treating it as a 





     'practice   of  this  Court'. Be  that  as it may, since  it is treated as a 
     practice of this Court, we have to consider whether to elevate it to 
     an absolute proposition of law, and also whether the Act requires it 
     to   be   an   absolute   proposition.     Mr.Kadam     analysed   various

<p id="p_157">     39.           Dr.Tulzapurkar drew our attention to the reports of the 
     Committees constituted to make recommendations to amend the Act 
     of 1940.  He pointed out that the Shavaksha Committee was of the 




                                        
     opinion that the words "if valid" should not be included so that the 
                        
     defence of invalidity is not available to the defendant.  He also drew 
     our attention to the report of  Justice  Rajgopal Ayyangar Committee 
                       
     which opined that the defence of the invalidity should be available 
     to   the   defendant,   but   recommended   that   the   issue   of   invalidity 
      

     should not be decided by the Court but should be decided in the 
     rectification   application.     This   may   have   been   the   view   of   the 
   



     Committee constituted to recommend changes in the enactment, but 
     at the highest, it was only a material placed before the legislature at 





     the  time  of  enactment  of this statute.   The fact remains  that  the 
     words "if valid" and "prima facie evidence" were incorporated in the 
     statute.     Furthermore,   the   question   of   referring   to   any   external 





     material would arise if the language of the statute was ambiguous. 
     As we have already held that the words "if valid" and "prima facie 
     evidence" are clear enough upon plain reading of them and it is not 
     necessary  to   adopt  any other rule  of interpretation, except  literal 
     interpretation.

     'Malar'   was   a   general   word   in   Tamil,   it   meant   a   magazine.   The

     words 'Malar TV' have become publicia juris.  The appeal filed by the 
     plaintiff was also dismissed.   In this case, the Madras High Court 
      

     made a prima facie enquiry into the question whether the words in 
     the   trademark   'Malar'   and   'TV'   were  publicia   juris  and   did   not 
   



     automatically grant injunction on the basis of the registration.  Same

            This   results   in   a   product   acquiring   a   worldwide

            lead to an anomalous situation if an identical mark

            no intention of coming to India or introducing their  
   



            product in India should not be allowed to throttle  
            an Indian Company by not permitting it to sell a  
            product   in   India,   if   the   Indian   Company   has  





            genuinely   adopted   the   mark   and   developed   the  
            product   and   is   first   in   the   market.     Thus   the

     infringement action where the Defendant is able to show fraudulent 
                        
     nature of the registration of the Plaintiff's trade mark.  As observed 
     by   the   Supreme   Court   in  Milment   Oftho   Industries's   case,   the 
                       
     Court   must   keep   in   mind   the   fact   that   now-a-days,   the   field   of 
     medicine   is   of   an   international   character.     Doctors,   particularly 
     eminent Doctors, medical practitioners and persons or Companies 
      


     connected with medical field keep abreast of latest developments in 
   



     medicine   preparations   worldwide.     Medical   literature   is   freely 
     available   in   this   country.     Doctors   and   medical   practitioners   and 





     persons connected with the medical field regularly attend medical 
     conferences, symposiums, lectures, etc.  Goods are widely advertised 
     in newspapers, periodicals, magazines, and on the internet.   This 





     results in a product acquiring a worldwide reputation in a very short 
     time.  If the trade mark in respect of a medicine is associated with 
     the Defendant worldwide, it would lead to an anomalous situation if 
     an identical mark in respect of a similar medicine is allowed to be 
     sold in India only on the ground that the Plaintiff got it registered in 
     India first.  The ultimate test should be who is first in the market.

     given   to  the   world   at   large   to  raise   an   objection   to  the   grant   of

     the view that it is precisely because of that reason that there is a 
                         
     strong presumption in favour of the validity of a registered trade 
     mark and at an interlocutory stage in a suit for infringement action, 
                        
     the Civil Court will not easily doubt the validity of the registration of 
     the   Plaintiff's   trade   mark.   Even   where   the   Defendant   has   taken 
      

     rectification proceedings before the Appellate Board, the Civil Court 
     will not treat it as a sufficient ground for refusing the grant of an ad-

<p id="p_172">     interim injunction in favour of the Plaintiff.  But having said so, it is 
     difficult to accept the Plaintiff's  contention that the Court is barred 





     from  considering the Defendant's plea about fraudulent nature of 
     the Plaintiff's registered trade mark or where the registration of the 
     Plaintiff's trade mark bears the mark of invalidity on its forehead.

     TECHNOLOGY'. The plaintiff alleged infringement of its trademark 
     by   the   defendant,   and   filed   a   suit.     The   plaintiff   took   out   an 




                                                                                
     application   for   interlocutory   relief,   which   was   opposed   by   the 




                                                        
     defendant.  One of the contentions raised by the defendant was that 
     registration   of   the   trademark   was   bad   in   law   and,   therefore,   the 
     plaintiff is not entitled to any injunction.  An ex-parte interim-relief 




                                                       
     was granted in favour of the plaintiff which was later on vacated by 
     the   learned   Single   Judge.     The   plaintiff   challenged   the   order 
     denying interim relief to it, by way of an appeal before the Division 




                                          
     Bench.   Before the Division Bench, issues arose as to whether the 
                         
     factum of registration gave exclusive right to use the trademark, and 
     whether  the  registration  constitutes only prima facie validity, and 
                        
     whether the Court can deny injunction in spite of the registration. 
     The Division Bench crystallized these issues and answered them as

     that   the   Apex   Court  could  go  into the  question  of  validity  but  it

<p id="p_188">            13.  The perusal of the aforesaid provision (of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_270">sections  
            28</a> and <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_271">31</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1958) clearly shows  
            that an exclusive right to the use of the trade mark has  




                                           
            been given to the registered proprietor by <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_272">Section 28(1)</a>  
            in   relation   to   the   goods   in   respect   of   which   the   trade  
                         
            mark is registered. It is the registered proprietor who is  
            also   given   the   right   to   obtain   relief   in   respect   of   the  
            infringement of the trade mark. It is true that  <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_273">Section  
                        
            28(1)</a> confers the right on the registered proprietor if the  
            registration is valid. This provision has, therefore, to be  
            read along with <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_274">Section 31(1)</a> which, inter alia, provides  
            that the registration of the trade mark shall be the prima  
      


            facie   evidence   of   the   validity   thereof.   Reading   the   two  
            provisions   together,   namely   <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_275">Section   28(1)</a>   and   <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_276">Section  
   



            31(1)</a>, the implication would be that as long as a trade  
            mark stands registered in the name of a proprietor, the  
            said   registration   shall   be   deemed   to   be   valid   and   the  





            registered proprietor would have an exclusive right to use  
            the said trade mark. If the registration is cancelled by an  
            action being taken under <a href="/doc/1356592/" id="a_277">Section 56</a> of the Act, then the  
            protection and right afforded under <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_278">Section 28(1)</a> read  
            with <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_279">Section 31(1)</a> would no longer be available, but till

            is shown as the proprietor of the registered trade mark  
            would   continue   to   have   all   the   rights   and   privileges  
            which are conferred by the Act on the registered owner of  
            the trade mark. Therefore, even though the plaintiff has

     point   by  a  motion  to  take  the  mark  off the  register  i.e. by filing 





     rectification proceeding in the same Court.  The Court did not have 
     to deal with the contention whether in a suit for infringement of 
     Trademark, the question of invalidity can be examined as a prima 
     facie case in an interlocutory proceeding.

     that the registration in the Plaintiff's favour is so fraudulent or is so 
     apparently invalid that the Court should not grant an injunction in 
   



     favour of the Plaintiff.   Of course, a very heavy burden lies on the 
     Defendant to rebut the strong presumption in favour of the Plaintiff 





     at the interlocutory stage.   The Civil Court obviously cannot give 
     any final finding on this question as the jurisdiction to give such 
     final   finding   is   conferred   on   Appellate   Board   in   the   rectification

     the application for interim injunction to restrain the defendant from
