<p id="p_2">      1.    The appellant is engaged in the manufacture of  pig  iron.   The
      appellant imported Low Ash Metallurgical (LAM) Coke under seven  Bills
      of Entry, against four  advance  licenses  without  payment  of  basic
      customs duty (BCD) levied under <a href="/doc/1510048/" id="a_1">Section 12</a> of the Customs  Act,  1962,
      special customs duty (SCD) levied under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2">Section 68</a> of the Finance Act,
      1996, special additional duty (SAD) levied under <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_3">Section 3A</a> of Customs
      Tariff Act, 1975 and Anti-dumping duty (ADD) levied under  <a href="/doc/946858/" id="a_4">Section  9A</a>
      of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 during the period June 1998 to  August
      1998, which were exempt from duty vide (i) Notifications No. 30/97 Cus
      dated 1.4.1997, (ii) Sr.  No.4  of  Notification  No.12/97  Cus  dated
      1.3.97,  (iii)  Sr.  No.3  of  the  Notification  No.34/98-Cus   dated
      13.6.1998,  and   (iv)   Notification   No.41/97-Cus   dated   30.4.97
      respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.    At the time of import, the appellant furnished a bond containing
      an  undertaking  to  pay  duty  on  imported   goods   cleared   under
      Notification No.30/97 and 41/97 in the event of failure to fulfill its
      export obligation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.    It is an admitted position that the appellant failed to  fulfill
      its export obligation in the terms of the exemption notifications. The
      entire LAM so imported has instead been used by the appellant  in  its
      factory for the manufacture of pig iron.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.    Demand of duty of Rs.7.21 crores was sought to be  raised.   The
      break up of demand of Rs.7.21 crores is as under:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">           1.    Basic Customs Duty                Rs.1.01 crores

           2.    Antidumping Duty            Rs.5.00 crores

           3.    Special Customs Duty              Rs.0.50 crore

           4.    Special Additional Duty                Rs.0.66 crore

           5.    Cess                              Rs.0.02 crore

                 Total                             Rs.7.21 crores.




</pre><p id="p_6">      5.    Pending final adjudication of  the  show  cause  notice  by  the
      Commissioner, the appellant duly paid the entire duty payable  towards
      BCD, SAD and SCD after considering partial exports already made.   The
      appellant did not make any payment towards ADD.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6.    The Commissioner of Customs vide Order dated 4.11.2004 confirmed
      the duty demand of Rs.3.37 crores and  imposed  a  penalty  of  Rupees
      Twenty  lakhs.  According  to  the  learned  Commissioner,  since  the
      appellant after issuance  of  the  show  cause  notice  paid  duty  of
      Rs.1,66,18,563/-,  the  differential  duty  to  be  paid  amounted  to
      Rs.1,70,98,510/-.  Further, interest on the said  amount  at  24%  was
      also held to be payable.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      7.    The appellant appealed to CESTAT.  Vide  the  impugned  judgment
      dated 18.8.2005, CESTAT partly allowed the  appeal  by  remanding  the
      matter to the original authority  to  calculate  duty,  interest,  and
      penalty in accordance with the findings  contained  in  its  judgment.
      The basic difference  between   CESTAT’s  judgment  and  that  of  the
      Commissioner is that interest was reduced from 24%  to  15%,  but  the
      Anti-dumping duty was increased by applying the higher rates specified
      by the final Notification No.69 of 2000.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      8.    Shri Lakshmikumaran, learned advocate for the appellant did  not
      dispute before us that the appellant failed in its export  obligations
      and was, therefore, not liable to be exempted so far as  customs  duty
      is concerned.  He, therefore, conceded that basic customs duty and the
      special customs duty as well as special additional duty was payable by
      the appellant.   However,  he  disputed  that  Anti-dumping  duty  was
      payable  at  all  stating  that  the  appellant   was   exempt   under
      Notification No.69 of 2000.  He further argued  that  no  interest  is
      chargeable on any of the four duties inasmuch as  the  bond  that  was
      furnished under Notification No.30 of 1997 did not stipulate  that  in
      the  event  of  default,  interest  would  become  payable.   Further,
      according to him, it is clear that the assessment in the present  case
      is only provisional and that being the case, even if the provisions of
      the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_5">Customs Act</a> are made applicable insofar as  Anti-dumping  duty  is
      concerned, under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_6">Customs Act</a> itself there  was  no  provision  for
      collection of interest for the period in dispute  as  <a href="/doc/1127169/" id="a_7">Section  18</a>  was
      amended to include such a provision  only  prospectively  with  effect
      from 2006.  He further argued, that  in  any  case  Anti-dumping  duty
      could not be added for purposes of  computing  customs  duty,  special
      customs  duty  and  special  additional  duty.   Also  no  penalty  is
      imposable inasmuch as nothing contumacious was done by  the  appellant
      and the export obligation could  not  be  fulfilled  only  because  of
      bonafide commercial impossibility.  It is contended that  nothing  has
      been diverted to the domestic tariff area and sold in that  area,  and
      the entire imports made have been used by the appellant  captively  in
      its factory for the manufacture of pig iron.  He further  argued  that
      he could not be worse off in an appeal filed  only  by  the  appellant
      herein to CESTAT and that on the assumption  that  the  appellant  was
      liable to pay Anti-dumping duty, they should only pay the said duty at
      the lower rate prescribed by  the  Commissioner  as  Revenue  had  not
      appealed to the Tribunal against the Commissioner’s order.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      9.    Shri Radhakrishnan, learned senior counsel appearing  on  behalf
      of the revenue countered the aforesaid submissions and submitted  that
      the exemption contained in the Anti-dumping duty  Notification  69  of
      2000 was only prospective and, hence Anti-dumping duty had to be  paid
      for the relevant period. He further submitted  that  interest  in  any
      case was payable as Notification No.30 of 1997 independently levied  a
      charge of interest.  Further, he  also  supported  the  Commissioner’s
      order and the Tribunal so far as the various  other  aspects  of  this
      appeal are concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      10.   We have heard learned counsel  for  the  parties.  In  order  to
      appreciate the first submission of Shri Lakshmikumaran,  namely,  that
      Anti-dumping duty in the present case ought to be nil, we set out  the
      relevant Notifications –

           Nothing contained in this notification shall apply to imports of

           Excisable Goods) Rules, 1996.”

</p><p id="p_17">      13.   The bone of  contention  in  the  present  appeal  is  the  last
      paragraph of this Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      14.   It is clear that under  Rule  20(2)(a)  of  the  Customs  Tariff
      (Identification, Assessment And  Collection  of  Antidumping  Duty  on
      Dumped Articles and For Determination of Injury) Rules, 1995, where  a
      provisional duty has been levied and where  the  designated  authority
      has recorded a final finding of injury or threat  of  injury  and  the
      further  finding  that  the  effect  of  imports  in  the  absence  of
      provisional duty would have led to injury, the Anti-dumping  duty  may
      be levied from the date of imposition of  provisional  duty.   In  the
      present  case,  therefore,  it  will  be  noticed   that   the   final
      Notification dated 27.10.1998 is said to come into force from the date
      of the first Notification dated 6.5.1998 imposing provisional duty  in
      the present case.  It is clear that as the  final  Notification  dated
      27.10.1998 has been superseded by the  Notification  dated  19.5.2000,
      the appellant would have had to pay Anti-dumping duty at the  rate  of
      US$ 24.95 per metric tonne as indisputably it falls within  Item  No.7
      of the said Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      15.   It will  be  noticed  that  the  exception  carved  out  in  the
      Notification dated 19.5.2000 was pursuant  to  a  minutes  of  meeting
      dated 25.11.1999 by the Secretary (Steel) and representatives of  Mini
      Blast Furnace producers  of  Metallurgical  Coke.   These  minutes  of
      meeting state as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           “The  Representatives  of  IMCOM  (Indian   Metallurgical   Coke
           Manufacturers Association) said that IMCOM represents  both  the
           petitioners i.e. M/s. BLA Industries and Industries and Commerce
           Association in the anti dumping duty petition against import  of
           metcoke of Chinese  origin.   They  explained  that  while  anti
           dumping duty was essential for the survival of the domestic coke
           producers, the blast furnaces have never  been  their  principal
           customers and it was not  their  intention  to  harm  the  blast
           furnaces industry.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           5.    After detailed deliberations it was agreed between  Indian
           Metallurgical  Coke  Manufacturers   Association   (IMCOM)   and
           Association of Indian Mini Blast Furnaces (AIM) that  the  blast
           furnace units were not the principal market  that  the  domestic
           coke producers cater to.  The market to which the domestic  coke
           producers cater to companies ferrous and non-ferrous  foundries,
           ferro alloys producers, soda ash producers, zinc usmelting units
           some other chemical units and various SSI units.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">           6.    Since the imposition of the anti dumping  duty  the  blast
           furnace units had to resort to  import  from  expensive  sources
           like Russia, Japan etc.  In view of this it was suggested by the
           AIM that the blast furnace units could be exempted  from  paying
           ADD on import of metallurgical coke of Chinese origin,  provided
           this import is for actual use by the blast furnace  units.   The
           list of blast furnace  units  which  will  be  covered  by  this
           exemption is also enclosed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           7.    Considering the financial difficulty  of  the  members  of
           AIM, IMCOM agreed that they have no objection if the  government
           exempts the blast furnace industry from the purview of the anti-
           dumping duty.  Metcoke will be imported under  OGL  with  Actual
           user Conditions for blast furnace industry without  ADD.   IMCOM
           reiterated that while the continuation of the ADD on metcoke  of
           Chinese origin is vital for the survival of the indigenous  coke
           manufacturers they also agreed that the exemption of  the  blast
           furnace units from ADD was vital for their survival.”




</blockquote><p id="p_20">      16.   On reading these minutes  it  becomes  clear  that  Anti-dumping
      duties that had been imposed upon the Blast Furnace  Industry  had  an
      adverse impact upon the industry and that the intention of levying  an
      Anti-dumping duty was not to harm their interests.  Paragraphs 6 and 7
      of the said minutes in particular seem to suggest that  the  exemption
      that was contemplated by the minutes of such Blast Furnace  units  was
      something that could take place only in the future.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      17.   Quite apart from this, it is clear that no exception was  carved
      out before 19.5.2000 in favour of Blast Furnace  Manufacturers  either
      when the provisional Anti-dumping duty was first imposed or  when  the
      final Notification dated 27.10.1998 was issued.  It is clear that  the
      last part of the Notification dated 19.5.2000 creating an exception in
      favour of persons like the appellant has no reference to  the  earlier
      proceedings in the case  and  is  obviously  intended  to  apply  only
      prospectively.  This is also clear from the language used in the  said
      clause – ‘nothing  contained  in  the  Notification  “shall  apply  to
      imports” …. Using a Blast Furnace “if he follows”  the  procedure  set
      out in the Customs “import of goods at concessional rate of  duty  for
      manufacture of excisable goods” Rules, 1996’.   The  language  of  the
      aforesaid clause applies only in futuro and we are  afraid  that  Shri
      Lakshmikumaran’s first argument must, therefore, fail.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      18.   However,  Shri  Lakshmikumaran  is  on  firmer  ground  when  he
      submitted before us that the Commissioner has held that the  appellant
      is liable to pay Anti-dumping duty only under the  Notification  dated
      27.10.1998. The rate prescribed in the  said  Notification  is  lesser
      than the rate that would apply under the Notification dated 19.5.2000.
       As there was no appeal by the revenue against  this  finding  of  the
      Commissioner, the Tribunal could not have enhanced the rate  at  which
      the appellant would have to pay Anti-dumping duty in  the  appellant’s
      own appeal.  The appellant cannot be worse off by reason of filing  an
      appeal. To  this  limited  extent,  the  appellant  succeeds  and  the
      Tribunal’s order is set aside.  The appellant will have to  pay  Anti-
      dumping duty calculated at the rates specified  only  in  Notification
      No. 81/98 dated 27.10.1998.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      19.   It was argued by Shri Lakshmikumaran that the appellant was  not
      liable to pay interest on any of the customs duties for which  it  was
      held  liable  by  the  Commissioner’s  order.   He  referred   us   to
      Notification No.30 of 1997,  the  relevant  part  of  which  reads  as
      follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           “In exercise of the  powers  conferred  by  sub-section  (1)  of
           <a href="/doc/412480/" id="a_21">section 25</a> of the Customs Act, 1962 (52  of  1962)  the  Central
           Government, being satisfied that it is necessary in  the  public
           interest so to do, hereby exempts materials imported into India,
           against an Advance Licence with Actual User Condition  in  terms
           of para 7.4 of the Export &amp; Import Policy 1997-2002 notified  by

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">              i) xxx xxx

                 in such form and for such sum as may be  specified  by  the
                 Assistant Commissioner of Customs binding himself to pay on

                 four percent per annum from the date of  clearance  of  the
                 said materials.”



</blockquote><p id="p_24">      20.   A reading of this Notification makes it clear that  interest  at
      the rate of 24% per annum is only liable to be paid if at the time  of
      clearance of the imported materials the importer executes  a  bond  in
      which such interest is stated to be payable.  We have been  shown  the
      bond executed in the present case.  It says nothing about any interest
      that is payable in case the conditions of the  Notification  No.30  of
      1997 are not met.  On this short ground alone, it  is  clear  that  no
      interest is payable on any of the customs duties that are due from the
      appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      21.   It was also argued by Shri Lakshmikumaran that  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_25">Section  101</a>  of
      the Finance Act, 2009 has been given a retrospective application  with
      effect from 1.1.1995.  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_26">Section 9A</a> sub-section (8) as substituted  with
      effect from 1.1.1995 reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">           “(8)  The provisions of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_27">Customs Act</a>, 1962 (52 of  1962)  and

           relating to date of determination of rate of  duty,  assessment,
           non-levy, short levy, refunds, interest, appeals,  offences  and
           penalties shall, as far as maybe, apply to the  duty  chargeable
           under this section as they apply in relation to duties  leviable
           under that Act.”




</blockquote><p id="p_26">      22.   Even though the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_28">Customs Act</a> would necessarily  become  attracted
      to <a href="/doc/946858/" id="a_29">Section 9A</a> of the Customs Tariff Act insofar as  Anti-dumping  duty
      is concerned, learned counsel further submitted that the  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_30">Customs  Act</a>
      itself contained no provision for levy of  interest  until  13.7.2006.
      <a href="/doc/1127169/" id="a_31">Section 18(3)</a> was added only with effect from 13.7.2006 and  reads  as
      follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">           “(3)  The importer or exporter shall be liable to pay  interest,
           on any amount payable to the Central Government,  consequent  to
           the final assessment order under sub-section (2),  at  the  rate
           fixed by the Central Government  under  <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_32">Section  28AB</a>  from  the
           first day of the  month  in  which  the  duty  is  provisionally
           assessed till the date of payment thereof.”

</blockquote><p id="p_27">      23.   It  is  clear  that  on  the  facts  of  the  present  case  the
      provisional assessment had been made in 1998 and the final  assessment
      only on 4.11.2004 by the Commissioner.  Both these dates  being  prior
      to  13.7.2006,  Shri  Lakshmikumaran  is  right  and  no  interest  is
      chargeable under <a href="/doc/1127169/" id="a_33">Section 18</a> of the Customs  Act,  for  the  period  in
      question.

           there was no liability to pay  interest  on  difference  between
           finally assessed  duty  and  provisionally  assessed  duty  upon
           payment of which the assessee may have cleared  the  goods.   It
           was only with effect from 13.7.2006 that such charging provision
           was introduced in the statute.  Upon introduction therefor  such
           provision created interest liability for the first  time  w.e.f.
           13.7.2006.  In absence of any indication in the  statute  itself
           either  specifically  or   by   necessary   implication   giving
           retrospective effect to such a statutory provision,  we  are  of

           We respectfully agree with the aforesaid view.  In addition,  it
      is clear that this Court has held that the  levying  of  interest  can
      only be by a substantive  provision  (See:  <a href="/doc/1917195/" id="a_36">J.K.  Synthetics  Ltd.  v.
      Commercial Taxes Officer</a>, (1994) 4 SCC 276 at paragraph  16),  thereby

      provision which levies an independent duty, as the relevant words  are
      “an addition” and not “in addition”.  This argument  has  considerable
      force.  For example, the  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_82">Finance  Act</a>  of  1963  made  a  distinction

      when what was sought to be levied was only a  surcharge.   By  way  of
      contrast, <a href="/doc/1209720/" id="a_101">Section 24(3)</a> when it levies a different duty – a regulatory
      duty of customs – uses the  expression “in  addition”.  It  is  clear,
      therefore, that what is referred to in <a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_102">Section 3(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_103">3A(2)</a> is  only
      a surcharge or an additional duty of customs.  The words “in the  same
      manner” also point to the same conclusion.  It is clear on  a  reading
      of the Customs Tariff (Identification, Assessment  And  Collection  of
      Antidumping Duty on Dumped Articles and For Determination  of  Injury)
      Rules, 1995, that Anti-dumping duty apart from being a  separate  levy
      from a levy of customs duty is also levied in a  completely  different
      manner from that of customs duty.

                 being in force in respect of the basic customs duty)  needs
                 to be taken into account. Other duties such as anti-dumping
                 duty,  safeguard  duty,  etc.  should  not  be  taken  into
                 account.”

                 “In the explanatory notes for the last year’s budget it was
                 clarified that for computing the CVD,  only  the  value  of
                 imported article as determined  under  <a href="/doc/368047/" id="a_128">section  14</a>  of  the
                 Customs Act, 1962, including the landing  charges,  if  any
                 and  the  basic  customs  duty  chargeable  at  the   rates
                 specified in the First Schedule to the <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_129">Customs  Tariff  Act</a>
                 (read with any notification for the time being in force  in
                 respect of the basic customs duty) needs to be  taken  into
                 account. Other duties such as anti-dumping duty,  safeguard
                 duty, etc. should not be taken into  account.  A  view  has
                 been expressed that <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_130">section 3A</a> of the  Customs  Tariff  Act
                 does not permit such interpretation. To  place  the  matter
                 beyond doubt, it is proposed to amend <a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_131">section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_132">section
                 3A</a> of the Customs Tariff Act so as to make  it  very  clear
                 that for computation of additional duty  of  customs,  only
                 the c.i.f. price, landing charges and  basic  customs  duty
                 will  be  included.  Similarly  for   determining   special
                 additional duty of customs (SAD), only  the  c.i.f.  price,
                 landing charges, basic customs duty and the additional duty
                 of customs will be included. Other  duties  such  as  anti-
                 dumping duty safeguard duty, etc. shall not be  taken  into
                 account.  This amendment will have effect from 1.3.2002.”

      clarify and set at rest doubts, it is not necessary to decide  whether
      this amendment is clarificatory and, therefore, retrospective in  view
      of what has already been held by us above.

<p id="p_49">      37.   As far as penalty is  concerned,  we  feel  that  the  appellant
      before us has not diverted goods meant  for  export  to  the  domestic
      tariff area.  We are satisfied  that  market  considerations  made  it
      difficult, if not impossible, for the appellant to fulfill its  export
      obligations and are, therefore, of the view that the  penalty  imposed
      in the present case ought to be set aside.

      the judgment of CESTAT is set aside.
