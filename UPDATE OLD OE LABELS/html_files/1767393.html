              judgments of Punjab and Haryana High Court,

              Calcutta High Court and Kerala High Court and

              relate to different banks but since the common

              issues are involved, it is appropriate that these

              appeals are dealt with and disposed of by the

              common judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.            In the month of    May, 2000, Government of

India, Ministry of Finance (Banking Division), advised the

nationalized banks to carry out detailed            manpower

planning as these banks were found to have 25% of its

manpower as surplus.       A Human Resource Management

Committee was constituted to examine the said issue and

to suggest suitable remedial measures. The committee so

constituted observed that high established cost and low

productivity in public sector banks affect their profitability

and it was necessary for these banks to convert their

human resources into assets compatible with business

strategies.      Inter alia, the committee placed the draft

Voluntary     Retirement    Scheme        with   the   Central

Government that would assist the banks in their efforts to

optimize their human resources and achieve a balanced

age and skills profile in keeping with their business

strategies.    With the approval of the central government,

Indian Bank Association (IBA) circulated      salient features

of the draft scheme to the nationalized banks for

consideration and adoption by their respective boards vide

its letter dated August 31, 2000. The Board of Directors of

each    of the nationalized banks, keeping in view the

objectives, considered the draft scheme and adopted it

separately.

<p id="p_6">4.            In the present batch of appeals, the Voluntary

Retirement Scheme brought out by the Punjab National

Bank, Punjab &amp; Sind Bank, Bank of India, Union Bank of

India and United Bank of India is in issue.

</p><p id="p_7">5.            The scheme adopted by these banks, although

separately, is identical and bears similar salient features

with some variation in certain      respects.       It is not

necessary to consider them individually. For the sake of

brevity, we shall    refer the scheme as VRS 2000.

<p id="p_14">     (i)   All permanent employees of the bank who have
     put in minimum 15 years of service or completed 40

     available to an employee , according to the terms

     equivalent to 60 days salary for each completed
     year of service.

     the application of an employee for voluntary
     retirement and the decision    of the competent
     authority shall be final.

            unless competent authority has passed orders
            accepting the applications of the employees to
            retire voluntarily under the scheme.

            discretion of the bank at any time without
            assigning any reason.

            conditions of the scheme. (In the scheme

have also been filed by the parties which we considered

thoughtfully.
</p>
<p id="p_56">21.         The submissions on behalf of the banks may

be summarised thus : (i) that Pension Regulations, 1995,

as were existing during the operation of VRS 2000, did

not cover the class of employees         retiring under the

Scheme which is contractual in nature.        Regulation 28

came to be amended by insertion of proviso thereto to

cover the employees retiring under the Scheme inasmuch

as by the said amendment, the employees having

completed 15 years of service or more became entitled to

pension   on pro-rata basis; (ii) that voluntary retirement

under VRS 2000 cannot be compared or equated with

voluntary retirement under Pension Regulations, 1995.

VRS 2000 is completely different and distinct scheme

from voluntary retirement contemplated under Regulation

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                17</span>
29 of the Pension Regulations, 1995; (iii) that Regulation

29(5) of Pension Regulations, 1995, read: "the qualifying

service of an employee      retiring voluntarily under this

regulation shall be increased by a person not exceeding ...

......" The words "under this regulation" would mean

`under Regulation 29' and no other interpretation to the

meaning could be attributed to these words; (iv) that during

operation of VRS 2000, the concerned banks had brought

out circulars to   bring to the notice of the concerned

employees the proposed amendment and, thus, the

employees were aware of the proposed amendment of

Pension Regulations and could have withdrawn their offer

but in the absence of such withdrawal and after having

accepted the benefits under VRS 2000, they are estopped

under law     from challenging the Scheme or claiming

benefit of addition of five years of notional service in

calculating the length of service for the purposes of

pension and (v)     that Regulation 29 does not cover

persons retiring under VRS 2000 which is de hors        the

statutory scheme for voluntary retirement.

</p><pre id="pre_2">22.          On the other hand, on behalf               of the

employees,     it   was   contended:    (i)     that   Pension

</pre><p id="p_57">Regulations, 1995, were framed and notified in the year

1995 that provides for different classes of pension which

might be available to a      pension optee,     inter alia, two

classes of these     pension are;    superannuation pension

(Regulation 28) and pension         on Voluntary Retirement

(Regulation 29); that     VRS 2000 was brought out with the

object of optimizing human resources at various levels for

achieving the balanced age and skills profile in keeping

with business strategies and         the banks allowed its

employees to retire voluntarily under the Scheme with an

intention to confer attractive benefits in addition to ex-

gratia and   such additional benefits also included pension

as per Pension Regulations, 1995; (ii) that VRS 2000 is

not statutory in nature; rather, it is an invitation to treat by

the bank to its employees to offer for voluntary retirement.

The offer for voluntary retirement was founded on the

terms of scheme. By acceptance of the said offer made

by the employees, the        concluded contract came into

existence    between the bank       and the employee which

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                   19</span>
could not have been altered; (iii) that on the date of the

relieving the concerned employees, Regulation 28 had not

been amended and, therefore, the entitlement to the

pension could not have      been decided in terms of that

Regulation and the pension benefits to the optees could

only be given under Regulation 29; (iv) that by making

provision in the Scheme that optees would be eligible for

the benefits in addition to the ex-gratia amount, inter alia,

pension as per Pension Regulations, 1995,                the

employees understood that what was contemplated was

pension under Regulation 29.      Any ambiguity     in   VRS

2000 ought to be construed that harmonized          with the

intention of the parties; (v) that the amendment in

Regulation 28 was introduced for a class of employees

who had put in more than 15 years but less than 20 years

of service. In terms of Pension Regulations, 1995, as it

stood before amendment to Regulation 28, an employee

although a pension optee under VRS having not completed

20 years service was not entitled to any pension. In order

to take care of this anomalous position and to confer

pensionary benefits on such employees, the amendment

was brought into effect in Regulation 28 which cannot

affect the subject employees who undisputedly           have put

in more than 20 years of service; (vi) that the employees

made the offer to retire from service in terms of             the

Scheme which was accepted by the banks without any

reservation. In terms of the Scheme under the head `other

benefits', the optees are eligible for benefit of pension as

per Pension Regulations, 1995.         Regulation 29 was the

only regulation under the Pension Regulations,1995,

applicable    to    voluntary    retirement    and,     therefore,

Regulation 29, ipso facto, became the term of the contract

and (vii) that each and every paragraph of Regulation 29

can be made applicable to an optee of more than 20 years

of service   without coming into conflict with any provision

of the Scheme; the notice period of three months in

Regulation 29(3) can be waived at the discretion of the

banks.

seeking voluntary retirement will be eligible for pension as

per Pension Regulations? If the intention was not to give

pension as provided in Regulation 29 and particularly sub-

regulation (5) thereof, they    could have said so in the

scheme itself. After all much thought had gone into the

formulation of the VRS 2000 and it came to be framed

after great deliberations.   The only provision that could

have been in mind while providing for pension as per

Pension Regulations was      Regulation 29.   Obviously, the

employees, too, had benefit of Regulation 29(5) in mind

when they offered for voluntary retirement as admittedly

attracted.   It appears    that VRS 2000 evoked       huge

response, much more than expected and then began the

second thought. At the fag end of operation of VRS

2000, at the instance of NBA, the banks            proposed

amendment in the Pension Regulations and a circular

came to be issued. But, by that time, ball had gone out of

the hands of the employees; they had already made their

offers which were irrevocable; it was not open to them to

withdraw the offers as per specific condition incorporated

in the scheme (albeit this court in O.P. Swarnakar held

that offer could be withdrawn before acceptance)        and

their offers were accepted and they were relieved. We

are afraid, it would      be   unreasonable   if   amended

Regulation 28 is made applicable, which had not seen the

light of the day and which     was not the intention of the

although contractual in nature, must meet the test of

fairness. It has to be construed in a manner that avoids

arbitrariness and unreasonableness on the part of the

public sector banks who brought out VRS 2000 with an

objective of rightsizing its manpower. The banks decided

to    shed   surplus manpower.       By formulation     of    the

Special Scheme (VRS 2000), the banks intended                  to

achieve its objective of rationalizing its force as they were

overstaffed. The Special Scheme was, thus, oriented to

lure the employees to go in for voluntary retirement.          In

this background,     the consideration that was to           pass

between the parties          assumes significance and a

harmonious construction to the Scheme           and     Pension

</p><p id="p_79">36.          Two things      immediately become noticeable

from     the said communication. One is              that as per

Regulation 29 of Pension Regulations, 1995, an employee

can take voluntary retirement after 20 years of qualifying

service and become eligible for pension. The other thing is

that the Scheme provides that the employees with 15 years

of service or 40 years       of age shall be eligible to take

voluntary retirement       under the Scheme and under

Regulation 29, the employees having rendered 15 years of

service or completed 40 years of age but not completed

20 years of service shall not be eligible for           pensionary

benefits on taking voluntary retirement under the Scheme.

The    use    of   the   words    `such    employees'       in   the

communication is referable to employees having rendered

15 years of service but not completed 20 years of service

and, therefore, it was decided to bring in         amendment in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                       30</span>
the Regulations so that employees having not completed

20 years service do not loose the benefit of pension. The

amendment in Regulation 28, as is reflected from the

afore-referred communication, was intended to cover the

employees who had rendered 15 years service        but not

completed 20 years service. It was not intended to cover

the optees who had already completed 20 years service

as the provisions contained in Regulation 29 met that

contingency.
</p>
<p id="p_80">37.        Even if it be   assumed that by insertion of the

proviso in Regulation 28 (in the year 2002 with effect from

September 1, 2000), all class of employees under VRS

2000 were intended to be covered, such amendment in

Regulation 28, needs to be harmonized with Regulation 29,

particularly Regulation 29(5) which provides for addition of

qualifying service by five years for the optees who had put

in 20 years service or more subject to the condition that

total qualifying service rendered by such employee shall

not in any case exceed 33 years. This would be in tune

and consonance with the explanatory note appended to

the amendment     in Regulation 28 wherein it is stated that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                               31</span>
the amendment with retrospective effect would not

adversely affect any employee or officer of the respondent-

bank. That would also meet the test of fairness.

</p><p id="p_81">38.         The contention was raised on behalf of the

banks that if Regulation 29(5) of the Pension Regulations,

1995, is applied for the purposes of VRS 2000, the same

would create an anomalous situation inasmuch as           two

different classes of employees for the purpose of granting

pension would be created, namely, a class of employees

who had completed 15 years of service but less than 20

years of service and this class would not be entitled to

receive   benefits   under   Regulation   29(5)   while   the

employees who had completed 20 years service or more

would be entitled to receive the benefit under Regulation

29(5). It was submitted that by such construction a class

within the class would be created which is impermissible.

We do not agree.      If a special benefit under Regulation

29(5) is available to the employees who had completed 20

years of service or more, by no stretch of imagination, can

it be said that it is discriminatory to those employees who

had completed 15 years of service but not completed 20

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                32</span>
years. In view of the provision contained in Regulation 29

(5), if the optees who have not completed 20 years get

excluded from the weightage of five years which has been

given to optees who have completed 20 years of service

or more, it is no       discrimination.     Such provision can

neither be said to be arbitrary nor can         be held to be

violative of any constitutional or statutory provisions. The

weightage of          five years under Regulation 29(5) is

applicable to the optees having service of 20 years or

more.      There is, thus,      basis for    additional benefit.

Merely because the employees who have completed 15

years of service but not completed 20 years of service are

not     entitled to    weightage of five years for qualifying

service under Regulation 29(5), the employees who have

completed 20 years of service or more cannot be denied

such benefit.
</p>
<p id="p_82">39.          On behalf of the banks, it was contended that

Pension Regulations, 1995, are statutory         in nature and

these Regulations cannot be altered, amended or read

down in view of any contract or a contractual scheme. It

was submitted that any contract (or contractual scheme),

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                   33</span>
contrary to a statutory law would be hit by <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_10">Section 23</a> of

the Contract Act and, therefore, it is the contract or the

scheme which has to be modified, altered or read down to

bring it in tune with the provisions of statutory Regulations

and not the other way round.         The contention does not

impress us. It is misplaced assumption that by reading

Regulation 29(5) in the Scheme, the Pension Regulations

would get      altered or amended.       Can it be said     that

statutory relationship of employee and employer brought

to an end         prematurely by     contractual VRS 2000

amounted to alteration       or amendment       in the statutory

Regulations.     Surely, answer has to be in negative and

that must answer this contention. The precise effect          of

Pension Regulations, for the purposes of pension, having

been made part of scheme, is that Pension Regulations,

to the extent, these are applicable, must be       read into the

Scheme. It is pertinent to bear in mind that interpretation

clause    of VRS-2000 states          that the words and

expressions     used in the scheme but not defined and

defined in the     Rules/Regulations shall have the same

meaning       respectively    assigned     to    them     under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                                   34</span>
Rules/Regulations.    The Scheme does not define the

expression `retirement' or `voluntary retirement'. We have,

therefore,   to fall back on the definition   of `retirement'

given in Regulation 2(y) whereunder voluntary retirement

under Regulation 29      is considered to be retirement.

Regulation 29 uses the expression, `voluntary retirement

under these Regulations'.    Obviously, for the purposes of

the Scheme, it has to be understood to mean with

necessary changes in points of details. <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_11">Section 23</a> of the

Contract Act has no application to the present           fact

situation.
</p>
<p id="p_83">40.          It was submitted on behalf of the banks that

amendment to Regulation 28 has neither been challenged

nor the said Regulation has been declared ultra vires and,

therefore, that provision cannot be rendered otiose by

taking recourse to Regulations 29. It is true that   validity

and legality of Regulation 28 has not been put in issue. It

was apparently not done because, according to the

employees, amended Regulation 28 although made

retrospective   could not have     affected the concluded

contract. We have already indicated above as to how the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                35</span>
amendment in Regulation 28 in the year 2002 with effect

from September 1, 2000 could not have applied to the

optees under the Scheme who had completed service of

20 years. Lack of challenge to the Regulation 28 by the

employees is, therefore, not very material. It is not correct

to say that    by taking recourse to Regulation 29, the

amendment to Regulation 28 is rendered otiose.

</p><p id="p_84">41.        It was vehemently contended on behalf of the

banks that VRS 2000 was a self-contained Scheme and it

provided for special benefits in the form of ex-gratia. It

was submitted that    ex-gratia   was not available to the

employees claiming voluntary retirement under Pension

Regulations and it was because of that, that Scheme did

not envisage granting of pension benefits under Regulation

29(5) of the Pension Regulations, 1995, along with the

payment of ex-gratia which was a substantial amount. It is

true that VRS 2000 is a complete      package in itself and

contractual in nature. However, in that package, it has

been provided that the optees, in addition to ex-gratia

payment, will also be eligible to other benefits inter alia

pension under the       Pension Regulations.       The only


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                36</span>
provision in the Pension Regulations at the relevant time

during the operation of VRS 2000 concerning voluntary

retirement     was Regulation 29 and       clause(5) thereof

provides     for weightage     of addition of five years to

qualifying service for pension to those optees who had

completed 20 years service.         It, therefore, cannot be

accepted that VRS 2000 did not envisage grant of pension

benefits     under    Regulation   29(5)   of   the   Pension

Regulations, 1995, to the optees of 20 years service along

with payment of ex-gratia. The whole idea in bringing out

VRS    2000 was to rightsize workforce which the banks

had not been able to achieve despite        the fact that the

statutory Regulations provided for voluntary retirement to

the employees having completed 20 years service. It was

for this reason that VRS 2000 was made more attractive.

VRS 2000, accordingly, was an attractive package for the

employees      to    go in for as they were getting   special

benefits in the form of ex-gratia and in addition thereto,

inter alia pension under the Pension Regulations which

also provided for weightage of five years        of qualifying

service for the purposes of pension to the employees who

had completed 20 years service.

<p id="p_85">42.         In   support     of    their   contention   that    the

employees, who have sought voluntary retirement             under

VRS 2000, are not entitled to benefit of Regulation 29(5)

of Pension Regulations, 1995, on behalf of banks,           heavy

reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in the

case of Bank of Baroda            and Ors. Vs. Ganpat       Singh

Deora, 2009 (1) Scale 168.           As a matter of fact, it was

submitted that the decision of this Court in the case of

Bank of Baroda concludes the controversy and the legal

position is no more res integra.               Reliance in this

connection was placed on the following observations:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">      "15. The only question which is required to be
      determined in the instant case is whether Regulation 29
      of the Pension Regulations, 1995, could have been
      applied in the case of the respondent or whether
      Regulation 14 has been rightly applied both by the

      Bhati that Regulation 29 does not contemplate
      voluntary retirement under the Voluntary Retirement
      Scheme and applies only to such employees who
      themselves wish to retire de hors any Scheme of
      Voluntary Retirement, after having completed 15 years
      of qualifying service for the said purpose. There is a
      distinct difference between the two situations and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                      38</span>
Regulation 29 would not cover the case of an employee
opting to retire on the basis of a Voluntary Retirement
Scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_88">19.      Furthermore, Regulations 2 of the Voluntary
Retirement Scheme, 2001, of the appellant-Bank
merely prescribes a period of qualifying service for an
employee to be eligible to apply for voluntary
retirement. On the other hand, Regulations 14 and 29
of the Pension Regulations, 1995, relate to the period
of qualifying service for pension under the said
Regulations, in two different situations.          While
Regulations 14 provides that in order to be eligible for
pension an employee would have to render a minimum
of 10 years service, Regulation 29 is applicable to the
employees choosing to retire from service pre-maturely,
and in their case the period of qualifying service would
be 15 years. The facts of this case, however, do not
attract the provisions of Regulation 29 since the
respondent accepted the offer of voluntary retirement
under the Scheme framed by the Bank and not on his
own volition de hors any Scheme of              Voluntary
Retirement. In such a case, Regulaion14 read with
Regulation 32 providing for premature retirement would
not also apply to the case of the respondent. While
Regulation 2 of         the BOBEVRS -2001 speaks of
eligibility for applying under the Scheme, Regulation 14
of the Pension Regulations, 1995, contemplates a
situation whereunder an employee would be eligible for
premature pension. The two provisions are for two
different purposes and for two different situations.
However, Regulations 28 of the Pension Regulations,
1995, after amendment made provision for situations
similar to the one in the instant case. In the absence of
any particular provision for payment of pension to those
who opted for BOBEVRS-2001 other than Regulation
11(ii) of the Scheme, we are once again left to fall back
on the Pension Regulations, 1995, and the amended
provisions of Regulation 28 which brings within the
scope of Superannuation Pension employees who
opted for the Voluntary Retirement Scheme, which will
be clear from the Explanatory Memorandum. However,
the period of qualifying service has been retained as 15
years for those opting for BOBEVRS-2001 and is
treated differently from premature retirement where the
minimum period of qualifying service has been fixed at
10 years in keeping with Regulation 14 of the Pension
Regulations, 1995."

      every judgment must be read as applicable to the
      particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since
      the generality of the expressions which may be found
      there are not intended to be expositions of the whole

      what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be
      quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow

is placed. It was further observed that the judgments of

courts are not to be construed as           statutes and the

observations must be read in the context in which they

appear to have been stated. The Court went on to say

that circumstantial applicability, one additional or different

fact may make a word of difference between conclusions

in two cases.

<p id="p_101">49.          It is true that the controversy in the case of

Bank of Baroda arose out of the same voluntary retirement

scheme with which we are concerned in this group of

appeals. However, there is vital factual difference in that

case and this group of appeals. Pertinently that was a

case where the employee had completed only 13 years of

service( not even 15 years of service much less 20 years'

service) although he completed 40 years of age at the time

he offered      for voluntary retirement.    The employee's


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                 42</span>
application therein for voluntary retirement    was accepted

by the Bank of Baroda and he was paid all retiral benefits.

However, his request for grant of pension in addition to

the other retiral benefits was not acceded to by the bank.

It was so because he had not completed even 15 years of

service. The employee       pursued industrial adjudicatory

process for redressal      of his grievance in respect of

non-grant of pension by the bank. The employee's claim

was opposed     by the Bank of Baroda contending that in

terms of Regulations 14, 28 and 29 of the Pension

Regulations, 1995, the employee was not entitled to

pension. The observations made by this Court in Bank of

Baroda which have been quoted above and relied upon by

the banks in support of their contention have to be

understood in the factual backdrop          namely,   that the

employee had completed only 13 years of service and,

was not eligible for the pension under           the Pension

Regulations,1995 and for the benefit of addition of five

years to qualifying service under Regulation 29(5), an

employee must have completed 20 years of service. The

question therein was not        identical    in form with the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                 43</span>
question here to be decided.         The following observations

in paragraph 11 of the report in Bank of Baroda are

significant:
</p>
<p id="p_102">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">      "......since both the Tribunal as well as the High Court
      appear not to have considered or taken note of the fact
      that the respondent was not eligible for pension as he
      had not completed 15 years of qualifying service......
      ......."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_103">50.            The decision of this Court in Bank of Baroda

is, thus, clearly distinguishable as the employee therein

had not completed qualifying service much less 20 years of

service for       being eligible to the weightage under

Regulation 29(5) and cannot be applied to the present

controversy nor does that matter decide the question here

to be decided in the present group of matters.

</p><p id="p_104">51.            On behalf of banks it was submitted that the

employees, having taken benefits under the scheme (VRS

2000),    are estopped from raising any issue that their

entitlement to pension would not be covered by amended

Regulation 28. It was suggested that               the employees

having taken       benefit of the scheme cannot insist           for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                       44</span>
pension under Regulation 29(5).     O.P. Swarnakar     was

relied upon in this regard wherein it has been held that an

employee, having taken the ex-gratia payment, or any

other benefit under the scheme cannot be allowed to resile

from the scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_105">52.        Insofaras the present group of appeals is

concerned, the employees are not seeking to resile from

the Scheme. They are actually seeking enforcement of the

clause in the Scheme that provides that the optees will be

eligible for pension under the Pension Regulations, 1995.

According to them, they are entitled to the     benefits of

Regulation 29(5).   In our considered      view,   plea of

estoppel is devoid of any substance; as a matter of fact it

does not arise at all in the facts and circumstances of the

case.
</p>
<p id="p_106">53.        We hold, as it must be, that the employees who

had completed 20 years of service and were pension

optees and offered voluntary retirement under VRS 2000

and whose offers were      accepted    by the banks    are

entitled to addition of five years of notional service in

calculating the length of service for the purposes of that

Scheme as per Regulation 29(5)               of the Pension

Regulations, 1995. The contrary view expressed by some

of the High Courts do not lay down the correct legal

position.
</p>
<p id="p_107">54.         The only question now remains to be seen is

whether the concerned employees are entitled to interest

on unpaid pension.
</p>
<p id="p_108">

</p><p id="p_109">55.         Although it has been held by us that the subject

employees are entitled to the weightage in terms of

Regulation 29(5) of Pension Regulations, 1995, but we are

satisfied that any award of interest       on unpaid pension

would not be in the interest of justice.     It is so because

different High Courts did not have unanimous judicial

opinion on the issue. Punjab and Haryana High Court

and the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court upheld the

contention of the employees with regard to applicability of

Regulation 29(5) to the optees who had completed 20

years of service while the Division Bench of the Calcutta

High Court and a single Judge of the        Kerala High Court

took exactly an opposite view. The stance of the banks,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                46</span>
although found not meritorious,       cannot be said to be

totally frivolous.   We, accordingly, hold that the subject

employees are not entitled to interest on unpaid pension.

</p><p id="p_110">56.         The result of the foregoing discussion is that

the   appeals preferred by the banks must fail and are

dismissed while the appeals of the employees deserve to

be allowed and are allowed accordingly. The respective

banks shall now recalculate, within one month from today,

the pension payable       to the concerned       employees by

giving them the benefit of Regulation 29(5). However, the

employees shall not be entitled to interest on unpaid

pension. The pending        applications     in these appeals

stand disposed of. The parties shall bear their own costs.
