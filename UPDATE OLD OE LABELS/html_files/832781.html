HEADNOTE:
     On the  allegations that  the appellant in the Criminal
Appeal along  with two	other accused  were in possession of
railway	 property  which  they	had  obtained  under  forged
railway receipts,  the Inspector  of the  Railway Protection
Force lodged a complaint against the three accused that they
were guilty  of offences  under <a href="/doc/136652272/" id="a_10">section	 3(a)</a> of the Railway
Property (Unlawful  15	<a href="/doc/38107498/" id="a_11">Possession)  Act</a>,  1966	 and  action
should be  taken against  them.	 In  the  Complaint  it	 was
mentioned that	accused 2  and 3 were absconding and annexed
to the complaint was (I) a list of prosecution witnesses and
(2) a list of documents.
     The appellant,  who was  accused I	 appeared before the
Presidency Magistrate  who commenced an enquiry and recorded
the statements of four witnesses one on March 2, 1973 and of
the other  three on  June 12,  1973. On	 June 11,  1973	 the
appellant moved	 an application before the Magistrate making
a grievance that although three witnesses had been examined,
no copies of the document were furnished to him. On June 25,
1973 he	 made a further application requesting for supply of
true copies  of all  the documents in the case to enable him
to prepare  the defence	 and that  he should be permitted to
take photostat	copies of  the documents.  The Magistrate on
August 9,  1973 rejected  the appellants' application on the
ground that  the offence  complained of	 against him was not
cognizable and that the provisions of <a href="/doc/38107498/" id="a_12">section 251</a> (a)<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_13"> of the
Code</a>  of   Criminal  Procedure	 were  not   applicable	 and
consequently, he  had no  right	 to  obtain  copies  of	 the
documents concerned.  On  August  24,  1973  the  Magistrate
framed a  charge under	<a href="/doc/136652272/" id="a_14">section 3(a)</a> of the Act. The accused
pleaded not  guilty and	 again made an application repeating
his request  for  copies  of  the  statements  of  witnesses
recorded by  the Inspector  R.P.F. This application was also
rejected by the Magistrate on September 7, 1973.
176
     Feeling  aggrieved	  by  the   orders  passed   by	 the
Magistrate on  August 9,  1973 and  September  7,  1973	 the
appellant invoked  the inherent	 jurisdiction  of  the	High
Court by  a petition  under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">section  561A</a>  of  the  Code  of
Criminal Procedure,  1898 and  prayed  that  the  orders  be
quashed.  He   challenged  the	constitutional	validity  of
<a href="/doc/55217626/" id="a_16">section 9</a>  of the  Act	in  the	 petition.  The	 High  Court
rejected the petition.
     In the  appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf
of the	appellant (a)  relying on <a href="/doc/1409644/" id="a_17">Raja Ram Jaiswal vs. State
of Bihar</a>,  [1964] 2  S.C.R. 752	 that the expression "Police
officer"  in   <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_18">section	25</a>  of	the  Evidence  Act  must  be
considered in  a wide popular sense, so as to include within
its ambit  all officers	 of Government	who are in substance
invested with  the power  to investigate certain offences in
accordance with	 the provisions<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_19">	 of  the  Code</a>	of  Criminal
Procedure 1898	irrespective  of  the  fact  that  they	 are
differently labelled  such as  Excise  officers	 or  Customs
officers or  members of R.P.F., otherwise the very object of
s. 25 will be defeated. An Inspector of the R.P.F. making an
inquiry under the <a href="/doc/38107498/" id="a_20">Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act</a>
1966 into  an offence  under  <a href="/doc/197281033/" id="a_21">section  3</a>  of  that  Act,  in
substance, acts	 and exercises	almost all  the powers	of a
'Police officer'  making an  investigation under<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_22"> the Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure  and any  confessional statement recorded
by such	 Inspector will	 be hit	 by<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_23"> s.	25</a> Evidence Act. The
case of	 <a href="/doc/637970/" id="a_24">State of  U.P. v. Durga Prasad</a>, 1975 (1) S.C.R. 881
was  not   correctly  decided	and  that  its	ratio  needs
reconsideration by  a larger Bench because it has overlooked
the test  laid down  by the  three Judge  Bench in  Raja Ram
Jaiswal's case.	 (b) As	 soon as  a person is arrested by an
officer of  the Force on a suspicion or charge of committing
an offence  punishable under  the 1966 Act, he stands in the
character of  a "person	 accused  of  an  offence"  and	 any
confessional or	 incriminating	statements  recorded  by  an
officer of  the Force  in the  course of  an  inquiry  under
<a href="/doc/143988428/" id="a_25">section 8(1)</a>  of the 1966 Act, cannot be used as evidence in
view of the constitutional ban against "compelled testimony"
imposed by <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_26">Art. 20(3)</a> of the Constitution.
     On behalf	of the respondent it was submitted that: (a)
an officer  of the  R.P.F. while making an inquiry under the
1966 Act  cannot be  equated with a police officer in charge
of a  Police Station making an investigation under<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_27"> the Code</a>.
The important difference in their powers is, that the R.P.F.
Inspector has  no power to submit a report or a charge-sheet
under <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_28">section 173</a> of the Code. The decision of this Court in
Raja Ram Jaiswal's case stands on its own peculiar facts and
was distinguished  in a	 later decision	 by  a	Constitution
Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/32824/" id="a_29">Badku Joti Savant v. State of Mysore</a>,
[1966] 3  SCR 698.  The correct test for determining whether
or not R.P.F. Officer is a police officer for the purpose of
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_30">section 25</a>  of	the  Evidence  Act  is	the  one  which	 was
consistently applied in <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_31">State of Punjab v. Barkat Ram</a> [1962]
3 SCR  338, &amp;  <a href="/doc/690751/" id="a_32">Romesh Chandra  Mehta v. West Bengal</a> [1969] 2
SCR 461.  (b) The conditions necessary for the attraction of
the ban	 in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_33">Art.  20(3)</a> do  not exist  in the  instant	case
because before the filing of the complaint in the Court, the
appellant was  not a "person accused of an offence" and that
it  was	  nowhere   alleged   that   the   confessional	  or
incriminating statements were extorted by the R.P.F. Officer
under physical duress, threat, inducement or mental torture.
177
on the questions:
     (1) whether  an officer of the Railway Protection Force
making an  inquiry  under  the	<a href="/doc/38107498/" id="a_34">Railway	 Property  (Unlawful
Possession) Act</a>, 1966 in respect of an offence under <a href="/doc/197281033/" id="a_35">section
3</a> of that Act of unlawful possession of the railway property
is a  police officer  for the  purpose of  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_36">section 25</a> of the
Evidence Act  and  <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_37">section  162</a>	 of  the  Code	of  Criminal
Procedure 1898	and whether  any confession or incriminatory
statement recorded  by him in the course of an inquiry under
<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_38">section 8</a>  of the  Act is  inadmissible in evidence, and (2)
whether a  person arrested  by an  officer  of	the  Railway
Protection Force  under <a href="/doc/1536853/" id="a_39">section 6</a> of the Act for the alleged
commission of  an offence  under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_40">section  3</a> of	the  Act  is
"person accused	 of an	offence" within	 the meaning of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_41">Art.
20(3)</a> of the Constitution:
^
     HELD: 1. An officer of the R.P.F. conducting an enquiry
under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_42">section  8(1)</a> of	the 1966  Act has  not been invested
with all  the powers  of an  officer- in-charge	 of a police
station making	an investigation  under Chapter	 XIV of	 the
Code. Particularly,  he has no power to initiate prosecution
by filing  a charge-sheet  before the  Magistrate  concerned
under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_43">section  173</a> of the Code, which he has been held to be
the  clinching	 attribute  of	 an  investigating   'police
officer'. An  officer of  the R.P.F.  could not therefore be
deemed to  be a	 "police  officer"  within  the	 meaning  of
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_44">section	 25</a>   of  the	Evidence  Act,	and  therefore,	 any
confessional or	 incriminating statement  recorded by him in
the course of an inquiry under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_45">section 8(1)</a> of the 1966 Act,
cannot be  excluded from  evidence under  the said  section.
[201C-E]
     2. The  term 'police  officer' has	 not been defined in
the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_46">Evidence  Act</a> The  policy behind  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_47">sections 25</a>  and <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_48">26</a> of
Evidence Act  is to  make a  substantive rule  of  law	that
confessions whenever  and wherever  made to the police shall
he presumed  to have  been obtained  under the circumstances
mentioned in section ' 24 and therefore, inadmissible except
so far as is provided in <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_49">section 27</a> of that Act. [182F, <a href="/doc/612149/" id="a_50">E]
     Ariel v. State</a> A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 15, referred to.
     3. The  primary  object  of  constituting	the  Railway
Protection  Force   is	to  secure  better  "protection	 and
security of  the railway  property". The restricted power of
arrest and  search given  to the  officers or members of the
Force is  incidental to	 the efficient	discharge  of  their
basic duty  to protect	and safeguard  Railway Property.  No
general power to investigate all cognizable offence relating
to Railway  Property, under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_51">  the Criminal Procedure Code</a> has
bee. conferred	on any	superior officer  or member  of	 the
Force by the 1957 Act [185F-G]
     4. The  main purpose  of passing  the 1966	 Act was  to
"invest powers of investigation and prosecution" of offences
relating to  railway property in the RPF "in the same manner
as in  the Excise  and Customs." Inspite of provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_52"> the
Code</a> of	 Criminal Procedure  to the contrary, offences under
this Act  have been made non-cognizable and, as such, cannot
be investigated	 by a  police officer  under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_53">  the  Code</a>.  It
follows that  the initiation  of prosecution  for an offence
inquired into  under this  Act can only be on the basis of a
complaint by  an officer  of RPF  and not on the report of a
police	officer	  under	 <a href="/doc/1505589/" id="a_54">section   173(4)</a>  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898. [187A, 188B]
     5. <a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_55">Section	 14</a> makes  clear that  the provisions of the
Act shall override all other laws. which means that anything
in the 1966 Act which is inconsistent
178
with<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_56"> the  Code</a>, will prevail and the application<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_57"> of the Code</a>
pro tanto  will be  excluded. The  scheme of  the 1966	Act,
particularly the  provisions in	 <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_58">sections 5</a>, <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_59">8</a>, <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_60">9(3)</a>, (4) is
different from that<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_61"> of the Code</a>. The Code, therefore, cannot
proprio vigore	apply to  an enquiry conducted under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_62">section
8(1)</a> of	 the 1966  Act by  an officer  of the  Force. [189G,
190A]
     6. An  analysis of	 clause (3)  of <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_63">Art.  20</a> shows three
things: Firstly,  its protection  is  available	 only  to  a
"person accused of any offence". Secondly, the protection is
against	 compulsion   "to  be	a  witness".  Thirdly,	this
protection avails "against himself". [202F]
     7. Only  a person	against whom  a formal accusation of
the commission	of an  offence has been made can be a person
"accused of  on offence"  within the  meaning of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_64">Art. 20(3).</a>
Such formal  accusation may be specifically made against him
in an  F.I.R. or  a formal  complaint or  any  other  formal
document or  notice served  on that person, which ordinarily
results in his prosecution in Court. [204F]
     In the  instant case no such formal accusation had been
made against the appellant when has statement(s) in question
were recorded  by the  R.P.F. Officer.	He did	not at	that
time, stand  in the  character of  a person  "accused of  an
offence" and  as such,	the protection of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_65">Article 20(3)</a> will
not be available to him. [203F-<a href="/doc/1949862/" id="a_66">G]

of  Wadi   Bunder  in  which  Balkishan	 was  involved,	 the
Inspector recorded  the confessional statement of Balkishan,
appellant, herein. After making that confessional statement,
Balkishan is  said to  have led	 Inspector  Kakade,  in	 the
presence  of   Panchas,	 to   Tulsiram	Gupta  Mills  Estate
Compound, wherefrom  35	 M.S.  Plates  were  recovered.	 The
Inspector further  discovered  that  the  M.S.	Plates	were
shifted from  Devi Dayal's compound to Nittal Estate, Kurla-
Andheri Road,  Marol Naka  and they  were  transported	from
there for Devi Dayal's Estates. He recorded the statement of
Tukaram, the  owner of one of these motor-trucks on February
7, 1971.  Tukaram stated  that	his  lorry  was	 engaged  on
November 1, 1971, by the appellant.
</p><p id="p_13">     In the  meantime, investigation  regarding the offences
of forgery  and cheating  was being  done at  Akola  by	 the
concerned Police  Sub Inspector, who was directed to suspend
his inquiry till further orders were received by him.
</p><p id="p_14">     In the  complaint, Inspector Kakade stated that accused
2 and  3 are  absconding Annexed to the complaint was a list
of prosecution witnesses numbering, in all, 40 and a list of
documents numbering 62.
</p><p id="p_15">     The  appellant   (accused	1)   appeared	before	 the
Presidency Magistrate.	He was	then supplied  the  list  of
prosecution witnesses and the list of documents to be relied
upon by	 the prosecution. The list of documents included the
list of	 statements  of	 various  persons  recorded  by	 the
Inspector of  the Railway  Protection Force.  The Presidency
Magistrate commenced an inquiry and recorded the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">181</span>
statements of four witnesses, of one on March 2, 1973 and of
the other three on June 12, 1973.
</p><p id="p_16">     On June  11, 1973,	 an application	 was  filed  by	 the
appellant  to	the  Magistrate,  making  a  grievance	that
although three witnesses had been examined, no copies of the
documents were	furnished to him by the prosecution. On June
25, 1973,  the appellant  made a  further application to the
Magistrate, requesting	for supply of true copies of all the
documents in  the case to enable him to prepare his defence.
He  further  prayed  that  he  should  be  allowed  to	take
photostats of all the documents in the presence of the court
officer. The  Magistrate on  August 3, 1973, passed an order
rejecting the accused's application, dated June 11, 1973, on
the ground  that the  offence complained  of against him was
non-cognizable and  the provisions  of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_87">Section	251A</a> of	 the
Code  of   Criminal  Procedure	 were  not  applicable,	 and
consequently. he  (accused 1)  had no right to obtain copies
of the documents concerned. The Magistrate further passed an
order on  August 3,  1973. declining to allow the accused to
take photostats of all the documents, on the ground that the
documents could	 not be	 allowed to  be	 taken	outside	 the
court. He, however, added that "if any request to secure the
photostat copies in the Court comes, it will be considered".
</p><p id="p_17">     On August	24, 1973,  the Magistrate  framed  a  charge
under <a href="/doc/121150618/" id="a_88">Section  3(a)</a> of	the Act	 to the	 effect? that  on or
after November	14, 1970 the accused was found in possession
of M.S.	 Plates numbering  about 110, which were the Railway
property unlawfully  possessed by  him. The  accused pleaded
'not guilty'  and again	 made an  application repeating	 his
request for  copies of	the statements of witnesses recorded
by Inspector  Kakade. He  also prayed  that he be allowed to
inspect all  the statements  recorded by the prosecution and
take  copies   thereof.	  The	Magistrate   rejected	this
application, also, by an order on September 7, 1973.
</p><p id="p_18">     Feeling  aggrieved	  by  the   orders  passed   by	 the
Magistrate on  August 9. 1973 and September 7, 1973, and the
framing of the charge against him, the appellant invoked the
inherent jurisdiction  of the High Court by a petition under
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_89">Section 561A</a>  of the  Code of  Criminal Procedure, 1898, and
prayed that the said orders be quashed. In this petition, he
challenged the	constitutional validity	 of <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_90">Section 9</a> of the
Act. The  petition was heard by a Bench consisting of Vaidya
and  Gandhi,   JJ.  The	 learned  Judges  answered  all	 the
questions, posed  above, in  the negative. But, on the other
aspects of  the	 case,	the  Assistant	Government  Pleader,
appearing on  behalf of	 the State,  stated before  the High
Court that the prosecution did not desire to keep back
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">182</span>
any material  from the	accused and  that they would produce
copies of  statements of all the witnesses and the documents
on which  the prosecution  intends  to	rely  or  which	 the
accused wanted	to examine. In view of this statement of the
Government Pleader,  the High  Court set aside the orders of
the Magistrate	and directed  the complainant  under <a href="/doc/302809/" id="a_91">Section
165</a> of	the Evidence  Act to  produce in the trial court the
true copies  of	 the  statement	 of  the  witnesses  already
examined and to be examined hereafter By the complainant and
of the documents on which the complainant desired to depend.
The High  Court further	 declared that	the accused  and his
counsel shall  be entitled  to inspect	those documents	 and
take copies  thereof, if necessary, in the court. If further
declared that  <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_92">Section 9</a>  of the Act, is not ultra vires the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_19">     Hence, these appeals by the accused persons.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Question No. 1</span>
<p id="p_20">     The first	question for  consideration is.	 whether  an
Inspector of  the Railway Protection Force, (for short, RPF)
is  a  "police	officer",  and	therefore  any	confessional
statement made	to  him	 comes	within	the  prohibition  of
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_93">Section 25</a>. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_94">Evidence Act</a>. <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_95">Section 25</a> reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "No confession  made to  a police officer shall be
     proved as against a person accused of any offence."</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">     As explained by this Court in <a href="/doc/612149/" id="a_96">Ariel v. State</a> the policy
behind <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_97">Sections	 25</a> and	 <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_98">26</a>.  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_99">Evidence	Act</a>  is	 to  make  a
substantive  rule  of  law  that  confessions  whenever	 and
wherever made  to the  police shall be presumed to have been
obtained under	the circumstances  mentioned in p <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_100">Section 24</a>
and, therefore, inadmissible except so far as is provided in
<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_101">Section 27</a>,  of that  Act. The term "Police officer" has not
been defined in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_102">Evidence Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_22">     Shri R.  K. Garg,	appearing for the appellant, submits
that the expression "police officer" in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_103">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_104">Evidence
Act</a> must  be construed	in a  wide popular  sense, so  as to
include within its ambit all officers of Government who are,
in substance, invested with the power to investigate certain
offences in  accordance with  the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_105">  of the Code</a> of
Criminal  Procedure  1898  (for	 short,	 called<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_106">	 the  Code</a>).
irrespective of	 the fact that they are differently labelled
such as,  Excise officers  or Customs officers or members of
the RPF,  otherwise, the  very object  of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_107">Section 25</a> will be
defeated. In support of this contention, the learned counsel
has referred to the decision of this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">183</span>
in <a href="/doc/1409644/" id="a_108">Raja	 Ram Jaiswal  v. State	of Bihar</a>.  The point pressed
into argument  is that	an Inspector  of the  RPF making  an
inquiry under  the <a href="/doc/38107498/" id="a_109">Railway  Property  (Unlawful	 Possession)
Act</a>. 1966  into an  offence under  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_110">Section 3</a> of that Act, in
substance. acts	 and exercises	almost all  the powers	of a
'Police officer'  making an  investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_111"> the Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure. If that be the correct position-proceeds
the argument  any confessional	statement recorded  by	such
Inspector will	be hit	by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_112">section  25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_113">Evidence Act</a>, and if
that statement	falls short of a 'confession', then also, it
will not be admissible in evidence against its maker, at his
trial because  of the bar in <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_114">section 162</a>. Criminal<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_115"> Procedure
Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_23">     As against the above, Shri Nain submits that an officer
of the RPF while making an inquiry under the 1966 Act cannot
be equated  with a  Police officer  in charge  of  a  Police
Station	 making	  an  investigation   under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_116">  the  Code</a>.	 One
important difference  in  their	 powers	 is,  that  the	 RPF
Inspector has  no power	 to submit  a report  or chargesheet
under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_117">section 173</a> of the Code. Shri Nain has further pointed
out that  Raja Ram Jaiswal's case stands on its own peculiar
facts, and  was distinguished  in  a  later  decision  by  a
Constitution Bench  of this  Court in  <a href="/doc/32824/" id="a_118">Badku Joti  Savant v.
State of  Mysore</a>. According  to Shri  Nain, the correct test
for determining	 whether or  not a  RPF officer is a 'Police
officer' for the purpose of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_119">section 25</a>. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_120">Evidence Act</a>, is the
one which  was consistently  applied in	 <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_121">State of  Punjab v.
Barkat Ram</a>;  Badku Joti	 Savant (ibid); <a href="/doc/690751/" id="a_122">Romesh Chandra Mehta
v. West	 Bengal</a>. To  top  it  all,  it	is  maintained,	 the
question is now no longer res integra and has been concluded
by the	recent judgment	 of this  Court in  <a href="/doc/637970/" id="a_123">State of U.P. v.
Durga Prasad</a>.
</p><p id="p_24">     In reply, Shri R.K. Garg has tried to distinguish Durga
Prasad's  case,	 ibid,	on  the	 ground,  that	therein	 the
question whether  or not  an officer  of the RPF is a Police
officer within	the  contemplation  of	<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_124">section	 25</a>  of	 the
Evidence Act,  was not	directly in  issue. It is maintained
that the  only question	 for  decision	in  that  case	was.
Whether an  enquiry conducted under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_125">section 8(1)</a> of the 1966
Act can	 be deemed to be an investigation for the purpose of
<a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_126">section 162</a>  of the  Code of  Criminal Procedure.  and	this
question was  answered in  the negative. In the alternative,
it is  urged that  Durga Prasad's  case	 was  not  correctly
decided and  its ratio	needs reconsideration  by  a  larger
Bench because  it has  overlooked the  test laid down by the
3-Judge Bench in Raja Ram laiswal's case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">184</span>
<p id="p_25">     Although Durga  Prasad's case  very largely  appears to
conclude this  question,  yet,	in  deference  to  the	last
argument of  Shri Garg,	 we propose  to deal  with the other
decisions of  this Court.  also. which have been referred to
by counsel on both sides.
</p><p id="p_26">     At the  outset, for  the sake  of perspective,  we	 may
notice the  relevant provisions	 of the	 1966  Act  and	 the
<a href="/doc/1352182/" id="a_127">Railway Protection Force Act</a> ]957 (for short called the 1957
Act). First we will notice the relevant features of the 1957
Act whereunder	the RPF was constituted. The preamble of the
1957 Act  states that  its object  is  to  provide  for	 the
constitution and  regulation of	 a Force  called the Railway
Protection Force  for the  better protection and security of
railway property.  The various clauses in <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_128">Section 2</a> contains
definitions. The  definition of "railway property" in clause
</p><p id="p_27">(e) "includes  any goods,  money or  valuable  security,  or
animal, belonging  to, or  in the charge or possession of. a
railway administration."  "Member of  The  Force"  means  "a
person appointed  to the  Force under  this Act other than a
superior officer".  Clause (c)	"superior officer" means any
of the	officers appointed  under <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_129">section 4</a>. Clause (g) says
that the  words and expressions used but not defined in this
Act and	 defined in the <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_130">Indian Railways Act</a> 1890, shall have
the meanings  respectively assigned  to them under that Act.
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_131">Section	 3</a>   gives  powers  to	the  Central  Government  to
constitute and	maintain the Force. <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_132">Section 5</a> enumerates the
classes of  officers; Inspector/Sub-Inspector/Assistant Sub-
Inspector. <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_133">Section  10</a> says that the officers and members of
the Force  shall be  deemed to	be 'railway servants' within
the meaning  of the <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_134">Indian Railways Act</a>. 1890. <a href="/doc/1067003/" id="a_135">Section 11</a> is
important. It  enumerates That,	 the duty  of every superior
officer and member of the Force shall be-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (a)  promptly to  execute all orders lawfully issued to
	  him by his superior authority;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (b)  to protect and safeguard railway property;

	  railway property; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (d)  to do	 any  other  act  conducive  to	 the  better
	  protection and security of railway property.
</blockquote><p id="p_28"><a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_136">Section 12</a>  enables any	 superior officer  or member  of the
Force to  arrest, without  an order  from a  Magistrate	 and
without a warrant-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  "(a) any  person who	has  been  concerned  in  an
     offence relating  to railway  property punishable	with
     imprisonment  for	a  term	 exceeding  six	 months,  or
     against whom  a  reasonable  suspicion  exists  of	 his
     having been so concerned; or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">185</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  (b) any person found taking precautions to conceal
     his  presence within railway limits under circumstances
     which afford  reason to  believe that he is taking such

     damage to, railway property."</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">     <a href="/doc/808094/" id="a_137">Section 13</a> provides: "Whenever any superior officer, or
any member  of the  Force, not	below the  rank of  a Senior
Rakshak, has  reason to	 believe that any such offence as is
referred to  in <a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_138">section	 12</a> has	 been nor is being committed
and  that   a  search-warrant  cannot  be  obtained  without
affording the  offender an  opportunity of  escaping  or  of
concealing evidence  of the  offence, he  may detain him and
search his person and belongings forthwith and, if he thinks
proper, arrest	any person  whom he has reason to believe to
have committed	the  offence.  Under  sub-section  (2),	 the
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_139"> of the Code</a>, relating to searches under that Code
shall, so  far as  may be,  apply  to  searches	 under	this
section. <a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_140">Section  14</a> indicates	the procedure to be followed
after arrest.  According to  it,  any  superior	 officer  or
member of  the Force  making an arrest under this Act, shall
without unnecessary  delay. make over the person arrested to
a police  officer, or,	in the	absence of a Police officer,
take such  person or  cause him	 to be	taken to the nearest
police station. <a href="/doc/430855/" id="a_141">Section 17</a> provides penalties for neglect of

make rules for carrying out the purposes of this Act. Clause
</p><p id="p_30">(b) of	sub-section (2) of this section says that such rules
may provide,  inter alia,  for	regulating  the	 powers	 and
duties	of  superior  officers	and  members  of  the  Force
authorised to exercise any functions by or under this Act.
</p><p id="p_31">     From the above survey, it will be seen that the primary
object of  constituting the  Railway Protection	 Force is to
secure	better	"protection  and  security  of	the  railway
property." The	restricted power  of arrest and search given
to the officers or members of the Force is incidental to the
efficient discharge  of their  basic  duty  to	protect	 and
safeguard Railway  Property. No general power to investigate
all cognizable	offences relating to Railway Property, under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_144">
the Criminal  Procedure	 Code</a>  has  been  conferred  on	 any
superior officer  or member  of the  Force by  the 1957 Act.
<a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_145">Section 14</a> itself makes it clear that even with regard to an
offence relating to 'railway property', the superior officer
or member  of the  Force making	 an arrest  under <a href="/doc/808094/" id="a_146">section 13</a>
shall forthwith	 make over  the person	arrested to a police
officer, or  cause his	production  in	the  nearest  police
station.
</p><p id="p_32">     Now, we  will take	 up the	 1966 Act,  which came	into
force  on  September  16,  1966.  As  is  evident  from	 its
preamble, it  is an  Act to  consolidate and  amend the	 law
relating to unlawful possession of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">186</span>
Railway Property.  The material	 part  of  the	objects	 and
Reasons for  moving the	 Bill which  became this  Act, is as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "2. At  present, offences against Railway property
     are being	dealt with  under Railway  Stores  (Unlawful
     Possession) Act,  1955, but this Act has been found, by
     experience, to  be ineffective  in	 tackling  with	 the
     enormity of  the problems	of theft  and pilferages  on
     Railways. As  it is, this Act makes unlawful possession
     of Railway Stores an Defence, but it is only applicable
     to unlawful possession of Railway property owned by the
     Railways, and  does not  cover the offences relating to
     goods and parcels entrusted to Railways for transport.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  3.  Further,	the  offences  under  this  Act	 are
     investigated and  enquired	 into  by  local  police  in
     accordance with  the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_147"> of the Code</a> of Criminal
     Procedure, 1898.  It has  been observed  that  the	 two
     Agencies,	i.e.   the  Government	Railway	 Police	 and
     Railway Protection Force, which are at present provided
     to	 deal	with  crimes  on  railways  find  themselves
     handicapped,  for	different  reasons,  in	 effectively
     dealing with  the problem	of theft  and  pilferage  of
     Railway Property.	The Railways  are spread  out over a
     large part of the country and property, etc., entrusted
     to them  is carried  from one  part to  another usually
     crossing	boundaries    of   different   states.	 The
     jurisdiction of  State Police  being restricted  to the
     State boundary  only, it becomes difficult at times for
     the Police	 to make thorough and fruitful investigation
     into offences  relating to	 Railway Property.  Besides,
     investigation of  cases in	 respect of Railway Property
     also  requires   a	 specialised  knowledge	 of  Railway
     working. The  Railway Protection  Force, on  the  other
     hand, are not at present equipped with requisite powers
     of investigation  and prosecution, with the result that
     whatever action  they take	 in  respect  of  prevention
     etc., is  taken just  in aid  of the  State Police	 who
     conduct investigation  and prosecution etc. Due to this
     fact of  two agencies  being responsible  for achieving
     the same  object,	the  machinery	has  not  proved  as
     effective as it ought to have.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  4, It	 is,  therefore,  proposed  to	replace	 the
     Railway Stores  (Unlawful Possession)  Act, 1955,	by a
     more comprehensive	 Act so	 as to	bring with its ambit
     the unlawful  possession  of  goods  entrusted  to	 the
     Railways as  common carriers and to make the punishment
     for such  offences more  deterrent. It is also proposed
     to invest	powers of  investigation and  prosecution of
     offences relating	to Railway  Property in	 the Railway
     Protection Force  in the  same manner  as in the Excise
     and Customs."</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">     (emphasis added)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">187</span>
     From what	has been  quoted above, it is clear that the
main purpose  of passing  the 1966 Act was to "invest powers
of investigation  and prosecution"  of offences	 relating to
railway property  in the  RPF "in  the same manner as in the
Excise and Customs".
</p><p id="p_34">     We will  advert to	 this point later. Suffice it to say
here that  in view  of the  aforesaid object of enacting the

appear in  the inquiry	are expressly  mandated to state the
truth. In  contrast with  this, <a href="/doc/1957834/" id="a_187">Section 160</a> of the Code does
not expressly bind persons examined in Police investigation,
to state  the truth.  The inquiry  under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_188">Section 8(1)</a> of the
1966 Act  in view  of <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_189">Section  9(4)</a> shall  be deemed to be a

of the	Penal Code. But a police investigation under <a href="/doc/1957834/" id="a_192">Section

193</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_194"> Penal Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_50">     The fourth important aspect in which the power and duty
of an  officer of  the RPF  conducting an  inquiry under the
1966 Act,  differs from	 a police  investigation  under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_195">	 the
Code</a>, is  this Sub-section  (3) of  <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_196">Section 161</a>	 of the Code
says that  the police  officer may  reduce into	 writing any
statement made	to  him	 in  the  course  of  investigation.
<a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_197">Section 162(1)</a>,	 which is  to be  read	in  continuation  of
<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_198">Section	 161</a>   of  the	Code,  prohibits  the  obtaining  of
signature of  the person  on his  statement recorded  by the
investigating officer.	But no	such prohibition attaches to
statements recorded  in the  course of	an inquiry under the
1966 Act;  rather, from	 the obligation	 to state  the truth
under pain  of prosecution enjoined by <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_199">Section 9(3)</a> and (4),
it follows  as a  corollary, that the officer conducting the
inquiry may  obtain signature  of the  person who  made	 the
statement.
</p><p id="p_51">     Fifthly, under  the provision  to	sub-section  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_200">Section 162</a>  of the Code, oral or recorded statement made to
a police  officer during  investigation may  be used  by the
accused, and  with the	permission  of	the  Court,  by	 the
prosecution to	contradict the statement made by the witness
in Court  in the  manner provided  in <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_201">Section  145</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_202">Evidence

examination, he	 may be	 reexamined if	any  explanation  is

purpose, whatever, except of course
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">191</span>
when it	 falls within <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_203">Sections 32</a> or 27 of he <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_204">Evidence Act</a>.

statements,  confessional   or	otherwise  during  a  police
investigation made  by any  person whether  accused or	not,
whether reduced	 to writing  or not, subject to the proviso.
In contrast  with<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_206"> the  Code</a>, in	 the 1966  Act, there  is no
provision analogous  to the proviso to <a href="/doc/1153129/" id="a_207">Section 162(1)</a> of the
Code, which  restricts or  prohibits the  use of a statement
recorded by  an officer	 in the	 course of  an inquiry under
<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_208">Sections 8</a> and <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_209">9</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_52">     Sixthly, the primary duty of a member/officer of RPF is
to safeguard  and protect railway property. Only such powers
of arrest and inquiry have been conferred by the 1966 Act on
members of  RPF as  are	 necessary  and	 incidental  to	 the
efficient and effective discharge of the basic duty of watch
and ward.  Unlike a  police officer  who has a general power
under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_210"> the  Code</a> to  investigate all  cognizable	 cases,	 the
power of  an officer  of the  RPF  to  make  an	 inquiry  is
restricted to offences under the 1966 Act.
</p><p id="p_53">     Last but  not the least, under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_211">Section 190</a> of the Code,
a Magistrate  is empowered  to take cognizance of an offence
only in	 three ways, namely, (a) "upon receiving a complaint
of facts  which constitute  an offence; (b) upon a report in
writing of  such facts	made by	 any police officer, and (c)
upon information  received from	 any  person  other  than  a
Police officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that
such offence  has been committed". The 'report' mentioned in
clause (b),  includes the  report made	by a  police officer
under  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_212">Section	173</a>  after  completing	investigation  under
Chapter XIV  of the  Code. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_213">Section  173</a>, in  terms makes  is
clear that  the	 duty  of  making  a  report  thereunder  on
completion of  the investigation  to the Magistrate, is that
of the	officer-in-charge of  the  police  station.  Such  a
report shall include the opinion of the police officer as to
the result  of the  investigation.  The	 formation  of	such
opinion is  the final  step in	the investigation  and	that
final step is to be taken by the police officer in charge of
the station  and by  no other  authority (<a href="/doc/49832/" id="a_214">Abhinandan  Jha v.
Dinesh Mishra</a>).	 An officer  of the  RPF making	 an  inquiry
under the  1966 Act,  cannot, by any stretch of imagination,
be called  an "officer-in-charge of a Police Station" within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_215">Sections 173</a> and <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_216">190(b)</a> of the Code. The made
of initiating  prosecution  by	submitting  a  report  under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_217">Section 173</a>  read with clause (b) of <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_218">Section 190</a> of the Code
is, therefore,	not available  to an  officer of the RPF who
has completed an inquiry into an offence under the 1966 Act.
The only mode of initiating prosecution of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">192</span>
person	against	 whom  he  has	successfully  completed	 the
inquiry, available  to an officer of the RPF, is by making a
complaint  under  <a href="/doc/545340/" id="a_219">Section  190(1)(a)</a>  of  the  Code  to	 the
Magistrate empowered  to try the offence. That an officer of
the Force  conducting an  inquiry under	 <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_220">Section 8(1)</a> cannot
initiate proceedings  in court	by a  report under  <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_221">Sections
173</a>/<a href="/doc/867855/" id="a_222">190(1)(b)</a> of the Code, is also evident from the provisos
to sub-section	(2) of	<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_223">Section 8</a>  of the  1966	 Act.  Under
proviso (a),  if such  officer is  of opinion  that there is
sufficient  evidence   or  reasonable  ground  of  suspicion
against the  accused, he  shall	 either	 direct	 him  (after
admitting him  to bail)	 to  appear  before  the  Magistrate
having jurisdiction  or	 forward  him  in  custody  to	such
Magistrate. Under  proviso (b), if it appears to he officer
that there is no sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of
suspicion against  the accused, he shall release him on bond
to appear  before the Magistrate concerned "and shall make a
full report  of all  the particulars  of  the  case  to	 his
superior officer".  Provisos (a) and (b) put it beyond doubt
that where  after completing  an inquiry, the officer of the
Force is  of opinion  that there  is sufficient	 evidence or
reasonable ground  of suspicion against the accused, he must
initiate prosecution  of the  accused by  making a complaint
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_224">Section  190(1)</a> (a)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_225">  of the  Code</a>	 to  the  Magistrate
competent to try the case.
</p><p id="p_54">     From the  comparative study  of the relevant provisions
of the 1966 Act and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_226"> the Code</a>, it is abundantly clear that an
officer of  the RPF  making an inquiry under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_227">Section 8(1)</a> of
the 1966  Act does  not possess several important attributes
of an  officer-in-charge of  a police  station conducting an
investigation under  Chapter XIV  of the Code. The character
of  the	  'inquiry'   is   different   from   that   of	  an
'investigation' under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_228">  the Code</a>.  The  official	 status	 and
powers of  an officer  of the Force in the matter of inquiry
under the  1966 Act differ in material aspects from those of
a police officer conducting an investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_229"> the Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_55">     The ground	 is now clear for noticing the rulings cited
at the	Bar. <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_230">In	 State of  Punjab v.  Barkat Ram</a> (ibid), the
question was  whether a Customs officer can be regarded as a
'police officer' within the purview of Section Evidence Act.
This decision  was rendered  by a  Bench  of  three  learned
Judges. The  judgment of the Court was delivered by majority
(consisting of Raghubar Dayal and J.L. Kapur JJ.). Subba Rao
J. (as	he then	 was wrote  a dissenting  opinion. The	view
taken by the Court Majority was to the effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	  "that the  powers which  the police officers enjoy
     are powers	 for the  effective prevention and detection
     of crime  in order	 to maintain law and order. Although
     the expression  'police officer" has to be construed in
     a wide and popular sense, yet it has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">193</span>
     so wide  a meaning as to include officers interested in
     the duty  of detecting  and  preventing  smuggling	 and
     similar offences  with the	 object of  safeguarding the
     levying and  recovery of  Customs duties.	He  is	more
     concerned with the goods and customs duty than with the
     offender. The  duties of customs officers are very much
     different from  those  of	police	officers  and  their
     possessing certain	 powers, which	may have  similarity
     with those	 of police  officers,  for  the	 purpose  of
     detecting	the  smuggling	of  goods  and	the  persons
     responsible  for	it,  would   not  make	them  police
     officers. Merely  because similar	powers in  regard to
     the detection  of infraction  of Customs laws have been
     conferred on officers of the Police is not a sufficient
     ground for	 holding them  to be  police officers within
     the purview  of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_231">Section  25</a> of  the Evidence  Act.	 The
     Customs officers,	when they  act under the Sea Customs
     Act to  prevent the  smuggling  of	 goods	by  imposing
     confiscation and  penalties, act judicially. The Police
     officers never act judicially. Hence, a Customs officer
     either under  the Land  Customs Act. 1924, or under the
     Sea Customs  Act, 1878, is not a police officer for the
     purpose of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_232">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_233">Evidence Act</a>."</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">     In his  dissenting opinion,  Subba Rao  J.,  held	that
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_234">Section 25</a>,  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_235">Evidence Act</a>  was enacted	to subserve  a	high
purpose and  that is  to prevent  the police  from obtaining
confession by  force, torture  or inducement.  The  salutary
principle underlying  the Section  would  apply	 equally  to
other officers,	 by whatever  designation they may be known,
who have  the power  and duty to detect and investigate into
crimes and  is for  that purpose  in a	position to  extract
confessions from  the accused  It is  not the  garb  or	 the
designation under  which the officer functions that matters,
but the nature of the power he exercises or the character of
the  function	he  performs,	is  decisive.  The  question
therefore, in  each  case  is,	does  the  officer  under  a
particular  Act	  substantially	 exercise   the	 powers	 and
discharge the  duties of  prevention and detection of crime?
If he  does, he	 will be a police officer. The learned Judge
quoted with  approval the  view of  Balakrishna Ayyar, J. in
Paramasivam's case  that if  the officer's powers and duties
are  substantially  those  of  a  police  officer,  but	 are
confined to  a	particular  extent  of	territory  or  to  a
particular subject-matter  he will  be a police officer only
in respect of that territory or that subject matter. On this
reasoning, Subba  Rao J.  held that  a Customs	officer is a
police officer qua his police functions.
</p><p id="p_57">     The next  case is	Raja Ram Jaiswal (ibid) decided by a
three-Judge Bench.  There,  the	 question  was,	 whether  an
Excise officer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">194</span>
exercising the	power of  investigation under  the Bihar and
Orissa Excise  Act, 1915,  is a	 'police officer' within the

for himself and Subba Rao, J., answered this question in the
affirmative. What  the majority	 held in  that case  may  be
summed up as under:
</p><p id="p_58">     The test  for determining whether a person is a "police

establish a  direct or	substantial  relationship  with	 the
prohibition enacted  by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_240">Section	 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_241">Evidence  Act</a>, that is,
the recording  of a  confession. In other words, whether the
powers conferred  on the  Excise officer  under the  Act are
such as	 would tend  to facilitate the obtaining by him of a
confession from a suspect delinquent. If they do, then it is
unnecessary to consider the dominant purpose for which he is
appointed or the question as to what other powers he enjoys.
It was	further held that unlike the Customs officer on whom
are conferred  by the  Sea Customs  Act, 1878,	powers of  a
limited character, which are analogous to those conferred on
police	officers,   are	 not  by  themselves  sufficient  to
facilitate the	obtaining by  him of a confession. It is the
possession of these powers which enables police officers and
those who  are deemed  to be  police officers  to exercise a
kind of authority over the persons arrested which facilitate
the  obtaining	 from	them   statements   which   may	  be
incriminating to the persons making them. The law allows the
police officer	to obtain  such statements  with a  view  to
facilitate  the	 investigation	of  the	 offences.  But,  it
renders them inadmissible in evidence for the obvious reason
that a	suspicion about	 voluntariness would attach to them.
It is  the power of investigation which establishes a direct
relationship with  the prohibition  enacted in	<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_242">Section	 25</a>.
Therefore, where  such a power is conferred upon an officer,
the mere  fact that  he possesses  some other  powers  under
another law would not make him any the less a police officer
for the	 purposes of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_243">Section 25</a>. Hence, a confession made by
an accused  under the  Bihar and  Orissa Act, recorded by an
Excise Inspector who is empowered to investigate any offence
under the  Act, is inadmissible by reasons of the provisions
of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_244">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act.
</p><p id="p_59">     Raghubar  Dayal,  J.,  however,  expressed	 a  contrary
opinion. He held that the Excise Inspectors empowered by the
State Government  under <a href="/doc/1170743/" id="a_245">Section	 77(2)</a> of the Bihar Act, are
not 'police  officers' within  the meaning  of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_246">Section 25</a> of
the Evidence  Act and  that the aforesaid officers cannot be
treated to  he police  officers for  the purposes of <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_247">Section
162</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_248">Section 162</a> does not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">195</span>
confer any  power on a police officer. It deals with the use
which can  be made  of the  statements recorded	 by a police
officer carrying  out investigation under Chapter XIV of the
Code. The  investigation which	the aforesaid Excise officer
conducts is  not under Chapter XIV of the Code, but is under
the provisions	of the	Act and therefore, this is a further
reason for  non-applicability of  <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_249">Section 162</a> of the Code to
any statements	made by a person to an Excise officer during
the course of his investigating an offence under the Act.

     when investigating a cognizable case; but this power is
     conferred for  the purpose	 of  sub-section  (1)  which
     gives power  to a	Central Excise	officer to  whom any
     arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the charge
     against him.  Thus under  <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_261">section 21</a>  it is the duty of

     Bihar and	Orissa Excise  Act, 1915,  which came  to be
     considered	 in  Raja  Ram	Jaiswal's  case,  and  which
     provided in terms that "for the purposes of <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_272">Section 156</a>

     Sub-section (2),  is appointed  shall be deemed to be a
     police station,  and such officer shall be deemed to be
     the officer-in-charge  of such station". It, therefore,
     cannot be	said that  the provision in <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_274">Section 21</a> is on
     par with  the provision  in <a href="/doc/677392/" id="a_275">Section  78(3)</a> of the Bihar

<p id="p_64">     On the  above reasoning, the Court concluded that "mere
conferment of powers of investigation into criminal offences
under <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_278">Section  9</a> of the Act does not make the Central Excise
officer a  police officer even in the broader view mentioned
above".
</p><p id="p_65">     Following the  decisions in  <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_279">Punjab State v. Barkat Ram</a>
(ibid), and  <a href="/doc/32824/" id="a_280">Badku Joti	 Savant v.  Mysore State</a>  (ibid),  a
Constitution Bench of this Court, in <a href="/doc/690751/" id="a_281">Ramesh Chandra v. State
of  West   Bengal</a>  (ibid),  reiterated	that  the  test	 for
determining whether  an officer of customs is to be deemed a
police officer is whether he is invested with all the powers
of  a  police  officer	qua  investigation  of	an  offence,
including the  power to	 submit a  report under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_282">Section 173</a>,
Code of	 Criminal Procedure.  Applying this  test, the Court
held that  since a  Customs officer exercising power to make

</p><p id="p_66">     Again in  <a href="/doc/387476/" id="a_286">Illias v.  Collector of	Customs</a>, this  Court
held that  although a  Customs officer under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_287">Customs Act</a>
1962, has  been invested  with many of the powers similar to
those exercisable  by a	 police officer under Chapter XIV of
the Code-which	he did	not have under the old Act-yet he is
not empowered to file a chargesheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_288">Section 173</a> of the
Code and  therefore, he	 cannot be  regarded  as  a  "police
officer" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_289">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_290">Evidence Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_67">     Shri Garg	tried to  distinguish  these  cases  on	 the
ground that  they  relate  to  Customs	officers  or  Excise
officers whose	primary duties	are to	collect and  prevent
evasion of revenues, and that some of the powers of a police
officer are  conferred on  them	 merely	 for  the  effective
discharge  of  their  duties  as  revenue  officers.  It  is
submitted that	the members  of	 the  RPF  are	not  revenue
officers and  their duties are confined to the protection of
railway	  property,    and   prevention,    detection	 and
investigation of  crimes  relating  to	'railway  property'.
Relying on  the decision  in Raja  Ram Jaiswal's case, it is
urged that  the real test to be applied for determining this
question, is,  whether the  police powers  conferred  on  an
officer of  the RPF  are such  as would	 tend  to  tempt  or
facilitate the	obtaining by  him a confession from a person
suspected of  the commission  of an  offence under  the 1966
Act.  It  is  argued  that  since  an  officer	of  the	 RPF
conducting  an	 inquiry  has  been  invested  qua  'railway
property' with almost all the powers or an officer-in-charge
of a  Police Station  making an	 investigation under Chapter
XIV of	the Code,  this test is amply satisfied to hold that
he is a 'police officer' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_291">Section 25</a> of
the Evidence  Act. At  one stage,  it was  contended by Shri
Garg that  it could  be spelled out from <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_292">Section 8(2)</a> of the
1966 Act  that an  officer of  the Force  had the  power  to
present a  charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_293">Section 173</a> of the Code, also.
In the alternative, it was submitted that the mere fact that
an officer  of the  Force could initiate prosecution only by
filing a  complaint and not by making a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_294">Section
173</a>  of	  the  Code,   was  immaterial	 in  regard  to	 the
satisfaction of This test, if, in fact, he had been invested
with all  other powers	of investigation  exercisable  by  a
police officer	under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_295"> the  Code</a>, qua offences under the 1966
Act.
</p><p id="p_68">     Prima facie  there is much to be said for the reasoning
advanced by  the learned counsel for the appellant, but as a
matter of  judicial discipline	we cannot  deviate from	 the
ratio of Punjab State v. Barkat
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">199</span>
Ram and	 Badku Joti  Savant's case,  and  the  primary	test
enunciated therein for determining this question. Indeed, we
are bound  by the  decision in <a href="/doc/637970/" id="a_296">State of U.P. v. Durga Prasad</a>
(ibid) which,  following the  ratio of	the aforesaid cases,
has held  that an  officer of  the RPF conducting an inquiry
under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_297">Section  8(1)</a> of	the 1966 Act, cannot be equated with
an  officer-in-charge	of  a	Police	Station	  making  an
investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code.
</p><p id="p_69">     It may  be recalled  that the  primary test  evolved in
Badku Joti  Savant's case  by the  Constitution	 Bench,	 is:
Whether the  officer concerned	under the  special Act,	 has
been invested with all the powers exercisable by an officer-
in-charge of a Police Station under Chapter XIV of the Code,
qua investigation  of offences under that Act, including the
power  to   initiate  prosecution  by  submitting  a  report
(chargesheet) under  <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_298">Section 173</a>  of the  Code. In  order to
bring him  within The  purview of a 'police officer' for the
purpose of  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_299">Section 25</a>.	 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_300">Evidence Act</a>,	it is  not enough to
show that  he exercises some or even many of the powers of a
police officer conducting an investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_301"> the Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_70">     Nor  is   the  ratio   of	 the   aforesaid   decisions
inapplicable  merely  because  they  related  to  a  Customs
officer or  an Excise  officer, and not to an officer of the
RPF. The  factual premises  on which the ratio of Badku Joti
Savant's rests	were substantially analogous to those of the
instant case.  That is to say, the powers of arrest, inquiry
and investigation  conferred on	 the Central Excise officers
under Act  1 of	 1944 (which was under consideration in that
case) are very similar to those with which an officer of the
RPF is invested under the 1966 Act. Under <a href="/doc/808094/" id="a_302">Section 13</a> of that
Act of	1944, any  Central Excise  officer duly empowered by
the Central  Government in this behalf can arrest any person
whom he	 has reason  to believe	 to be liable to punishment.
'<a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_303">Section 18</a>  provides that  all searches made under that Act

such Central Excise officer within a reasonable distance, to
the officer-in-charge of the nearest police station. <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_306">Section

     Code</a> of  Criminal Procedure, 1898, when investigating a
     cognizable case."
</blockquote><p id="p_71">It will be seen that these provisions in Sections 13, 18, 19
and  21	  of  the  Central  Act	 I  of	1944,  substantially
correspond to the provisions in <a href="/doc/1536853/" id="a_309">Sections 6</a>, <a href="/doc/681440/" id="a_310">7</a>, <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_311">8</a> etc. Of the
1966 Act,  which  we  have  already  noticed  It  will	bear
repetition that sub-<a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_312">section 12</a>) of <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_313">section 8</a>, under which an

same powers  as an  officer-in-charge of  a  police  station

materia with sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_315">Section 21</a> of Act 1 of 1944.
</p><p id="p_72">     It may  be recalled  that in the objects and Reasons of
the Bill,  which was enacted as 1966 Act, it was stated that
this  measure	invests	  "powers   of	 investigation	 and
prosecution of	offences relating to Railway Property in the
Railway Protection Force in the same manner as in the Excise
and Customs".  The  1966  Act  thus  brings  the  status  of
officers of  the RPF in the matter of inquiry, investigation
and prosecution	 of offences  under the Act substantially at
par with  that of  an Excise officer under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_316">Central Act</a> 1
of 1944 and that of a Customs Officer under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_317">Customs Act</a>,
1962. The  ratio  of  all  the	decisions  noticed  earlier,
therefore, applies  in full  force to the case of an officer
of the	RPF making an inquiry into an offence under the 1966
Act.
</p><p id="p_73">     <a href="/doc/637970/" id="a_318">In	 State	 of  U.P.  v.  Durga  Prasad</a>  (ibid),  after
carefully examining  and comparing  the	 powers	 of  arrest,
inquiry and  investigation of  an officer of the Force under
the 1966  Act with those of a police officer under he Code,
it was	pointed out that such an officer of the RPF does not
possess all  the attributes  of an  officer-in-charge  of  a
police station investigating a case under Chapter XIV of the
Code. He possesses but a part of those attributes limited to
the purpose  of holding	 the inquiry under the Act. On these
premises, it  was held	that an officer of the RPF making an
inquiry under  the 1966	 Act,  cannot  be  equated  with  an
investigating police  officer. In  reaching this conclusion,
Chandrachud, J.	 (as he	 then was),  speaking for the Court,

Badku Joti Savant's case, when he observed:

     investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_319"> the Code</a>. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_320">Section 173(1)(a)</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">201</span><a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_321">
     the Code</a>  provides that as soon as the investigation is
     completed the  officer-in-charge of  the police station
     shall  forward   to  a  Magistrate	 empowered  to	take
     cognizance of  the offence on a police report, a report
     in the  form prescribed  by the  State Government.	 The
     officer conducting an inquiry under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_322">Section 8(1)</a> cannot
     initiate court proceedings by filing a police report."
</blockquote><p id="p_74">The decision  in Raja Ram Jaiswal's case, on which Shri Garg
relies,	 was  distinguished,  as  was  done  in	 Badku	Joti
Savant's case,	on the	ground that  Jaiswal's case involved
the interpretation  of <a href="/doc/677392/" id="a_323">Section 78(3)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa
Excise Act, 1915.
</p><p id="p_75">     In the  light of the above discussion, it is clear that
an officer  of the  RPF conducting  an enquiry under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_324">Section
8(1)</a> of	 the 1966  Act has  not been  invested with  all the
powers of an officer-in-charge of a police station making an
investigation under  Chapter XIV  of the Code. Particularly,
he has	no power to initiate prosecution by filing a charge-
sheet before  the Magistrate  concerned under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_325">Section 173</a> of
the Code,  which has been held to be the clinching attribute
of an  investigating 'police  officer'. Thus,  judged by the
test laid  down in  Badku Jyoti	 Savant's,  which  has	been
consistently adopted  in the  subsequent  decisions  noticed
above, Inspector Kakade of the RPF could not be deemed to be
a 'police  officer' within  the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_326">Section 25</a> of the
Evidence   Act,	  and	therefore,   any   confessional	  or
incriminating statement	 recorded by him in the course of an
inquiry under  <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_327">Section 8(1)</a>  of	 the  1966  Act,  cannot  be
excluded from evidence under the said section.
</p><p id="p_76">     This takes us to the second question.
</p><p id="p_77">     Question II
     The  main	 contention  of	  Shri	Garg   is  that	 any
confessional or	 incriminating	statements  recorded  by  an
officer of  the Force  in the  course of  an  inquiry  under
<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_328">section 8(1)</a>  of the  1966 Act,	 cannot be  used as evidence
against the  appellant in  view of  the	 constitutional	 ban
against "compelled  testimony" imposed	by <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_329">Article  20(3)</a> of
the Constitution.  The argument	 is that as soon as a person
is arrested  by an  officer of	the Force  on a suspicion or
charge of  committing an  offence punishable  under the 1966
Act, he	 stands in  the character of a "person accused of an
offence".
</p><p id="p_78">     That being	 the case-proceeds  the argument-a statement
made by	 such an  accused person  to an	 officer of  the RPF
making an  inquiry against  him can  never  be	said  to  be
voluntary, being subject to a legal compulsion under <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_330">Section
9(3)</a> of the 1966 Act to state the truth
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">202</span>
upon any  subject respecting  which he	is examined  even if
such state of might incriminate him. On these premises it is
maintained that both the conditions necessary for attraction
of the ban in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_331">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution exist in the
case of such statements.
</p><p id="p_79">     In this  connection, Shri	Garg  has  referred  to	 the
dissenting judgment  of Subba  Rao, J. in Barkat Ram (ibid);
<a href="/doc/1949862/" id="a_332">Kathi Raning  Rawat v.	The State  of Saurashtra</a>;  <a href="/doc/684217/" id="a_333">K. Joseph
Augusthi &amp;  Ors. v.  M.A. Narayanan</a>; <a href="/doc/653753/" id="a_334">Mohamed Dastagir v. The

Satish Chandra</a>;	 <a href="/doc/1938988/" id="a_338">Smt. Nandini  Satpathy v. P.L. Dani &amp; Anr</a>.;
and In re The Special Courts Bill.
</p><p id="p_80">     As against this, Mr. Nain, appearing for the respondent
State,	submits	  that	the  conditions	 necessary  for	 the
attraction of  the ban	in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_339">Article 20(3)</a> do not exist in the
instant case,  because before the filing of the complaint in
the Court,  the appellant  was not  a "person  accused of an
offence".  It	is  further   urged  that   the	  compulsion
contemplated by	 Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_340">Article 20</a> means "physical or
mental compulsion"  and not  compulsion of  law to state the
truth;	that   freedom	to  tell  lies	is  not	 within	 the
protection of  this clause.  It was nowhere alleged that the
confessional or	 incriminating statements  in question	were
extorted by  the RPF  officer under physical duress, threat,
inducement or  mental torture. It is added that in any case,
it is  a question of fact to be established by evidence that
any such  compulsion was used in obtaining the incriminating
statements.
</p><p id="p_81">     Clause (3)	 of <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_341">Article  20</a> of  the Constitution  reads,
thus:
</p><p id="p_82">	  "No  person	accused	 of  any  offence  shall  be
     compelled to be a witness against himself."
An analysis  of this clause shows three things: Firstly, its
protection is  available only  to a  "person accused  of any
offence". Secondly, the protection is against compulsion "to
be a  witness". Thirdly,  this	protection  avails  "against
himself".
</p><p id="p_83">     It follows	 that if  any of  these ingredients does not
exist, this  clause (3), will not be attracted. Keeping this
in mind,  it will be appropriate to concentrate on the first
point, as to whether during the inquiry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">203</span>
under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_342">Section  8</a> of the 1966 Act when the appellant made the
incriminating  statement  in  question,	 he  was  a  "person
accused of  any offence" within the contemplation of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_343">Article
20(3).</a>
</p><p id="p_84">     <a href="/doc/1306519/" id="a_344">In M.  P. Sharma  v. Satish  Chandra</a> (ibid)  which is a
decision by  a seven  Judge Bench of this Court, it was held
that determination  of this  issue will depend on whether at
the  time   when  the  person  made  the  self-incriminatory
statement, a  formal accusation	 of  the  commission  of  an
offence had  been made	against him.  "Formal accusation" is
ordinarily brought into existence by lodging of an F.I.R. Or
a formal  complaint to	the appropriate	 authority or  court
against	 the   specific	 individual,  accusing	him  of	 the
commission of  a crime	which, in  the normal  course, would
result in  his prosecution. It is only on the making of such
formal accusation  that clause	(3) of	<a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_345">Article	 20</a>  becomes
operative  covering  that  individual  with  its  protective
umbrella against testimonial compulsion.
</p><p id="p_85">     The  interpretation  placed  by  the  Court  in  M.  P.
Sharma's case. On the phrase "person accused of any offence"
used in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_346">Article 20(3)</a> was reiterated in <a href="/doc/325591/" id="a_347">Bhagwan Das v. Union
of India</a>  (ibid) was  reaffirmed in <a href="/doc/693505/" id="a_348">Raja Narayanlal Bansilal
v. Maneck Phiroz Mistry &amp; Anr</a>.
</p><p id="p_86">     Again, in	the <a href="/doc/1626264/" id="a_349">State  of Bombay  v. Kathi	Kalu Oghad &amp;
Ors</a>; one  of the  propositions enunciated  by the Court was,
that to	 bring a statement within the prohibition of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_350">Article
20(3</a>), the  person accused  must have stood in the character
of an  accused person  at the time he made the statement. It
is not	enough, that  he should	 become an accused, any time
after the  statement has been made. The same proposition was
reiterated by Gajendragadkar C.J. in Joseph Augusthi (ibid),
and again  by the Constitution Bench in Ramesh Chand Mehta's
(ibid). In  the instant	 case, at  the time when the alleged
incriminating statement	 was made  before the officer of the
RPF, no	 formal complaint  in regard to the commission of an
offence had  been filed	 against him  in Court,	 nor had any
F.I.R. been  lodged with  the Police,  specifically accusing
the appellant  or  the	author	of  that  statement  of	 the
commission of an offence. It is, therefore, manifest that at
the material  time  the	 author	 of  the  self-incriminatory
statements in  question, did  not fulfil  the character of a
"person accused of an offence" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_351">Article
20(3).</a>
</p><p id="p_87">     The last  authority to  be noticed	 in  regard  to	 the
interpretation	of   the  phrase   "person  accused  of	 any
offence", is  Ramanlal	Bhogilal  Shah's  case	(ibid).	 The
petitioner Ramanlal Bhogilal Shah was arrested under <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_352">Section
19B</a> of the Foreign Exchange Act. The grounds
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">204</span>
purportedly served  on him  under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_353">Section
19B</a> for the offence under <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_354">Section 4(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1021266/" id="a_355">Section 22</a> of the
Act,  punishable  under	 <a href="/doc/813048/" id="a_356">Section  23</a>,  were  elaborate.	 The
question arose	whether after  these grounds had been served
on the	petitioner, it	could be  said that he was 'a person
accused	 of   an  offence'   within  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_357">Article  20(3)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.  The   petitioner	 was   produced	 before	 the
Magistrate, who	 released him  on  bail.  Thereafter,  First
Information Report  was recorded under <a href="/doc/1646837/" id="a_358">Section 154</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_359"> Criminal
Procedure  Code</a>,   and	an   order  was	 obtained  from	 the
Magistrate, permitting	the investigation  to be  made under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_360">Section 155(2)</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_361">	 Criminal Procedure  Code</a>.  The	 Enforcement
Officer had  examined the petitioner and put his conclusions
in  the	  grounds  of	arrest	which  were  served  on	 the
petitioner. Under  these circumstances,	 the Court held that
the petitioner	was  definitely	 a  "person  accused  of  an
offence"  within   the	meaning	 of  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_362">Article  20(3)</a>  of	 the
Constitution and  at any rate, the petitioner was accused of
an offence  when the  F.I.R. was recorded and therefore, the
summons issued	by  the	 Enforcement  Directorate  would  be
illegal. At  the same  time, it	 was held  that although the
petitioner is  a 'person  accused of  an offence',  the only
protection that	 <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_363">Article 20(3)</a> gave him is that he could not
be compelled  to be  a witness against himself, but this did
not mean that he need not give information regarding matters
which do  not tend  to incriminate  him.  Consequently,	 the
Court did  not set  aside the  summons	and  held  that	 the
petitioner  was	 bound	to  appear  before  the	 Enforcement
Directorate  and   answer  such	  questions  that   did	 not
incriminate him.
</p><p id="p_88">     To	 sum  up,  only	 a  person  against  whom  a  formal
accusation of the commission of an offence has been made can
be a  person "accused  of an  offence" within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_364">Article 20(3).</a>	Such formal  accusation may  be specifically
made against  him in  an F.I.R. Or a formal complaint or any
other formal document or notice served on that person, which
ordinarily results  in his  prosecution	 in  court.  In	 the
instant case no such formal accusation had been made against
the  appellant	 when  his  statement(s)  in  question	were
recorded by the RPF Officer.
</p><p id="p_89">     At the  relevant time  of making the self-incriminatory
statements in  question, therefore,  the appellant  did	 not
stand in  the character	 of a  person accused  of an offence
and, as	 such, the  protection of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_365">Article 20(3</a>), will not be
available to  him. In  view of this finding, we do not think
it necessary  for the  decision of  these appeals to go into
the question  whether legal  compulsion to  state the  truth
such as	 the one  contained in	<a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_366">Section 9(3)</a> of the 1966 Act
is, also, a compulsion interdicted by <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_367">Article 20(3).</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">205</span>
<p id="p_90">     In the  light of  what has	 been said  above, we  would
answer the legal proposition (formulated as Question No. II)
propounded by  the learned counsel for the appellant, in the
negative.
</p><p id="p_91">     Question No. 3 was not raised or pressed at the time of
arguments in  the courts  below. We, therefore, refuse to go
into this question and pronounce in regard thereto.
</p><p id="p_92">     Before we	part with  this judgment,  we may  note here
that the  learned counsel  for the respondent-State has very
fairly stated  at the  bar, that  the State  shall  have  no
objection to  the supply  of  copies  of  all  the  relevant
documents and statements on which the prosecution intends to
rely, to  the accused-appellants in the trial court. In view
of this undertaking we thought it unnecessary to go into the
legal aspects  of this	question. We  will however, add that
the prosecution	 shall also  permit the accused-appellant to
inspect the  other material  that may have been collected by
the inquiry  officer, relevant	to the	charge	against	 the
accused-appellant. With	 this observation,  we would dismiss
these appeals  (Nos. 208-209 of 1974) and send the case back
to the	trial court  for further  proceedings in  accordance
with law.  Since the  case is  already old,  the proceedings
shall be  conducted as	far as	possible, from day-to-day on
top-priority basis,  and disposed of preferably within three
months of  the date or which the records are received in the
trial court.
</p><p id="p_93">     Since the	legal questions	 raised before us in Special
Leave Petition	(Crl.) No.  630 of  1977 are  the same as in
Criminal Appeals  Nos. 208-209	of  1974,  and	the  learned
counsel	 for   the  petitioners	  therein  has	adopted	 the
arguments of  Shri R.K. Garg, appearing for the appellant in
Criminal Appeals  Nos. 208-209	of 1974,  that Special Leave
Petition, after	 granting special leave to appeal, will also
stand disposed of by this judgment.
</p><p id="p_94">N.V.K.	  Appeals dismissed.
