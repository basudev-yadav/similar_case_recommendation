HEADNOTE:
A notification under sec. 4 of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_9">Land Acquisition Act</a>	 was
issued	on  Nov. 13, 1959, stating that an  area  of  34,070
acres  of  land was needed for a public	 purpose,  viz.	 the
planned development of Delhi.  Between 1959 and 1961,  about
six thousand objections were filed under sec. 5<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_10">A of the Act</a>.
The  objections	 were  overruled.  On March  18,  1966,	 the
declaration under sec. 6 of the Act was published in respect
of a portion of the area.  Therefore, in 1970, notices	were
issued	under sec. 9(1) of the Act requiring the  appellants
to  state  their objections, if any, to	 the  assessment  of
compensation.	The  appellants	 thereupon  challenged	 the
validity  of  proceedings for acquisition  before  the	High
Court of Delhi.	 The High Court negatived their	 contentions
and dismissed the writ petitions.  In the writ petitions and
civil appeals filed in the Supreme Court it was contended  :
(i) The public purpose specified in the notification  issued
under  sec. 4, namely, the planned development of Delhi	 was
vague  as  neither  a Master Plan nor a Zonal  Plan  was  in
existence on the date of the notification and as the purpose
specified in the notification was vague, the appellants	 and
the  petitioners were unable to exercise  effectively  their
right under sec. 5<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_11">A of the Act</a>; (ii) As there was inordinate
delay  in finalizing the acquisition proceedings, they	were
deprived of the benefit of the appreciation in the value  of
the  property between the date of notification under sec.  4
and the date of taking possession of the property. (iii) The
provisions   of	 sec.  23  of  the  Act	 laying	 down	that
compensation  should  be determined with  reference  to	 the
market	value  of the land as an the  date  of	notification
under  sec.  4	was  an	 unreasonable  restriction  on	 the
fundamental  right of the appellants to hold and dispose  of
property under <a href="/doc/1248826/" id="a_12">Article 19(1) (b); (iv)</a> As the acquisition of
the property was for the purpose, of planned development  of
Delhi,	 the   only  authority	competent   to	 issue	 the
notification  under sec. 4 was the Central Govt. under	see.
15  of Delhi Development Act and since the proceedings	were
initiated   by	 the  Chief  Commissioner  of	Delhi,	 the
proceedings were ab initial invalid; and (v) The acquisition
was  not  for any public purpose, but for companies  as	 the
major portion of the land acquired was allotted without	 any
development  to	 co-operative housing societies	 which	were
companies within the definition of the word "company" in the
Act  and as the provisions of part VII of the Act  were	 not
complied with the proceedings for acquisition were bad.
Rejecting the contention and dismissing the appeals and	 the
petitions,
803
HELD  : (i) A valid notification under sec. 4 is a sine	 qua
non  for  initiation  of  proceedings  for  acquisition	  of
property.  It is necessary to specify the particular  public
purpose, in the notification for which the land is needed or
likely	to be needed as otherwise, the matters specified  in
sub-sec. (2) of sec. (4) cannot be carried out. [807C]
Munsh  Singh and Others v. Union of India, [1973]  1  S.C.R.
973 (975 and 984)   relied  on. <a href="/doc/284811/" id="a_13">Arnold Rodricks and  Another
v.  State  of Maharashtra and others</a>, [1966]  3	 S.C.R.	 885
referred to.
In  the	 case  of an acquisition of a  large  area  of	land
comprising several plots belonging to different persons, the
specification of the purpose can only, be with reference  to
the acquisition of the whole area.  Unlike in the case or an
acquisition  of	 a  small  area,  it  might  be	 practically
difficult  to specify the particular purpose for which	each
and  every  item of land comprised in the area	is-  needed.
[807G]
The  appellants	 did not move in the matter even  after	 the
declaration  under  sec.  6 was	 published  in	1966.	They
approached the High Court with their writ petitions only  in
1970 when the notices under sec. 9 were issued, to them That
apart, the appellants did not contend before the High  Court
that as the particulars of public purpose were not specified
in   the-notification  issued  under  sec.  4,	 they	were
prejudiced in that they could not effectively exercise their
right  under  sec. 5A.	As the plea was not raised  by	them
before	the High Court, the appellants are not	entitled  to
have  the plea considered in these appeals.  To have sat  on
the fence and allowed the Govt. to complete the	 acquisition
proceedings  on the basis of the notification under  sec.  4
and  the  declaration under sec. 6 were valid  and  then  to
attack	the notification on grounds which were available  to
the  writ petitioners at the-time when the notification	 was
published  would be putting a premium on  dilatory  tactics.
The writ petitions are liable to be dismissed on the  ground
of laches and delay on the part of the petitioners. [808A-B;
D &amp; F-G]
Tilok.	 Chand	Moti Chand and others v. H.  B.	 Munshi	 and
Another,  [1969]  2  S.C.R. 824 and  <a href="/doc/157601289/" id="a_14">Rabindranath  Bose	 and
Others	v.  Union of India and others</a> [1970]  2	 S.C.R.	 697
referred to.
(ii) About  6,000  objections were filed under	sec.  5A  by
persons interested in the property.  Several writ  petitions
were also filed in 1966 and 1967 challenging the validity of
the  acquisition proceedings.  The Govt. had necessarily  to
wait for the disposal of the objections and petitions before
proceeding further in the matter.  The High Court was of the
view  that there was no inordinate delay on the part of	 the
Govt.  in  completing  the  acquisition	 proceedings.	 The
conclusion of the High Court is correct. [809B-C]
(iii)	  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_15">The  Land  Acquisition Act</a> is	 a  pre-<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_16">Constitution
Act</a>.  its  provisions  are  not,  therefore,  liable  to  be
challenged  on	the ground that they are not  in  conformity
with  the requirement of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_17">Article 31(2)</a> of the  Constitution.
What  the appellants and writ petitioners complain  is	that
their  properties were acquired by paying them	compensation
computed with reference to the. market value of the land  as
on  the date of the notification under sec. 4 and that	sec.
23 is, therefore, bad.	This, in substance is nothing but  a
challenge to the adequacy of compensation.  Such a challenge
is  precluded by reason of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_18">Art. 31(5)</a> of  the  Constitution.
[809F-G]
Although  a  law for acquisition of property must  pass	 the
test  of  <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_19">Article  19(5</a>), the challenge	 to  the  law  would
ordinarily   be	 limited  to  the  question  of	  procedural
unreasonableness. [810B]
R.  C. Cooper v. Union of India [1970] 3 S.C.R.	 530,  (577)
relied on.
It  follows  that  although  sec.  23  of  the	Act  can  be
challenged  on the, ground that it violates the	 fundamental
right  of  a citizen to held and dispose of  property  under
<a href="/doc/1248826/" id="a_20">Article 19(1)(b</a>), the challenge would practically be limited
to  the question of procedural reasonableness.	But sec.  23
does  not deal with procedure and cannot, therefore,  suffer
from any procedural unreasonableness. [810E-F]
804
(iv) The planned development of Delhi had been decided	upon
by  the	 Govt.	before 1959, viz.,  even  before  the  Delhi
Development  Act  came into force.  It is  true	 that  there
could  be no planned development of Delhi except in  accord-
ance with the provisions of Delhi Development Act after that
Act came into force but there was no inhibition in acquiring
land  for planned development of Delhi under the Act  before
the Master Plan was ready. [812E]
Patna  Improvement  Trust v. Sint. Lakshmi Devi	 and  others
[1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 812 referred to.
In  other  words,  the	fact  that  actual  development	  is
permissible  in an area other than a development  area	with
the  approval  or sanction of the local	 authority  did	 not
preclude  the  Central	Govt. from acquiring  the  land	 for
planned development under the Acts.  <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_21">Section 12</a> is concerned
only  with  the planned development.  It has nothing  to  do
with   acquisition  of	property-,   acquisition   generally
precedes  development.	For planned development in  an	area
other  than  a	development area, it is	 only  necessary  to
obtain	the sanction or approval of the local  authority  as
provided in sec. 12(3).	 The Central Govt. could acquire any
property  under the Act and develop it after  Obtaining	 the
approval  of  the  local authority.   As  already  held	 the
appellants  and	 the writ petitioners cannot be	 allowed  to
challenge  the validity of notification under sec. 4 on	 the
ground of laches and acquiescence.  The plea that the  Chief
Commissioner  of  D.-]hi had no authority  to  initiate	 the
proceedings  for  acquisition by  issuing  the	notification
under sec. 4 of the Act as sec. 15 of the Delhi	 Development
Act  gives  that  power only to the  Central  Govt.  relates
primarily  to  the  validity  of  the  notification.	Even
assuming that the Chief Commissioner was not so	 authorized,
since the appellants and the writ petitioners are  precluded
by  their  ]aches  and acquiescence  from  questioning	the,
notification, the plea must be negatived. [812F-H; 813A-B]
(v)  The  plea	that the provisions of Part VII of  the	 Act
have  not been complied witin has also to be rejected.	 The
High  Court  was  correct in giving  the  finding  that	 the
acquisition was not for Company'.  The mere fact that  after
the  acquisition  the Govt. proposed to hand  over,  or,  in
fact,  handed over, a portion of the property  acquired	 for
development  to the cooperative housing societies would	 not
make  the acquisition one for company' and  therefore,	Part
VII of the Act was not attracted, [813C-E]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
MATHEW,	 J.  These writ petitions and  civil  appeals  raise
common	questions and they are, therefore, disposed of by  a
common	judgment.   The	 Civil	Appeals	 arise	out  of	 the
decision  of  High  Court  of  Delhi  dismissing  the	writ
petitions filed by the appellants challenging-the,  validity
of  the proceedings for acquisition of the land in  question
for "planned development of Delhi".  In the writ  petitions,
the validity of the same proceedings is being challenged  on
certain additional grounds also.
</p><p id="p_8">A  notification	 under	s. 4 of	 the  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_23">Land  Acquisition	 Act</a>
(hereinafter referred to as the Act') was issued on November
13,  1950, stating that an area of 34,070 acres of land	 was
needed	for a public purpose, viz., the planned	 development
of  Delhi.   Between  1959  and	 1961,	about  six  thousand
objections  were filed under<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_24"> s. 5A</a> of the Act.	 The  objec-
tions  were civerruled.	 On March 18, 1966, the	 declaration
under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_25"> S. 6</a> of the Act was published in respect of a  portion
of the area.  Thereafter, in 1970, notices were issued under
s. 9(1) of the, Act requiring the appellants to state  their
objections, if any, to the assessment of compensation.	 The
appellants thereupon challenged the validity of	 proceedings
for  acquisition  before  the, High Court of  Delhi  on	 the
following,  grounds : (1) that the acquisition was  not	 for
public	purpose but for companies and so the  provisions  of
Part  VII of the Act ought to have been complied  with,	 (2)
since  no  part of the compensation payable  came  from	 the
public	exchequer,  the	 acquisition was not  for  a  public
purpose	 and  (3)  that	 the  proceedings  for	 acquisition
violated  the  fundamental right of  the,  appellants  under
<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_26">Article 19(1)(f)</a> as there was unreasonable delay between the
publication of the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_27"> s. 4</a> and the issue  of
the  notices under<a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_28"> s. 9</a> of the Act with the result that	 the
appellants were deprived of the benefit of the	appreciation
in value of the property after the date of the	notification
under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_29"> s.  4</a>. The High Court negatived the  contentions	 and
dismissed the writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_9">The  main  arguments addressed before us on  behalf  of	 the
appellants  and	 the writ petitioners were that	 the  public
purpose	 specified  in the notification issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_30"> s.  4</a>,
namely,	 the  planned  development of Delhi'  was  vague  as
neither	 a Master Plan nor a Zonal Plan was in existence  on
the date of the notification and as the purpose specified
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">806</span>
in  die, notification was vague, the appellants were  unable
to  exercise effectively their right under<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_31"> s. 5A</a> of the	 Act
and  that  as the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_32"> s. 4</a> was  published  in
1959,  the compensation awarded was wholly  inadequate	with
reference  to the market value of the property on  the	date
when  the appellants are to be deprived of their  possession
of the property.  In other words the contention was that  as
there  was  inordinate delay in finalizing  the	 acquisition
proceedings, the appellants were deprived of the benefit  of
the  appreciation in the value of the property between	the,
date  of the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_33"> s. 4</a> and the date of  taking
possession of the property.  Linked with this contention was
the submission that the previsions of<a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_34"> s. 23</a> of the Act which
lay  down  that	 compensation  should  be  determined	with
reference to the market value of the land as on the date  of
the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_35"> s. 4</a> was an unreasonable	 restriction
on  the	 fundamental  right of the appellants  to  hold	 and
dispose of property under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_36">Article 19(1) (f).</a>  It was further
contended  that as the acquisition of the property  was	 for
the  purpose  of  planned development  of  Delhi,  the	only
authority competent to issue the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_37"> s. 4</a> was
the Central Government under s. 15 of the Delhi	 Development
Act  and since the proceedings were initiated by  the  Chief
Commissioner  of  Delhi,  the  proceedings  were  ab  initio
invalid.  The argument was that, as the acquisition was made
for  the planned development of Delhi, it could	 be  carried
out'  only  in accordance with the provisions of  the  Delhi
Development  Act, and that, under<a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_38"> s. 15</a> of that Act, it	 was
only  the  Central Government which could  have	 issued	 the
notification  under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_39"> s. 4</a>, after having formed	the  opinion
that  the  acquisition	of the land was	 necessary  for	 the
planned development of Delhi and, since the notification was
issued by the Chief Commissioner of Delhi, the	notification
was  void  ab  initio.	The last  contention  was  that	 the
acquisition  was  not  for  any	 public	 purpose,  but	 for
companies,  as	the major portion of the,land  acquired	 was
allotted  without  any development  to	cooperative  housing
societies which were companies within the definition of	 the
word  Company' in the Act and as the provisions of Part	 VII
of  the	 Act  were not complied with,  the  proceedings	 for
acquisition were bad.
</p><p id="p_10">The  influx of displaced persons in 1947 from West  Pakistan
into  Delhi aggravated the problem of housing  accommodation
in  Delhi.  With the extension of industrial and  commercial
activities  and	 the setting up of  the	 foreign  embassies,
Delhi  acquired enormous potential as an employment  centre.
The   consequent   increase  in	 the  population   was	 not
accompanied by an adequate expansion of lousing	 facilities.
There  was  haphazard  and unplanned  growth  of  houses  in
different  areas; land also was not available at  reasonable
price as substantial portion of the available land, suitable
for  development,  had	passed into  the  hands	 of  private
enterprises.   The  Government found it	 necessary  to	take
effective steps to check the haphazard growth of houses	 and
to   prevent  substandard  construction.    Therefore,	 the
Government  framed  a  scheme for  "planned  development  of
Delhi".	 It was in order to implement the scheme of  planned
development of Delhi that the Government decided to  acquire
34,070 acres of land in 1959 and published the	notification
under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_40"> s.  4</a> specifying the public purpose as  "the  planned
development of Delhi".
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">807</span>
<p id="p_11"><a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_41">Section	 4</a> of the Act says that whenever it appears  to	 the
appropriate  Government that land in any locality is  needed
or.  is	 likely	 to  be needed for  any	 public	 purpose,  a
notification  to  that	effect shall  be  published  in	 the
official Gazette and the Collector shall cause public notice
of  the	 substance  of	such notification  to  be  given  at
convenient  places in the said locality.  According  to	 the
section,  therefore,  it is only necessary to state  in	 the
notification  that the land is needed for a public  purpose.
The  wording of<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_42"> s. 5A</a> would make it further clear  that	 all
that is necessary to be specified in a notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_43"> s.
4</a>  is  that the land is needed for a  public  purpose.	 One
reason for specification of the particular public purpose in
the,  notification  is to enable the person  whose  land  is
sought to be acquired to file objection under<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_44"> s. 5A</a>.  Unless
a person is told about the specific purpose of the  acquisi-
tion  it  may not be possible for him to file  a  meaningful
objection  against the acquisition under<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_45"> s. 5A</a>.	 This  Court
has laid down that it is necessary to specify the particular
public	purpose	 in the notification for which the  land  is
needed	or  likely to be needed as, otherwise,	the  matters
specified in sub-section (2) of<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_46"> s. 4</a> cannot be carried	out.
in  <a href="/doc/1564044/" id="a_47">Munshi Singh and Others v. Union of India</a>,	etc.(1)	 the
Court said
	      "It  is apparent from sub-section (2) of<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_48"> s.  4</a>
	      that the public purpose which has to be stated
	      in   sub-section	(1)  of	<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_49"> s.  4</a>	has  to	  be
	      particularized  because, unless that is  done,
	      the  various matters which were  mentioned  in
	      sub-section  (2) cannot be carried out and  if
	      the  public  purpose  stated  in	s.  4(1)  is
	      planned development, without anything more, it
	      is  extremely difficult to comprehend how	 all
	      the matters set out in sub-section (2) can  be
	      carried out by the officer concerned."
</p><p id="p_12">We think that the question whether the purpose specified  in
a  notification	 under	s.  4 is  sufficient  to  enable  an
objection to be filed under<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_50"> s.	   5A</a> would depend upon	 the
facts and circumstances of each case.
</p><p id="p_13"><a href="/doc/284811/" id="a_51">In  Arnold Rodricks and Another v. State of Maharashtra	 and
Others</a>(2), this Court held that a notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_52"> s. 4</a> of
the   Act  which  stated  that	the  land  was	needed	 for
"Development  and  utilization	of  the	 said  lands  as  an

specification of public purpose.
</p><p id="p_14">In  the	 case  of an acquisition of a  large  area  of	land
comprising several plots belonging to different persons, the
specification  of the purpose can only be with reference  to
the acquisition of the whole area.  Unlike in the case of an
acquisition  of	 a  small  area,  it  might  be	 practically
difficult to specify the particular public purpose for which
each and every item of land comprised in the area is needed.
 Assuming  for	the moment that the public purpose  was	 not
sufficiently   specified  in  the  notification,   did	 the
appellants  make a grievance of it at the appropriate  time?

<p id="p_16">plots in which they were interested were needed, they should
have  taken steps to have the notification quashed  on	that
ground	within a reasonable time.  They did not move in	 the
matter even after the declaration under r 6 was published in
1966.	They  approached  the High  Court  with	 their	writ
petitions  only	 in 1970 when the notices under	<a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_53"> s.  9</a>	were
issued	to them.  In the concluding portion of the  judgment
in  <a href="/doc/1564044/" id="a_54">Munshi Singh &amp; Others v. Union of India</a> (supra), it	 was
observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "In matters of this nature we would have taken
	      due  notice  of  laches on  the  part  of	 the
	      appellants while granting the above relief but
	      we  are satisfied that so far as	the  present
	      appellants  are concerned they have  not	been
	      guilty  of laches, delay or  acquiescence,  at
	      any stage."
</blockquote><p id="p_17">We do not think that the appellants were vigilant.
That  apart, the appellants did not contend before the	High
Court that as the particulars of the public purpose were not
specified  in the notification issued under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_55"> s. 4</a>, they	were
prejudiced in that they could not effectively exercise their
right  under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_56"> s.  5A</a>.  As the plea was	not  raised  by	 the
appellants  in	the  writ petitions filed  before  the	High
Court,	we do not think that the appellants are entitled  to
have the plea considered in these appeals.
Nor  do we think that the petitioners in the writ  petitions
should	be  allowed  to raise this plea	 in  view  of  their
conduct in not challenging the validity of the, notification
even after the publication of the declaration under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_57"> s. 6</a>  in
1966.  Of the two writ petitions, one is filed by one of the
appellants.   There  was apparently no reason why  the	writ
petitioners  should  have waited till 1972 to come  to	this
Court  for  challenging	 the validity  of  the	notification
issued	in 1959 on the ground that the particulars  of	the,
public	purpose	 were not specified.  A	 valid	notification
under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_58"> s. 4</a> is a sine qua non for initiation of	 proceedings
for  acquisition of property.  To have sat on the fence	 and
allowed	  the  Government  to  complete	  the,	 acquisition
proceedings  on the basis that the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_59"> s.  4</a>
and the declaration under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_60"> s. 6</a> were valid and then to attack
the notification on grounds which were available to them  at
the  time  when	 the notification was  published  would	 be,
putting	 a premium on dilatory tactics.	 The writ  petitions
are liable to be dismissed on the ground of laches and delay
on the part of the petitioners (see <a href="/doc/623976/" id="a_61">Tilokchand Motichand and
Others v. H. B. Munshi</a> and Another(1); and <a href="/doc/157601289/" id="a_62">Rabindranath Bose
and Others v. Union of India &amp; Others</a>(2).
</p><p id="p_18">From   the  counter  affidavit	filed  on  behalf   of	 the
Government, it is clear that the Government have allotted  a
large portion of the land after the acquisition	 proceedings
were  finalised to Cooperative lousing societies.  To  quash
the  notification at this stage would disturb the rights  of
third parties who are not before the Court.

<p id="p_19">As regards the second contention that there, was  inordinate
delay  in finalizing the acquisition proceedings,  and	that
the  appellants	 and writ petitioners were deprived  of	 the
appreciation  in  value	 of  the land  in  which  they	were
interested,  it	 may be, noted that about  6,000  objections
were  filed  under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_63"> s.	5A</a>  by	persons	 interested  in	 the
property.   Several writ petitions were also filed  in	1966
and  1967  challenging	the  validity  of  the	 acquisition
proceedings.  The Government had necessarily to wait for the
disposal  of the objections and petitions before  proceeding
further	 in  the matter.  Both the learned Single  Judge  as
well  as  the Division Bench of the High Court were  of	 the
view  that there was no inordinate delay on the part of	 the
Government  in completing the acquisition  proceedings.	  We
are not persuaded to come to a different conclusion.
Linked	with the above contention was the argument that	 the
provisions  of	s.  23	of  the	 Act  imposes	unreasonable
restrictions  upon the fundamental right of  the  appellants
and  writ petitioners to hold and dispose of property  under
<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_64">Article	 19(1)(f)</a>  of the, Constitution as  compensation  is
awardable  only with reference to the value of the  property
on the date of notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_65"> s. 4</a> however long the pro-
ceedings for acquisition may drag on and not with  reference
to the market value of property when it is taken  possession
of.  It was submitted that compensation should be paid	with
reference  to the value of the property as on the date	when
possession of the, property is taken and the section', as it
lays  down that compensation should be fixed with  reference
to the market value as on the date of the notification under
s.  4,	abridges the fundamental right of  a  citizen  under
<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_66">Article	 19  (1)  (f).</a>	We find- that the  argument  is	 not
persuasive.  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_67">Article 31(5) (a)</a> provides :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "(5) Nothing in clause (2) shall affect--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      (a)   the provisions of any existing law other
	      than  a law to which the provisions of  clause
	      (6) apply,"
</blockquote><p id="p_20">The,  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_68">Land Acquisition Act</a> is a pre-<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_69">Constitution  Act</a>.	 Its

the  ground  that  they	 are  not  in  conformity  with	 the
requirement of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_70">article 31(2).</a>  What the appellants and	writ
petitioners complain is, that their properties were acquired
by  paying them compensation computed with reference to	 the
market value of the land as on the date of the	notification
under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_71"> s.  4</a> and that<a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_72"> s. 23</a> is, therefore,  bad.   This,  in
substance,  is	nothing but a challenge to the	adequacy  of
compensation.	Such a challenge is precluded by  reason  of
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_73">Article 31(5).</a>	In other words, the appellants and the	writ
petitioners  cannot challenge the validity of<a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_74"> s. 23</a>  on	 the
ground that compensation payable under its provisions is  in
any  way inadequate, because, such a challenge would fly  in
the face of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_75">Article 31(5).</a>
</p><p id="p_21">It  is	noteworthy  that<a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_76"> s. 4(3)</a>  of  the  Land	 Acquisition
Amendment  and <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_77">Validation Act</a>, 1957 provides for payment  of
interest at 6 per cent of the market value after the  expiry
of  3 years from the date of the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_78"> s. 4</a>  to
the date of payment of compensation.  <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_79">Section 24</a> of the	 Act
provides that any outlay or improvements on,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">810</span>
or  disposal  of  the  land  acquired,	commenced,  made  or
effected  without  the sanction of the Collector  after	 the
date  of the publication of the notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_80"> s.	4(1)</a>
shall  not  be	taken into consideration  by  the  Court  in
awarding compensation.	This provision means that any outlay
or improvement made with the sanction of the Collector after
the   date   of	 the  notification  will   be	taken	into
consideration in awarding compensation.
In  R.	C.  Cooper  v. Union of	 India(1),  this  Court	 has
observed  that	although a law for acquisition	of  property
must  pass the test of <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_81">Article 19(5</a>), the challenge  to	 the
law   would  ordinarily	 be  limited  to  the  question	  of
procedural unreasonableness.  This is what the Court said
	      ".  . . Where the law provides for  compulsory
	      acquisition of property for a public  purpose,
	      it may be presumed that the acquisition or the
	      law  relating  thereto  imposes  a  reasonable
	      restriction  in  the interest of	the  general
	      public.	If  there is no	 public	 purpose  to
	      sustain	compulsory  acquisition,   the	 law
	      violates	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_82">Art. 31(2).</a>  If the  acquisition  is
	      for    a	  public    purpose,	 substantive
	      reasonableness   of  the	 restriction   which
	      includes	deprivation  may,  unless  otherwise
	      established,  be	presumed, but  enquiry	into
	      reasonableness  of the  procedural  provisions
	      will  not	 be excluded.  For  instance,  if  a
	      tribunal is authorised by an Act to  determine
	      compensation    for   property	compulsorily
	      acquired,	 without  hearing the owner  of	 the
	      property, the Act would be liable to be struck
	      down under Art. 19(1)(f)."
</p><p id="p_22">It follows that although<a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_83"> S. 23</a> of the Act can be  challenged
on  the ground that it violates the fundamental right  of  a
citizen to hold and dispose of property under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_84">Article 19  (1
)  (f</a>),	 the challenge would practically be limited  to	 the
question of procedural reasonableness.	But <a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_85">section 23</a>	does
not  deal with procedure and cannot, therefore, suffer	from
any procedural unreasonableness.  When it is seen that<a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_86"> S. 23</a>
is  not	 liable	 to be challenged on  the  ground  that	 the
compensation  provided	by its provisions is  inadequate  in
view  of the provisions of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_87">Art. 31(5</a>), there is no point  in
the  contention	 that  it can be challenged  for  that	very
reason on the basis that it imposes unreasonable restriction
upon a citizen's right to hold and dispose of- property.
It was argued that there could be no planned development  of
Delhi  otherwise than in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Delhi Development Act and, therefore, the	notification
under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_88"> S. 4</a> of the Act should have been issued by the Central
Government in view of <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_89"> S.     15</a> of that Act and not by	 the

</p><p id="p_32">Counsel	 contended  that on the date when  the	notification
under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_92"> s. 4</a> was published, the Government had  not  declared
any  area in Delhi is a development area under s.  12(1)  of
the Delhi Development Act, nor was there a master plan drawn
up  in	accordance  with <a href="/doc/1789527/" id="a_93"> s.  7</a>	 of  that  Act	and  so	 the
acquisition of the property for planned development of Delhi
was  illegal.  Under s. 12(3) of the Delhi Development	Act,
no  development	 of land can be undertaken  or	carried	 out
except	as provided in that clause.  <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_94">Section 2(d)</a>  states  :
"development".	with  its grammatical variations  means	 the
carrying  out  of  building, engineering,  mining  or  other
operations in, on, over or under land or' the making of	 any
material  change  in  any  building  or	 land  includes	 re-
development.  <a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_95">Section 2(e)</a> states "development area"'  means
any area declared to be a development area under sub-section
(1) of<a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_96"> s. 12</a>.
</p><p id="p_33">The  planned development of Delhi had been decided  upon  by
the  Government	 before 1959, viz., even  before  the  Delhi
Development  Act  came into force.  It is  true	 that  there
could	be  no	planned	 development  of  Delhi	 except	  in
accordance  with  the provisions of  Delhi  Development	 Act
after that Act came into force, but there was no  inhibition
in acquiring land for planned development of Delhi under the
Act  before the Master Plan was ready (see the	decision  in
<a href="/doc/1155640/" id="a_97">Patna Improvement Trust v. Smt.	 Lakshmi Devi and Others</a>(1).
In  other  words,  the	fact  that  actual  development	  is
permissible  in an area other than a development  area	with
the  approval  or sanction of the local	 authority  did	 not
preclude the Central Government from acquiring the land	 for
planned development under the Act.  <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_98">Section 12</a> is  concerned
only  with  the planned development.  It has nothing  to  do
with acquisition of property; acquisition generally precedes
development.  For planned development in an area other	than
a  development	area  it is only  necessary  to	 obtain	 the
sanction  or approval of the local authority as provided  in
S. 12(3).  The Central Government could acquire any property
under the Act and develop it after obtaining the approval of
the  local  authority.	We do not think it necessary  to  go
into  the  question whether the power to  acquire  the	land
under <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_99"> s. 15</a> was delegated by the Central Government to	 the
Chief Commissioner of Delhi.  We have already held that	 the
appellants  and	 the writ petitioners cannot be	 allowed  to
challenge the validity of the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_100"> s. 4</a> on the
ground of laches and acquiescence.  The plea that the  Chief
Commissioner of Delhi had no authority to initiate the
(1)  [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 812.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">813</span>
<p id="p_34">proceeding for acquisition by issuing the notification under
s. 4 of the Act as s. 15 of the Delhi Development Act  gives
that-power only to the Central Government relates  primarily
to the validity of the notification.  Even assuming that the
Chief  Commissioner  of	 Delhi was  not	 authorized  by	 the
Central	 Government to issue the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_101"> s. 4</a>  of
the Land Acquisition Act, since the appellants and the	writ
petitioners  are precluded by their laches and	acquiescence
from  questioning the notification, the contention must,  in
any event, be negatived and we do so.
</p><p id="p_35">It  was	 contended by Dr. Singhvi that the  acquisition	 was
really	for  the  cooperative housing  societies  which	 are
companies  within the definition of the word company' in <a href="/doc/107797531/" id="a_102"> s.
3(e)</a> of the Act, and, therefore, the provisions of Part	 VII
of the Act should have been complied with.  Both the learned
Single	Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court	were
of  the view that the acquisition was not for  company.	  We
see no reason to differ from their view.  The mere fact that
after the acquisition the Government proposed to hand  over,
or, in fact, handed over, a portion of the property acquired
for  development to the cooperative housing societies  would
not  make  the	acquisition one for company'.	Nor  are  we
satisfied  that	 there is any merit in the  contention	that
compensation  to be paid for the acquisition came  from	 the
consideration  paid  by the cooperative societies.   In	 the
light of the averments in the counter affidavit filed in the
writ  petitions	 here, it is difficult to hold that  it	 was
cooperatives  which provided the fund for  the	acquisition.
Merely	because	 the  Government  allotted  a  part  of	 the
property to cooperative societies for development, it  would
not   follow  that  the	 acquisition  was  for	 cooperative
societies, and therefore, Part VII of the Act was attracted.
It may be noted that the validity of the notification  under
s. 4 and the declaration under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_103"> s. 6</a> was in issue in <a href="/doc/270610/" id="a_104">Udai Ram
