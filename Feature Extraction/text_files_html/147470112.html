 VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    The present appeal arises from the order dated 21.5.2008

(impugned order) whereby the learned Single Judge has dismissed the

application of the plaintiff for injunction and by which application the

plaintiff had prayed for an injunction restraining the defendant from

using the trademark "Golden Deer", which was said to be deceptively

similar to „Double Deer‟, the registered trademark of the plaintiff. The

plaintiff is the appellant and the defendant is the respondent before us.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                            Page 1 of 16</span>
</p><p id="p_2"> 2.    As already stated above, the appellant‟s registered trademark is

"Double Deer" with respect to the product rice and which is also the

product for which the respondent is using the offending trade mark.

The suit therefore seeks the reliefs of injunction and rendition of

accounts.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    The operative portion of the order of the learned Single Judge is

contained in paras 4 and 5 of the impugned order and these read as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "4. A perusal of the documents filed by the plaintiff
            would show that the trademark of the plaintiff
            consists of a figure of two deers facing each other
            with a flag in between. The figures and flat are
            enclosed in a white colour semi circle. The base of
            the packing is yellow and prominent colour of the
            trademark is red with cooked/uncooked rice shown on
            the pack.        The trademark being used by the
            defendant is one single deer enclosed in a standing
            oval shape ring. There is peripheral rim in the ring
            which is having holes at regular intervals. On both
            sides of the ring are spikelets. The word „Golden
            deer‟ is written on the top. Neither the artistic design
            nor the words nor the colour combination has
            anything common with the design of the plaintiff‟s
            trademark. The figure of deer is also altogether
            different from that of the plaintiff. While the two deers
            in the plaintiff‟s trademark are males with antlers, the
            deer of defendant is a female only having ears and no
            antlers. The deers in the plaintiff‟s trademark are
            running deers with both front feet bent and rear feet
            stretched in running condition, the deer in the
            defendant‟s trademark is a standing deer with one
            front feet a little raised and bent. The contention of
            the plaintiff that the defendant‟s trademark is
            deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff is on the
            face of it a false and wrong contention. Neither the
            trademark of the plaintiff was being infringed by
            defendant. The plaintiff has no prima facie case to
            contend that the defendant was passing off the goods
            as that of the plaintiff. There is no similarity between

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                              Page 2 of 16</span>
             the label of plaintiff and that of the defendant. The
            learned counsel for plaintiff vehemently argued that
            the defendant had no right to use the word „golden
            deer‟ since the plaintiff was using the word „double
            deer‟. He submitted that the rice may be purchased
            by the illiterate persons and they purchase the same
            only looking at the figure of deer and they would not
            go into the nicety of the fact whether there were two
            deers or one deer and, therefore, use of the word
            „deer‟ by the defendant amounted to infringement of
            the plaintiff‟s trademark.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            5.      The test to be applied as if the defendant was
            passing off his goods as those of the plaintiff. It is not
            the case of the plaintiff that goods of the plaintiff
            were known by the name of „deer‟ or by the mark
            deer alone. It is the plaintiff‟s own case that its goods
            are known by mark of „double deer‟and two stags
            with antlers were shown on the mark facing each
            other, across a flag. The goods bearing the mark of
            two deers with antlers cannot be confused by the
            goods having mark of one deer, which is altogether
            different from that mark of plaintiff. The devise used
            by the plaintiff along with double deer is materially
            different from one used by the defendant along with
            golden deer. There is no likelihood or customers‟
            confusing one deer with two deers and golden deer
            with double deers, even if the customer is illiterate.
            There is no similarity between the defendant‟s label
            and that of plaintiff‟s name. Neither there is visual
            similarity between defendant‟s name and the
            plaintiff‟s name.     Any customer of plaintiff‟s rice
            would certainly ask for double deer and would not ask
            for golden deer. Even an illiterate person who can
            see if there are two deers on the label or there is only
            one deer on the label. It is not the case of the
            plaintiff that defendant has tried to present its device
            in such a manner so as to look similar or deceptively
            similar with the devise of the plaintiff. Neither the
            plaintiff has placed on record any material to show
            that the defendant has attempted to pass off its
            goods as those of the plaintiff‟s. Even the areas of
            business of plaintiff and defendant are different."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_4">4.    A reference to the above said two paras shows that the learned

Single Judge has held that on account of various facts there is no

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                               Page 3 of 16</span>
 deceptive similarity or chance of confusion.       Some of these facts

distinguishing the two marks are that there is a single deer in the

trademark of the respondent whereas there are two deers in the

trademark of the appellant, the figure of the deer is different, the

appellant‟s deers are males with antlers while the respondent‟s deer is

a female having only ears and no antlers, the appellant‟s deers are

running deers with both front feet bent and rear feet stretched but the

deer in the respondent‟s trademark is a standing deer with one front

feet a little raised and bent and so on. The learned Single Judge has

arrived at a conclusion that there is no chance of confusion because

the appellant‟s goods were not known by the name of „deer‟ alone.

The learned Single Judge held that the labels and the devices of the

two trademarks are different and the same are not therefore resulting

in confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.    In our opinion, the learned Single Judge has fallen into an error in

declining the grant of interim injunction to the appellant.            The

overriding aspect in a case such as the present is that deer is a

prominent part of the trademark of the appellant.          Copying of a

prominent part of a trademark leads to deceptive similarity especially

when the product of both the parties is the same.        The expression

"Deer" was arbitrarily adopted by the appellant with respect to its

product being rice. A deer has no connection or co-relation with the

product namely rice.    Such arbitrary adoption of a word mark with

respect to a product with which it has no co-relation, is entitled to a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                             Page 4 of 16</span>
 very high degree of protection, more so, as the appellant‟s trademark

is a registered trademark. The use by the respondent of its trademark

is admittedly subsequent to that of the appellant. The first registration

of the appellant is of the year 1985 and then of 1990. The respondent

claims the first user only from the year 1999, and, as the later

discussion will show, that is also not a correct fact because the user of

the respondent is prima facie only from around the year 2003.

</p><p id="p_6">6.    That copying of a prominent part of a trademark of a person is

prohibited, more so, when the same is a registered trademark, is clear

from the following observations of a judgment of a Division Bench of

this court in the case reported as Goenka Institute of Education

and Research Vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka AIR 2009 Del. 139.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           "17. The question which follows now is that whether
           „Goenka‟ being only a part of the trade mark/trade
           name „G.D. Goenka Public School‟ whether even such
           part of larger trademark is entitled to protection. Putting
           it differently, if there is prior use of a larger trade mark
           will there be a prior use also for a part of the trade
           mark?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           18.    The law in this regard is stated in para 34 to 39
           of the impugned judgment. Some of the paras are
           reproduced below:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">               34. A trade mark is infringed if a person other than
               the registered proprietor or authorized user uses, in
               relation to goods covered by the registration, one or
               more of the trade mark‟s essential particulars. The
               identification of an essential feature depends partly
               upon the Court‟s own judgment and partly upon the
               burden of the evidence that is placed before the
               Court.</blockquote>

               took the same view."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">               36. In the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_2">Ruston
               and Hornby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engineering Co</a>.,
               MANU/SC/0304/1969. The High Court, in appeal, held
               that the offending trade mark infringed the
               appellant‟s trade mark "Ruston", and restrained the
               respondent from using the trade mark "Rustam", but
               further held that the use of the words "Rustam India"
               was not an infringement of the registered trade
               mark, as the appellant‟s goods were manufactured in
               England and not in India and the suffix of the word
               "India" constituted a sufficient distinguishing factor.
               The Supreme Court, white upholding the first part of
               the High Court Judgment and reversing the second
               part, held that an infringement of a registered trade
               mark takes place not merely by exact imitation but
               by the use of a mark so nearly resembling the
               registered mark as to be likely to deceive.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">               39. As observed by the Privy Council in De
               Cordova and others Vs. Vick Chemical
               Company, 68 R.P.C. 103, 106 it was held as
               under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                    "it has long been accepted that, if a word
               forming part of a mark has come in trade to be used
               to identify the goods of the owner of the mark, it is
               an infringement of the mark itself to use that word as
               the mark on part of the mark of another trader, for
               confusion is likely to result.".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">           19.    Therefore, subject to facts and circumstances of
           each individual case, no one can copy an essential part
           or predominant part of a trade mark and the benefit of
           prior use doctrine will also be available to an
           essential/prominent/predominant part of trade mark i.e.
           an important part of a trade mark of another person,
           but, that is however not the end of the matter. When
           two marks are identical nothing further needs to be
           seen in the cases of infringement, but if the marks are

            not identical but only deceptively similar, then, the tests
           of passing off are to be applied to see if user of a trade
           mark by a person other than the registered proprietor
           infringes the trade mark of the registered proprietor i.e.
           if after adopting an essential feature of a trade mark of
           a registered proprietor by another person, in the
           peculiar facts of that case, it is to be seen whether
           there is deceptive similarity by applying the tests of
           passing off, and in case there is no passing off of the
           trade mark, then it cannot be said that there is
           infringement. ..............."       (Emphasis added)



</blockquote><p id="p_7">7.    In fact, this case is more or less identical to the facts of the case

reported as Amar Singh Chawal Wala Vs. Shree Vardhman Rice

and Genl. Mills, 2009 (40) PTC 417 (Del.) (DB).              In the case of

Amar Singh Chawal Wala (supra) the registered trademarks were

„Golden Qilla‟ and „Lal Qilla‟. The trademark which was sought to be

injuncted against was „Hara Qilla‟. The product in question in the said

case was also rice. It is in these facts that the Division Bench of this

court held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                "15.     The submissions of the parties have been
                considered. It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff has
                in its favour registration of the four marks and
                devices as noticed hereinbefore. The suit filed by
                the Plaintiff is essentially one for infringement in
                respect of the Plaintiff‟s trade mark on the ground
                that the use by the Defendants of the mark and
                device HARA QILLA and QILLA respectively would
                cause confusion and deception among the users
                and the trade in general. The distinction between a
                suit based on infringement and that based on
                passing off was explained by the Supreme Court in
                Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories AIR
                1965 SC 980. It was explained that "while action
                for passing off is a common law remedy being in
                substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing
                off by a person of his own goods as those of

                 another, that is not the gist of an action for
                infringement. The action for infringement is a
                statutory remedy conferred on the registered
                proprietor of a registered trade mark for the
                vindication of the „exclusive right to the use of the
                trade mark in relation to those goods.‟ The use by
                the Defendant of the trade mark of the Plaintiff is
                not essential in an action for passing off, but is the
                sine qua non in the case of an action for
                infringement." It was further noticed that "where
                the evidence in respect of passing off consists
                merely of the colourable use of a registered trade
                mark, the essential features of both the actions
                might coincide, in an action for infringement, the
                Plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the
                defendant's mark is so close either visually,
                phonetically or otherwise and the Court should
                reach the conclusion that there is an imitation" in
                which event it would be established that the
                Plaintiff‟s rights are violated. The Supreme Court
                went on to further explain that "if the essential
                features of a trade mark of the Plaintiff have
                been adopted by the defendant, the fact that
                the get up, packing and other writing or
                marks on the goods or on the packets in
                which he offers his goods for sales show
                marked differences, or indicate clearly a
                trade origin different from that of the
                registered proprietor of the mark would be
                immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off,
                the defendant may escape liability if he can show
                that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish
                his goods from those of the Plaintiff." (emphasis

                "the overall similarity between the two names in
                respect of the same description of the goods would
                likely to cause confusion within the meaning of

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">                17. In the instant case as far as the registered
                marks in favour of the Plaintiff are concerned,
                applying the test laid down in Kaviraj Pandit it is
                seen that the essential feature of the mark is the
                word „QILLA‟. Whether the word is spelt as QILLA
                or KILLA, or even written in a different style or
                colour combination. To the customer who seeks to
                purchase the QILLA brand rice both names would
                sound phonetically similar. The customer is likely
                to ask the retailer: "Can I have the QILLA brand
                rice?" In the considered view of this Court, it is this
                essential feature of the Plaintiff‟s mark, i.e the
                word QILLA, which has been adopted by the
                Defendant No.1. That the defendants have also
                used a pictorial representation of the device in the
                form of a fort also indicates that the Defendants
                too intended the same meaning to be assigned to
                the word, which is an Urdu one meaning "fort".
                Therefore, though the device QILLA is depicted in a
                slightly different way by the defendant, it is
                deceptively similar to the device used by the
                Plaintiff. Further the use is in respect of the same
                commodity, rice. Therefore there is every
                possibility f there being a confusion created in the
                mind of the purchaser of rice that the product
                being sold by the Defendant is in fact a product
                that has emanated from or has been manufactured
                by the Plaintiff.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                18. It is not possible to agree with the reasoning of
                the learned Single Judge that the word QILLA is not
                associated with rice and therefore no ordinary
                purchaser of rice would associate the Defendant‟s
                mark as that of the Plaintiff‟s. It is plain from the
                pleadings that the Plaintiff has been using the
                words QILLA consistently in connection with the
                rice being sold by them with only the first word
                indicating the colour viz., GOLDEN, LAL or NEELA. It

                 must be held that the Plaintiff has been able to
                prima facie show that it has developed a „family of
                marks‟ and that by merely changing the first word
                from GOLDEN, LAL or NEELA to the word HARA
                there is every possibility of confusion being caused
                both in trade and in the mind of any person
                desiring to purchase rice. Likewise the use of the
                picture or depiction of a fort in the background on
                the label/packing of the rice is also likely to cause
                confusion in the mind of the purchaser and in the
                trade that the product being sold by the
                Defendants are in fact those manufactured by the
                Plaintiff.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                19. This Court proposes to next consider the plea
                of the Plaintiff that use by the Defendants of the
                said marks was not in fact an honest one since the
                Defendant did not indicate how it came across the
                word/device associated with its product rice. It
                must be remembered that the Plaintiff has been in
                trade since 1962 onwards and it has been
                marketing its rice by using the words and device of
                QILLA. These words, as rightly pointed out by the
                learned Single Judge, do not automatically get
                associated with a consumable food product like
                rice. For the Defendants to have chance upon the
                same word i.e. QILLA and the same device in terms
                of depiction of a fort would have to be supported
                by its showing how it got inspired to use those
                words. It is not possible therefore to accept the
                plea of the Defendants that in the instant case,
                there was an honest concurrent use. The legal
                position was succinctly explained by the House of
                Lords in Alex Pirie &amp; Sons' Application (1933)
                50 R.P.C. 147 where it was held as under:
                "Secondly, the appellants say, and this is their
                main line of attack upon the conclusion of the
                Court of Appeal, that though the respondents were
                honest in their user in the sense that they never
                intended to cause confusion or to pass off their
                goods as the goods of the appellants, yet inasmuch
                as they knew of the appellants‟ mark when they
                adopted their own and that the marks have been
                used on the same goods in the same market, the
                user of the respondents‟ mark cannot be treated
                as honest within the meaning of the section and
                that in any case by refusal of registration there

                 would not in these circumstances be the hardship
                to the respondents which the section is intended to
                prevent.

                this case that the conduct of the respondents has
                in the slightest respect been open to criticism, and
                I should be sorry to place upon this statute a
                construction which would brand as statutory
                dishonesty conduct justified in the eyes of
                honourable men. There is in fact no ground for
                doing so. Knowledge of the registration of the
                opponent‟s mark may be an important factor
                where the honesty of the user of the mark sought
                to be registered as impugned, but when once the
                honesty of the user has been established the fact
                of knowledge loses much of its significance, though
                it may be a matter not to be wholly overlooked in
                balancing the considerations for and against
                registration."                  (Emphasis added)

</blockquote><p id="p_8">8.    The aforesaid ratio of the Division Bench in the case of Amar

Singh Chawal Wala (supra) squarely applies to the facts of the

present case because the expression "Deer" is arbitrarily adopted with

respect to the product rice and „deer‟ is a prominent part of the

trademark "Double Deer" of the appellant, similar to the prominent

word mark Qilla in the case of Amar Singh Chawal Wala (supra).

The respondent has also failed to give any satisfactory explanation as

to why it adopted the expression " Deer" when there already existed a

registered trademark "Double Deer" of the appellant.

</p><p id="p_9">9.    Before us, the learned counsel for the respondent laid stress on

three aspects; (i) that there is no deceptive similarity between the two

trademarks ; (ii) that the claim of injunction is barred by delay and

laches inasmuch as the respondent has been using the mark since

1999; (iii) there are other users of the trademark "Deer" including for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                             Page 11 of 16</span>
 that of rice and therefore the word mark "Deer" is common to the

trade.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.   The aspect of deceptive similarity we have already discussed

above and held in favour of the appellant.      In support of his second

contention pertaining to delay/latches, learned counsel referred to

some stray bills from 1999 till the year 2003 and more specifically

relied upon a typed chart showing the alleged sale figures of the

respondent with respect to the mark "Golden Deer" that the sales were

in the region of 3 to 5 crores.    In our opinion, the documents relied

upon by the respondent do not inspire confidence.         Merely because

some documents are filed by a party, the court is not bound to believe

them. A court must apply its mind to such documents to ensure that

there is reasonable credibility and genuineness in the same so that the

same can be relied upon to weigh the respective strength of the cases

of the parties, otherwise, any and every document not having

genuineness/credibility will be filed to deny relief to the opposite party.

No doubt a mini trial is not conducted at the stage of grant of an

interim injunction, however, the respective strength of the cases of the

parties have to be considered and inherent in the same is right to see

the genuineness and credibility of the documents. That respective

strength of the cases set up by the parties have to be seen is no longer

res integra and this has been so held by the Supreme Court in its two

judgments     reported   as   Colgate   Pamolive      (India)   Ltd.    Vs.

Hindustan Lever Ltd. (1999) 7 SCC 1 and Ramdev Food (P) Ltd.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                              Page 12 of 16</span>
 Vs. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel &amp; others (2006) 8 SCC 726 It is,

in order to judge the prima facie genuineness and credibility of the

documents of the respondent, we put it to the counsel for the

respondent that if the sales were such huge why only stray bills were

filed and that no profit and loss account and balance sheet or the

audited accounts were filed so as to substantiate the credibility and

genuineness of the documents being relied upon. The counsel for the

respondent had no answer. In our opinion, after all, if there were such

huge sales as claimed by the respondent with respect to the trademark

"Golden Deer" from the year 1999-2000 then surely it was not difficult

for the respondent to file audited accounts showing the sale of "Double

Deer" from 1999-2000 and myriad other documents.             In fact, we

further and again put to learned counsel for the respondent that

whether any such documents have been filed either before this court or

before the learned Single Judge, to which the counsel for the

respondent admitted that no such documents have been filed either

before the learned Single Judge or this Court. As held by the Supreme

Court in the case of Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd &amp; Anr. Vs.

Sudhir Bhatia &amp; others (2004) 3 SCC 90 once there is a registered

trademark, certain amount of delay would not prevent grant of an

interim injunction. The delay is only of just about 2 odd years.   Interim

injunction could have been refused only if the delay on the part of the

appellant/plaintiff was such so as to result in acquiescence or grave

prejudice to the respondent. There is no question of acquiescence in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                            Page 13 of 16</span>
 the facts of the present case, more so, because the adoption of the

respondent is not honest and the defence that the mark "Deer" was

common to the trade is clearly misconceived. It is in the light of this,

we are convinced that the respondent does not have any strength in its

case as compared to the case set up on the registered trademark of

the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">          Our belief is further confirmed because the counsel for the

respondent stated that others traders were also using the word mark

"Deer" and that is why the respondent adopted the same as it was

common to trade, however, when we refer to the documents which

were relied upon by the respondent on this aspect we find that as

regards the others who are using the word mark "Deer", the said trade

mark "Deer" is not being used with respect to the product rice but is

being used with respect to products such as Masalas, Chicory Powder

and Wheat Flour.     Clearly, therefore, the contention of the learned

counsel for the respondent is misconceived that the word mark "Deer"

is common to the trade of rice. In fact this shows that the dishonest

adoption of the word mark "Deer" by the respondent in its trademark

"Golden Deer" inasmuch as the appellant was already an established

and registered user of the trademark "Double Deer" from 1985 when

registration was first granted.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.   In view of the said discussion, since the learned Judge has clearly

misapplied the law and arrived at a conclusion which is quite

unsustainable in law, this court is of the opinion that the impugned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO(OS) No. 286/08                                            Page 14 of 16</span>
 order is liable to be set aside. Ordinarily, if two views were possible,

this court would not have interfered, however, we are of the firm

opinion that only one view is possible in the facts of the present case

because not only the appellant/plaintiff was the prior and the

registered     user        of      the     trademark,    the      adoption     of     the

respondent/defendant was not honest and it is not permissible to copy

a prominent part of the registered trademark of another person, more

so, when the said word mark is arbitrarily adopted with respect to the

product in question.            The balance of convenience is          clearly not in

favour of the              defendant/respondent but is in            favour of the

appellant/plaintiff who will be caused serious, grave and irreparable

injury with respect to its ownership and goodwill in the trademark

"Double Deer". The Supreme Court in the case of                      Ram Dev Food

Products (P) Ltd. (supra) has held that an Appellate Court is entitled

in certain circumstances to interfere with the order of a learned Single

Judge in such matters where the discretion has been exercised by the

learned Single Judge arbitrarily, capriciously, perversely or where the

court has ignored the settled principles of law regulating the grant or

refusal of interlocutory injunctions. We find the present case to be fit

case in accordance with the above for interference and the impugned

order of the learned Single Judge dated 21.5.2008 is set aside and the

I.A. 1315/2006 as filed by the appellant/plaintiff before the learned

Single    Judge       is        entitled    to   be     allowed     and      thus     the

respondent/defendant is restrained from in any manner using the

 trademark "Golden Deer" or any other mark deceptive similar to the

appellant/plaintiff‟s registered trademark "Double Deer" with respect

to the product namely rice and such other products as fall in the class

of goods for which the trademark of the appellant/plaintiff is registered

and for which the appellant/plaintiff is using the said trademark
