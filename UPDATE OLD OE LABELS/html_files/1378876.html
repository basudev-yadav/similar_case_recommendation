HEADNOTE:
A  criminal  case was filed in 1961  against  the  appellant
under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_4"> s. 120B</a> of the Penal Code while in respect of  others
for  various offences under<a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_5"> ss. 465</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_6">471</a>/ <a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_7">466</a>, <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_8">476</a>/<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_9">466</a>,	 <a href="/doc/1991013/" id="a_10">470</a>

Magistrate,  Punjab Camp Jullundur framed charges under	 the
aforesaid sections against the accused.	 An objection, "that

invalid,"  raised by the accused appellant was	rejected  by
the  Trial  Court on 6-6-1970 holding that no  sanction	 was
necessary in the case.	A revision application filed against
the  said orders was dismissed by the Punjab High  Court  on
24-3-1972.  The appellant thereafter obtained special  leave
on 5-4-1973 from this Court.
'Dismissing the appeal the Court,
HELD:(1)  The  very  agreement, concert	 or  league  is	 the
ingredient  of the offence of criminal conspiracy  under <a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_17"> s.
120A</a> introduced for the first time in 1913 in Chapter VA  of
the  Penal  Code.  It is not necessary that  all  the  cons-
pirators  must know each and every detail of the  conspiracy
as  long as they are co-participators in the main object  of
the conspiracy.	 There may be so many devices and techniques
adopted	 to  achieve the common goal of the  conspiracy	 and
there  may  be	division of performances  in  the  chain  of
actions	 with  one object to achieve the real end  of  which
every  collaborator must be aware and in which each  one  of
them  must be interested.  There must be unity of object  or
purpose	 but there may be plurality of means sometimes	even
unknown	 to  one  another,  amongst  the  conspirators.	  In
achieving the goal several offences may be committed by some
of  the conspirators even unknown to the others.   The	only
relevant  factor is that all means adopted and illegal	acts
done  must  be	and purported to be in	furtherance  of	 the
object of the conspiracy even though there may be  sometimes
misfire or over-shooting by some of the conspirators.	Even
if  some  steps	 are  resorted	to by  one  or	two  of	 the
conspirators without the knowledge of the others it will not
affect	the  culpability  of  those  others  when  they	 are
associated with the object of the conspiracy.

(2)  That  an  accused	himself	 is  not  charged  with	 the
ultimate  offence  which  is  the  object  of  the  criminal
conspiracy  is besides the point in a charge under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_19"> s.	120B</a>
I.P.C.	as long as he is a party to the conspiracy with	 the
end  in	 view.	 Whether  the  charges	will  be  ultimately
established  against the accused is a  completely  different
matter within the domain of the 'Trial Court. [785 F] (3 )
In the instant case :
(a)The main object of the criminal conspiracy in the first
charge is undoubtedly "cheating by personation".  The  other
means adopted, inter alia, are preparation or causing to  be
prepared spurious passports; forging or causing to be forged
entries	 and endorsements in that connection; and use of  or
causing	 to be used forged passport as genuine in  order  to
facilitate travel of IF persons abroad.	 The final object of
the  conspiracy	 in the first charge being  the	 offence  of
cheating  by  personation,  the	 other	offences   described
therein	 are steps albeit offences themselves in and of	 the
ultimate crime.	 Without achiev-
78 2
ing  that  goal other acts would be of no  material  use  in
which any person could be necessarily interested.  That	 the
appellant  himself  does  not personate	 another  person  is
beside the point when he, is alleged to be a collaborator of
the conspiracy with that object. [785D-E-F]
(b)Although  the  word "cheating by personation"  was  not
mentioned  in the charge, no valid objection could be  made,
as  the entire recitals are clear arid are also followed  up
by a specific mention of the offence under<a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_20"> s. 419</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">I.P.C</a>.

(c)The object of criminal conspiracy is absolutely  clear,
the object is not cheating simpliciter under<a href="/doc/105503/" id="a_23"> s. 417</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">I.P.C</a>.
				 [785 H]
(d)Since the object of criminal conspiracy is cheating	by
personation  u/s.  419 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25">I.P.C</a>. punishable  with	imprisonment
which  may extend to three years, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26">section 196A(2)</a> is no	 bar

that the accused are charged with other non-cognisableoffences
in  the same trial cannot affect the validity of  the  trial

</p><p id="p_2">Appeal	by Special Leave from the Judgment and	Order  dated
24-3-1972  of  the  Punjab  &amp; Harayan  High  Court  in	Crl.
Revision No. 739 of 1970.
</p><p id="p_3">Frank Anthony and D. N. Mishra for the Appellant.
R. L. Kohli and R. N. Sachthey for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
GOSWAMI,  J.-The  criminal case, out of	 which	this  appeal
arises,	 goes back to the year 1961.  On July 1,  1967,	 the
Special	  Judicial   Magistrate	 Punjab,   camp	  Jullundur,
committed  the appellant along with several others to  stand
trial  in the Court of Sessions under various charges,	such
as under <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_27">sections 465</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_28">471</a>/<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_29">466</a>, <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_30">476</a>/<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_31">466</a>, <a href="/doc/105503/" id="a_32">417</a>, <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_33">419</a> read	with
<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_34">section 120B</a> IPC.  Apparently it took nearly three years for
the  trial  to commence.  On objection being raised  by	 the
accused	 with regard to the sanction under  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_35">section  196A(2)</a>
Cr.  P. C., 1898, the trial court on June 6, 1970,  rejected
the  same by holding that no sanction was necessary  in	 the
case.	The trial court, however, held that  the  particular
sanction  accorded  under  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_36">section 196A(2)</a> Cr.	 P.  C.	 was
invalid, the correctness of which was not challenged  before
us.
</p><p id="p_4">That led to a revision application by the accused before the
High Court of Punjab and Haryana.  That was also rejected on
March  24,  1972.   The	 appellant  obtained  special  leave
against the order of the High Court on April 5, 1973.
Even  such  a short matter, as it is, where no	records	 are
required to, be prepared. has come, up for hearing before us
after  well over four years.  True, the accused	 profits  by
the  delay  in	many ways but the  State  should  have	been
vigilant  to,  apply for an expeditious hearing	 of  such  a
short  matter since the trial has been inordinately  delayed
on  account of this.  The methodology of disposal of such  a
matter, like the pattern we have been recently adopting, may
suitably  be to dispose of the whole matter within  a  month
after notice of motion to the State at the the of hearing of
the special leave petition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">783</span>
<p id="p_5">The  only question raised before us by Mr. Frank Anthony  is
with  regard  to the invalidity of the trial  under  <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_37">section

</blockquote><p id="p_7">The first charge in which all accused. are, named  including
tile  appellant	 is  tile principal  charge  describing	 the
nature	and  object of the conspiracy in which a  number  of
persons including. absconders and some unknown persons	were
involved.   With  regard,  to the.  twelve  other  remaining
charges, although the appellant was not charged under any of
them,  his  other companions were charged and  in  eight  of
these charges, specific mention was made of various offences
being committed "in pursuance of the said conspiracy".	Some
of  the	 accused  persons  are	charged	 tinder	 substantive
offences  which	 are  connected	 with  the  object  of	tile
conspiracy.   The  court could have added in  the  remaining
charges also that the offences were, committed in  pursuance
of  the said conspiracy but much cannot be made of its	non-
mention at this stage at any rate.
</p><p id="p_8">Mr. Anthony submits very strenuously that the first and	 the
only charge in which the appellant is involved speaks merely
of  "cheating"	which is an offence under  <a href="/doc/105503/" id="a_45">section  417</a>	 IPC
punishable with imprisonment for one year.  When pointed out
that the charges does refer specifically to <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_46">section 419</a> IPC,
be submits that the mention of the offence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">784</span>
is  not	 decisive  when the recitals in the  charge  do	 not
notify to the accused "cheating by personation".  He  relies
strongly  on the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1312948/" id="a_47">Bhanwar  Singh  &amp;
Anr.  v. State of Rajasthan</a>(1) as his main plank of  attack.
He draws our attention to the observation therein that	"the
object	of the conspiracy has to be determined, not only  by
reference  to the sections of the penal enactment,  referred
to  in	the  charge,  but  on  a  reading  of  the   charges
themselves".
</p><p id="p_9">It is not possible to accede to the above submission of	 Mr.
Anthony.  The aforesaid observation cannot be called in	 aid
at the threshold of a trial divorced from the context.	That
was  a case where the accused were, convicted at  the  trial
and  the appeal by special leave was dismissed.	  The  court
was  in a position to ascertain in that case as	 to  whether
the  accused  had  proper  notice of  the  charge  with	 the
definite  object  of conspiracy and whether  there  was	 any
prejudice to the accused in any manner affecting the  trial.
We  are	 however, called upon to examine the matter  at	 the
threshold.   We	 have carefully read the  first	 charge	 and
although  the  words  "cheating	 by  personation"  were	 not
mentioned  therein, no valid objection could be made as	 the
entire recitals are clear and are alsofollowed	up  by	 a
specific  mention of the offence under <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_48">section 419</a> IPC.	  We
are  not required to ascertain the object of the  conspiracy
from  mere mention of <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_49">section 419</a> IPC but from the  recitals
in  the charge.	 The decision in Bhanwar Singh (Supra)	does
not  come  to  the aid of counsel in this  case.   Since  an
objection  like this has been made, it will be even open  to
the  trial  court  to  alter the  Words	 of  the  charge  by
specifically mentioning "cheating by personation".
Besides. the other charges levelled against the alleged	 co-
conspirators  also throw sufficient light on the  object  of
the  conspiracy and it is not necessary that  the  appellant
should	figure or for the matter of that all accused  should
figure in all the charges.
</p><p id="p_10">The  offence of criminal conspiracy under <a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_50">section 120A</a> is  a
distinct  offence introduced for the first time in  1913  in
Chapter VA of the Penal Code.	   The	  very	  agreement,
concert or league is the ingredient of the offence. It is
not  necessary that all the conspirators must know each	 and
everydetail  of the conspiracy as long as they are  co-
participators  in the main object of the conspiracy.   There
may be so many devices and techniques adopted to achieve the
common	goal of the conspiracy and there may be division  of
performances  in  the chain of actions with  one  object  to
achieve	 the  real end of which every collaborator  must  be
aware  and  in which each one of them  must  be	 interested.
There  must be unity of object or purpose but there  may  be
plurality  of means sometimes even unknown to  one  another,
amongst	 the  conspirators.  In achieving the  goal  several
offences, may be committed by some of the conspirators	even
unknown to the others.	The only relevant factor is that all
means adopted and illegal acts done must be and purported to
be  in	furtherance  of the object of  the  conspiracy	even
though	there may be sometimes misfire or  over-shooting  by
some  of the conspirators.  Even if some steps are  resorted
to by one or two- of the conspirators without the  knowledge
of the others it will not affect the culpability of those

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">785</span>
<p id="p_11">others	when  they  are associated with the  object  of	 the
conspiracy.   The significance of criminal conspiracy  under
<a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_51">section	 120A</a> is brought out pithily by this Court in  <a href="/doc/342903/" id="a_52">Major
B. G. Darsay v. The State of Bombay</a>.(1) thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "The  gist of the offences is an agreement  to
	      break  the  law.	 The  parties  to  such	  an
	      agreement	  will	 be   guilty   of   criminal conspiracy, t
hough the illegal act agreed  to
	      be done has not been done.  So too, it is	 not
	      an  ingredient  of the offence  that  all	 the
	      parties  should agree to de a  single  illegal
	      act.   It	 may comprise the  commission  of  a
	      number  of  acts.	 Under<a href="/doc/704346/" id="a_53"> s. 43</a> of	 the  Indian
	      Penal  Code, an act would be illegal if it  is
	      an  offence  or if it is	prohibited  by	law.
	      Under the first charge the accused are charged
	      with have conspired to do three categories  of
	      illegal  acts, and the mere fact that  all  of
	      them  could  not be  convicted  separately  in
	      respect  of  each	 of  the  offences  has	  no
	      relevancy in considering the question  whether
	      the offence of conspiracy has been  committed.
	      They   are  all  guilty  of  the	offence	  of
	      conspiracy to do illegal acts, though for	 in-
	      dividual	offences  all  of them	may  not  be
	      liable."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">We  are in respectful agreement with the above	observations
with regard lo the offence of criminal conspiracy.
The  main  object of the criminal conspiracy  in  the  first
charge	is undoubtedly cheating by personation.	  The  other
means adopted, inter alia, are preparation or causing to  be
prepared spurious passports; forging or causing to be forged
entries	 and endorsements in that connection; and use of  or
causing	 to be used forged passports as genuine in order  to
facilitate  travel of persons abroad.  The final  object  of
the  conspiracy	 in the first charge being  the	 offence  of
cheating  by  personation, and we find,	 the  other  offence
described therein are steps, albeit, offences themselves, in
aid  of	 the ultimate crime.  The charge  does	not  connote
plurality of objects of the conspiracy.	 That the  appellant
himself is not charged with the ultimate offence,, which  is
the  object of the criminal conspiracy, is beside the  point
in a charge under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_54">section 120B</a> IPC as long as he is a  party
to the conspiracy with the end in view.	 Whether the charges
will  be  ultimately established against the  accused  is  a
completely  different matter within the domain of the  trial
court.
</p><p id="p_13">The principal object of the criminal conspiracy in the first
charge	is  thus  "cheating  by	 personation"  and   without
achieving  that goal other acts would be of no material	 use
in  which any person could be necessarily interested.	That
the  appellant himself does not personate another person  is
beside the point when he is alleged to be a collaborator  of
the  conspiracy	 with that object.  We have seen  that	some
persons have been individually and specifically charged with
cheating  by personation under <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_55">section 419</a> IPC.	  They	were
also  charged  along with the appellant under  <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_56">section	120B</a>
IPC.  The object of criminal conspiracy is absolutely  clear
and there is no substance in the argument that the object is
merely to cheat simpliciter under <a href="/doc/105503/" id="a_57">section 417</a> IPC.
