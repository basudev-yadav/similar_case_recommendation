published on  August 10	 1975, amending Articles 71, 329 and
329(A) and  added Entries after Entry 86 in the 9th Schedule
and the	 Maintenance of	 Internal Security  Act (Act  26  of
1971)  1971 as item 92 in the said Schedule.
175
     On October 17, 1975, on ordinance 16 of 1975 was issued
making further	amendments ill	s. 16A of the maintenance of
internal <a href="/doc/190229/" id="a_37">Security  Act</a> introducing sub-Clause (8) and (9) to
s. 16A.	 On November  16, 1975	ordinance 22  of 1975	 was
issued making  certain	amendments  in	the  Maintenance  of
Internal security  Act inserting  also sub-<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_38">section 2A</a> ill<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_39"> s.
16A</a>. All  the amendments  made by  the (ordinance were given
retrospective effect  for the purpose of validating all Acts
done previously.  'The said ordinances were published as the
Maintenance of	Internal Security  (Amendment) Act 1976 (Act
14 of 1976) on- Janurary ''5, 1976.
     The respondents  detained under <a href="/doc/230008/" id="a_40"> s. 3(IA)(ii)</a> read with
s. 3(2)	 of the maintenance-   of Internal Security Act (Act
26 of  1971 j  as amended  by the  Maintenance	of  Internal
Security Act  (Amendment Act 39 of 1975), 1975 challenged in
several High  Courts, the  vires of  the ordinance issued on
June 27, 1975, by the President of India as unconstitutional
and inoperative	 in law and prayed for (a) the setting aside
of the	said order  and	 (b)  for  directing  their  release
forthwith. In  come cases,  they challenged  the validity of
the Thirty-eight  and I	 thirty-ninth constitution <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_41">Amendment
Act</a>s.
     When these petitions came up for hearing, the appellant
raised the  preliminary	 objection to the maintainability on
the ground that in asking For l release by the issuance of a
writ of	 habeas Corpus.	 the respondents were, in substance,
claiming that  they have  been deprived	 of  their  personal
liberty in  violation of  the procedure	 established by law,
which plea  was available  to them  under. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_42">Art.	 21</a>  of	 the
Constitution only  and in  view of  the	 Presidential  order
dated June  27	1975,  suspending  the	right  to  move	 for
enforcement of	the right  conferred by	 that  article,	 the
petitions were liable to be dismissed at the threshold.
     While the	High Courts  of Andhra	Pradesh, Kerala	 and
Madras	have   upheld  The   preliminary   objection,	this
contention	did not find favour with the  High Courts of
Allahabad, Bombay  (Nagpur Bench),  Delhi Karnataka,  Madhya
Pradesh, Punjab	 and Haryana  respectively.  'I	 these	High
(courts	 broadly   took	 the   view  that  (a)	despite	 the
Presidential order  it is  open to  the detenus to challenge
their detention	 on   the ground  that it is ultra vires, as
for example,  by showing that the order, on  the face of it,
IS passed  by an authority not empowered of pass it or it is
not in	exercise of  the power delegated to the authority or
that  the   power  has	been  exercised	 in  breach  of	 the
conditions prescribed  in that behalf by the Act under which
the order  is passed,  or that	he order  is not  in  strict
conformity with	 the	provisions of the Act. Some of these
High Court have further held that the detenus can attack the
order of  detention on	the ground  that it is mala fide, as
for example,  by showing  that the  authority	   did	 not
supply its  mind to the relevant considerations, or that the
authority   was influenced  by irrelevant  considerations or
that the  authority was	 influenced by improper motives. The
Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court read down s. 16A(9) of
the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 1 implying an
exception in  favour of	 disclosure to	the Court.  The High
Court did not decide about the validity of the Thirty-eighth
and    Thirty-ninth Constitution Amendment Acts.
     Accepting the  States' appeals,  some  by	certificates
granted by  the High  Court and	 some by  special leave, the
Court by majority (Khanna, J. dissenting),

     The vital distinction between Arts. 358 and 359 is that

extent that  the Legislature can make laws contravening <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_53">Art.

the  Executive	can  take  action  which  The  Executive  is
competent to  take under  such laws  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_54">Article  358</a>  does	 not
suspend any  Fundamental  Right.  While	 a  proclamation  of
emergency is  in operation the Presidential order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_55">Art.
359(1)</a>	can   suspend  the   enforcement    of	any  or	 all
Fundamental Rights. <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_56">Article 359(1)</a> also suspends any pending
proceedings for the enforcement of such Fundamental Right or

Articles is  that <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_57">Art.	358</a> provides  for indemnity. whereas
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_58">Article 359(1)</a>	does not:  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_59">Article 359(1A)</a>  is on  the	same

virtually abolished  by the  Presidential order	 without any
amendment of  the Constitution is incorrect. No amendment to
the Constitution  is necessary	because no  jurisdiction and
power either  of this  Court or	 of the	 High Court is taken
away. When  a Presidential order takes away the locus standi
of the	detenu to  move any  court for	the  enforcement  of
Fundamental Rights  for the time being, the jurisdiction and
powers	of   this  Court  and  of  the	High  Courts  remain
unaltered. [224 E-F]
     <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_74">Article 359(1)</a> is not directed against any court, it is
directed against an individual and deprives him of his locus

     The most  important  object  of  making  certain  basic
rights fundamental  by the  Constitution  is  to  make	them
enforceable against  the State	and its agencies through the
Courts. [329 F]
     Under our	constitutional jurisprudence  courts cannot,
during a  constitutionally enjoined  period of suspension of
the enforceability  of fundamental  rights  through  courts,
enforce hat  may even  be a  Fundamental Right	sought to be
protected by Part III of the Constitution. [314 C-D]
     The enforceability	 of a  right by	 a  constitutionally
appointed judicial  organ has necessarily to depend upon the
fulfillment of	two conditions:	 firstly, its recognition by
or  under  the	Constitution  as  a  right;  and,  secondly,
possession of  the vower  of its enforcement by the judicial
organs. <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_176">Article	 226</a> of	 the Constitution  is not  meant for
futile and  unenforceable declarations	of right.  The whole
purpose of  a writ of habeas corpus is to enforce a right to
personal freedom  after the  declaration of the detention as
illegal	 when	it   is	  so   found   upon   investigation.
Enforceability of  rights, whether.  they are constitutional
or common  law or  statutory, in constitutionally prescribed
ways  by   constitutionally  appointed	judicial  organs  is
governed solely	 by the terms of the written instrument in n
Constitution such as ours. The scope for judicial law making
on the	subject of  enforcement of  the	 right	to  personal
freedom was  deliberately  restricted  by  our	Constitution
makers.	 It   is  difficult  to	 see  any  such	 scope	when
enforcement itself is suspended. [314 E-F, 315 B-C]
     What is  suspended is  really  the	 procedure  for	 the
enforcement of a right through courts which could be said to
flow from  the infringement of a statutory procedure. If the
enforcement of	a right	 to be	free, resulting derivatively
from both  the constitutional and statutory provisions based
on an  infraction of  the procedure.  which is	statutory in
cases  of   preventive	detention,   is	 suspended,   it  is
impossible to lay down that it becomes enforceable when that
part of	 the procedure	which is  mandatory is	violated but
remains unenforceable  so long	as the part of the procedure
infringed is  directory. Such  a  view	would  introduce  a'
distinction which  is neither  warranted by  the language of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_177">Article	 359</a>   of  the	Constitution  nor  by  that  of	 the
Presidential order of 1975. [315 F-G]
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">183</span>
     If	 the   protection  of	enforceability	is   validly
suspended for  the duration of an  Emergency, declared under
constitutional provisions,  the	 courts	 will  have  nothing
before them to enforce so as to able to afford any relief to
a person who comes with a grievance before them. [329 G]
     A court cannot. in exercise of any supposed inherent or
implied or  unspecified power,	purport to  enforce  or,  in
substance enforce,  a right  the  enforcement  of  which  is
suspended. To permit such circumvention of the suspension is
to authorise  doing indirectly what law does not allow to be
done directly. [317 E-F]
     [His Lordship  felt that it was unnecessary to consider
"any other  purpose" in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_178">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution in view

corpus and for no other kind of writs or orders.]
     The Constitution  given unto  themselves by the people,
is legally  supreme. A	notional surrender  by the people of
India of  control over their several or individual rights to
a  Sovereign   Republic	 by   means  of	 a  legally  supreme
Constitution only means that the Constitution is supreme and
can confer  rights and	powers. One  has to look to it alone
and not	 outside it  for finding out the manner in which and
the limits subject to which individual citizens can exercise
their separate	freedoms. A  satisfactory explanation of the
language of conferment used with reference to rights is that
there has  to be  necessarily, as a result of such a process
of Constitution	 making, a  notional surrender of individual
freedom so  as to  convert the	possibility of	"licence" to
all, which  ends in  the exploitation  and oppression of the
many weak  by the few strong into the actuality of a freedom
for all regulated by law or under the law applicable to all.

from challenge	in courts even when the emergency is over. A
noticeable feature of our Constitutions is that, whereas the

under <a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_207">Art.  352(1)</a> are	automatic, Presidential orders under

emergency to  emergency depending  upon	 the  terms  of	 the
Presidential orders involved. And then, <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_209">Article 359(1A)</a> made
operative  retrospectively   by	 the   38th   Constitutional
amendment of  1st August  1975, makes it clear that both the
legislative and	 executive organs of the State are freed for
the duration  of the  emergency from  the limits  imposed by
Part III of the Constitution. [348 A-D]
     The striking  differences	in  the	 terms	of  the	 two
Presidential orders are:
</p><p id="p_21">     (1) The  Presidential order  of 1962  did	not  specify
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_210">Article 14</a>  of the  Constitution, but  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_211">Art. 14</a>, guaranteeing
equality before	 the law and equal protection of laws to all
persons in  India, is mentioned in the 1975 order. This does
make some  difference  between	the  intentions	 behind	 and
effects of' the two Presidential orders. [352 B-C]
</p><p id="p_22">     (ii) The President	  Order of 1962 expressly hedges the
suspension of  the specified  Fundamental  Rights  with	 the
condition, with regard to deprivations covered by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_212">Article 21</a>
and <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_213">22</a>	of  the	 Constitution  that  the  detenu  should  be
deprived of his rights "under the Defence of India Act, 1962
or any	rules or  order made thereunder". In other words. On
the terms  of the  1962 Presidential  Order, the courts were
under a	 duty to  see whether  a deprivation satisfies these
conditions or  not. They  could adjudicate upon the question
whether a  detention was  "under "  the Act  or a rule "made
thereunder". On	 the other  hand, the  Presidential order of
1975 unconditionally  suspends the enforcement of the rights
conferred upon	"any person  including a  foreigner" to move
any court  for the  enforcement of  the rights	conferred by
Articles 14,  21 and 22 of the Constitution. The Courts are.
therefore, no longer obliged or able to test the validity of
a detention by examining whether they conform to statutory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">187</span>
requirements. They  will have  to be content with compliance
shown with forms of the law. [352 C-E]
</p><p id="p_23">     (iii) Presidential	 order of  1962 makes  no mention of
pending	 proceedings,  but.  the  1975	order  suspends	 all
pending	 proceedings  for  the	enforcement  of	 the  rights
mentioned therein.  This further  clarifies  and  emphasizes
that the intention behind the Presidential order of 1975 was
to actually  affect the	 jurisdiction  of  courts  in  which
proceedings were  actually pending.  the inference from this
feature also  is that all similar proceedings in future will
similarly be affected. [352 E-F]
     There can	be no doubt whatsoever that the Presidential
order of  June 27,  1975,  was	a  part	 of  a	unmistakably
expressed intention to suspend the ordinary processes of law
in those  cases where  persons complain	 of infringement  of
their fundamental rights by the executive authorities of the
State. The intention of the Parliament itself to bring about
this result so that the jurisdiction of courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_214">article
226</a> in	this particular type of cases is itself affected for
the duration  of the  emergency, seems clear enough from the
provisions of<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_215"> S. 16A(9)</a> of the Act, introduced by Act No. 14
of 1976,  which received  Presidential assent on January 25.
1976, making <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_216"> s. 16A(9)</a>	 operative retrospectively from June
25, 1975. [352 F-H]
     There is  no doubt	 that the object of the Presidential
(order of  June '27,  1975, by suspending the enforcement of
the specified  rights, was to affect the powers of courts to
afford relief  to those	 the enforcement of whose rights was
suspended. This	 was within  the purview  of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_217">Article 359(1).</a>
Hence objections  that powers  of the courts under. <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_218">Art. 226</a>
may indirectly	be affected  is	 no  answer  to	 the  direct
suspension of rights which was bound to have its effect upon
the manner  in which  jurisdiction is or could reasonably be
exercised  even	  if  that  jurisdiction  cannot  be  itself
suspended for all types of cases. [353 A-B]
     The term  Rule of	Law is hot a magic wand which can he
waved to dispel every difficulty. It is not an Aladin's lamp
which can be scratched to invoke a power which brings to any
person in  need whatever he or she may desire to have It can
only mean  what the  law in a particular State or country is
and what  it enjoins.  This means  that the Rule of Law must
differ in  shades of  meaning and emphasis from time to time
and country  to country.  It could not be rigid, unchanging,
and immutable  like the	 proverbial laws  of the  Medes	 and
Persians. It cannot be like some brooding omnipotence in the
skies. Its  meaning cannot  be what anyone wants to make it.
It has	to be,	for each  particular situation. indicated by
the courts as to what it means. [353 F-H, 354 A]
     The Rule  of Law  includes the concept of determination
by courts,  of the  question whether  an impugned  executive
action	is  within  the	 bounds	 of  law.  It  pre-supposes,
firstly, the  existence of  a fixed  or identifiable rule of
law which  the executive has to follow as distinguished from
a purely  policy decision open to it under the wide terms of
the statute   conferring  a discretionary  power to act. and
secondly the  power of	the courts  to test  the  action  by
reference to the rule. [354 E-F]
     Even in  emergencies provided the power of the court to
so test the legality of some executive act is not curtailed,
courts will  apply the	test' of  legality  "if	 the  person
aggrieved brings the action in the competent court". But, if
the locus standi of the person to move the court is gone and
the competence of the court to enquire into the grievance is
also  impaired	by  inability  to  peruse  the	ground	  of
executive action  or their  relationship with  the power  to
act, it	 is no	use appalling  to this particular concept of
the Rule  of Law.  It is  just inapplicable to the situation
which arises  here. Such  a situation  is  governed  by	 the
emergency provisions of the Constitution. [354 F-H]

is no  bar against that. What is hot possible is to secure a
release by  an order  in  habeas  corpus  proceedings  after
taking the  courts behind  a duly  authenticated prima facie
good return. [366 B-C]
     If the  meaning of	 the  emergency	 provisions  in	 our
Constitution and  the provisions of' the Act is clearly that
what lies  in the executive field should not be subjected to
judicial  scrutiny   or	 judged	 by  judicial  standards  of

     It does  not  follow  from	 a  removal  of	 the  normal
judicial superitendence	 even over  questions of  vires,  of
detention orders,  which may require going into facts behind
the returns  that  there  is  no  Rule	of  Law	 during	 the
emergency or  that the	principles of ultra vires are not to
be applied  at all by any authority except when, on the face
of the	return itself,	it is demonstrated in a court of law
that the  detention does  not even purport to be in exercise
of the	executive power	 or authority or is patently outside
the law authorising detention The intention behind emergency
provisions and	of the	Act is that although such, executive
action as  is	not susceptible	 to  judicial  appraisement,
should not  be subjected  to it,  yet, it should be honestly
supervised and	controlled by  the  hierarchy  of  executive
authorities  themselves.   It  enhances	  the	powers	 and
therefore, the responsibilities of the Executive. [363 F-H]
     In actual practice, the grounds supplied always operate
as an  objective test for determining the question whether a
nexus could  reasonably exist  between the grounds given and
the detention  order or	 whether some  infirmities had crept
in.  The   reasonableness  of	the  detention	because	 the

     The theory	 of basic  structure  oil  the	Constitution
cannot be  used to  build into the Constitution an imaginary
part which  may	 be  in	 conflict  with	 the  constitutional
provisions. The	 Constitution cannot  have a  base out	away
from the  superstructure. Indeed,  the emergency  provisions
could themselves  be regarded as part of the basic structure
of the Constitution. [366 E-F]
     The theory	 of  basic  structure  of  the	constitution
cannot be  considered as anything more than a part of a well
recognised mode	 of constructing a document The Constitution
like any  other document has to be read and constructed as a
whole.	The  theory  was  nothing  more	 than  a  method  of
determining the	 intent behind the constitutional provisions
it could  not and  did not  build and  add a new part to the
Constitution.  It   cannot  imply   new	 tests	 outside  he
Constitution or be used to defeat constitutional provisions.

	 The dominant purpose of the present petitions is to
  obtain an order of release from detention by enforcing the

   barred because regard must be had to the substance of the

person detained	 under the Maintenance of  Internal Security
Act   1971, no	relief by way of releasing the detenu can be
granted because	 no person  has a legal capacity to move any
court	to ask for such relief. The Presidential order takes
away such legal capacity by including <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_268">Art. 21</a> within it. The
source of  the	right  to  personal  liberty  is  immaterial
because the  words "conferred by" which occur in <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_269">Art. 359(1)</a>

     The contention that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_271">Art. 226</a> which occurs in Chapter V,

     The Presidential  order neither  bars the	right of  an
accused to defend his personal liberty in the court of first

extended to  cases where  there	 is  a	threat	of  external

     The object	 of Art 359 is to confer wider powers on the
President than the power merely to suspend the right to file
a petition  for the  writ of habeas corpus. <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_281">Article 359</a> aims
at empowering  the President to suspend the right to enforce

not provide  that the  President may declare that the remedy
by way of habeas corpus shall be suspended during emergency.
Personal liberty  is  but  one	of  the	 Fundamental  Rights

neculiar to the enforcement of the

the right  to enforce  the right  conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_283">Art. 21</a> means

     The true  implication of  the Presidential	 order is to
take away  the right of any person to move any court for the

     It is  the basic  characteristic and essence of martial

     <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_447">Article 34</a> clearly postulates that during the time that

(9)(a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_480"> s. 16A</a>  applies or  in other words. It is only in

     If the  grounds,  information  and	 materials  have  no
relation to  matter of	State or  they cannot possibly be of
such a	character that	their closure  would  injure  public
interest, the  legislature cannot,  by	merely	employing  a

it would be against public interest to disclose an 1 thereby
exclude them  from the	judicial ken.  That would  not be  a

     Sanctity of life and liberty was not something new when
the Constitution  was drafted.	It represented	a  facet  of
higher	values	which  mankind	began  to  cherish  in	its,
evolution from	a state	 of tooth  and claw  to a  civilized
existence. The	principle that	no one	shall be deprived of
his life  and liberty  without the  authority of law was not
the gift  of the  Constitution. It was a necessary corollary
of the concept relating to the sanctity of life and liberty,
it existed  and was in force before the coming into force of
the Constitution. [268 C-D]
     Even in the absence of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_494">Art. 21</a> in the Constitution, the
State has  got no  power to  deprive a person of his life or
liberty without	 the authority of law. That is the essential
postulate and basic assumption of the Rule of Law and not of
men in	all civilised nations. Without such sanctity of life
and liberty,  the distinction  between a Lawless society and
one governed  by laws  would cease  to have any meaning. the
principle that	no one	shall be  deprived of  his  life  or
liberty without	 the authority	of  law	 is  rooted  in	 the
consideration  that   life   and   liberty   are   priceless
possessions which cannot be made the plaything of individual
whim and caprice and that any act which has

clear that the protection which is afforded by that clause h
is to  such law or execute action as the State would but for
the provisions	contained in Part 111 of the Constitution be
competent  to  make  or	 take.	The  word  competent  has  a
significance  and   it	is   apparent	that   despite	 the
Presidential  order   under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_545">Art.  359(1)</a>  in  the  case  of
executive action  the competence  of the  State to take such
action would  have to  be  established.	 Such  competence  .
Would, however, be judged ignoring the restriction placed by
the provisions or Part III of tho Constitution. To put it in
other words,  clause (IA) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_546">Art. 359</a> does not dispense with

     Though, there  is no  reference to substantive power in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_547">Art.  21</a>,   it	would	cover  both  the  existence  of	 the
substantive power  of depriving	 a person  of his  life	 and

of that power [284-D]
     The suspension  of the  right to  move a  court for the
enforcement of	the right  contained in	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_548">Art. 21</a> cannot have
the effect of debarring an aggrieved person from approaching
the courts  with the complaint regarding deprivation of life
or personal  liberty by	 an authority  on the  score that no
power has  been vested	in the authority to deprive a person
of life	 or liberty. The pre-supposition of the existence of
substantive power  to  deprive	a  person  of  his  life  or
personal liberty  in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_549">Art.  21</a> even  though that article only
mentions the  procedure, would	not necessarily point to the
conclusion that	 in the event of the suspension of the right
to move	 any court  for the  enforcement  of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_550">Art.  21</a>,	 the
suspension would  also dispense	 with the  necessity of	 the
existence of  the  substantive	power  The  co-existence  of
substantive power  and	procedure  established	by  law	 for
depriving R person of his life and liberty which is implicit
in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_551">Art.	 21</a> would  not lead to the result that even if there

be true	 of the converse of that proposition. The suspension
of the	right to  make. any court for the enforcement of the
right contained in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_552">Art. 21</a> may have the effect of dispensing
with  the   necessity  of   prescribing	 procedure  for	 the

life or	 personal liberty, it can in no case have the effect
of permitting  an authority  to deprive a person of his life
or personal  liberty without  the existence  of	 substantive
power. The  close bond	which is there between the existence
of substantive	power of  depriving a Person of his  life or
personal liberty  and the procedure for the exercise of that
power, if  the right contained in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_553">Art. 21</a> were in operation,
would not necessarily hold good if that right were suspended
because the  removal of compulsion about the prescription of
procedure for  the exercise  of the  substantive power would
not do	away with  the compulsion regarding the existence of
that power. [284 G-H, 285 A-G]
     In	 considering   the  effect   of	 Presidential  order
suspending the	right of  a person  tn	move  my  court	 for

[285 D]
     A Presidential  order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_554">Art. 359(1)</a> cannot have the
effect of  suspending the  right to  enforce rights  flowing
from statutes,	nor can	 it bar	 access	 to  the  courts  of
persons seeking	 redresses on  he s  ore of contravention of
statutory provisions. Statutory provisions are enacted to be
complied with  and it is not permissible to contravene them.
Statutory  provisions	cannot	be  treated  as	 mere  pious
exhortations or	 words of  advice which	 may be	 adjured  or
disobeyed with	impunity. Nor  is compliance  with statutory
provisions optional  or at  the sufference  of the  official
concerned. It  is the  presence	 of  legal  sanctions  which
distinguished positive	law from  other systems of rules and
norms. To  be a	 legal system  a set  of norms	must furnish
sanctions for  some of	its precepts.  A legal	sanction  is
usually thought	 of  as	 a  harmful  consequence  to  induce
compliance with law. Non-complince with statutory provisions
entails certain	 legal consequences.  The Presidential order
cannot stand in the way of the courts giving effect to those
consequences.  To   put	 it   differently,   the   executive
authorities exercising	power under a statute have to act in
conformity with its provisions and within the limits set out
therein.  When	 a  statute  deals  with  matters  effecting
prejudicially the  rights of  individuals, the	ambit of the
power of  the authorities  acting under the Statute would be
circumscribed  by  its	provisions  and	 it  would  not	 the
permissible to involve some indefinite general powers of the
executive. [286 D-H]

     There is a clear demarcation of the spheres of function

that during  the period	 of emergency,	the courts  would be
reduced to the position of being helpless spectators even if
glaring and  blatant instances	of deprivation	of Life	 and
personal liberty in contravention of the statute are brought
to their  notice. It would also mean that whatever it may be
the law	 passed by  the legislature,  in the matter of life,
and personal  liberty of  the citizens, the executive during
the period  of emergency  would not be bound by it and would
be at  liberty to  ignore and  contravene it.  It is obvious
that the acceptance of the contention would result in a kind
of  supremacy  of  the	executive  over	 the  legislate	 and
judicial organs	 of  the  State,  and  thus  bring  about  a
constitutional imbalance  which perhaps	 was  never  in	 the
contemplation of  the framers  of the Constitution. The fact
the the government which controls the executive has to enjoy
the confidence	so the	legislator does not d-tract from the
above conclusion.  The executive  under	 our  constitutional
scheme is nob merely to enjoy the confidence of the majority
in the	legislature it	is  also  bound	 to  carry  out	 the
legislative as	manifested by  the statutes  passed  by	 the

function of  deciding	whether the  executive has  acted in

     No one  can call  deny the power of the State to assume
vast powers of the detention in the interest of the security
of the	State. It  may indeed the necessary to do so to meet
the peril   acing  the nation. The consideration of security
of the	State must  have  a  primacy  and  be  kept  in	 the
forefront compared  to which the interests of the individual
can only  take as  secondary piece.  The motto has to be who
lives, if  the country dies. Extraordinary powers are always
assumed by  the Government  in all  countries  in  times  of
emergency  because   of	 the  extraordinary  nature  of	 the
emergency. The	exercise of  the power	of detention.  it is
well-settled depends upon the subjective satisfaction of the
detaining authority and the courts can neither act as courts
of appeal  over the decisions of the detaining authority nor
can they  substitute their  own	 opinion  for  that  of	 the
authority regarding  the necessity of detention. There is no
antithesis between the power of the State to detain a person
without trial  under a	law or	preventive detention and the
power  of   the	 court	to  examine  the  legality  of	such
detention. Tn  dealing with  an application  for a  writ  of
habeas corpus,	the courts  only, ensure  that the detaining
authorities act	 in accordance	with the  law of  preventive
detention. The impact upon the individual of the massive and
comprehensive powers  of preventive detention with which the
administrative officers are armed l has to be cushioned with
legal  safeguarded..   against	arbitrary   deprivation	  of
personal liberty  if the  premises of the rule of law is not
to lose	 its content  and become meaningless. The chances of
an innocent  person being detained under a law providing for
preventive detention  on the  subjective satisfaction  of an
administrative authority  are much  greater compared  on the
possibility of	an innocent  person being convicted at trial
in a court of law. 1291 F-H, 292 A, D-E]

     Every law	providing for  preventive detention contains
certain procedural  safeguards. It  is imperative that there
should be  strict compliance  with the requirements of those
procedural safeguards  to sustain the validity of detention.
Detention without  trial results  in  serious  inroads	into
personal liberty  of an	 individual.  In  such	case  it  is
essential to  ensure. that  there is  no deviation  from the
procedural safeguards provided by the statute. In the matter
of even	 a criminal  trial. it	is procedure that spells out
much of	 the difference between the rule of law and the rule
by whim and caprice. The need for strict adherence to`strict
procedural safeguards  is much	greater when  we are dealing
with preventive	 detention which  postulates  detention of a
person even  though he is not found guilty of the commission
of an  offence. To condone or allow relaxation in the matter
of compliance with procedural requirements would necessarily
have the  effect of  practically doing	away with  even	 the
slender safeguards  is provide	 by  the legislature against
the arbitrary  use of  the provisions relating to prevention
detention. The	history of  personal Liberty  is largely the
history of insistence upon procedure. It would. therefore be
wholly inappropriate to countenance and laxity in the mutter
of strict compliance with procedural requirements prescribed
for preventive detention. [297 G-H, 9`s A-B]
     Once substantial  disquieting doubt:  are raised by the
detenue in  the mind  of the court regarding the validity or
his detention.	it would be the bounden duty of the State to
dispel those  doubts   by placing sufficient material before
the court  with a   view to satisfy it about the validity of
the detention by filing a good return. [299 C-D]

by Articles 14,21 and 22 the High Courts can examine whether
an order  of detention	is in accordance with the provisions

referred to  as the  Act), which  constitute the  conditions
precedent to  the exercise  of powers  thereunder  excepting
those provisions  of the  Act which are merely procedural or
whether the  order was	necessary. The High courts also held
that in	 spite of  suspension of  enforcement of fundamental
rights conferred by Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution a
person's right to freedom from arrest or detention except in
accordance with	 law can  be enforced only where such arrest
and detention  except in accordance with law can be enforced

</p><p id="p_147">     The questions  which fall	for consideration  are two .
First, whether	in view	 of the	 Presidential orders date 27
June, 1975  and 8  January, 1976 under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_603">Article
359</a> of	the Constitution any writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_604">Article 226</a>
before a  High Court  for habeas corpus to enforce the right
to personal  liberty of	 a person  detained under the Act on
the ground  that the  order of	detention or  the  continued
detention is  for any reason not under or in compliance with
the Act	 is maintainable.  Second  if  such  a	petition  is
maintainable  what  is	the  scope  or	extent	of  judicial
scrutiny particularly  in view	of  the	 Presidential  order
dated 27  June, 1975  mentioning, inter	 alia, <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_605">Article 22</a> of
the Constitution  and also  in view  of sub  section (9)  of
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_606">section 16A</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_148">     The Attorney  General contended  that  the	 object	 and
purpose of  emergency provisions  is that  the	Constitution
provides special  powers to  the Executive  because at	such
times  of  emergency  the  considerations  of  state  assume
importance. It	has been  recognised  that  times  of  grave
national emergency  demand grant  of special  power  to	 the
Executive   Emergency provisions  contained  in	 Part  XVIII
including Articles 358,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">219</span>
359(1)	and  359(1A)  are  constitutional  imperatives.	 The
validity of   law  cannot be  challenged on  the  ground  of
infringing a fundamental right mentioned in the Presidential
Order under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_607">Article 359(1).</a>   Similarly,  if the  Executive
take any  action depriving  a person  of a fundamental right
mentioned in  the Presidential	order any not complying with
the law	 such Executive action can not be challenged because
such challenge	would  amount  in  substance  to  and  would
directly impinge  on the  enforcement of  fundamental rights
mentioned in the Presidential order. The reason given by the
Attorney General  behind e  principle is  that in  times  of
emergency the  Executive  safeguards  the  life	 of  nation.
Challenge to  Executive actions	 either on  the ground	that
these are  arbitrary or	 unlawful  has	been`  negatived  in
England in Liversidge v. Anderson(l) and Greene v. Secretary
of State  for Home Affairs(') and also by this Court in <a href="/doc/1102062/" id="a_608">Sree
Mohan Chowdhury	 v. the	 Chief Commissioner, Union Territory
of Tripura</a>(3) and Makhan Singh v, State of Punjab(4).
</p><p id="p_149">     The contentions  of the respondents are as follows: The
arguments on  behalf of	 the  state  mean  that	 during	 the
emergency there	 is no right to life or liberty. <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_609">Article 358</a>
is  more  extensive  as	 the  fundamental  right  itself  is
suspended. The	Presidential order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_610">Article 359(1)</a> does
not suspend any fundamental right.
</p><p id="p_150">     Second, the  object of  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_611">Article 359(1)</a> is to bar moving
the Supreme  Court under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_612">Article 32</a>  for the enforcement of
certain specified rights without affecting in any manner the
enforcement of	common law  and statutory rights to personal
liberty under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_613">Article 226</a> before the High Court.
</p><p id="p_151">     Third, <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_614">Article  359(1)</a> removes  the fetter	 in Part III
but does  not remove the fetters arising from the principles
of limited power of the Executive under the system of checks
and balances based on separation of powers.
</p><p id="p_152">     Fourth, while  the Presidential  order operates only in
respect of  fundamental rights mentioned in the Presidential
order it  would not affect the rights of personal liberty at
common law or under statute law or under natural law.
</p><p id="p_153">     Fifth, <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_615">Article  359(1)</a> is not to protect illegal orders
of the	Executive. The Executive cannot flout the command of
Parliament relying  on	 a Presidential	 older under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_616">Article
359(1).</a> The  suspension	 of  fundamental  right	 or  of	 its
enforcement cannot  increase the power of the executive vis-
a-vis the individual.
</p><p id="p_154">     Sixth, there  is no reason to equate the state with the
Executive. The	suspension of  the fundamental	right or the
right to  enforce it  has  only	 this  consequence  that  it
enables the  Legislature  to  make  laws  violative  of	 the
suspended fundamental  rights and the Executive to implement
such laws.  The suspension of the fundamental right does not
unable the  Executive  to  flout  legislative  mandates	 and
judicial decisions.

</p><p id="p_156">     (3) [1964] 3 S. C. R. 442.	   (4) [196414 Sr C. R. 797.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">220</span>
<p id="p_157">     Seventh, the  Executive can  act to  the  prejudice  of
citizens only  to the  extent permitted	 by valid  laws. The
Proclamation of Emergency does not widen the Executive power
of the state under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_617">Article 162</a> so as to empower the State to
take  any   Executive  action  which  it  is  not  otherwise
competent to take.
</p><p id="p_158">     Eighth, the  right to arrest is conferred by the Act on
the State  and their  officers only  if the  conditions laid
down under <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_618">section 3</a> of the Act are fulfilled. Therefore, if
the conditions	laid down under <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_619">section 3</a> of the Act are not
complied with  by the  detaining authority then the order of
detention would be ultra vires the said Act.
</p><p id="p_159">     Ninth, Habeas  corpus is  a remedy	 not  only  for	 the
enforcement of	he right to personal liberty,, whether under
natural law  or a  statute but	is also	 a  remedy  for	 the
enforcement of	the principle  of ultra vires viz., when the
detaining authority has failed to comply with the conditions
laid down  in <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_620">section  3</a> of the Act. In such a case the High
Court has  jurisdiction to issue a writ af haheas corpus for
the enforcement of the principle of ultra vire.;.
</p><p id="p_160">     In England	 it was	 the practice  in times of danger to
the state  to	pass what  were popularly  known  as  Habeas
Corpus Suspension  Acts. Suspension did not legalise illegal
arrest; it  merely suspended  a particular remedy in respect
of particular  offences. Accordingly  it was the practice in
England at  the close of the period of suspension to pass an
<a href="/doc/528544/" id="a_621">Indemnity Act</a>  in order	 to protect  official concerned from
the consequences  of any  incidental illegal acts which they
might have  committed under  cover of  the suspension of the
prerogative writ.
</p><p id="p_161">     In England	 the  Defence  of  the	Realm  Acts  1914-18
empowered the  Executive to  make regulations  by  order  in
Council for securing the public safety or for the defence of
the realm.   In	 The King  v. Hallday  Ex parte Zadiq(1) the
House of  Lords held  that  a  regulation  was	valid  which
authorised the	Secretary  of  state  to  detain  a  British
subject on the grounds of his hostile origin or association.
It was	contended on  behalf of	 Zadiq	that  there  was  no
provision for  imprisonment without  trial. The	 substantial
contention was	that general  words in	a statute  could not
take away  the vested  right  of  a  subject  or  alter	 the
fundamental law	 of the	 Constitution because  it  would  be
repugnant to  the Constitutional  tradition of	the country.
The majority  of the  court swept  aside these arguments and
held that  on the construction of the Act. the Executive had
unrestricted powers.
</p><p id="p_162">     During  the  Second  World	 War  the  Emergency  Powers
(Defence) Act,	1939 in	 England  empowered  the  making  of
regulations for the detention of persons by the Secretary of
state in  the interests	 of the public safety or the defence
of the	realm, and  for authority  to enter  and search	 any
premises.
</p><p id="p_163">     Although access to the courts was not barred during the
Second World War in England the scope for judicial review of
executive action
     (1) [1917] A. C. 260.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">221</span>
<p id="p_164">was  limited.  The  courts  could  not	consider  whether  a
particular regulation  is necessary  or	 expedient  for	 the
purpose of  the Act  which authorised  it. The	question  of
necessity or  expediency  was  one  for	 the  Government  to
decide. The  court could, however, hold an act to be illegal
as being  not authorised  by the  regulation relied  upon to
Justify it.

detention by  application for  a writ  of habeas corpus, but
such application had little chance of success in view of the
decision of the House of Lords in Liversidge's case (supra).
The House  of Lords  took the  view that the power to detain
could not  be controlled  by the  courts,  if  only  because
considerations of  security forbade  proof of  the  evidence
upon which  detention was ordered. It was sufficient for the
Home Secretary	to have	 a belief  which  in  his  mind	 was
reasonable. The	 courts would  not enquire  into the grounds
for his	 belief,  although  apparently	they  might  examine
positive evidence  of mala  fides or  mistaken identity.  In
Greece's case (supra) the House of Lords held that a mistake
on the	part of	 the advisory  committee in  failing, as was
required by  the regulation,  to give  the appellant correct
reasons for  his detention  did not  invalid  the  detention
order. It  is noticeable  how the  same House expressed this
view without any dissent.

or a  State of	siege'`. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_622">Under	the Act</a>	 of 1881  the  Irish

prison any person arrested on suspicion for the whole period

public safety  may require  it.	 In  America  the  power  in
suspend	 the  privilege	 is  a	legislative  power  and	 the
President cannot  exercise it  except as  authorised by law.
The suspension	does not  legalise what	 is doing  while  it

the. court  is not merely an inappropriate tribunal, but one
the jurisdiction of which is unworkable and even illusory in
these cases.  A court  of law  could not  have before it the

Second, is  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_628">Article 21</a>	the sole  repository of right to the

</p><p id="p_178">     The first	question turns	on the	depth and content of

<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_630">Article 358</a> and <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_631">Article 359</a> is that <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_632">Article 358</a> suspends the

fundamental right.  While a  Proclamation of Emergency is in
operation the  Presidential order  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_636">Article  359(1)</a> can
suspend the  enforcement of  any or  all fundamental rights.
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_637">Article 359(1)</a> also suspends any pending proceedings for the
enforcement of such fundamental right or rights. The purpose

fundamental right  mentioned in	 the Presidential  order  is
barred or it remains suspended during the emergency. Another
important distinction  between	the  two  Articles  is	that
<a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_639">Article 355</a>  provides for  indemnity where as <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_640">Article 359(1)</a>

which may  be mentioned	 in  a	Presidential  order  and  is

the  scope  of	<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_646">Article	 359(1)</a>	 is  only  to  restrict	 the
application of	the Article to the Legislative field and not
to the	Acts of	 the  Executive.  The  reason  is  that	 and
enforcement of	the  fundamental  rights  mentioned  in	 the
Presidential order is barred
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">224</span>

enforcement of	fundamental rights  and will,  therefore, be
within the mischief of the Presidential order. The effect of

necessarily apply  to Executive	 acts because Executive acts
are challenged	on the	grounds of being contrary to law and
without	 the   authority  of  law.  The	 submission  of	 the
respondents that  a person  in detention can come to a court
of law	in spite  of the  Presidential order  under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_695">Article
359(1)</a> and contend that a habeas corpus should be issued for
his release or that the Executive should answer the detenu's
challenge that the Act complained of is without authority of
law or	the challenge  of the  detenu that the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/1369884/" id="a_696">Legislative	 Act</a> under which the detention has been made
have  not   been  complied   with  are	all  rooted  in	 the

entertain such applications and allow the detenus to enforce
to start  or continue  proceedings  or	enforce	 fundamental
rights.	 <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_697">Article  359(1)</a>  will	be  nullified  and  rendered

</p><p id="p_194">     This Court	 in Makhan Singh's case (supra) said that if
there was  challenge to	 the validity of the detention order
based on  any  right  other  than  those  mentioned  in	 the

could not be suspended by the Presidential order because the
right was  outside <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_698">Article  359(1).</a> This  was  explained  by
stating that  if the  detention was challenged on the ground
that it contravened the mandatory provisions of the relevant
Act or that it was malafide and was proved to be so, the bar
of the Presidential order could have no application.
</p><p id="p_195">     This observation  in Makhan  Singh's case (supra) is to
be understood  in the context of the question that arose for
decision there.	 Decision on  a point  not necessary for the
purpose of  or which  does not fall to be determined in that
decision  becomes  an  obiter  dictum  [<a href="/doc/660275/" id="a_699">See  Maharajadhiraja
Madhav Rao  Jiwaji Rao	Scindia Bahadur	 &amp; Ors.	 v. Union of
India</a>(1). In  Makhan  Singh's  case  (supra)  the  detention
orders which  were the	subject matter	of the judgment were
orders made  by the  Executive under  the Defence  of  India
ordinance or  Act and rules and orders made thereunder which
was the	 express condition for detention in respect of which

pointed out  that the  Presidential  order  of	1962  was  a
conditional one	 and therefore	if a  person was deprived of
his personal  liberty not  under the Act or rules and orders
made thereunder	 but in	 contravention thereof, his right to
move the  courts in  that regard  would not be suspended The
decision of this Court in Pandurang's case (supra) is by the
Constitution Bench  of five  learned Judges,  three of	whom
were on	 the Constitution  Bench  of  seven  learned  Judges
deciding Makhan	 Singh's case  (supra). In  Pandurang's case
(supra) the ratio was that if a personal was deprived of his
personal liberty  not under the Act or rules and orders made
thereunder but	in contravention  thereof, his right to move
the courts in that regard was not suspended
     It,  therefore,   follows	 from	the   decisions	  in
Pandurang's case  and Makhan  Singh's case  (supra) that the
ratio in both the cases was that the 1962 Presidential order
being a	 conditional one  the enforcement  of  rights  under
Articles 21  and 22  was suspended only to the extent of the
conditions laid	 down in  the  Presidential  order  and	 the
suspension  could   not	 operate   in  areas   outside	 the
conditions. There is no aspect whatever. Of any condition in
the present  Presidential order. Therefore, the decisions in
Makhan Singh's	case (supra)  and subsequent cases following
it have	 no application	 to  the  present  cases  where	 the
suspension is  not hedged  with any condition of enforcement
of any	right under  Articles 21  and 22. The conclusion for
the forging  reasons is that the Presidential order is a bar
at the threshold.
</p><p id="p_199">     The heart	of the	matter is  whether <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_703">Article 21</a> is the

answer	to   that  question   be  in   the  affirmative	 the

</p><p id="p_200">     The contentions  of the  Attorney General are two-fold.
First, the  legal enforceable  right to personal liberty for
violation thereof  by the  Executive is	 a fundamental right
conferred by the Constitution and is embodied in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_704">Article 21.</a>
Second, apart  from <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_705">Article 21</a> the right to personal liberty
against the  Executive is  neither a  common law right nor a
statutory right	 nor a	natural right.	He relies  on  three
decisions.  The	  earliest  is	<a href="/doc/1788368/" id="a_706">Girindra  Nath	Banerjee  v.
Birendra Nath Pal</a>(2). The others are King Emperor v. Sibnath
Banerjee(3) and	 Makhan Singh's	 case (supra).	In the first
two decisions  it has  been held  that the  right to  habeas
corpus is  only under  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_707">section 491</a>  of the  Code of Criminal
Procedure. In  Makhan Singh's  case (supra) it has been said
that this right under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_708">section 491</a> became embodied in Article
</p><p id="p_201">21. The	 statutory right  under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_709">section	 491</a> of	 the Code of

     The arguments on behalf of the respondents are that the
right to   life	 and personal liberty is not only in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_710">Article
21</a> but also under common law and statutes for these reasons.
</p><p id="p_205">     The right	to personal liberty is contained in Articles
19, 20	and 22,	 and, therefore,  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_711">Article 21</a> is not the sole
repository to  personal liberty. The respondents rely on the
decision is  <a href="/doc/513801/" id="a_712">Rustom Cavasjee  Cooper v.	 Union	of  India</a>(1)
where it  was said  that the  ruling in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_713">A. K. Gopalan v. the
State of  Madras</a>(2) that  Articles 19  and 22  are  mutually

Sripadagalavaru v.  State of  Kerala</a>(6) is that there are no
natural rights.	 fundamental rights  in our Constitution are
interpreted to	lie what  is commonly  said  to	 be  natural
rights. The  only right the life and liberty is enshrined in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_718">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_207">     In A.  K. Gopalan's  case (supra) it has been said that
to read	 law   as meaning  natural law	is to lay down vague
standards. Law means law enacted by the State. Law must have
some firmness. Law means positive State made law. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_719">Article 21</a>
has been  interpreted in  A. K.	 Gopalan's case	 (supra)  to
include substantive  as well as procedural law in the phrase
"procedure established by law". The reason is obvious. A law
providing for  procedure depriving  a person of liberty must
be a  law made	by statute. <a href="/doc/525184/" id="a_720">P. D. Shamdasani v. Central Bank
of India Ltd</a>.(7) held that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_721">Article 21</a> is prohibition against
unauthorised  executive	 action.  In  Shrimati	Vidya  Verma
through next  friend R.	 V. S.	Mani  v.  Dr.  Shiva  Narain
Verma(8) law  in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_722">Article 21</a> has been held in mean State made
law.
</p><p id="p_208">     In Makhan	Singh's case  (supra) it  was  decided	that
during the  subsistence of the Presidential order suspending
the enforcement	 of fundamental	 rights neither	 a  petition

accentuates by	reason thereof the importance of that right.
The negative  language is  worded to  emphasise the immunity

case (supra) at p. 568). Similarly <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_729">Article 21</a> is our Rule of
Law regarding  life and	 liberty. No  other rule  of law can
have separate  existence as  a distinct	 right. The negative
language of  fundamental  right	 incorporated  in  Part	 III
imposes limitations  on the  power of the State and declares
the  corresponding  guarantee  of  the	individual  to	that
fundamental  right.   The  limitation	and  guarantee	 are
complementary. The  limitation of State action embodied in a
fundamental right couched in negative form is the measure of
the protection of the individual.

affected could	move a	competent court by way of a suit for
false imprisonment and claim damages.
</p><p id="p_227">     Suits for	false imprisonment are one of the categories

to ask	for a  writ of	habeas corpus  as a matter of common

present appeals	 the Act  is not  challenged nor  can it  be

reason why  reference is made at this stage to <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_771">Article 20</a> is
to show	 that <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_772">Article  20</a> is a constitutional mandate to the
Judiciary and  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_773">Article 21</a> is a constitutional mandate to the

also include  the Judiciary  and <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_775">Article  20</a> is	 enforceable
against the  Judiciary in  respect of  illegal	orders.	 The
answer is  that <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_776">Article	 20</a> is	a  prohibition	against	 the
Judiciary in  the cases	 contemplated there.  If a person is
detained after the Judiciary acts contrary to the provision,

the  provisions	  in  <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_778">Article  20</a>  such,  detention  can  be
challenged by  moving the  court against  the Executive	 for
wrongful detention  or conviction  or punishment as the case
may be.	 The expression	 "No person  shall be prosecuted for
the same  offence more	than once" in <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_779">Article 20</a> would apply

fundamental rights  cannot be enforced against the Judiciary
in case of illegal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">233</span>
orders. The  decision in <a href="/doc/623555/" id="a_780">Ram  Narayan Singh  v. The State of
Delhi	&amp; Ors</a>.(1)  is no  authority for the proposition that
fundamental rights  can be  enforced against  the Judiciary.
This Court  held that  the  detention  of  Ram	Narayan	 was
illegal because	 Ram Narayan  was being detained without any
order of  remand by  the Magistrate.  In Ram  Narayan's case
(supra) there  was no  aspect of the bar. under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_781">Article 359.</a>
It is  not correct to say that the suspension of fundamental
rights or  of	their enforcement  can increase the power of
the Executive.	The effect  of suspension  or enforcement of
fundamental   rights is	 that an  individual cannot move any
court for  the	enforcement  of	 his  fundamental  right  to

<a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_783">Article 256</a> do. not confer any right on any person. It deals

liberty.  In  a	 criminal  proceeding  the  accused  defends

given against  the Government  could be	 enforced because of

decree conclusively  determines the rights of the parties in
the suit  and after  a decree  is passed  the right  of	 the
decree-holder  is   not	 founded   on  the  right  which  is
recognised by  the decree  but on  the decree  itself.	This

Court said that what under the Government of India Act was a

<p id="p_248">cannot enforce	any statutory  right under  the Act  for the
same reason   that it will amount to enforce his fundamental
right to  personal liberty  by contending that the Executive
is depriving  him of  his personal  liberty not according to
"procedure established by law". Similarly, the example given
of an illegal detention of a person by a Police officer will
be met with the same plea.
</p><p id="p_249">     An argument  was advanced	on behalf of the respondents
that if	 n pre-existing	 law is	 merged in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_804">Article 21</a> there
will be	 conflict with	<a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_805">Article 372.</a>  The expression "law in

incorporated in	 the Constitution  viz., in  Part  III.	 The
expression "law"  in Articles  19(1) and 21 takes in statute
law.
</p><p id="p_250">     The respondents  contended that permanent law cannot be
repealed by  temporary law.  The argument  is irrelevant and
misplaced. The	Presidential order  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_807">Article  359(1)</a> is
not a  law. The	 order does  not real  any law	either.	 The
suggestion that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_808">Article 21</a> was intended to afford protection
to life	 and personal  liberty against violation lay private
individuals  was   rejected  in	 Shamdasani's  case  (supra)
because	 there	 cannot	 be  any  question  of	one  private
individual being authorised by law to deprive another of his
property or  taking away  the life and liberty of any person
by procedure  established by  law.  The	 entire	 concept  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_809">Article 21</a>  is against	Executive action.  In Vidya  Verma's
case (supra)  this Court  said that  there is no question of
infringement of fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_810">Article 21</a> where the
detention complained  of is by a private person and not by a
State or under the authority or orders of a State.
</p><p id="p_251">     <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_811">The Act</a>  in the  present case  is valid  law and it has
laid down procedure of applying the law. The validity of the
Act has	 not been  challenged and  cannot be challenged. The
Legislature has	 competence to	make the law. The procedure?
therefore. cannot  be challenged  because Articles 21 and 22
cannot be  enforced. The  suggestion of the respondents that
the power of the Executive is widened is equally untenable.
</p><p id="p_252">     The suggestion  on behalf	of the	respondents that the
right to  private  defence  is	available  and	if  any	 one
resorted to  private defence  in resisting  detention  there
might be  civil war  is an  argument to	 excite emotion.  If
there are signs of civil wars as the respondents suggestion,
it is  for the	Government of  our country  to deal with the
situation. It  is because of these aspects that emergency is
not justifiable because no court can have proper standard to
measure the  problems of  emergency in	the country.  If any
person detained finds that the official has the authority to
arrest him  no question of resistance arises and if there is
no authority  the  same	 cannot	 be  challenged	 during	 the
operation of  the Presidential	order but  the person  shall
have his  remedy for any false imprisonment after the expiry
of the Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_253">     The respondents  submitted that  if <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_812">Article 21</a> were the
repository of a right to personal liberty it would mean that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_813">Article 21</a>  destroyed pre-existing  rights and	then made  a
fresh grant. There is no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">236</span>
question of destruction of any right. Our fundamental rights
came  into   existence	for   the  first   time	 under	 the
Constitution. The  fact that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_814">section 491</a> of the old<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_815"> Criminal
Procedure  Code</a>	  has  been   abolished	 in   the  new	Code
establishes that  the pre-existing  right was  embodied as a
fundamental right in the Constitution. The right to personal
liberty	 because   identified  with   fundamental  right  to
personal liberty under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_816">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_254">     The third question is whether Rule of law overrides the
Presidential Order.   The  Presidential Order does not alter
or suspended any law. The Rue of law is not a mere catchword
or  incantation.  Rule	of  Law	 is  not  a  law  of  nature
consistent  and	  invariable  at   all	times	and  in	 all
circumstances.	 The certainly of law is one of the elements
in the concept of the Rule of law but it is only one element
and taken by itself, affords little guidance.  The essential
feature if  Rule of  law is  that the  judicial power of the
state is to a large extent, separate from  the Executive and
the Legislature.  The Rule  of Law us a normative as much as
it is  a descriptive term. It  expresses an ideal as much as
a juristic  fact.   The Rule  of Law is nit identical with a
free society.	If  the sphere	of the	Rule of Law involves
what can  be called the "Existence of the Democratic system"
it means  two things.	In  the first  place the  individual
liberties of  a democratic  system involves the right of the
members of  each society  to choose the Government under the
which they lie.	 In the second place come freedom of speech,
freedom of  assembly and  freedom f  association.  These are
not absolute  tights, Their  exceptions are justified by the
necessity if reconciling the claims of different individuals
to those  rights,  The criterion whereby this reconciliation
an be  effected is  the concern	 of law	 to ensure  that the
status and  dignity of	all individuals	 is to	the greatest
possible extent observed.
</p><p id="p_255">     Freedom of speech may be limited by conception as clear
present danger",  attack, on the free democratic order". The
institutions and  procedures by which the fundamental regard
for the	 status and  dignity  of  the  human  person  an  be
effected is  that rights  and remedies	are complimentary to
the other,  The phrases	 such as  "equality before  law"  or
"equal protection  of the laws: are in themselves equivocal.
The supremacy  of the  law means  that the  faith  of  civil
liberty depends	 on the	 man who  has  to  administer  civil
liberty much  more than	 on any	 legal	formula.  Aristotle,
pointed	  out  that  the  rigid	 certainty  of	law  is	 not
applicable to  all circumstances.  this plea would be echoed
by the	modern administrator  called upon  to deal  with the
ever changing  circumstances of	 economic and social life of
the nation.
</p><p id="p_256">     The respondents  contend  that  all  executive  actions
which operate  to the  prejudice of any person must have the
authority of  law to  support it.  Reliance is placed on the
decisions in  <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_817">Rai Sahib	 Ram Jawaya Kapur  Ors. v. The State
of Punjab</a>(1)  <a href="/doc/766560/" id="a_818">M.P State	 v. Bharat  Singh</a> (2)  <a href="/doc/264147/" id="a_819">Collector  v.

India(1) and  <a href="/doc/1758272/" id="a_821">Meenakshi Mills  v. Union of India</a>(2). This is
amplified by  the respondents  to mean	that  the  Executive
cannot detain  a person otherwise than under any legislation
and on	the suspension of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_822">Article 21</a> or the right to enforce
it, the	 Executive cannot  get any  right to act contrary to
law.
</p><p id="p_257">     The Executive  cannot detain  a person  otherwise	than
under valid  legislation. The  suspension of any fundamental
right does  not effect	this rule  of the  Constitution.  In
normal situations  when there is no emergency and when there
is no  Presidential order  of the type like the present tile
situation is  different. In Bharat Singh's case (supra) this
Court was  concerned with the pre-emergency law and an order
of the	Executive thereunder.  It was  held  that  the	pre-
emergency law  was void	 as violative  of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_823">Article  19</a>,	and,
therefore, such	 a law	being pre-emergency  law  could	 not

</p><p id="p_258">     The ratio	in Bharat  Singh's  case  (supra)  is  this:

acts outside   his  authority, it will be an illegal act and
the High  Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_847">Article 226</a> can deal with it. Reliance
is placed  on the  English decision  in Christie  &amp; Anr.  v.
Leachinsky(1) in  support of the proposition that the action
of an individual officer will be an Executive action when he
acts within the scope of his authority. ,
     The decision  in Leachinsky's case (supra) is an action
for false  imprisonment and  damages against  two persons of

question. There	 are three  principal grounds why this Court
should express	views. First.  The Bombay High Court (Nagpur
Bench) has  read down  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_873">section 16A(9)</a> of the Act. One of the
appeals is  from the  judgment	of  the	 Bombay	 High  Court
(Nagpur Bench).	 This judgment	directly raises the question
of  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_874">section  16A(9)</a>  of	 the  Act.  Second.  The  Additional
Solicitor General  made his  submissions on this part of the
case  and   all	 counsel  for  the  respondents	 made  their
submissions in reply. Considerable time was spent on hearing
submissions on	both sides. Time of the Court is time of the
nation. Third.	It is only proper that when so much time has
been taken  on these  questions this  Court  should  express
opinions and lay down areas for judicial scrutiny.

<p id="p_289">     The respondents  contend that if the Presidential order
does not   bar	the challenge  on the ground that the orders
are malafide  or that  the orders are not made in accordance
with the  Act the  non-supply of grounds will not affect the
jurisdiction of	 the Court.  It is  said by  the respondents
that the  scope of  judicial scrutiny is against orders. The
respondents submit  that court has gone behind the orders of
detention in large number of cases.
</p><p id="p_290">     The respondents  submit as	 follows: It  is open to the
Court to  judge the  legality of  the orders. This the Court
can do	by going  beyond the  order. Though  satisfaction is
recorded in  the order	and such  recording of	satisfaction
raises the presumption of legality of order the initial onus
on a  detenu is	 only to the extent of creating "disquieting
doubts" in  the mind  of the  Court. The doubts are that the
orders are  based on  irrelevant non-existing  facts  or  on
facts on  which no  reasonable person  could be satisfied in
respect of  matters set out in <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_875">section 3</a> of the Act. If such
a prima	 facie case is established the burden shifts and the
detaining  authority   must  satisfy  the  court  about	 the
legality of  detention	and  the  detaining  authority	must
remove doubts on all aspects of legality which have been put
in issue. If the detaining authority for whatever reasons ]
fails to satisfy the court either by not filing an affidavit
or not placing such facts which may resolve the doubts about
the legality  of detention  the court  may direct release of
the detenus.
</p><p id="p_291">     The respondents  submit that all that they want is that
if the	detenus challenge the orders to be malafide or to be
not in compliance with the statute and if the court does not
have any  "disquieting doubts"	the court  will dismiss	 the
petitions. If  the court  has any  such doubt the court will
call for  the return. On a return being made if the court is
satisfied that	the return  is an  adequate answer the court
will dismiss  the petition.  If the court wants to look into
the grounds  the court	will ask  for the  production M	 the
grounds and  the court itself will look into the grounds but
will not  show the  grounds to	the detenus.  In short,	 the
respondents submit  that the  jurisdiction of  the court  to
entertain the  application should  not be  taken away  as  a
result of the Presidential order. F
     The appellants  submit that if <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_876">Article 359</a> is not a bar
at the	threshold and if the Court can entertain a petition,
judicial review	 should be  limited within a narrow area. In
the forefront  16A(9) of the Act is put because that section
forbids	 disclosure   of  grounds  and	information  in	 the
possession of  the detaining  authority. The Nagpur Bench of
the Bombay  High Court	read down  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_877">section  16A(9)</a>  but	 the
Additional Solicitor  General submitted	 that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_878">section 16A(9)</a>
should not  be	read  down  because  it	 enacts	 a  rule  of
evidence.
</p><p id="p_292">     The Additional  Solicitor General submitted as follows:
the scrutiny  by  courts  will	extend	to  examining  first
whether detention  is in  exercise or  purported exercise of
law. That  will be  to find  out whether  there is  a  legal
foundation for detention. The second enquiry will be whether
the law	 is valid law. If it is a pre-emergency law the same
can be	tested as  to whether it was valid with reference to
Articles
     18-833Sup. CI/76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">242</span>
14, 19,	 21 and	 22. If	 it is	an emergency legislation the
validity of  law cannot	 be  gone  into	 first,	 because  of
<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_879">Article 358</a>,  and, second, because of the Presidential order
under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_880">Article  359.</a> The	 other matters	which the  court may
examine are  whether the  detaining authority is a competent
authority under	 the law  to pass  the	order,	whether	 the
detenu has  been properly  identified,	whether	 the  stated
purpose is  one which ostensibly conforms to law and whether
the procedural safeguards enacted by the law are followed.
</p><p id="p_293">     With regard  to grounds  of detention it is said by the
Additional  Solicitor	General	 that  if  the	grounds	 are
furnished or  are required  to be  furnished the  Court	 can
examine whether	 such grounds  ex-facie	 justify  reasonable
apprehension of	 the detaining	authority. Where the grounds
are not	 to be	furnished, it is said that this enquiry does
not arise.  The Additional  Solicitor General  submits	that
judicial scrutiny  cannot  extend  to  three  matters-first,
objective appraisal of the essential subjective satisfaction
of the	detaining  authority,  second,	examination  of	 the
material and  information before the detaining authority for
the purpose  of testing	 the satisfaction  of the authority,
and, third,  directing compulsory  production  of  the	file
relating to detenu or drawing and adverse inference from the
non-production thereof.
</p><p id="p_294">     Material and  information on which orders of preventive
detention are  passed  necessarily  belong  to	a  class  of
documents  whose   disclosure  would   impair	the   proper
functioning of	public service	and administration. The file
relating to  a detention  order	 must  contain	intelligence
reports and like information whose confidentiality is beyond
reasonable question.  This was	the view  taken in  the Live
sidge (1)  case. See  also Rogers(2) case. If privilege were
to be  claimed in  each case  such a claim would in terms of
<a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_881">sections  123</a>	and  <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_882">162</a>  of  the  Evidence  Act  have	been
invariably upheld.  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_883">Article  22(G)</a>  also  contemplates	such
claims on  behalf of  the State.  That	is  why	 instead  of
leaving it  to individual  decision in	each case  or to the
discretion of  individual detaining  authorities to  make  a
claim for  privilege, the  legislature has  enacted  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_884">section
16A(9)</a> providing  for a	 general exclusion  from evidence of
all  such   material  as  would	 properly  fall	 within	 the
classification.
</p><p id="p_295">     <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_885">Section 16A</a>  cannot be  said  to  be  an  amendment  to
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_886">Article 226.</a>  The jurisdiction	to issue  writs	 is  neither
abrogated nor  abridged. A  claim  of  privilege  arises  in
regard to  documents or	 information where a party to a suit
or proceeding  is called  upon to  produce evidence. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_887">Section
16A(9)</a> enacts  provisions analogous to a conclusive proof of
presumption. Such a provision is a genuine rule of evidence.
It is  in the  nature of  an Explanation to <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_888">sections 123</a> and
<a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_889">162</a> of	the Evidence  Act.  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_890">Section  16A(9)</a>  is	 a  rule  of
evidence. Therefore when the detaining authority is bound by
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_891">section 16A(9)</a> and forbidden absolutely from disclosing such
material no question can arise for adverse inference against
the authority.	If a detenu makes out a prime facie case and
the court calls for a return, the affidavit of the

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">243</span>
<p id="p_296">authority will	be an answer. The Court cannot insist on the
production of  the file	 or hold that the case of the detenu
stands unrebutted  by reason of such non-disclosure. To hold
otherwise would be to induce reckless averments of malafides
to force production of the file which is forbidden by law.
</p><p id="p_297">     <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_892">Section  16A(9)</a>   cannot  be   read  down	implying  an
exception in  favour of	 disclosure  to	 the  Court  as	 was
suggested by  the Bombay  High Court  (Nagpur  Bench).	Such
disclosure to  the court  alone and  not to  the detenu will
introduce something unknown to judicial procedure. This will
bring in  an element  of  arbitrariness	 and  preclude	both
parties from  representing their  respective cases. Further,
it would  substitute or	 super-impose  satisfaction  of	 the
Court for  that of  the Executive.  This Court has held that
the view of the detaining authority is not to be substituted
by the	view of	 the court. (<a href="/doc/1382411/" id="a_893">See State of Bombay v. Atma Ram

(5) and	 (8) have  no application  in these cases. The court
cannot strike  down the	 order as  vitiated by	malafide and
grant relief  since it is not possible for the court without
the examination	 of such  grounds, materials and information
to decide  whether the	order of  detention is the result of
malice or ill-will. When the court cannot give any relief on
that  basis   the  contention	of  malafides  is  not	only
ineffective but also untenable. (<a href="/doc/302539/" id="a_912">See Lawrence Joachim Joesph

</p><p id="p_304">     The provision  for periodical  review entrusted  to the
Government under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_913">section 16A(4)</a> of the Act in the context of
emergency provides a sufficient safeguard against the misuse
of power of detention or arbitrary malafide detention during
the emergency.	The Government	is in full possession of the
grounds,  materials   and  information	 relating   to	 the
individual detentions while exercising the power of review.
</p><p id="p_305">     The jurisdiction  of the court in times of emergency in
respect of  detention under the Act is restricted by the Act
because	 the  Government  is  entrusted	 with  the  task  of
periodical review.  Even if the generality of the words used
in <a href="/doc/188392346/" id="a_914">section  3(1)</a> of  the Act  may not  be taken	 to show  an
intention to  depart from  the principle  in ordinary  times

<p id="p_307">fides. (See  Smith v.  East Elloe  Rural District  Council &amp;
Ors.(1) and  Ram Manohar  Lohia's case (supra) at 716, 732).
This Court  said that  an action  to decide the order on the
grounds	 of   malafides	 does  not  lie	 because  under	 the
provisions no  action is  maintainable for the purpose. This
Court also  referred to	 the decision in the Liversidge case
(supra) where  the Court  held that  the jurisdiction of the
court was  ousted in  such way	that even  questions of	 bad
faith could not be raised.
</p><p id="p_308">     The production of the order which is duly authenticated
constitutes a  peremptory answer  to the challenge. The onus
of showing  that the  detaining authority  was not acting in
good  faith   is  on  the  detenu.  This  burden  cannot  be
discharged because of the difficulty of proving bad faith in
the exercise of subjective discretionary power vested in the
administration.	 De   Smith  in	  his  Judicial	  review  of
<a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_921">Administrative Act</a>ions	1973 Edition  at page  257 seq.	 has
said that  the reservation  for the  case of  bad  faith  in
hardly more  than a formality. Detenu will have to discharge
the impossible	burden of proof that the detaining authority
did not genuinely believe he had reasonable cause
     In	 Lawrence  Joachim  Joseph  D'Souza's  case  (supra)
malafide exercise  of power  was untenable  having regard to
the grounds  on which detention was based. In the context of
emergency <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_922">section  3</a> (1)  of the  Act confers  an  unlimited
discretion which  cannot be examined by courts. This rule of
construction of	 the phrases "is satisfied", "in the opinion
of", "it  appears to be", "has reason to believe" adopted by
courts in  times of  national  emergency  will	be  rendered
nugatory and  ineffective if  allegations of  malafides	 are
gone into.  A distinction is to be drawn between purpose and
motive so  that where  an  exercise  of	 power	fulfils	 the
purpose for  which power  was given, it does not matter that
he who	exercised it  is influenced  by an extraneous motive
because when  an act  is done  which is	 authorised  by	 the
Legislature it	is not	possible to contest that discretion.
So long as the authority is empowered by law action taken to
realise that  purpose is  not malafide.	 when the  order  of
detention is  on the  face of it within the power conferred,
the order is legal.
</p><p id="p_309">     The width and amplitude of the power of detention under
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_923">section 3</a> of the Act is to be adjudged in the context of the
emergency proclaimed  by the  President.  The  Court  cannot
compel the  detaining authority	 to give  the particulars of
the grounds on which he had reasonable cause to believe that
it was	necessary to exercise this control. An investigation
into facts or allegations of facts based on malafides is not
permissible because such a course will involve advertence to
the grounds  of detention  and materials  constituting those
grounds which  is  not	competent  in  the  context  of	 the
emergency.
</p><p id="p_310">     For  the  foregoing  reasons  the	conclusions  are  as
follows:-
</p><p id="p_311">     First. In view of the Presidential order dated 27 June,
1975 under  clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_924">Article 359</a> of our Constitution no
person has locus
     (1) [1956] A. C. 736 at 776.

<p id="p_312">standi to  move any writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_925">Article 226</a> before a
High Court  for habeas	corpus or any other writ or order or
direction to  enforce any  right to  personal liberty  of  a
person detained	 under the Act on the grounds that the order
of detention  or the  continued detention  is for any reason
not under  or in  compliance with  the Act  or is illegal or
malafide.
</p><p id="p_313">     Second. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_926">Article  21</a> is the sole repository of rights to
life and  personal liberty against the State. Any claim to a
writ of	 habeas corpus is enforcement of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_927">Article 21</a> and, is,
therefore, barred by the Presidential order
     Third. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_928">Section 16A(9)</a> of the Act is valid. It is a rule
of evidence  and it  is not  open either to the detenu or to
the court to ask for grounds of detention.
</p><p id="p_314">     Fourth. It	 is not	 competent for	any court to go into
questions of  malafides of  the order  of detention or ultra
vires character	 of the order of detention or that the order
was  not   passed  on  the  satisfaction  of  the  detaining
authority.
</p><p id="p_315">     The appeals  are accepted.	 The judgments	of the	High
Courts are set aside.
</p><p id="p_316">     KHANNA, J.-Law  of preventive  detention, of  detention
without trial  is an anathema to all those who love personal
liberty. Such  a law  makes deep  inroads into	basic  human
freedoms  which	 we  all  cherish  and	which  occupy  prime
position among	the higher  values of life. It is" therefore
not surprising	that those who have an abiding faith ill the
rule of	 law and  sanctity of personal liberty do not easily
reconcile themselves  with a  law under which persons can be
detained for  long periods  without trial.  The proper forum
for bringing  to book  those alleged  to be  guilty  of	 the
infraction of  law and	commission of  crime,  according  to
them, is  the court  of law  where the	correctness  of	 the
allegations can	 be gone   into in the light of the evidence
adduced at  the trial.	The vesting  of power  of  detention
without trial  in the  executive, the assert, has the effect
of making  the same authority both the prosecutor as well as
the judge and is bound to result in arbitrariness.
</p><p id="p_317">     Those who	are entrusted with the task of administering
The    land  have  another  viewpoint.	According  to  them,
although they  are conscious  of the value of human liberty,
they cannot afford to be obvious of the need of the security
of the	State or  the maintenance  of public order. Personal
liberty has  a value  if the  security of  the State  is not
jeopardised and	 the maintenance  of  public  order  is	 not
threatened.  There  can	 be  the  administrator	 assert,  no
freedom to  destroy . Allegiance to ideals of freedom cannot
operate in vacuum. Danger lurks and serious consequences can
follow when  thoughts	 become	 encysted  in  fine  phrases
oblivious of  political realities   and	 the impact  of real
politik. No government can afford to take risks in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">247</span>
matters relating to the security of the State. Liberty, they
accordingly claim,  has to  be measured	 against community's
need for security against internal and external peril.
</p><p id="p_318">     It	 is   with  a  view  to	 balancing  the	 conflicting
viewpoints that the framers of the Constitution made express
provisions for	preventive detention  and at  the same	time
inserted safeguards  to prevent abuse of those powers and to
mitigate the  rigour and  harshness of those provisions. The
dilemma which faced the Constitution-makers in balancing the
two  conflicting  viewpoints  relating	to  liberty  of	 the
subject and  the Security   of	the State  was not, however,
laid to rest for good with the drafting of the Constitution.
It has	presented itself  to this  Court in  one form or the
other ever  since the  Constitution came  into force. A. K'.
Gopalan's(1) was  he first  case where	in a  Bench  of	 six
Judges of this Court dealt with the matter. Another Bench of
seven Judges again dealt with the matter in 1973 in the case
of <a href="/doc/608557/" id="a_929">Shambhu  Nath Sarkar	 v. State of West Bengal &amp; Ors</a>(2) In
between a  number of  Benches have  dealt with	the  various
facets of  the question	 one such  facet has  now  presented
itself to this Constitution Bench
     The question  posed before us is whether in view of the
Presidential order  dated June	27, 1975 under clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_930">article 359</a>  of the  Constiution, any petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_931">article
226</a> before a High Court for writ of habeas corpus to enforce
the right of personal liberty of a person detained under the
Maintenance of	Internal Security Act, 1971 (Act 26 of 1971)
(hereinafter  referred	 to   as   MISA)   as	amended	  is
maintainable. A consequential question which may be numbered
as question  No. 2  is, if  such a petition is maintainable,
what is	 the scope or extent of judicial scrutiny. The above
questions arise	 in criminal  appeals Nos.  279 of 1975" 355
and 356	 of 1975, 1845-49 of 1975, 380 of 1975, 1926 of 1975
389 of	1975, 3	 of 1976,  41 of  1976 and 46 of 1976. These
appeals have been filed against the orders of Madhya Pradesh
High Court,  Allahabad High  Court,  Karnataka	High  Court,
Delhi High  Court, Nagpur  Bench of  Bombay High  Court	 and
Rajasthan High	Court whereby  the High	 Courts repelled the
preliminary objections	relating to  the maintainability  of
petitions under	 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_932">article 226</a>  for writs	 of habeas corpus on
account of  Presidential order	dated June  27, 1975. On the
second question"  some of the high Courts expressed the view
that this  was a  matter which	would  be  gone	 into  while
dealing with  individual cases	on their  merits. The  other
High Courts  went into	the matter and expressed their view.
This judgment would dispose of all the appeals.

Presidential order  dated June	27, 1975  under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1011">article	 359</a>
suspending the	right of  all persons  to move any court for
the enforcement	 of the	 rights conferred  by articles 14 21

laid upon the fact that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">259</span>
the right  to move  the court  for enforcement	of the right
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1012">article  21</a> had been suspended and as such no petition
for a  writ of	habeas corpus  could be	 proceeded with. The
above mentioned	 Presidential order  was  stated  to  be  an
absolute bar  to the  judicial	security  of  the  detention
orders. This  contention did  not find	favour with the High

order the petitions were maintainable and could be proceeded

<p id="p_355">     In these appeals before us, learned Attorney-General on
behalf of  the appellants  has drawn  our attention  to	 the
difference in  phraseology of  the Presidential	 order dated
June 27,  1975 and  the earlier	 Presidential  orders  dated
November 3, 1962 and November 16, 1974 and has urged that in
view of	 the absolute  nature of  the Presidential  order of
June 27,  1975, petition  for a writ of habeas corpus is not
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_356">     There can be no doubt that the Presidential order dated
June 27,  1975 has  been worded	 differently compared to the
earlier Presidential  orders which  were issued under clause
(1) of	<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1013">article 359</a> and that there has been a departure from
the pattern  which used	 to be	adopted while  issuing	such
orders. The  Presidential order	 dated November 16, 1974 has
already been  reproduced earlier.  Presidential order  dated
November 3,  1962 issued  under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1014">article 359</a> of
the Constitution read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">			   "ORDER
	     New Delhi, the 3rd November, 1962
     G.S.R. 146-In  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by
     clause (1)	 of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1015">article  359</a>  of  the  Constiution,	 the
     President hereby  declares that the right of any person
     to move  any court	 for the  enforcement of  the rights
     conferred	by   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1016">article  21</a>   and	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1017">article	 22</a>  of	 the

     issued under  clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1018">article 352</a> thereof on the
     26th October, 1962 is in force, if such person has been
     deprived of  any such rights under the Defence of India
     ordinance, 196  (4 of  1962) or  any rule or order made
     thereunder."
</blockquote><p id="p_357">on November 6, 1962, the rules framed under the ordinance by
the Central  Government were published. On November 11, 1962
the Presidential  order reproduced above was amended and for
the words  and figure  "<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1019">article 21</a>",  the words	 and figures
"articles 14  and 21" were substituted. The Defence of India
ordinance was  subsequently replaced by the Defence of India
Act and	 the rules framed under the ordinance were deemed to
have been  framed  under  the  Act.  Perusal  of  the  above
Presidential order of 1962 shows that what was suspended was
the  right   of	 any  person  to  move	any  court  for	 the
enforcement of	rights conferred  by articles 14, 21 and 22.
The suspension was, however, conditioned by the circumstance
that such  person had been deprived of such rights under the
Defence of  India Act  or any rule or order made thereunder.
It was	plain that in case a detention order was made or any
other action  was taken	 not under  the	 provisions  of	 the
Defence of  India Act  or any rule or order made thereunder,
the same  could not enjoy the protection of the Presidential
order under  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1020">article 359.</a> Another effect of the Presidential
order was  that as long as the proclamation of emergency was
in force,  the validity	 of the provisions of the Defence of
India Act  or the  rules or orders made thereunder could not
be assailed on the ground of being violative of articles 14,
21 and	22. It	is also	 clear that  in view of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1021">article 358</a>,
while a	 proclamation of emergency was in operation, nothing
in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1022">article  19</a> could  have restricted the power of the State
to make	 any law  or to	 take any executive action which the
State could but for the provisions contained in Part III was
competent to make or to take.
</p><p id="p_358">     Likewise, under  the Presidential	order dated November
16, 1974 which has been already reproduced earlier, what was
suspended was the right to move any court with respect to an
order of detention which might have been made or which might
be made	 thereafter under section 3(1)(c) of the Maintenance
of Internal  Security Act  as amended for the enforcement of
rights conferred by articles 14, 21 and clause (4) to (7) of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1023">article 22</a>  of the  Constitution. Proceedings pending in any
court for  the enforcement  of any  of the  aforesaid rights
with respect to orders of detention made under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1024">section 3</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_359">(c) too	 were suspended.  It was  plain from the language of
the Presidential  order that there could be no suspension of
the  right  mentioned  in  the	Presidential  order  if	 the
detention order	 could not  be shown to have been made under
section 3(1)(c)	 of MISA  because an order not under <a href="/doc/188392346/" id="a_1025">section
3(1)</a> (c) was outside the Presidential order.

case of	 <a href="/doc/834589/" id="a_1027">Makhan Singh  v. State of Punjab</a>.(1) Gajendragadkar
J. (as	he then	 was) speaking	for six	 out of the Bench of
seven Judges  of this  Court observed while dealing with the
effect of  the Presidential  order on  a petition  of habeas
corpus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">     (1) [1964] 4 S. C. R. 797.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">261</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">	  "We have  already seen  that the right to move any
     court   which is  suspended  by  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1028">Art.  359(1)</a>  and	 the
     Presidential order issued under it is the right for the
     enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III
     as may be mentioned in the order. If in challenging the
     validity of his detention order, the detenu is pleading
     any right	outside the  rights specified  in the order,
     his right	to move	 any court  in that  behalf  is	 not
     suspended,	 because  it  is  outside  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1029">Art.	 359(1)</a>	 and
     consequently outside the Presidential order itself. Let
     us take  a case  where a  detenu has  been detained  in
     violation of  the mandatory  provisions of	 the Act. In
     such a  case, it  may be  open to the detenu to contend
     that his  detention is  illegal for the reason that the
     mandatory provision  of the  Act have been contravened.
     Such a plea is outside <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1030">Art. 359(1)</a> and the right of the
     detenu to	move for his release on such a ground cannot
     be affected by the Presidential order.
	  Take also  a case where the detenu moves the Court
     for a  writ of  habeas corpus  on the  ground that	 his
     detention i  has been  ordered malafide.  It is  hardly
     necessary to  ; emphasise	that the exercise of a power
     malafide  is  wholly  outside  the	 scope	of  the	 Act
     conferring the  power and	can ; always be successfully
     challenged. It  is true that a mere allegation that the
     detention is  malafide would  not be enough; the detenu
     will have	to prove the malafides. But if the malafides
     are  alleged,  the	 detenu	 cannot	 be  precluded	from
     substantiating his	 plea  on  the	ground	of  the	 bar
     created by <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1031">Art. 359(1)</a> and the Presidential order. That
     is another kind of plea which is outside the purview of
     Art. 359(1)."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_64">     It was further observed :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">     "It is  only in  regard to	 that class of cases falling
     under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1032"> s. 491(1)</a> (b) where the legality of the detention
     is challenged  on grounds	which fall under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1033">Art. 359(1)</a>
     and Presidential  order that  the bar would operate. In
     all other	cases falling  under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1034"> s. 491(1)</a> the bar would
     be inapplicable  and proceedings taken on behalf of the
     detenu will have to be tried in accordance with law. We
     ought to  add that	 these categories of pleas have been
     mentioned by  us by  way of illustrations, and so, they
     should not be read as exhausting all the pleas which do
     not fall within the purview of the Presidential order.
	  There is  yet another ground on which the validity
     of the  detention may be open to challenge. If a detenu
     contends that  the operative provision of the law under
     which he is detained suffers from the vice of excessive
     delegation and  IS, therefore,  invalid, the  plea thus
     raised by the detenu cannot at the threshold be said to
     be barred by the Presi-

<p id="p_361">     In the  case  of  <a href="/doc/850821/" id="a_1035">State  of  Maharashtra  v.  Prabhakar
Pandurang Sangzgiri  &amp; Anr</a>(1). Subba Rao J. (as he then was)
speaking for the Constitution bench of this Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_67">     "<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1036">Article  358</a>   of	 the   Constitution   suspends	 the
     provisions of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1037">Art. 19</a>  of Part III of the Constitution
     during the	 period the  proclamation of emergency is in
     operation; and  the order passed by the President under
     <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1038">Art. 359</a> suspended the enforcement, inter alia, of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1039">Art.
     21</a> during	the period  of the  said emergency.  But the
     President's order	was a  conditional one. In effect it
     said that	the right  to move  the High  Court  or	 the
     Supreme Court  remained suspended	if such a person had
     been deprived of his personal liberty under the Defence
     of	 India	 Act,  1962,  or  any  rule  or	 order	made
     thereunder. If  a person  was deprived  of his personal
     liberty not under the Act or a rule or order made there
     under but	in contravention  thereof, his right to move
     the said  Courts in that regard would not be suspended.
     The question,  therefore, in  this case  is whether the
     first respondent's liberty has been restricted in terms
     of the  Defence of	 India	Rules  where  under  he	 was
     detained. If  it was in contravention of the said Rules
     he would  have the	 right to  approach the	 High  Court
     under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1040">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution."</blockquote>
<p id="p_362">     Similar view  was expressed  in the  case	of  <a href="/doc/1733535/" id="a_1041">Dr.	 Ram
Manohar Lohia  v. State	 of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.(2) Sarkar J. (as be
then was)  in that  case observed  that where  a person	 was
detained in  violation OF  the mandatory  provisions of	 the
Defence of  India Act,	his right  to move the court was not
suspended. Hidayatullah	 and Bachawat  JJ. referred  to	 the
fact that  the Presidential order did not say that even if a
person was  proceeded against  in breach  of the  Defence of
India Act  or the  rules, he  could not	 move the  court  or
complain that  the Act	and the	 Rules under colour of which
some action  was taken	did not warrant it. The Presidential
order  was   held  to	have  not  intended  to	 condone  an
illegitimate  enforcement  of  the  Defence  of	 India	Act.
Raghubar Dayal	J. held	 that the  Court could	go into	 the
question as to whether the District Magistrate exercised the
power of detention under the Defence of India Rules bonafide
and in accordance with the rules. Mudholkar J. Observed that
if a  detenu contends  that the order. though it purports to
be under  rule 30(1)  of the Defence of India Rules, was not
competently made,  this Court had a duty to enquire into the
matter. Sarkar,	 Hidayatullah, Mudholkar and Bachawat JJ. On
consideration of  the material before them found that as the
detention order	 had been  made with  a view  to present the
detenu	from   acting  in   a  manner	prejudicial  to	 the
maintenance of
     (1) [1966] 1 S. C. R. 702.
</p><p id="p_363">     (2) [1966] 1 S. C. R. 709
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">263</span>
law and	 order and not public order, as contemplated by rule
30, the	 detention order was not in conformity with law. The
petitioner in  that case  was accordingly directed to be set
at liberty.
</p><p id="p_364">     The observations  in the  cases referred  to above show
that the  validity of the detention orders could be assailed
despite the  Presidential orders  of: 1962  and	 1974  under
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1042">article 359</a>  in case  the right	 relied	 upon  was  not	 one
covered	 by   these  Presidential   orders.  The  protection
afforded by  those Presidential	 orders was not absolute, it
Was conditional	 and confined to ruling out the challenge to
detention  orders   and	 other	 actions  taken	  under	 the
provisions mentioned  in those	Presidential orders  on	 the
score of  contravention of  the articles  specified in those
orders. If  the detention  of a detenu was not in accordance
with the  provisions mentioned	in the	Presidential orders,
the Presidential orders did not have the effect of affording
protection to  the detention order and it was permissible to
challenge the  validity of  the detention on the ground that
it had	not been  made under the specified provisions but in
contravention of those provisions.
</p><p id="p_365">     We may  now deal with the Presidential order dated June
27,  1975   with  which	  we  are   concerned.	Unlike	 the
Presidential orders  under clause  (1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1043">article 359</a> issued
earlier, this  Presidential order  makes no reference to any
detention order made under any specified provision. It seeks
to impose  a blanket  suspension of the right of any person,
including a foreigner, to move any court far the enforcement
of the	rights conferred  by articles  14, 21  and 22 of the
Constitution and of all proceedings pending in any court for
the enforcement of the above mentioned rights for the period
during which  the proclamation of emergency is in force. The
observations which  were made  by this	court in  the  cases
referred to  above in  the context of the phraseology of the
earlier Presidential  orders of	 1962 and  1974	 namely	 the
detention orders made under specified provisions, cannot now
be  relied   upon  while   construing  the   ambit  of	 the
Presidential order of June 27, 1975.
</p><p id="p_366">     The difference in phraseology of the Presidential order
dated June  27, 1975  and that	of the	earlier Presidential
orders would  not,  however,  justify  the  conclusion	that
because of the new Presidential order dated June '27, 1975 a
detention order need not comply with the requirements of the
law providing  for preventive  detention. Such	a  detention
order would  still be  liable to be challenged in a court on
the ground  that it  does not comply with the requirement of
law for preventive detention if ground for such challenge be
permissible in	spite  of  and	consistently  with  the	 new
Presidential order.  The effect of the change in phraseology
would only  be that such of the observations which were made
in the	cases mentioned above in the context of the language
of the	earlier Presidential  orders cannot  now  be  relied
upon. Reliance,	 however,  can	still  be  placed  upon	 the
observations made  in those cases which were not linked with
the phraseology of the earlier Presidential orders.
</p><p id="p_367">     Question then  arises as  to what	is the effect of the
suspension of  the right  of a	person to move any court for
the enforcement of rights
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">264</span>
conferred by articles 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution. One
obvious result	of the	above is  that no  one can rely upon
articles 14,  21 and  22 with a view to seek relief from any
court. According  to the stand taken by the learned Attorney
General, the  effect of	 the suspension	 of the	 right of  a
person to  move any  court for	the enforcement of the right
conferred by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1044">article 21</a>  is that  even	 if  the  order	 for
detention has  been made  without the  authority of  law, no
redress can  be sought from the court against such detention
order. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1045">Article 21</a> of the Constitution reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_68">     "No person	 shall be  deprived of	his life or personal
     liberty except  according to  procedure established  by
     law."
</blockquote><p id="p_368">It is  urged that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1046">article 21</a> is the sole repository of one's
right to  life or  personal liberty. The moment the right to
move any  court for  enforcement of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1047">article 21</a> is suspended,
no one	can, according	to the	submission, complain  to the
court of  deprivation of  life or  personal liberty  for any
redress sought	from  the  court  on  that  score  would  be
enforcement of	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1048">article 21.</a>  Petition under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1049">article 226</a> for
the issue  of a	 writ of  habeas corpus,  it is contended by
learned Attorney  General,  is	essentially  a	petition  to
enforce the  right of  personal liberty	 and as the right to
move any court for the enforcement of the right conferred by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1050">article 21</a>  is suspended,  no relief  can be  granted to the
petitioner in such petition.
</p><p id="p_369">     In order  to assess the force of the above argument, it
may be	necessary to  give the background and the history of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1051">article	 21.</a>   In  the	 original  draft   of	the   Indian
Constitution, in  the article which now stands as <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1052">article 21</a>
the words  used were "in accordance with due process of law"
instead of  the words "according to procedure established by
law." The  concept of expression "due process of law" or its
equivalent "law	 of the	 land" traces  its lineage  for back
into the  beginning of the 13th century A.D. The famous 39th
chapter of  the Magna Carta provides that "no free man shall
be taken  or imprisoned	 or disseized, or outlawed or exiled
or in  any way	destroyed; nor shall we go upon him nor send
upon him  but by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the
law of	the land."  Magna Carta	 as  a	charter	 of  English
liberty was confirmed by successive English monarchs. It was
in one of these confirmations (28 Ed. III, Chap. 3) known as
"Statute of Westminster of the liberties of London" that the
expression "due	 process of  law" appears  to have been used
for the	 first time. Neither of the expressions "due process
of law" or "law of the land" was explained or defined in any
of the documents, but on the authority of Sir Edward Coke it
may be said that both the expressions have the same meaning.
In substance,  they guaranteed	that persons  should not  be
imprisoned without proper indictment and trial by peers, and
that property  should not  be seized  except in	 proceedings
conducted in  due form	in which  the owner or the person in
possession should  have an  opportunity to  show  cause	 why
seizure should	not be	made. The expression "due process of
law" came  to be  a part of the US Constitution by the Fifth
Amendment which	 was adopted in 1791 and which provided that
"no person shall be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">265</span>
deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of
law." A	 Similar  expression  was  used	 in  the  Fourteenth
Amendment in  1868. It has been said that few phrases in the
law are	 so elusive of exact apprehension as "due process of
law." The United States Supreme Court has always declined to
give a comprehensive definition of it and has preferred that
its full  meaning should  be gradually	ascertained  by	 the
process of  inclusion and  exclusion in	 the course  of	 the
decisions as  they arise.  The expression  "due	 process  of
law," as  used in  the US  Constitution, has  been taken  to
impose a  limitation upon  the	powers	of  the	 Government,
legislative as	well as	 executive and	judicial. Applied in
England as protection against executive usurpation and royal
tyranny, in  America it	 became a  bulwark against arbitrary
legislation. "Due  process of  law,"  according	 to  Cooley,
"means in  each particular  case such  an  exercise  of	 the
powers of Government as the settled maxims of law permit and
sanction, and  under such  safeguards for  the protection of
individual rights as those maxims prescribe for the class of
cases to  which the one in question belongs" (Constitutional
Limitations, Vol. II, p. 741).
</p><p id="p_370">     'Till about the middle of the 19th Century, due process
clause was  interpreted as a restriction upon procedure, and
particularly the judicial procedure, by which the Government
exercises its power. Principally it related to the procedure
by which  persons were	tried for  crimes and  guaranteed to
accused persons the right to have a fair trial in Compliance
with  well   established  criminal   proceedings.  The	same
principle applied  to the  machinery or proceedings by which
property rights	 were adjudicated and by which the powers of
eminent domain	and taxation  were  exercised.	During	this
period	it  was	 not  considered  to  have  any	 bearing  on
substantive  law  at  all.  Subsequently  view	came  to  be
accepted that  the concept  of due  process of law protected
rights	of  life,  liberty  and	 property.  This  change  in
judicial thinking  was influenced  in a great measure by the
industrial development	leading	 to  accumulation  of  large
capital in  the hands of industrialists and the emergence of
a definite  labouring  class.  What  constituted  legitimate
exercise of  the powers	 of legislation	 now came  to  be  a
judicial question  and no  statute was	valid unless  it was
reasonable in the opinion of the Court. The US Supreme Court
laid stress  upon the  word "due"  which occurs	 before	 and
qualifies the expression "process of law." "Due" means "what
is just	 and proper"  according to  the circumstances  of  a
particular case.  The word  introduces a variable element in
the application	 of the	 doctrine, for what is reasonable in
one set	 of circumstances  may not  be so  in another set of
circumstances. The  requirement of  due process	 clause as a
substantial restriction	 on Government	control is  also now
becoming  a  thing  of	the  past  and	the  rule  is  being
restricted more	 and more  to its original procedural aspect
(see observations  of Mukherjea	 J. in	the case  of  A.  K.
Gopalan, (supra).
</p><p id="p_371">     At the  time the  Constitution was	 being drafted,	 the
Constitutional Adviser Mr. B. N. Rau had discussions with US
Constitutional experts	some of	 whom expressed	 the opinion
that power  of review  implied in due process clause was not
only undemocratic because it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">266</span>
gave the  power of  vetoing legislation	 to the	 judges, but
also threw  an unfair burden on the judiciary. This view was
communicated by	 Mr. Rau  to the  Drafting  Committee  which
thereupon  substituted	 the  words   "except  according  to
procedure established  by law"	for words  "due process,  of
law." In  dropping the	words  "due  process  of  law,"	 the
framers of  our Constitution  prevented the  introduction of
elements of  vagueness, uncertainty  and changeability which
had grown  round the  due process  doctrine  in	 the  United
States.	 The   words  '	  except  according   to   procedure
established by	law" were  taken  from	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_1053">article	 31</a>  of	 the
Japanese Constitution,	according to  which "no person shall
be deprived  of life  or  liberty  nor	shall  any  criminal
liability  be	imposed,  except   according  to   procedure
established by	law. The article is also somewhat similar to
<a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_1054">article 40(4)(1)</a>  of Irish  Constitution, according to which
no person  shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in
accordance with	 law." It was laid down in Gopalan's case by
the majority that the word "law" has been used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1055">article 21</a>
in the	sense of  State-made law and not as an equivalent of
law  in	  the  abstract	  or  general  sense  embodying	 the
principles of natural justice. "The procedure established by
law" was  held to mean the procedure established by law made
by the	State, that  is to  say, the Union Parliament or the
legislatures of	 the States,  Law, it  was also	 observed by
Mukherjea J.,  meant a	valid  and  binding  law  under	 the
provisions  of	the  Constitution  and	not  one  infringing
fundamental rights.
</p><p id="p_372">     The effect	 of the	 suspension of the right to move any
court for  the enforcement of the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1056">article
21</a>, in	my opinion,  is that  when a  petition is filed in a
court, the  court would	 have to proceed upon the basis that
no reliance  can be  placed upon  that article for obtaining
relief from  the  court	 during	 the  period  of  emergency.
Question then  arises as  to whether  the rule	that no	 one
shall be  deprived of  his life	 or personal liberty without
the authority  of law  still survives  during the  period of
emergency despite  the Presidential  order r  suspending the
right to  move any  court for  the enforcement	of the right
contained in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1057">article 21.</a>  The answer  to this	question  is
linked with the answer to the question as to whether <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1058">article
21</a> is  the sole repository of the right to life and personal
liberty. After giving the matter my earnest consideration, I
am of the opinion that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1059">article 21</a> cannot be considered to be
the sole  repository of	 the  right  to	 life  and  personal
liberty. The  right to life and personal liberty is the most
precious  right	 of  human  beings  in	civilised  societies
governed by  the rule  of  law.	 Many  modern  constitutions
incorporate certain  fundamental rights,  including the	 one
relating to  personal freedom.	According to Blackstone, the
absolute rights	 of Englishmen	were the  rights of personal
security,  personal   liberty  and   private  property.	 The
American Declaration  of Independence (1776) states that all
men are	 created equal,	 and among  their inalienable rights
are life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Second
Amendment to  the US   Constitution  refers  inter  alia  to
security of  person, while  the	 Fifth	Amendment  prohibits
inter alia  deprivation of  life  and  liberty	without	 due
process of  law. The  different Declarations of Human Rights
and fundamental	 freedoms have	all  laid  stress  upon	 the
sanctity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">267</span>
of life	 and liberty.  They have  also given  expression  in
varying words	to  the	 principle  that  no  one  shall  be
deprived of  his life  or liberty  without the	authority of
law. The  International	 Commission  of	 Jurists,  which  is
affiliated to  Unesco, has been attempting with considerable
success to  give material  content to  "the Rule of Law," an
expression  used  in  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human
Rights.	 One  of  its  most  notable  achievements  was	 the
Declaration of	Delhi, 1959.  This resulted  from a Congress
held in	 New Delhi  attended by	 jurists from  more than  50
countries, and	was based  on a	 questionnaire circulated to
75,000 lawyers.	 "Respect for  the supreme  value  of  human
personality" was stated to be the basis of all law (see page
21 of  the Constitutional  and Administrative Law by o. Hood
Phillips, 3rd Ed.
</p><p id="p_373">     Freedom under  law, it  may be  added, is	not absolute
freedom. It has its own limitations in its own interest, and
can properly be described as regulated freedom. In the words
of Ernest  Barker, (1)	the truth that every man ought to be
free  has   for	 its   other  side   the  complementary	 and
consequential truth that no man can be absolutely free. that
</p><p id="p_374">(ii) the  need of  liberty for each is necessarily qualified
and conditioned	 by the	 need of liberty for all: that (iii)
liberty in the State or legal liberty, is never the absolute
liberty of all: that (iv) liberty within the State is thus a
relative and  regulated liberty; and that (v) a relative and
regulated liberty;  actually, operative	 and enjoyed.  is  a
liberty greater in amount an absolute liberty could ever be-
if indeed  such liberty	 could ever exist, or even amount to
anything more than nothing at all.
</p><p id="p_375">     Rule of  law is  the antithesis of arbitrariness. Plato
believed  that	 if  philosophers   were  kings	  or   kings
philosophers government	 by  will  would  be  instrinsically
superior to  government by  law, and he so proclaimed in his
Republic. Experience  eventually taught	 him that this ideal
was not	 obtainable and that if ordinary men were allowed to
rule by	 will alone  the interests of the community would be
sacrificed to  those of	 the ruler. Accordingly. in the Laws
he modified  his position  and urged  the acceptance  of the
"second best",	namely government  under law. Since then the
question of  the relative  merits of  rule by law as against
rule by	 will has  been often  debated. In the aggregate the
decision has  been in  favour of  rule by  law. On occasions
however, we  have slipped  back into government by will only
to return  again, sadder  and wiser  men, to Plato's "second
best" when  the hard  facts of human nature demonstrated the
essential egotism  of men  and the  truth of the dictum that
all power  corrupts and	 absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Bracton's dicta	 that if the king has no bridle one ought to
be put	upon him, and that although the king is under no man
he is  under God and the law Fortescue's insistence that the
realm of England is a reginem politicium et regale and hence
limited by law. Coke's observation that "Magna Carta is such
a fellow  that he  will have  no sovereign"; these are but a
few of	the beacons  lighting the  way to the triumph of the
rule of	 law (see  pages 3-6  of the Rule of Law by  Malcolm
Macdonald &amp;  ors.). Rule  of law is now the accepted norm of
all civilised societies. Even if there have been deviations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">268</span>
from the  rule of  law, such deviations have been covert and
disguised for  no  government  in  a  civilized	 country  is
prepared to  accept the	 ignominy of  governing without	 the
rule of law. As observed on page 77 of Constitutional Law by
Wade and  Phillips, 8th	 Ed., the rule of law has come to be
regarded as  the mark  of a  free  society.  Admittedly	 its
content is different in different countries, nor is it to be
secured	 exclusively   through	the   ordinary	courts.	 But
everywhere  it	 is  identified	 with  the  liberty  of	 the
individual. It	seeks to  maintain  a  balance	between	 the
opposing notions  of individual liberty and public order. In
every State  the problem  arises of reconciling human rights
with the  requirements of  public interest. Such harmonising
can only  be attained by the existence of independent courts
which can  hold the  balance between  citizen and  State and
compel Governments to conform to the law.
</p><p id="p_376">     Sanctity of life and liberty was not something new when
the Consitution was drafted. It represented a fact of higher
values which  mankind began to cherish in its evolution from
a  state  of  tooth  and  claw	to  a  civilized  existence.
Likewise, the principle that no one shall be deprived of his
life and  liberty without  the authority  of law was not the
gift of	 the Constitution.  It was  a necessary corollory of
the concept relating to the sanctity of life and liberty; it
existed and was in force before the coming into force of the
Constitution. The  idea	 about	the  sanctity  of  life	 and
liberty as  well as  the principle  that  no  one  shall  be
deprived of  his life  and liberty  without the authority of
law are	 essentially two  facets of  the same  concept. This
concept grew  and acquired  dimensions in  response  to	 the
inner  urges   and  nobler   impulses  with   the  march  of
civilisation. Great  writers and  teachers, philosophers and
political thinkers nourished and helped in the efflorescence
of the	concept by  rousing the conscience of mankind and by
making it  conscious of	 the necessity	of  the	 concept  as
necessary social discipline in self-interest and for orderly
existence. According  even to  the theory  of social compact
many aspects of which have now been discredited, individuals
have surrendered  a part  of their  theoretically  unlimited
freedom in  return or the blessings of the government. Those
blessings include  governance  in  accordance  with  certain
norms in  the matter  of life  and liberty  of the citizens.
Such norms  take the  shape of	the rule of law. Respect for
law, we	 must bear  in mind,  has a mutual relationship with
respect for  government. Erosion  of the respect for law, it
has accordingly	 been said,  affects  the  respect  for	 the
government. Government	under the  law means, as observed by
Macdonald, that	 the power to govern shall be exercised only
under  conditions   laid  down	in  constitutions  and	laws
approved by  either the people or their representatives. Law
thus emerges  as a norm limiting the application of power by
the government	over the  citizen or  by citizens over their
fellows. Theoretically	all men are equal before the law and
are equally  bound by  it regardless of their status, class,
office or  authority. At the same time that the law enforces
duties it  also protects rights, even against the sovereign.
Government under  law thus  seeks the  establishment  of  an
ordered community  in which  the individual,  aware  of	 his
rights and  duties, comprehends	 the area of activity within
which, as a responsible and intelligent person, he may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">269</span>
freely order  his life, secure from interference from either
the government	or other  individuals (see Rule of Law, page
</p><p id="p_377">6). To quote further from Professor Macdonald:
</p><p id="p_378">	  "It	is    clear   enough   that   high   echelon
     administrators are	 understandably impatient  with	 the
     restraints imposed upon them by the traditional concept
     of	 the   rule  of	  law	as   developed	 by   Dicey.
</p><p id="p_379">     Administrators deal  with the  implementation of highly
     technical and  complex matters  involving the immediate
     interests of many citizens, To accomplish this they are
     granted wide  discretion in  the use  of administrative
     power to  effectuate broad	 policies laid	down by	 the
     legislators. It  is natural  that they should desire to
     have the  conflicts which	arise as  the result  of the
     exercise of  their discretion  adjudicated by tribunals
     composed of  experts acquainted with the details of the
     matters at issue, rather than by judges trained only in
     the law.  Hence their  resistance to judicial review of
     administrative  'findings	 of  fact'   as	 opposed  to
     'findings of law'. The very things which a court of law
     prizes-rules of  evidence, common	law procedures, even
     due process-frequently  appear to the administrators as
     obscurantist devices  employed by	those who oppose the
     very principle  of	 the  policy  he  is  attempting  to
     effectuate.  Often,   secretly  if	  not  openly,	 the
     administrator  considers	his   policy   to   be	 the
     incarnation of  the best interests of the people, or at
     least of their best interests if they really understood
     them, and	hence considers	 himself as  arrayed on	 the
     side of  progress and  light against the dark forces of
     reaction. E
	  Thus our  'wonderland of bureaucracy', as Beck has
     called it,	 has sought  autonomy from  the	 traditional
     rule of  courts and law. If it should succeed we should
     then indeed  be confronted	 with  a  vital	 segment  of
     govern mental power which would have escaped from legal
     control and  become arbitrary  in its  acts. To prevent
     this we  have subjected  the acts	of administrators to
     challenge in  the courts  on the  basis of ultra vires,
     and provided  for	judicial  review  of  administrative
     tribunals' finding of law." (see ibid page 8) .
     To use  the words	of  Justice  Brandeis(1)  with	some
modification, experience  should teach	us to be most on our
guard to  protect liberty when the Government's purposes are
beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel
invasion of  their liberty  by evil-minded persons. Greatest
danger to  liberty lies	 in insidious encroachment by men of
zeal, well-meaning but lacking in due deference for the rule
of law
     Even in  the absence of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1060">article 21</a> in the Constitution,
the State  has got  no power to deprive a person of his life
or liberty without

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">270</span>
<p id="p_380">the authority  of law.	This is	 the essential postulate and
basic assumption  of the  rule of  law and not of men in all
civilised  nations.   Without  such  sanctity  of  life	 and
liberty, the  distinction between  a lawless society and one
governed by  laws would	 cease	to  have  any  meaning.	 The
principle that	no one	shall be  deprived of  his  life  or
liberty without	 the authority	of  law	 is  rooted  in	 the
consideration  that   life   and   liberty   are   priceless
possessions which cannot be made the plaything of individual
whim and  caprice and  that any	 act which has the effect of
tampering With life and liberty must receive sustenance from
and  sanction	of  the	  laws	of   the  land.	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1062">Article  21</a>
incorporates an essential aspect of that principle and makes
it part	 of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of
the Constitution.  It does  not, however,  follow  from	 the
above that  if <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1063">article	21</a> had not been drafted and inserted
in Part	 III, in  that event  it would have been permissible
for the	 State to  deprive a  person of	 his life or liberty
without the  authority of law. No case has been cited before
us to  show  that  before  the	coming	into  force  of	 the
Constitution or	 in countries  under rule of law where there
is no  provision corresponding	to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1064">article  21</a>, a  claim was
ever sustained	by the	courts that  the State can deprive a
person of  his life or liberty without the authority of law.
In fact,  any suggestion  to such  a claim was unequivocally
repelled. In  the case of James Sommersett(1) Lord Mansfield
dealt with a case of a negro named Sommersett, who was being
taken in  a ship to Jamaica for sale in a slave market. When
the ships  anchored at London port, a habeas corpus petition
was presented  by some	Englishmen who	were  moved  by	 the
yelling and  cries  of	Sommersett.  In	 opposition  to	 the
petition the  slave trader  took the  plea that there was no
law  which   prohibited	 slavery.  Lord	 d  Mansfield  while
repelling this	objection made	the following observation in
respect of  slavery which  is one  of  the  worst  forms  of
deprivation of personal freedom:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">	  "It is  so odious  that nothing can be suffered to
     support it	 but positive  law: whatever inconveniences,
     therefore, may  follow from this decision, I cannot say
     this case is allowed or approved by the law of England;
     and therefore the black must be discharged."
</blockquote><p id="p_381">In other case, Fabriqas v. Mostyn(2) Lord Mansfield observed
on page 173:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_70">	  "To lay down in an English court of Justice that a
     Governor acting  by virtue of Letters Patent. under the
     Great Seal,  is accountable only to God and his own con

     plunder. and  affect His  Majesty's subjects,  both  in

of a  person's life or liberty by the State even though such

to  be	deprived  of  one's  life  or  liberty	without	 the

Such right  existed before the Constitution came into force.
The fact that the framers of the Constitution made an aspect

the effect of exterminating the independent identity of such
right and  of making <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1068">article 21</a> to be the sole repository of
that right.  Its real  effect was to ensure that a law under

Court, the  right secured by <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1071">section 229</a> was lifted into the
formal category	 of a  fundamental right. The principle laid
down in	 that case  cannot be  invoked in  a case  like	 the
present wherein the area covered by the right existing since
before the  Constitution is  wider than	 the area covered by
the fundamental	 right and  the fundamental right deals with
only an	 aspect of  such pre-existing  right. Moreover,	 the
correctness of	the view  taken in  the above  case,  in  my
opinion, is  open  to question in view of the later decision
of Makhan  Singh (supra)  decided by a Bench of seven Judges
wherein it  has been  observed on  page 821  that after	 the
coming into  force of  the Constitution,  a detenu  has	 two
remedies, one  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1072">article  226</a>  or	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1073">article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution and  another under	 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1074">section 491</a>  of the Code of
Criminal  Procedure.   Makhan  Singh's	case,  as  discussed
elsewhere, shows  that the  remedy under an earlier statuory
provision would not get obliterated because of the identical
remedy by a subsequent Constitutional provision and that the
two can co-exist without losing their independent identity.
</p><p id="p_389">     Preventive detention,  though not	strictly punishment,
is akin	 to punishment,	 because of the evil consequences of
being deprived	of one's  liberty. No one under our laws can
be deprived  of his life or liberty without the authority of
law. This  would be  evident from  the fact that if a person
without the authority of law takes another person's life, he
would  normally	  be  guilty  of  the  offence	of  culpable
homicide. Likewise,  if a  person deprives  another  of	 his
liberty by  confining him,  he would  in the  absence of any
valid justification,  be guilty	 of wrongful confinement. It
is for	that reason  that  courts  have	 insisted  upon	 the
authority of law for a public servant to take away someone's
life or liberty. An executioner carrying out the sentence of
death imposed  by the  court would not commit the offence of
homicide, because  he is  executing  the  condemned  man  in
obedience to a warrant issued by a court having jurisdiction
in accordance  with the	 law of the land. Likewise, a jailor
confining a  person sentenced  to imprisonment is not guilty
of the	offence of  wrongful confinement. The principle that
no one	shall be deprived of his life or liberty without the
authority of  law stems not merely from the basic assumption
in every  civilised society  governed by  the rule of law of
the
     (1) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 691.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">273</span>
<p id="p_390">sanctity of life and liberty, it flows equally from the fact
that under  our penal  laws no one is empowered to deprive a
person of his life or liberty without the authority of law.
</p><p id="p_391">     The fact  that  penal  laws  of  India  answer  to	 the
description of	the word  "law",  which	 has  been  used  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1075">article 21</a>  would not  militate against	 the inference	that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1076">article 21</a>  is not  the sole repository of the right to life
or personal liberty and that the principle that no one shall
be deprived  of his  life or  personal liberty	without	 the
authority of  law flows from the penal laws of India. Nor is
it the	effect of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1077">article 21</a>  that penal laws get merged in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1078">article 21</a> because of the fact that they constitute "law" as
mentioned in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1079">article 21</a>   for	were it so the suspension of
the right  to move  a court  for enforcement  of fundamental
right  contained   in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1080">article	 21</a>  would  also  result  in
suspension of the right to move any court for enforcement of
penal laws
     It has  been pointed  out above  that even	 before	 the
coming into  force of  the Constitution,  the position under
the common  law both  in England  and in  India was that the
State could  not deprive  a person  of his  life and liberty
without the  authority of  law. The  same was  the  position
under the  penal laws of India. It was all offence under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1081"> the
Indian Penal Code</a>, as already mentioned, to deprive a person
of his	life or	 liberty unless such a course was sanctioned
by the	laws of	 the land.  An action  was also maintainable
under the  law of torts for wrongful confinement in case any
person was  deprived of	 his personal  liberty	without	 the
authority of law. In addition to that, we had <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1082">section 491</a> of
the Code of Criminal Procedure which  provided the remedy of
habeas corpus  against detention  without the  authority  of
law. Such  laws continued  to remain  in force	in  view  of
<a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1083">article 372</a> after the coming into force of the Constitution.
According to  that article,  notwithstanding the  repeal  by
this Constitution  of the  enactments referred to in <a href="/doc/493040/" id="a_1084">article
395</a>  but   subject  to	 the  other   provisions   of	this
Constitution, all the law in force in the territory of India
immediately before  the commencement  of  this	Constitution
shall continue in force therein until altered or repealed or
amended	 by	competent  legislature	or  other  competent
authority. The	law in force, as observed by the majority of
he Constitution	 Bench in  the ease of <a href="/doc/1743548/" id="a_1085">Director of Rationing
and Distribution  v. The  Corporation  of  Calcutta  &amp;	Ors</a>.
include not  only the statutory law but also custom or usage
having the  force of  law as also the common law  of England
which was  adopted as  the law	of the	country	 before	 the
coming into  force of  the Constitution.  The position	thus
seems  to  be  firmly  established  that  at  the  time	 the
Constitution came into force, the legal position was that no
one could  be deprived	of his	life or	 liberty without the
authority of law.
</p><p id="p_392">     It is  difficult  to  accede  to  the  contention	that
because of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1086">article 21</a> of the Constitution, the law which was
already in  force that	no one could be deprived of his life
or liberty without the authority of law

was obliterated	 and ceased  to remain	in force. No rule of
construction  interpretation  warrants	such  an  inference.
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1087">Section 491</a>  of the  Code of Criminal Procedure continued to
remain an  integral part  of that Code despite the fact that
the High  Courts were vested with the power of issuing writs
of habeas  corpus under	 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1088">article 226.</a> No submission was ever
advanced on  the score	that the said provision had become a
dead letter  of unforceable because of the fact that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1089">article
226</a> was made a part of the Constitution. Indeed, in the case
of Malkha  Singh (supra)  Gajendragadkar J. speaking for the
majority stated	 that after  the coming	 into force  of	 the
Constitution, a	 party could  avail of	either the remedy of
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1090">section 491</a>  of the  Code of  Criminal Procedure  or that of
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1091">article 226</a>  of the  Constitution.  The	 above	observations
clearly go  to show  that constitutional  recognition of the
remedy of  writ of  habeas  corpus  did	 not  obliterate  or
abrogate the  statutory remedy	of writ	 of  habeas  corpus.
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1092">Section 491</a>  of the  Code of Criminal Procedure continued to
be part	 of that Code till that Code was replaced by the new
Code. Although	the remedy  of writ  of habeas corpus is not
now available  under the  new <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1093">Code  of</a>	Criminal  Procedure,
1973, the  same remedy	is still available under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1094">article 226</a>
of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_394">     Our attention  has been  invited to  <a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_1095">section 18</a>  of the
maintenance of	Internal Security  Act as amended. According
to that	 section,  no  person,	including  a  foreigner,  in
respect of  whom an  order is  made or	purported to be made
under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1096">section  3</a> shall have any right to personal liberty by
virtue of  natural law	or common  law, if any. This section
would not,  in my  opinion, detract  from my conclusion that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1097">article 21</a>  is not  the sole  repository  of  the  right  to
personal liberty.  It has  been pointed	 out above  that the
principle that	no one	shall be  deprived of  his life	 and
personal liberty  without the  authority of laws follows not
merely from  common law, it flows equally from statutory law
like the  penal law  in force in India. The above principle,
as would  appear from  what has been discussed elsewhere, is
also an	 essential facet  of the  rule of  law. <a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_1098">Section	 18</a>,
therefore, cannot be of much assistance to the appellants. I
am also	 unable to  subscribe to  the view  that <a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_1099">section  18</a>
would have the effect of enlarging the ambit of the power of
the detaining  authority for the purpose of passing an order
for detention. There has been, it needs to be emphasised, no
amendment of  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1100">section 3</a>	 of the	 Act. <a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_1101">Section  18</a> cannot  be
construed to  mean that	 even if  an order  for detention is
made on	 grounds not  warranted by  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1102">section 3</a> of the Act, it
shall be  taken to  be an  order under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1103">section 3</a> of the Act.
Apart  from   the  fact	  that	such  an  inference  is	 not
permissible on the language of <a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_1104">section 18</a>, the acceptance of
this view  would also render the validity of <a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_1105">section 18</a> open
to question  on the  ground that it suffers from the vice of
excessive delegation  of legislative  power. The legislature
is bound  to lay  down the legislative policy by prescribing
the circumstances  in which  an order  for detention  can be
made. It  is not permissible for the legislature to confer a
power  of  detention  without  laying  down  guidelines	 and
prescribing the	 circumstances in which such order should be
made.  To  do  so  would  be  tantamount  to  abdication  of
legislatitve function for in such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">275</span>
an event  it would  be open  to the  detaining authority  to
detain a person on any ground whatsoever.
</p><p id="p_395">     l agree  with the	learned Attorney  General that if we
are  to	  accept  his	argument  about	 the  scope  of	 the
Presidential order  of June  27, 1975, in that event we have
to accept  it in its entirety and go the whole hog; there is
no half	 way  house  in	 between.  So  let  us	examine	 the
consequences of	 the acceptance	 of the above argument. This
would mean  that if  any official,  even a head constable of
police, capriciously  or maliciously,  arrests a  person and
detains him  indefinitely without  any authority of law, the
aggrieved person  would not  be able to seek any relief from
the courts  against such  detention  during  the  period  of
emergency. This	 would	also  mean  that  it  would  not  be
necessary to  enact any	 law on	 the subject and even in the
absence of  any such  law, if any official for reasons which
have nothing to do with the security of State or maintenance
of public  order, but because of personal animosity, arrests
and puts  behind the  bar any  person or  a whole  group  or
family of persons, the aggrieved person or persons would not
be able	 to seek  any redress  from a court of law. The same
would be  the position	in case	 of threat of deprivation or
even actual  deprivation of life of a person because <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1106">article
21</a> refers  to both  deprivation of  life as well as personal
liberty. Whether  such things  actually come  to pass is not
the question before us; it is enough to state that all these
are permissible	 consequences from  the	 acceptance  of	 the
contention that	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1107">article 21</a>  is the  sole repository  of the
right	life and  personal liberty  and that consequent upon
the issue of the Presidential order, no one can approach any
court and  seek relief during he period of emergency against
deprivation of life or personal liberty. In order words, the
position would	be that	 so far	 as executive  officers	 are
concerned, in  matters relating to life and personal liberty
of citizens,  they would  not be  governed by  any law, they
would not  be answerable  to any  court and  they  would  be
wielding more or less despotic powers.
</p><p id="p_396">     To	  take	  another   illustration.    Supposing	 the
Presidential order  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1108">article  359(1)</a>  were	 to  mention
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1109">article 21</a>  but not  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1110">article 22.</a> The acceptance of the above
submission advanced  on behalf	of the appellants would mean
that if	 the State  does not  release a	 detenu despite	 the
opinion of  the Advisory  Board that  there is no sufficient
cause for  his detention  and thus keeps him in detention in
fragrant violation  of the  provisions	of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1111">article  22</a>,  no
habeas corpus  petition would be maintainable and this would
be so even though <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1112">article 22</a> itself is a fundamental right.

under an  order issued	under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1114">article  359(1).</a> The effect of
that, on  a parity  of reasoning  advanced on  behalf of the
appellant would	 be, that  no one can file a suit during the
period of  emergency  against  the  State  for	recovery  of
property or money (which is a form of property) because such
a suit,	 except in  some contingencies,	 would be  a Suit to
enforce the right contained in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1115">article 19.</a>

<p id="p_398">     Not much  argument	 is  needed  to	 show  that  if	 two
constructions  of  Presidential	 order	were  possible,	 one
leading to  startling results  and the	other not leading to
such results,  the court  should  lean	in  favour  of	such
construction as would not lead to such results.
</p><p id="p_399">     Equally well  established is  the rule  of construction
that if there be a conflict between the municipal law on one
side and  the inter  national law  or the  provisions of any
treaty obligations  on the  other,  the	 courts	 would	give
effect to  municipal law.  If, however, two constructions of
the municipal  law are	possible, the  courts should lean in
favour of  adopting such  construction	as  would  make	 the
provisions of  the municipal  law to  be in harmony with the
inter national	law or	treaty obligations.  Every  statute,
according to  this rule,  is  interpreted,  so	far  as	 its
language permits,  so as  not to  be inconsistent  with	 the
committee  of	nations	 or   the   established	  rules	  of
international law,  and the  court will avoid a construction
which would give rise to such inconsistency unless compelled
to adopt  it by	 plain and  unambiguous language. But if the
language of  the statute  is  clear,  it  must	be  followed
notwithstanding	  the	conflict   between   municipal	 and
international law  which results (see page 183 of Maxwell on
the  Interpretation   of  Statutes,   Twelfth  Edition.)  As
observed  by   Oippenheim's  International   law,   although
municipal  courts  must	 apply	Municipal  Law	even  if  it
conflicts with	the Law	 of Nations,  there is a presumption
against the  existence of  such a  conflict. As	 the Law  of
Nations is  based upon	the common  consent of the different
States, it  is improbable  that an  enlightened State  would
intentionally enact  a rule  conflicting  with	the  Law  of
Nations. A  rule of Municipal Law, which ostensibly seems to
conflict with  the  Law	 of  Nations,  must,  therefore,  if
possible, always be so interpreted as to avoid such conflict
(see Vol.  1, pages  45-46), Lord Denning gave expression to
similar view  in the  case of  Corocraft craft	Ltd. v.	 Pan
American Airways Inc. (1) when he observed
     "The Warsaw  Convention is	 an international convention
     which is  binding	in  international  law	on  all	 the
     countries who  have ratified  it and  it is the duty of
     these courts to construe our legislation so as to be in
     conformity with  international law	 and not in conflict
     with it."
</p><p id="p_400">The rule  about the construction of municipal law also holds
good when  construing the  provisions of the Constitution as
would  appear  from  International  Law	 by  Fenwick,  Third
Edition, page 90, wherein is observed:

     there are numerous cases in which the provisions of the
     national constitution of the provisions of a particular

     While dealing with the Presidential order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1120">article
359(1</a>), we  should adopt  such a  construction as  would, if
possible, not bring it in conflict with the above articles 8
and 9.	From what  has been discussed elsewhere, it is plain
that such  a construction  is not  only possible, it is also
preeminently reasonable.  The Presidential order, therefore,
should be so construed as not to warrant arbitrary arrest or
to bar	right to  an effective	remedy by competent national
tribunals for acts violating basic right of personal liberty
granted by law.
</p><p id="p_404">     It has  been argued  that suspending  the	right  of  a
person to  move any  court for	the enforcement	 of right to
life and  personal liberty  is done  under a  constitutional
provision and therefore it cannot be said that the resulting
situation would	 mean the  absence of  the rule of law. This
argument, in  my opinion, cannot stand close scrutiny for it
tries to equate illusion of the rule of law with the reality
of rule	 of law.  Supposing a law is made that in the matter
of the	protection of  life and	 liberty, the administrative
officers would	not be governed by any law and that it would
be permissible	for them  to deprive  a person	of life	 and
liberty without any authority of law. In one sense, it might
in that	 event be  argued that	even if lives of hundreds of
persons are  taken capriciously	 and maliciously without the
authority of  law, it  is enforcement  of the  above enacted
law. As observed by Friedmann on page 500 of Law in Changing
Society, 2nd  Ed., in  a purely	 formal sense, any system of
norm based on a hierarchy of orders, even the organised mass
murders of  Nazi regime qualify as law. This argument cannot
however, disguise the reality of the matter that hundreds of
innocent lives	have been  taken because  of the  absence of
rule of	 law. A	 state of  negation of rule of law would not
cease to  be such  a state  because of	the fact that such a
state of negation of rule of law has been brought about by a
statute. Absence of rule

<p id="p_405">of law	would nevertheless  be absence	of rule	 of law even
though it  is brought  about by a law to repeal all laws. In
the words  of Wade, Government under the rule of law demands
proper legal  limits on the exercise of power. This does not
mean merely that acts of authority must be justified by law,
for if	the law is wide enough it can justify a dictatorship
based on  the tyrannical  but perfectly legal principle quod
principi placuit  legis	 habet	vigorem.  The  rule  of	 law
requires something further. Powers must first be approved by
Parliament, and	 must then  be granted	by Parliament within
definable limits  (see Administrative  Law,  Third  Edition,
page 46).  It is  no doubt true that Dicey's concept of rule
of law	has been  criticised by	 subsequent writers since it
equates the  rule of  law  with	 the  absence  not  only  of
arbitrary  but	 even  of   wide  discretionary	 power.	 The
following reformulation	 of Dicey's  ideas as  applicable to

equation of arbitrary and wide discretionary powers:

     arbitrary power over the person or the interests of the
     individual; (2) all members of society, private persons

place in Raipur District, (ii) shall immediately proceed

was further  held not  to have	revived as  a result  of the

State submitted	 in the	 alternative that  even if <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1129">section 3</a>
(1)  (b)  was  void,  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1130">article  358</a>  protected  action,	both
legislative  and  executive,  taken  after  proclamation  of

State would  not be  liable to	be challenged  on the ground
that it infringed the fundamental freedoms under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1131">article 19.</a>
This contention	 was repelled.	Shah J.	 (as  he  then	was)
speaking for the Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">     "All executive  action which  operates to the prejudice
     of any person must have the authority of law to support
     it, and  the terms of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1132">Art. 358</a> do not detract from that
     rule. <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1133">Article  358</a> expressly  authorises the  State  to
     take legislative  or  executive  action  provided	such
     action was competent for the State to make or take, but
     for  the  provisions  contained  in  Part	III  of	 the
     Constitution. <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1134">Article  358</a> does  not purport  to invest
     the State	with arbitrary	authority to  take action to
     the  prejudice   of  citizens  and	 others:  it  merely
     provides that  so long as the proclamation of emergency
     subsists laws  may be enacted, and executive action may
     be taken in pursuance of lawful authority, which if the
     provisions of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1135">Art. 19</a>  were operative  would have been
     invalid. Our  federal structure  is founded  on certain
     fundamental principles:  (1)  the	sovereignty  of	 the
     people with  limited Government  authority	 i.  e.	 the
     Government must  be conducted  in accordance  with	 the
     will of  the  majority of the people. The people govern
     themselves through	 their representatives,	 whereas the
     official agencies	of the	executive Government possess
     only such	powers as  have been  conferred upon them by
     the people; (2) There is distribution of powers between
     the three	organs of  the State-legislative,  executive
     and judicial  each organ  having some  check direct  or
     indirect on  the other:  and (3)  the rule of law which
     includes  judicial	  review  of   arbitrary   executive
     actions. As  pointed out  by Dicey in his	Introduction
     to the  study of  the Law	of the	Constitution',	10th
     Edn., at  P. 202 the expression 'rule of law' has three
     meanings, or  may	be  regarded  from  three  different
     points of	view. 'It  means in  the  first	 place,	 the
     absolute supremacy	 or predominance  of regular  law as
     opposed to	 the HE	 influence of  arbitrary power,	 and
     excludes the existence of arbitrariness, of prerogative
     or even of wide discretionay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">280</span>
     authority on  the part  of government.' At p. 188 Dicey
     points out:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_85">	  'In  almost	every  continental   community	 the
     executive exercises  far wider  discretionary authority
     in the  matter of arrest, of temporary imprisonment, of
     expulsion from  its territory,  and the  like, than  is
     either legally  claimed  or  in  fact  exerted  by	 the
     government in England: and a study of European polities
     now and  again reminds  English readers  that  wherever
     there is  discretion there	 is room  for arbitrariness,
     and that  in a  republic no  less than under a monarchy
     discretionary authority.  On the part of the government
     must mean	insecurity for	legal freedom on the part of
     its subjects.'  We have  adopted under our Constitution
     not the Continental system but the British system under
     which tile	 rule of law prevails. Every act done by the
     Government or by its officers must, if it is to operate
     to the  prejudice of  any person,	be supported by some
     legislative authority."</blockquote>

     characteristic feature  is the  concept of	 the rule of
     law which	means, in the present context, the authority

     the  standard   of	 legality.   The  administrative  or
     executive action  that does  not meet the standard will

for decision  before this  Court was  whether the said order

declaration of	state of emergency by the president. Shah J.

Ramaswami J.  speaking for  the Constitution  Bench of	this
Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_91">	  "In this context it is important to emphasise that
     the absence  of arbitrary	power is the first essential
     of the  rule of law upon which our whole constitutional
     system is	based. In  a system governed by rule of law,
     discretion, when  conferred upon executive authorities,
     must be  confined within  clearly defined	limits.	 The
     rule  of  law  from  this	point  of  view	 means	that
     decisions should  be made	by the	application of known
     principles and  rules and,	 in general,  such decisions
     should be predictable and the citizen should know where
     he is.  If a decision is taken without any principle or
     without  any  rule	 it  is	 unpredictable	and  such  a
     decision is  the antithesis  of  a	 decision  taken  in
     accordance with the rule of law. (See Dicey-'Law of the
     Constitution' Tenth  Edn., Introduction  ex). 'Law	 has
     reached its  finest moments',  stated  Douglas,  J.  in
     United States  v. Wunderlick(2), 'when it has freed man
     from the  unlimited discretion of some ruler .... Where
     discretion is absolute, man has always suffered'. It is
     in this  sense that  the rule  of law may be said to be
     sworn enemy  of caprice.  Discretion, as Lord Mansfield
     stated  it	 in  classic  terms  in	 the  case  of	John
     Wilkes(3), 'means	sound discretion  guided by  law. It
     must be governed by rule, not by humour: It must not be
     arbitrary, value and fanciful.' "</blockquote>
<p id="p_427">     In the case of <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_1146">Shrimati Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj
Narain</a>(4) both Ray CJ. and Chandrachud J. laid stress on the
rule of law in our constitutional scheme.
</p><p id="p_428">     It would  not, in	my opinion,  be correct	 to consider
rule of	 law as	 a vague  or nebulous concept because of its
description as	an unruly  horse by  Ivor Jennings.  Indeed,
according to  Jennings, the rule of law demands in the first
place that  the powers	of the	Executive should not only be
derived from  law, but	that they  should be limited by law.
Whatever might	be the	position in  peripheral cases, there
are certain aspects which constitute the very essence of the
rule of	 law. Absence  of arbitrariness	 and the need of the
authority of  law for  official acts affecting prejudicially
rights of  individuals is one of those aspects. The power of
the courts  to grant relief against arbitrariness or absence
of authority  of law  in the  matter of	 the liberty  of the
subject may  now well be taken to be a normal feature of the
rule of law. To quote from Halsbury's Laws of England, Third

para 416,  the so-called liberties of the subject are really
implications	drawn  from  the  two  principles  that	 the
subjects may say or do what he pleases, provided he does not
transgress substantive	law, or infringe the legal rights of
others, whereas	 public authorities including the Crown) may
do nothing  but what  they are authorised to do by some rule
of common  law or  statute. The	 essence  of  rule  of	law,
according to  Prof. Goodhart,  is that	public officers	 are
governed  by  law,  which  limits  their  powers.  It  means
Government  under   law-  the  supremacy  of  law  over	 the
Government as  distinct	 from  Government  by  law-the	mere
supremacy of law in society generally-which would apply also
to totalitarian	 states (See  page 42  of constitutional and
Administrative Law by Hood Phillips, Third Edition).
</p><p id="p_432">     I may  mention that  there has  been  an  amendment  of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1148">article 359</a>  inasmuch as  clause (1A) has been added in that
article. The  effect of	 the insertion	of  that  clause  in
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1149">article 359</a>  is that  while an	order made  under clause (1)
mentioning any	of the	rights conferred  by Part  III is in
operation, nothing  ill that  Part conferring  those  rights
shall restrict	the power of the State to make any law or to
take any  executive action which the State would but for the
provisions contained in that Part be competent to make or to
take, but  any law  so made  shall. to	the .  extent of the
incompetency, cease  to have  effect as	 soon as  the  order
aforesaid ceases  to operate,  except as respects thing done
or omitted  to be  done before	the law	 so ceases  to	have
effect. Clause (1A) thus protects laws and executive actions
from any  attack on validity on the score of being violative
of the	fundamental rights  mentioned  in  the	Presidential
order in  the same  way as <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1150">article 358</a> protects the laws and
executive actions  from being  challenged on  the ground  of
being  violative   of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1151">article	 19</a>  during  the  period  of
emergency. If  the existence of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1152">article 358</a> did not have the
effect of  dispensing with  the necessity  for an  executive
action operating to the prejudice of tile right of a citizen
of the	authority of  law, the	same must necessarily be the
position after	the insertion of clause (1A) in <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1153">article 359.</a>
It is  significant that	 the  language	of  clause  (1A)  of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1154">article 359</a> in material respect is substantially the same as
that of	 <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1155">article 358.</a> The language of clause (1A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1156">article
359</a> makes  it clear that the protection which is afforded by
that clause  is to such law or executive action is the State
would but  for the  provisions contained  in Part III of the
Constitution  be   competent  to  make	or  take.  The	word
"competent" has	 a significance	 and  it  is  apparent	that
despite the  Presidential order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1157">article 359(1</a>), in the
case of executive action the competence of the State to take
such action  would have	 to be established. Such  competence
would, however, be judged ignoring the restriction placed by
the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. To put it in
other words,  clause (1A)  of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1158">article  359</a> does not dispense
with the  necessity  of	 competence  to	 make  law  or	take
executive action.  The only  effect of	that clause  is that
during the  period of  emergency the restriction placed upon
the competence by fundamental rights would not be there. But
it would  still be  necessary to  establish  the  competence
dehors the restrictions of the fundamental rights.

<p id="p_433">     The matter	 can also  be looked  at from another angle.
Before any public authority can deprive a person of his life
or personal liberty, two requirements are to be satisfied:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_92">	  (1)  Power must  be conferred	 by  law  upon	such
	       authority to  deprive a person of his life or
	       liberty; and
	  (2)  Law must also prescribe the procedure for the
	       exercise of such power.
</blockquote><p id="p_434">Suspension  of	 the  right   to  move	any  court  for	 the
enforcement of	the right  under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1159">article  21</a> can at the best
impinge upon  the second  requirement; it  cannot affect the
first requirement  which is a cardinal principle of the rule
of law.	 l am  conscious of  the fact that though <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1160">article 21</a>
refers	to   procedure	established   by  law,	 there	 are
observations in	 Gopalan's case	 that the article would also
cover substantive  law for  affording protection to life and
liberty. What  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1161">article 21</a>  lays down is that no person shall
be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according
to  procedure	established  by	 law.  Procedure  about	 the
exercise of  power of  depriving a  person of  his  life  or
personal   liberty    necessarily   presupposes	  that	 the
substantive power  of depriving	 a person  of  his  life  or
personal liberty  has been  vested in  an authority and that
such power exists. Without the existence of such substantive
power, no  question can	 arise about  the procedure  for the
exercise of  that power.  It has,  therefore, been held that
though there is no reference to substantive power in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1162">article
21</a>, the	 said article  would cover both the existence of the
substantive power  of depriving	 a person  of his  life	 and
personal liberty  as well  as the procedure for the exercise
of : that power. The question with which we are concerned is
as Lo  what is	the effect of the suspension of the right to
move a	court for. the enforcement of the right contained in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1163">article 21.</a>  The effect.  it may possibly be argued, is that
consequent upon	 such suspension  if a person is deprived of
his life  or personal liberty under a law not satisfying the
second requirement  indicated above, he cannot seek judicial
redress on  that score.	 Would it,  however, follow from the
suspension of  such right  that no  judicial remedy would be
available if  a personal  is deprived by an authority of his
life or	 personal liberty  even though such an authority has
not been vested with the substantive power of deprivation of
life and personal liberty. The answer to this question in my
opinion, should	 plainly be  in the negative. The suspension
of the	right to  move a  court for  the enforcement  of the
right contained	 in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1164">article  21</a> cannot	have the  effect  of
debarring an  aggrieved person	from approaching  the courts
with the complaint regarding deprivation of life or personal
liberty by  an authority on the score that no power has been
vested in  the authority  to deprive  a person	of  life  or
liberty. The  presupposition of the existence of substantive
power to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1165">article 21</a>  even  though  that	article	 only  mentions	 the
procedure, would  not necessarily  point to  the  conclusion
that in the event of the suspension of the right to move any
court for  the enforcement  of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1166">article	21</a>,  the  suspension
would also  dispense with  the necessity of the existence of
the substantive	 power. The coexistence of substantive power
and procedure  established by  law for depriving a person of
his life and liberty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">285</span>
which is implicit in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1167">article 21</a> would not lead to the result
that even  if there  is suspension  of the  right  regarding
procedure, suspension  would also operate upon the necessity
of substantive power. What is true of a proposition need not
be true	 of the converse of that proposition. The suspension
of the	right to  move any  court for the enforcement of the
right contained	 in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1168">article  21</a>  may  have  the  effect  of
dispensing with	 the necessity	of prescribing procedure for
the exercise of substantive power to deprive a person of his
life or	 personal liberty, it can no case have the effect of
permitting an  authority to  deprive a person of his life or
personal  liberty   without  the  existence  of	 substantive
personal.  The	 close	bond  which  is	 there	between	 the
existence of  substantive power of depriving a person of his
life or	 personal liberty and the procedure for the exercise
of that	 power, if the right contained in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1169">article 21</a> were in

Likewise, in the event of repeal of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1182">article 21</a>, a detenu can

So far	as matters  not mentioned  in <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1184">article 359(1)</a> and the
Presidential order thereunder concerned, the jurisdiction of
the court is not ousted. A provision which has the effect of

strictly. No  inference of the ouster of the jurisdiction of
the  court  can	 not  be  drawn	 unless	 such  inference  is
warranted by  the clear	 language of  the provision  ousting

     of construction that where an order purports to suspend

     the Constitution,	the  said  order  must	be  strictly
     construed in  favour  of  the  citizens'	 fundamental
     rights." ;</blockquote>
<p id="p_437">     I am  also unable to accede to the argument that though
the position   under  law may be that no one can be deprived
of his	right  to  life	 or  personal  liberty	without	 the
authority of law, the remedy to enforce the right to life or
personal liberty is no longer available during the period of
emergency because  of the  suspension of  right to  move any
court for  enforcement of right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1186">article 21.</a> The
basic assumption  of this argument is that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1187">article 21</a> is the
sole repository	 of right to life and personal liberty. Such
an assumption,	as already  ` I	 stated above,	is not	well
founded. This  apart, a	 Presidential  order  under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1188">article
359(1)</a> cannot  have the	 effect of  suspending the  right to
enforce rights	flowing from statutes, nor can it bar access
to the	courts of  persons seeking  redress on	the score of
contravention of  statutory provisions. Statutory provisions
are enacted to be complied with and it is not permissible to
contravene them.  Statutory provisions	cannot be treated as
mere pious  exhortations or  words of  advice which  may  be
abjured or  disobeyed with  impunity. Nor is compliance with
statutory provisions  optional or  at the  sufferance of the
official concerned.  It is  the presence  of legal sanctions
which distinguishes positive law from other systems of rules
and norms. To be a legal system a  set of norms must furnish
sanctions for  some of	its precepts.  A legal	sanction  is
usually thought	 of  as	 a  harmful  consequence  to  induce
compliance with law. Non-compliance with statutory provision
entails certain	 legal consequences.  The Presidential order
cannot stand in the way of the courts giving effect to those
consequences.  To   put	 it   differently,   the   executive
authorities exercising	power under a statute have to act in
conformity with its provisions and within the limits set out
therein.  When	 a  statute  deals  with  matters  affecting
prejudicially the  rights of  individuals, the	ambit of the
power of  the  authorities acting under the statute would be
circumscribed  by  its	provisions,  and  it  would  not  be
permissible to	invoke some indefinite general powers of the
executive. As observed by Lord Atkinson in
(1) [1966] 2 S. C. R. 406 (oh p. 410).

<p id="p_438">the case  of Attorney  General v.  De Keyser's	Royal  Hotel

control, and directly regulated by statute, the Executive no
longer derives	its authority  from the Royal Prerogative of
the Crown  but from  Parliament, and that in exercising such
authority the Executive is bound to observe the restrictions
which Parliament has imposed in favour of the subject. It is
also not  the result of the Presidential order, as discussed
elsewhere, that	 because of  the suspension  of the right to
move any  court for  enforcement of  right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1189">article 21</a>,
the remedy of a writ of habeas corpus ceases to be available
against the State. The Presidential order would not preclude
a person  from challenging the validity of a law or order on

     proximate connection  between the	ground given and the

     stated in	this context  that a  mala fide	 exercise of
     power does not necessarily imply any moral turpitude as
     a matter of law. It only means that the statutory power
     is exercised for purposes foreign to those for which it

nature	of   habeas  corpus   an  integral   part   of	 the
Constitution. They were aware that under the US Constitution

writ of	 habeas corpus	could be  suspended when in cases of
rebellion or  invasion the  public safety  may	require	 it.
Despite that  our founding  fathers made no provision in our

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1200">article  226</a> to  issue writs  in the  nature of habeas

view the  precedent of	England	 where	there  had  been  no
suspension of  writ of	habeas corpus  since 1881  and	even
during tile course of First and Second World Wars. It would,
in my  opinion, be not permissible to bring about the result
of suspension of habeas corpus by a strained construction of

</p><p id="p_444">     The writ  of habeas  corpus ad  subjiciendum, which  is
commonly known	as the	writ of	 habeas corpus, is a process
for securing  the liberty  of the  subject by  affording  an
effective  mean	  or  immediate	 release  from	unlawful  or
unjustifiable detention,  whether in  prison or	 in  private
custody. By  it the High Court and the judges of that Court,
at  the	  instance  of	a  subject  aggrieved,	command	 the
production of  that subject, and inquire is the cause of his
imprisonment. If  there is  no legal  justification for	 the
detention, the	party is  ordered to be released. Release on
habeas corpus  is not,	however, an  acquittal, nor  may the
writ be	 used as  a means  of appeal (see Halsbury's Laws of

Affairs v. O'Brien(1):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_97">	  "It is  perhaps the  most important  writ known to
     the constitutional law of England, affording as it does

     restraint	or   confinement.  It	is   of	  immemorial
     antiquity, an  instance of	 its use  occurring  in	 the
     thirtythird year  of Edward  I. It has through the ages

<p id="p_447">     The existence  of the  power of  the courts  to issue a
writ of	 habeas corpus	is  regarded  as  one  of  the	most
important characteristic of democratic states under the rule
of law. The significance of the writ for the moral health of
the society  has been  acknowledged by	all jurists.  Hallam
described it  as the "principal bulwark of English liberty".
The uniqueness of habeas corpus in the procedural armoury of
our law	 cannot be too often emphasised. It differs from all
others remedies	 in that  it  is  available  to	 bring	into
question the legality of a person's restraint and to require
justification for  such detention.  of course  this does not
mean that  prison doors	 may readily be opened. It does mean
that explanation  may be  exacted  why	they  should  remain
closed. It  is not  the boasting  of empty rhetoric that has
treated the  writ of habeas corpus as the basic safeguard of
freedom. The  great writ  of  habeas  corpus  has  been	 for
centuries  esteemed  the  best	and  sufficient	 defence  of
personal freedom (see Human Rights &amp; Fundamental Freedoms by
Jagdish Swarup, page 60).
</p><p id="p_448">     As <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1203">article 226</a> is an integral part of the Constitution,
the power  of the High Court to enquire in proceedings for a
writ of	 habeas corpus into the legality of the detention of
persons cannot"	 in my	opinion, lie  denied.  Although	 the
Indian Constitution,  as mentioned  by Mukherjea  CJ. in the
case of	 Ram Jawaya  Kapur (supra),  has not  recognised the
doctrine of  separation of powers in its, absolute rigidity,
the functions  of the  different parts,	 or branches  of the
Government  have   been	 sufficiently	differentiated	 and
consequently it	 can very well be said that our Constitution
does not contemplate assumption, by one organ or part of the
State, of  functions that essentially belong to another. The
executive  can	 exercise  the	powers	of  departmental  or
subordinate legislation when such powers are delegated to it
by the	legislature. It can also, when so empowered exercise
judicial function  in a	 limited way. The executive however,
can never  go against  the provisions of the Constitution or
of any	law. To	 quote the  words of  Dr.  Ambedkar  in	 the
Constituent Assembly:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_98">	  "Every Constitution,	so far as it relates to what

     Constitution a  provision	saying	that  the  executive
     shall obey	 the legislature,  nor have I found anywhere
     in any  Constitution a  provision	that  the  executive
     shall obey the judiciay. Nowhere is such a provision to

      found  That is because it is generally understood that
     the provisions of the Constitution are binding upon the
     different organs  of the  State. Consequently, it is to
     be presumed that those who work the Constitution, those
     who compose  the Legislature  and those who compose the
     executive and the judiciary know their functions, their
     limitations and  their duties.  It is  therefore to  be
     expected that  if the  executive, is  honest in working
     the Constitution,	then the  executive is bound to obey
     the  Legislature	without	 any   kind  of	  compulsory
     obligation laid down in the Constitution.
      Similarly	 if the	 executive is  honest in working the
     Constitution,  it	must  act  in  accordance  with	 the
     judicial  decisions   given  by   the  Supreme   Court.
     Therefore my submission is that this is a matter of one
     organ of  the State  acting within	 its own limitations
     and obeying  the supremacy	 of the	 other organs of the
     State. In	so far as the Constitution gives a supremacy
     to that  is a matter of constitutional obligation which
     is implicit in the Constitution itself."

     particular authority and any other authority,, then the
     decision of  that authority  shall be  binding upon any
     other  organ.   That  is	the  sanction	which	this
     Constitution gives	 in order  to see that the President
     shall follow  the advice  of his  Ministers,  that	 the
     executive shall  not exceed  in its executive authority
     the law made by Parliament and that the executive shall
     not give  its own interpretation of the law which is in

helpless spectators even if glaring and blatant instances of
deprivation of life and personal liberty in contravention of
the statute  are brought to their notice. It would also mean
that whatever
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">291</span>
may be	the law	 passed by the legislature, in the matter of
life and   personal  liberty of	 the citizens, the executive
during the  period of emergency would not be bound by it and
would be  at liberty  to ignore	 and contravene	 it.  It  is
obvious that  the acceptance  of the contention would result
in a kind of supremacy of the executive over the legislative
and judicial  organs of	 the State,  and thus  bring about a
constitutional imbalance  which perhaps	 was  never  in	 the
contemplation of  the framers  of the Constitution. The fact
that the  government which  controls the  executive  has  to
enjoy the  confidence of  the legislature  does not  detract
from  the   above  conclusion.	 The  executive	  under	 our
constitutional scheme  is not merely to enjoy the confidence

carry out  the	legislative  intent  as	 manifested  by	 the

life, liberty and the rule of law. More is at stake in these
cases than  the liberty	 of a few individuals or the correct
construction of	 the wording  of are order. What is at stake
is the	rule of	 law. If  it could  be the  boast of a great
English judge*	that the  air of   England is too pure for a
slave to  breathe, cannot  we also  say with ' I justifiable
pride that  this sacred land shall not suffer eclipse of the
rule of	 law and that the Constitution and the laws of India
do not	permit life  and liberty  to  be  at  the  mercy  of
absolute power of the executive, a power against which there
can be	no redress  in courts  of law. even if it chooses to
act contrary  to law  or  in  an  arbitrary  and  capricious
manner. The question is not whether there-can be curtailment
of personal  liberty when there is threat to the security of
the  State.   I	 have  no  doubt  that	there  can  be	such
curtailment even  on an extensive scale, in the face of such
threat. The  question is  whether the  laws speaking through
the authority of the courts shall be absolutely silenced and
rendered mute because of such threat.
</p><p id="p_454">     No one  can deny  the power of the State to assume vast
powers of  detention in	 the interest of the security of the
State. It  may indeed  be necessary  to do'  so to  meet the
peril facing  the nation.  The considerations of security of
the State  must have  a primacy and be kept in the forefront
compared to which the interests of the individuals can	only
take a	secondary place.  The motto has to be "Who lives, if
the country  dies". Extraordinary  powers are always assumed
by the.	 government in	all countries  in times of emergency
because of  the extraordinary  nature of  the emergency. The
exercise of  the power	of detention,  it  is  well-settled"
depends upon  the subjective  satisfaction of  the detaining
authority and the courts can neither act as courts of appeal
over the  decisions of	the detaining authority nor can they
substitute their  own opinion  for  that  of  the  authority
regarding the necessity of detention. There is no antithesis
between the  power of  the   *Lord Mansfield  in the case of
James Sommersett
(1772 State Trials page 1)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">292</span>
State to  detain a  person without  trial  under  a  law  of
preventive detention  and the  power of the court to examine
the legality  such detention.  As observed  by Lord Atkin in
Rex v.	Halliday(l) while dealing with the argument that the
Defence	 of   Realm  Consolidation  Act	 or  1914  arid	 the
regulation made	 under it  deprived the subject of his right
under the  several Habeas  Corpus Acts,	 that is  all entire
misconception. The  subject retains  every right which those
statutes confer upon him to have tested and determined ill a

to the	person in  whose custody  he may be, the legality of
the order  or warrant by virtue of which he is given into or
kept in	 that custody.	To quote the words of Lord Macmillan
in the case of Liversidge v. Anderson(2).
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_100">	  "It  is   important  to  have	 in  mind  that	 the
     regulation question  is a	war measure.  This is not to
     say that  the Court  sought to adopt in war time canons
     of construction  different from  those they  follow  in
     peace time.  The fact  that the  nation is at war is no
     justification for	any relaxation	of the	vigilance of
     the Courts	 in seeing  that the  law is  duly observed,
     especially in a matter so fundamental as the liberty of
     the subject. Rather the contrary."
</blockquote><p id="p_455">In dealing  with an application for a writ of habeas corpus,
the court  only ensure that the detaining authorities act in
accordance with	 the law of preventive detention. The impact
upon the  individual of the massive and comprehensive powers
of  preventive	 detention  with  which	 the  administrative
officers are armed has to be cushioned with legal safeguards
against arbitrary  deprivation of  personal liberty  if	 the
premises of  the rule  of law is not to lose its content and
become meaningless.  The chances of an innocent person being
detained under	a law  providing for preventive detention on
the subjective	satisfaction of	 an administrative authority
are much  greater compared to the possibility of an innocent
person being  convicted at trial in a court of law. It would
be apposite  in this context to refer to the observations of
Professor Alan M. Dershowitz:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">	  The available	 evidence suggest that our system of
     determining past  guilt results in erroneous conviction
     of relatively few innocent people. We really do seem to
     practice what  we preach about preferring the acquittal
     of guilty men over the conviction of innocent men.
	  But  the   indications  are  that  any  system  of
     predicting future	crimes	would  result  in  a  vastly
     larger  number   of  erroneous   confinements-that	  is
     confinements of  persons predicted to engage in violent
     crime who	would not,  in fact"  do so. Indeed, all the
     experience with  predicting  violent  conduct  suggests
     that in  order to	spot  a	 significant  proportion  of
     future violent  criminals, we would have to reverse the
     traditional maxim	of the	criminal  law  and  adopt  a
     philosophy that it is 'better to confine ten people who
     would not	commit predicted crimes, than to release one
     who would'."

compliance  with   requirements	 prescribed   by   law	 for
preventive detention.
</p><p id="p_460">     In England	 there was no suspension of the power of the
courts to  issue a  writ of  habeas corpus  during the First
World War and the Second World War. In India also, there was
no   absolute	bar   to   approaching the courts during the
Sino-Indian hostilities	 of 1962  and the  Indo-Pak wars  of
1965 and 1971. It has not been suggested that because of the
existence of  the powers  of the  court to  issue  writs  of
habeas corpus  war efforts  were in  any  way  prejudicially
affected. The  United Nations'	Economic and  Social Council
endorsed the general agreement reached at the Baguio Seminar
that "the  writ of habeas corpus or similar remedy of access
lo the	courts to  test the  legality and  bona-fides of the
exercise of  the emergency  powers should never be denied to
the citizen".  It drew	attention to  the following  passage
from the report of the seminar: "All members recognised that
in times  of emergency	it might  be necessary	to  restrict
temporarily the	 freedom of  the individual.  But they	were
firmly of  the view  that,  whatever  temporary	 restrictive
measures might	be necessary, recourse to the courts through
the right  of habeas  corpus or	 other similar remedy should
never  be   suspended.	Rather	the  legislature  could,  if
necessary,, subject  to well defined procedures safeguarding
human dignity.	authorise the temporary detention of persons
for  reasons  specified	 in  the  law.	By  that  means	 the
executive can  act as emergency may require but the ultimate
judicial protection  of	 individual  liberty  is  preserved.
Members hold  strongly that  it is  a fundamental  principle
that the individual should never be deprived of the means of
testing the  legality of  his arrest or. custody by recourse
to judicial  process even  in times  of emergency.  If	that
principle is departed from, the liberty of the individual is
immediately put in great peril".
</p><p id="p_461">     l	am,   therefore,  of  the  view	 that  there  is  no
sufficient ground  to interfere	 with the  view taken by all
the nine  High Courts  which went  into the matter, that the
Presidential order  of June  27, 1975  did  not	 affect	 the
maintainability of  the habeas	corpus petitions to question
the legality of the detention orders and that such petitions
could be proceeded with despite that order.
</p><p id="p_462">     We may  now deal with the second question regarding the
scope and  extent of judicial scrutiny in petitions for writ
of habeas  corpus relating  to persons	detained under MISA.
For this  purpose it would be appropriate to first deal with
the position under the above law so far as cases not covered
by <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1205">section 16A</a> are concerned.
</p><p id="p_463">     According to  section 3(1)	 of  MISA,  the	 authorities
specified in  the sub-section  may if satisfied with respect
to any	person (including  a foreigner)	 that with a view to
preventing him from acting in any  manner prejudicial to (i)
the defence  of India, the relations of India with foreigner
powers, or the security of India, or (ii) the security of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">294</span>
the State  or the  maintenance of public order, or (iii) the
maintenance  of	 supplies  and	services  essential  to	 the
community, it  is necessary  so to   make an order that such
person be  detained. The  words 'if satisfied" indicate that
the satisfaction  of the  authority concerned is a condition
precedent  to  the  making  of	a  detention  order.  Unless
therefore  the	authority  concerned  is  satisfied  on	 the
material before	 it than  it is necessary to detain a person
with a	view to	 prevent him  from indulging  in any  of the
specified prejudicial activities, it has no power to make an
order for  his detention. <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1206">Section 3</a> also contains an implied
injunction that the said authority shall not detain a person
under that  section for	 reasons other	than those specified
therein. Although  the satisfaction contemplated by the sub-
section is  the subjective  satisfaction  of  the  authority
concerned, it  is necessary  that it should be arrived at in
an objective  manner. It  is consequently essential that the
facts on  the basis of which the authority concerned reaches
the conclusion	that it	 is necessary  to  detain  a  person
should have  a rational	 nexus or  probative  value  and  by
germane to  the object	for which  such detention is allowed
under section  3(1) of	MISA. In  case the  facts which	 are
taken into  account are	 extraneous, not  germane or  do not
have any  live link or reasonable connection with the object
for which  the detention  order can be made, the order would
be liable to be quashed. Even if one out of the many grounds
on which  a detention  order is	 based	is  not	 germane  or
legally not  tenable, the  detention order  would be quashed
because it  is difficult to  predicate	that  the  detaining
authority would have come to the requisite satisfaction even
in the absence of that ground. It is plainly not possible to
estimate as  to how  far the  irrelevant or untenable ground
operated on  the  mind	of  the	 appropriate  authority	 and
contributed to the creation of the satisfaction on the basis
of which the detention order was made. To Say that the other
ground which  still remains  is quite  sufficient to sustain
the order  would be to substitute an objective judicial test
for the subjective decision of the executive authority which
is against the legislative policy underlying the statute.
</p><p id="p_464">     A law  of preventive  detention  is  not  punitive	 but
precautionary. and  preventive. The power of detention under
such law  is base(l  on circumstance of suspicion and not on
proof of  allegation as	 is required  at a regular trial for
the commission	of an  offence. Such  a power  is  exercised
because of  apprehension of  future prejudicial	 activity on
the part  of the person ordered to be detained judged in the
light of  his past  conduct and	 propensity. The  order	 for
preventive  detention	in  such   cases  postulates   prior
restraint so  that the	mischief apprehended at the hands of
the person ordered to be detained might not materialise. The
consequences of waiting and declining to take action against
that person  till the mischief is actually clone would quite
often be disastrous and the nation may in some cases have to
pay a  heavy price  for	 such  abstention.  The	 quantum  of
material available regarding the conduct and propensity of a
person may  not be sufficient to warrant his conviction in a
court of  law for  an offence  and yet	if the	material  is
germane to  the object for which detention order can legally
be made	 and the detaining authority is satisfied in view of
that material  regarding the necessity of making a detention
order, such  order made by that authority would be upheld as
being in accordance with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">295</span>
law. It	 is also  not difficult	 to  visualise	a  situation
wherein serious	 crimes are  committed in broad daylight and
yet the	 witnesses to  the crime  are so  much terrified and
awestricken that  they dare  not depose against the culprits
in a  court of	law. In	 such  cases  also  because  of	 the
difficulty of  securing the  conviction of the culprits, the
courts have  upheld the	 detention orders, if the activities
of the culprits are of such a nature as has a nexus with the
object for  which detention order can be made. In a petition
for a  writ of	habeas corpus  the courts  do  not  normally
question the veracity and sufficiency of the material on the
basis of  which	 the  authority	 concerned  arrives  at	 the
conclusion regarding the necessity of detention. In case the
detenu	challenges   the  correctness	or  truth   of	 the
allegations on	the basis  of which  the detention  order is
made, he  should normally  do so  by means of representation
contemplated by	 clause (5)  of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1207">article 22.</a> It is legitimate
to expect  that the  authority concerned  and  the  advisory
board when  the matter	comes up before them shall take into
account the  stand  taken  by  the  detenu  regarding  those
allegations.  It  would	 be  also  their  function  to	give
consideration to  any fresh  material which  may be produced
before them  regarding the  truth and  correctness of  those
allegations. In	 a habeas  corpus petition,  if	 it  becomes
apparent on  the record	 from  the  admission  made  by	 the
detaining authority  in the return or some other evidentiary
material of  unquestioned authenticity	and probative  value
that some  of the  alleged facts  upon the  basis  of  which
detention order is made are non-existent, the court would be
well justified	in quashing  the detention  order. A,  court
apart from  that cannot	 go behind  the truth of the alleged
facts If  the material	is germane  to the  object for which
detention is  legally permissible and an order for detention
is made on the basis of that material, the courts cannot sit
as a  court of	appeal and  substitute their own opinion for
that of	 the authority concerned and hold that the authority
concerned  should   not	 have	arrived	 at  the  conclusion
regarding the  necessity of  detention. At the same time, it
is necessary that the authority concerned before deciding to
detain a  person should	 apply its  mind to the facts before
lit in	a fair	and reasonable	manner.	 If  the  conclusion
arrived at  is so  unreasonable that no reasonable authority
could ever  come to  it, the  legitimate inference  would be
that the  authority concerned  did not apply its mind to the
relevant  facts	  and  did   not  honestly   arrive  at	 the
conclusion. To	use the	 words of Lord Halsbury in Shrape v.
Wakefield (1):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_102">	  " ... when it is said that something is to be done
     with in  the discretion  of  the  authorities  ..	that
     something is  to be  done according  to  the  rules  of
     reason and	 justice, not  according to  private opinion
     .... according  to law and not humour. It is to be, not
     arbitrary, vague" fanciful, but legal and regular."
</blockquote><p id="p_465">Likewise, if  there were  no grounds,  as observed  by	Lord
Morton in  Ross v.  Papadopollos(2), or	 which the authority
concerned could	 he satisfied,	the court might infer either
that the  authority did	 not honestly form that view or that
in forming it, the authority could not

</p><p id="p_466">     (2) [1958] 2 All. E. R. 23 (on p. 33).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">296</span>
<p id="p_467">have applied  its mind	to the	relevant facts.	 The  courts
would also  interfere if the power of detention is exercised
malafide, not  in good	faith or for an ulterior purpose. It
would follow  from the	above that if the power of detention
is exercised  for an  improper purpose,	 i.e., a purpose not
contemplated by	 the statute,  the order for detention would
be quashed.
</p><p id="p_468">     Between malice  in fact and malice ill law, as observed
by  Viscount   Haldana	L.C.  in  the  case  of	 Shearer  v.
Shields(1), there  is  a  broad	 distinction  which  is	 not
peculiar to any particular system of jurisprudence. A person
who inflicts  an injury upon another person in contravention
of the	law is	not allowed  to say  that he  did so with an
innocent mind;	he is taken to know the law, and he must act
within the  law. He  may, therefore,  be guilty of malice in
law,  although,	  so  far  as  the  state  of  his  mind  is
concerned.,  he	  acts	ignorantly,   and  in	that   sense
innocently. Malice  in fact  is quite  a different thing; it
means an  actual malicious  intention on  the  part  of	 the
person who  has done  the wrongful  act, and  it may  be, in
proceedings based  on wrongs independent of contract, a very
material ingredient in the question of whether a valid cause
of action  can be stated. The above principle was applied by
this Court  in detention  matters in  <a href="/doc/1473632/" id="a_1208">Bhut Nath	 v. State of
West Bengal</a>(2).
</p><p id="p_469">     Normally, it  is the past conduct or antecedent history
of a person which shows a propensity or attendency to act in
a particular  manner The  past conduct or antecedent history
of a  person can,  therefore  be  appropriately	 taken	into
account in  making a  detention order.	It is indeed largely
from the past events showing tendencies or inclinations of a
person that  an inference can be drawn that he, is likely in
the future  to act  in a  particular  manner.  In  order  to
justify such  an inference.  it is  necessary that such past
conduct or antecedent history should ordinarily be proximate
in point  of time.  It	would,	for  instance,	be  normally
irrational to  take into  account the conduct and activities
of a  person which  took place	ten years before the date of
his detention  and say	that  even  though  after  the	said
incident took  place nothing  is known	against	 the  person
indicating his tendency to act in a prejudicial manner, even
so on they strength of the said incident which is ten. years
old, the  authority  is	 satisfied  that  his  detention  is
necessary. It  is both	inexpedient and	 undesirable to	 lay
down an	 inflexible test  as to	 how far  distant  the	past
conduct or  the antecedent  history should be for reasonably
and rationally	justifying the	conclusion that	 the  person
concerned  if	not  detained  may  indulge  in	 prejudicial
activities. The	 nature of  the activity  would have  also a
bearing in  deciding the  question  of	proximity.  If,	 for
example, a  person who	has links  with a particular foreign
power is  known to  have indulged  in subversive  activities
when hostilities  broke out  with  that	 foreign  power	 and
hostilities again  break out  with that	 foreign power after
ten years,  the authorities  concerned, if  satisfied on the
basis of  the past activities that it is necessary to detain
him with  a view  to preventing	 him from acting in a manner
prejudicial to the security of India, might well pass a
     (1) [1914] A. C. 808.
</p><p id="p_470">     (2) [1974] 3 S. C. R. 315.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">297</span>
<p id="p_471">detention order	 in respect of that person. The fact that in
such a	case there  is a  time lag  of ten years between the
activities  of	the  said  person  and	the  making  of	 the
detention order would not vitiate such an order. Likewise, a
remote prejudicial  activity may  be so	 similar to a recent
prejudicial activity  as may  give rise to an inference that
the two	 are a	part  of  chain	 of  prejudicial  activities
indicative of a particular inclination. In such an event the
remote activity	 taken along  with the recent activity would
retain	its   relevance	 and  reliance	upon  it  would	 not
introduce an  infirmity. If, however, in a given case and in
the context  of the  nature of activity the time lag between
the prejudicial activity of a detenu and the detention order
made  because  of  that	 activity  is  ex  facie  long,	 the
detaining authority  should explain  the delay in the making
of the	detention order	 with a	 view to show that there was
proximity between the prejudicial activity and the detention
order. If  the detaining  authority fails to do so, in spite
of an  opportunity having  been afforded  to it,  a  serious
infirmity  would   creep  into	 the  detention	 order	(see
<a href="/doc/225492/" id="a_1209">Rameshwar Singh v. District Magistrate Burdwan &amp; Anr</a>.(1) and
<a href="/doc/662555/" id="a_1210">Sk. Abdul Munnaf v. State of West Bengal</a>(2) .
</p><p id="p_472">     One other	requirement of a valid order of detention is
that the  grounds of detention which are communicated to the
detenu should not be vague so that he may not be handicapped
in making  an effective representation against the detention
order. Both  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1211">article 22(S)</a> of the Constitution and <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_1212">section 8</a>
( 1  ) of MISA refer to such representation and provide that
the detaining  authority shall as soon as may be, and in any
case not  later than  the prescribed  period, communicate to
the person detained the grounds on which the detention order
has been made "and shall afford him the earliest opportunity
of making  representation against the order". In view of the
Presidential order  suspending the right of a person to move
any court  for enforcement  of specified fundamental rights,
including  the	 one  under   <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_1213">article  22(5</a>),  it  may	with
plausibility be	 argued that  the vagueness  of	 grounds  of
detention would	 not warrant  the quashing of such detention
order during  the pendency  of the Presidential order on the
score of  violation of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1214">article 22(S).</a> The Presidential order
would, however,	 not stand  in the way of the court quashing
the detention  order on	 the score  of the  infirmity of the
vagueness  of	grounds	 of   detention	  because   of	 the
contravention of <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_1215">section 8</a> ( 1 ) of MISA.
</p><p id="p_473">     Every law	providing for  preventive detention contains
certain procedural  safeguards. It  is imperative that there
should be  strict compliance  with the requirements of those
procedural safeguards  to sustain the validity of detention.
Detention without  trial results  in  serious  inroads	into
personal liberty  of an	 individual. In	 such  cases  it  is
essential to  ensure that  there is  no deviation  from	 the
procedural safeguards  provided	 by  the  statute.  In,	 the
matter of even a criminal trial? it is procedure that spells
out much  of the  difference between the rule of law and the
rule by	 whim and  caprice. The need for strict adherence to
strict procedural  safeguards is  much greater	when we	 are
dealing with preventive detention which postulates detention
of a
     (1) [1964] 4 S. C. R. 921.(2) A. 1. R 1974 S. C. 2066.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">298</span>
<p id="p_474">person even  though he is not found guilty of the commission
of an  offence. To condone or allow relaxation in the matter
of compliance with procedural requirements would necessarily
have the  effect of  practically doing	away with  even	 the
slender safeguards  provided by	 the legislature against the
arbitrary use  of  the	provisions  relating  to  preventive
detention. The	history of personal liberty, we must bear in
mind, is largely the history of insistence upon procedure. I
am,  therefore,	  of  the  view	 that  it  would  be  wholly
inappropriate to  countenance any  laxity in  the matter  of
strick compliance  with procedural  requirements  prescribed
for preventive	detention. The observations made in the case
of <a href="/doc/99652/" id="a_1216">Kishori  Mohan v. State of West Bengal</a>(1) have relevance.
It was observed by this Court in that case .
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_103">	  "<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1217">The	Act</a>   confers  extraordinary  power  on	 the
     executive to  detain a  person without  recourse to the
     ordinary laws  of the  land and  to  trial	 by  courts.
     Obviously, such  power places  the personal  liberty of
     such a  person in	extreme peril  against which  he  is
     provided with  a limited right of challenge only. There
     can, therefore,  be no  doubt that such a law has to be
     strictly construed.  Equally also, the power con feared
     by such a law has to be exercised with extreme care and
     scrupulously within the bounds laid down in such a law.</blockquote>
<p id="p_475">     Question then  arises as to how far are the recitals in
the order of detention binding upon the court, and upon whom
and to	what extent  does the  onus lie	 in a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus relating to a detained person. In this
respect I  find that  in the case of King Emperor v. Sibnath
Banerji(2) the	Judicial Committee,  speaking  through	Lord
Thankerton"  approved	the  following	observation  of	 the
learned Chief Justice of the Federal Court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_104">	  "It is  quite a  different thing  to question	 the
     accuracy of a recital contained in a duly authenticated
     order, particularly where the recital purports to state
     as a  fact the  carrying out  of what  I  regard  as  a
     condition necessary  to the valid making of that order.
     In the normal case the existence of such a recital in a
     duly authenticated	 order will,  in the  absence of any
     evidence as  to its accuracy, be accepted by a court as
     establishing   that   the	 necessary   condition	 was
     fulfilled. The  presence of  the recital  in the  order
     will place	 a difficult burden on the detenu to produce
     admissible evidence  sufficient  to  establish  even  a
     prima facie case that the recital is  not accurate."
</blockquote><p id="p_476">The matter was considered by this Court' by the Constitution
Bench of  this Court  in the case of- <a href="/doc/234426/" id="a_1218">G. Sadanandan v. State

     well-founded. The	failure of respondent No. 1 to place
     any such material before us in the pre sent proceedings

</blockquote><p id="p_477">The initial  burden is	on the	detenu to  show	 that at his
detention is mala fide or not in accordance with law. If the
detenu makes  out a  prima facie  case, the burden shifts on
the State  and it  becomes essential for the State to file a
good return.  Once substantial disquieting doubts are raised
by the	detenu in  the	mind  of  the  court  regarding	 the
validity of  his detention,  it would be the bounden duty of
the State  to dispel  those  doubts  by	 placing  sufficient
material before	 the court  with a  view to satisfy it about
the validity  of the  detention. In case the detenu fails to
discharge the  initial burden,	his  petition  for  writ  of
habeas	corpus	would  be  dismissed.  Even  if	 the  detenu
discharges the	initial burden	and makes out a "prima facie
case against  the validity  of his  detention, but the State
files a	 good return  and adduces sufficient material before
the court  to show that his detention is valid, the detenu's
petition would	be dismissed.  In case, however,, the detenu
discharges the	initial burden	and makes  out a prima facie
case against  the validity  of his  detention and  the State
fails to  file a  good return  and does not place sufficient
material on  the record to show that the detention is valid,
a serious infirmity would creep into the State case as might
justify interference by the court and release of the detenu.
More than that, it is not necessary to say for everything in
the final analysis would depend upon the individual facts of
the case.
</p><p id="p_478">We may now turn to the newly added section 16A of MISA. This
section was  inserted by  <a href="/doc/1536853/" id="a_1219">section 6</a>  of Act  39 of 1975 with
effect from June 29, 1975. Subsequently, there was a further
amendment of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1220">section 16A</a>  by  Act  14	of  1976  which	 was
published on January 25 1976. According to subsection (1) of
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1221">section 16A</a>, the provisions of the section would have effect
notwithstanding anything  contained in	MISA or any rules of
natural justice during the period of emergency proclaimed on
December 3,  1971 and June 25, 1975 or a period or 12 months
from June  25., 1975 whichever period was the shortest. Sub-
sections  (2)	and  (3)   provides  for  the  making  of  a
declaration to	that effect  by the authorities concerned if
they are  so satisfied on consideration that it is necessary
to  detain  a  person  for  effectively.  dealing  with	 the
emergency. Sub-section	(2)  deals  with  cases	 of  persons
against whom  orders of detention were made under the Act on
or after  June 25,  1975 but before the coming into force of
this section,  viz., June  29, 1975?  while sub-section	 (3)
deals with  cases of detention in respect of persons-against
whom orders  for detention  were made  after the coming into
force of  the section.	The provision  to sub-sectional	 (3)
provides for review and the necessity of confirmation within
fifteen days  of the  declaration by the State Government in
case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">300</span>
such declaration  is made  by an  officer subordinate to the
State  Government.  Sub-section	 (2A)  provides	 for  deemed
approval of a detention order made by an officer subordinate
to the State Government in case the State Government makes a
declaration that  the detention	 of the person ordered to be
detained is  necessary	for  dealing  effectively  with	 the
emergency. Sub-section	(4) provides  for reconsideration at
intervals not  exceeding four  months of  the  necessity  of
detention of  a person	in respect  of whom a declaration is
made under  sub-section (2) or (3). According to sub-section
(5), in	 making any review, consideration or reconsideration
under  sub-sections   (2),  (3)	  or  (4),  the	 appropriate
Government  or	 officer  may	act  on	 the  basis  of	 the
information and	 materials in  its or his possession without
communicating  or   disclosing	any   such  information	  or
materials to  the person  concerned  or	 affording  him	 any
opportunity of	making any representation against the making
under sub-section  (2)" or  the making	or confirming  under
sub-section (3),  or the  non-revocation  under	 sub-section
(4), of	 the declaration in respect of him. Sub-sections (6)

apply in  the case  of a  person detained  under a detention
order to  which the  provisions of  sub-sections (2) and (3)
apply. Sub-section  (8) authorises  the	 Central  Government
whenever it  considers it  necessary so to do to require the
State Government  to furnish  to the  Central Government the
information arid materials on the basis of which declaration
has been  made or  confirmed or	 not revoked  and such other
information and materials as the Central Government may deem
necessary.
</p><p id="p_479">     It would  appear from  what has  been stated above that
once a	declaration is	made with  respect to a detenu under
sub-sections (2).  or  (3)  of	section	 16A  of  MISA,	 the
provisions of  sections 8  to 12  of MISA would not apply to
such a	detenu. The  result would be that the grounds of the
order of  detention would  not be  disclosed to	 the  person
affected by  the order.	 There would also be no reference of
the case of such a person to the Advisory Board.

<p id="p_482">     So far  as the impact of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1226">section 16A(9)</a> is concerned on
the extent   of	 the power  of judicial scrutiny in writs of
habeas corpus  relating to persons detained under MISA, I am
of the view that the matter should not be gone into in these
appeals for the following reasons.
</p><p id="p_483">     Out of  the nine  High  Courts  which  dealt  with	 the
question of maintainability of petitions for writs of habeas
corpus, only  two, namely,  Rajsthan High  Court and  Nagpur
Bench of Bombay High Court have gone into this aspect, while
the other  seven have  not expressed and view in the matter.
Both Rajasthan	High Court  and Nagpur	Bench of  the Bombay
High Court have upheld the validity of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1227">section 16A(9)</a>. While
Rajasthan High	Court has  not read  down the  provisions of
section 16A(9) the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court has
expressed the view that it would be permissible for the High
Court  to   can	 for  and  peruse  the	grounds	 in  certain
circumstances. The  Nagpur Bench,  it may  be  pointed	out,
dealt with  the provisions  of section 16 A(9), as they then
existed before its amendment by Act 14 of 1976.
</p><p id="p_484">     Before us	arguments have	been addressed	on behalf of
the respondents	 challenging the validity of <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_1228">section 16</a>,A(9)
on the	ground that  it is violative of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1229">article 226</a> inasmuch
as it  prevents the  High Court	 from effectively exercising
the jurisdiction  under that  article to issue was of habeas
corpus. In  my opinion, it would not be permissible in these
appeals against orders disposing of preliminary objection to
decide the  question of	 validity of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1230">section 16A(9)</a>.  It is
manifest that  any decision  on the question of the validity
of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1231">section  16A(9)</a> would  result  either  in  upholding	 the
validity of the provision or in striking it down. The latter
course	is   out  of   question	 for  it  would	 be  plainly
impermissible to  strike down the provision in appeal by the
State when the validity of such provision has been upheld by
the High  Court. Like-wise,  it would  he  impermissible  in
these appeals to record a finding that the ambit of judicial
scrutiny is  greater than  that found by the High Court even
though	this   Court  on   consideration  of   the  relevant
provisions comes  to that  conclusion. There  is  no  appeal
before us by the detenu-respondents. This Court in appeal by
the State  cannot  enlarge  the	 area  of  the	unfavourable
decision qua  the State and make its position worse compared
to what	 it was	 before the filing of the appeal. Procedural
propriety in  matters relating	to appeals  forbids  such  a
course. The  appeals before  us are  primarily	against	 the
orders of  the	High  Court  disposing	of  the	 preliminary
objections relating,  to the  maintainability  of  petitions
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1232">article  226</a> for writs of habeas corpus in view of the
Presidential order.  The  question  of	extent	of  judicial
scrutiny in  the light	of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1233">section 16A</a> should, in my opinion
be gone into when the whole matter is at large before us and
we are	not inhibited  by procedural  and other	 constraints
from going  into certain aspects which have a vital bearing.
It is primarily for the High Courts before which the matters
are pending to decide the question area of judicial scrutiny
in the	light of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1234">section 16A(9)</a>,  as amended  by Act  14 of
1976. A	 course which  has the	effect of bypassing the High
Courts and  making this	 Court in  appeals  from  orders  on
preliminary objection  to decide  the matter even before the
matter has been considered by the High Court in the light of
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1235">section 16A</a>,  as amended  by Act  14 of	 1976" should, in my
opinion, be avoided.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">302</span>
<p id="p_485">     The observations on pages 658 and 659 in the case of <a href="/doc/1205745/" id="a_1236">J.
K. Synthetics Ltd. v. J. K. Synthetics Mazdoor Union</a> (1) can
be of  no assistance in this case because what has been laid
down there is that the respondent can support an award of an
Industrial Tribunal  on a  ground no adopted by the Tribunal
so long	 as in	the final  result the amount award ed is not
exceeded. The  observations in	that case do not warrant the
enlargement of	the area of unfavourable decision against an
appellant in the absence of an appeal by the respondent. Nor
does that  decision justify adoption of a course which might
conceivably lead to such result. Likewise, no assistance can
be  derived   from  clause   (3)  of   <a href="/doc/783690/" id="a_1237">article	132</a>  of	 the
Constitution because of the fact that the appeal against the
order of the Rajsthan High Court has been filed in pursuance
of a  certificate of fitness granted under that article. The
only point  on which  the Rajasthan  High Court	 has decided
against the  appellant is  regarding the  maintainability of
the petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1238">article 226.</a> The effect of <a href="/doc/17867/" id="a_1239">article 132(3)</a>
would only  be that  it would  be permissible  to assail the
order of  the High  Court on the question of Maintability of
the petition  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1240">article  226</a>  not  only  on	 the  ground
relating to  the question of as to the interpretation of the
Constitution mentioned in the order granting the certificate
but also  with the  leave of this Court on other grounds. It
is, however,  not the  effect of  <a href="/doc/17867/" id="a_1241">article 132(3)</a> that if the
High Court  in	the  impugned  order  decides  two  distinct
preliminary issues, one in favour of one party and the other
in favour  of the opposite party, this Court in an appeal by
only one party against that order of the High Court can also
go into	 the correctness of the issue which has been decided
in favour of the appellant. The fact that the respondents in
these appeals have as a matter of abundant caution addressed
arguments on  sub section  (9) of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1242">section 16A</a>,	 so that the
submissions of	the appellants	on that point may not remain
unanswered, would  not justify	departure from the principle
that this  Court cannot,  in the absence of an appeal by the
respondent, adopt  a course  which might conceivably enlarge
the area of unfavourable decision against the appellant.
</p><p id="p_486">     I am,  therefore, of  the	view  that  the	 appropriate
occasion for  going into  the question of the constitutional
validity of  section 16A(9)  of MISA  and its  impact on the
power and  extent of  judicial scrutiny	 in writs  of habeas
corpus would  be when  the State  or  detenu,  whosoever  is
aggrieved, comes  up in appeal against the final judgment in
any of	the petitions  pending in the High Courts. The whole
matter would  then be at large before us and we would not be
inhibited by  procedural and  other constraints	 referred to
above. It would not, in my opinion, be permissible or proper
to short  circuit the  whole thing  and decide the matter by
bypassing the High Courts who are seized of the matter.
</p><p id="p_487">     I may now summarise my conclusions:
</p><p id="p_488">	  (1) <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1243">Article 21</a> cannot be considered to be the sole
     repository of the right to life and personal liberty.
	  (2) Even  in the  absence of	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1244">article	 21</a>  in	 the
     Constitution, the	State has  got no power to deprive a
     person of	his life  or personal  liberty	without	 the
     authority of law. That is
     (1) [1972] 1 S. C. R 651.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">303</span>
<p id="p_489">     the essential  postulate and  basic assumption  of	 the
     rule of law in every civilised society.
</p><p id="p_490">	  (3) According	 to law in force in India before the
     coming into  force of the Constitution, no one could be
     deprived of  his life  or personal	 liberty without the
     authority of  law. Such  a law continued to be in force
     after the coming into force of the Constitution in view
     of <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1245">article 372</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_491">	  (4) Startling	 consequences would  follow from the
     acceptance of  the contention  that consequent upon the
     issue of  the Presidential order in question no one can
     seek relief  from courts during the period of emergency
     against deprivation  of life  and personal	 liberty. If
     two  constructions	  of  the  Presidential	 order	were
     possible, the  court should  lean in  favour of  a view
     which  does   not	result	 in  such  consequence.	 The
     construction which does not result in such consequences
     is	 not   only  possible,	 it  is	  also	preeminently
     reasonable.
</p><p id="p_492">	  (5) In  a long chain of authorities this Court has
     laid stress  upon the  prevalence of the rule of law in
     the country,  according to	 which the  executive cannot
     take action  prejudicial to  the right of an individual
     without the  authority of law. There is no valid reason
     to depart	from the  rule laid  down in those decisions
     some of  which were  given by  Benches larger  than the
     Bench dealing with these appeals.
</p><p id="p_493">	  (6)  According  to  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1246">article  21</a>,  no	one  can  be
     deprived or  his life  or personal	 liberty  except  in
     accordance with procedure established by law. Procedure
     for the  exercise of power of depriving a person of his
     life or  personal liberty	necessarily  postulates	 the
     existence of  the substantive power. Then <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1247">article 21</a> is
     in force,	law relating  to  deprivation  of  life	 and
     personal liberty  must provide both for the substantive
     power as  wen as the procedure for the exercise of such
     power. When  right to move any Court for enforcement of
     right guaranteed  by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1248">article  21</a> is suspended, it would
     have the  effect of  dispensing with  the necessity  of
     prescribing procedure  for the  exercise of substantive
     power to  deprive a  person of  his  life	or  personal
     liberty, it  cannot have  the effect  of permitting  an
     authority to  deprive a  person of his life or personal
     liberty  without  the  existence  of  such	 substantive
     power.
</p><p id="p_494">	  (7) A	 Presidential order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1249">article 359(1)</a> can
     suspend during  the period	 of emergency only the right
     to move  any court	 for enforcement  of the fundamental
     rights  mentioned	in  the	 order.	 Rights	 created  by
     statutes being  not fundamental  rights can be enforced
     during the period of emergency despite the Presidential
     order.  Obligations   and	liabilities   flowing	from
     statutory provisions  likewise remain unaffected by the
     Presidential order.  Any redress sought from a court of
     law on  the score	of breach  of statutory	 pro visions
     would be  outside the purview of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1250">article 359(1)</a> and the
     Presidential order made thereunder.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">304</span>
<p id="p_495">	  (8) <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1251">Article  226</a> under  which the  High Courts can
     issue writs of habeas corpus is an integral part of the
     Constitution. No  power has  been	conferred  upon	 any
     authority in  the Constitution for suspending the power
     of the  High Court	 to issue  writs in  the  nature  of
     habeas corpus  during the	period of  emergency. Such a
     result  cannot   be  brought   about  by  putting	some
     particular construction  on the  presidential order  in
     question
	  (9) There  is no  antithesis between	the power of
     the State	to detain a person without trial under a law
     of preventive  detention and  the power of the court to
     examine the  validity of  such detention. In exercising
     such power	 the courts  only ensure  that the detaining
     authority acts in accordance with the law providing for
     preventive detention.
</p><p id="p_496">	  (10) There  is no  sufficient ground	to interfere
     with the  view taken  by an  the nine High Courts which
     went into	the matter that the Presidential order dated
     June 27, 1975 did not affect the maintainability of the
     habeas corpus petitions to question the legality of the
     detention orders.
</p><p id="p_497">	  (11) The  principles which  should he	 followed by
     the courts	 in dealing  with  petitions  for  writs  of
     habeas corpus   to	 challenge the legality of detention
     are well-established.
</p><p id="p_498">	  (12) The appropriate occasion for this Court to go
     into the  constitutional validity of section 161A(9) of
     MISA and its impact on the power and extent of judicial
     scrutiny in  writs of  habeas corpus  would be when the
     State or  a detenu	 whosoever is aggrieved, comes up in
     appeal  against  the  final  judgment  in	any  of	 the
     petitions pending	in the High Courts. The whole matter
     would then	 be at	large before this Court and it would
     not be  inhabited by  procedural and other constraints.
     It would not be permissible or proper for this Court to
     short circuit  the whole thing and decide the matter by
     by-passing the  High  Courts  who	are  seized  of	 the
     matter.
</p><p id="p_499">     Before I  part with  the case,  I may  observe that the
consciousness that  the view  expressed by me is at variance
with that  of the  majority of	my learned  brethern has not
stood in  the way  of my ex pressing the same. I am aware of
the  desirability   of	unanimity,  if	possible.  Unanimity
obtained  without   sacrifice  of  conviction  comments	 the
decision to  public confidence.	 Unanimity which  is  merely
formal and  which is  recorded	at  the	 expense  of  strong
conflicting views  is not  desirable  in  a  court  of	last
resort. As  observed by	 Chief Justice Hughes (1) judges are
not there  simply to  decide cases,  but t to decide them as
they think  they should	 be decided,  and while	 if  may  be
regrettable that they cannot always agree, it is better that
their independence  should be maintained and recognized than
that unanimity	should be  secured through  its sacrifice. A
dissent in  a court  of last  resort to use his words, is an
appeal lo the brooding spirit of the law to the intelligence
of a  future day, when a later decision may possibly correct
the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court
to have been betrayed.

<p id="p_502">     BEG, J.  The two  principal questions  placed before us
for determination  in these  appeals from decisions given by
various High  Courts, on  certain preliminary  objections to
the maintainability  and hearing of Habeas Corpus petitions,
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1252">Article  226</a> of  our Constitution, have been stated as
follows by the Attorney General of India:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_108">	  1.   Whether, in  view of  the Presidential  order
	       dated June  27, 1975,  under  Clause  (1)  of
	       <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1253">Article	 359</a>,	 any   writ    petition	  is
	       maintainable under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1254">Article 226</a>, before a High
	       Court for  Habeas Corpus to enforce the right
	       to personal  liberty  of	 a  person  detained
	       under the  Maintenance of  Internal  Security
	       Act on the ground that the order of detention
	       or  the	 continued  detention  is,  for	 any
	       reason,	not  under  or	in  compliance	with
	       Maintenance of Internal Security Act ?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_109">	  2.   If such	a petition  is maintainable, what is
	       the scope  or ex	 tent of  judicial scrutiny,
	       particularly,  in   view	 of   the  aforesaid
	       Presidential order  which covers, inter alia,
	       Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1255">Article 22</a>, and also in view of
	       sub-section  (9)	  of  Section	16A  of	 the
	       Maintenance of Internal Security Act ?</blockquote>
<p id="p_503">     If the  only reason  on which  a detention is assailed,
could be  that the provisions of the Maintenance of Internal
Security Act  26 of  1971 (hereinafter	referred to  as 'the
Act') have  not been  complied with,  there could  be little
difficulty in  holding, having	regard to  the	natural	 and
obvious meaning	 of the suspension of "the right to move any
Court for  the enforcement"  of	 the  fundamental  right  to
personal  liberty,   protected	by   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1256">Article   21</a>   of	 the
Constitution, that this right, with whatever it evolved from
or embraced,  could not	 be the	 basis for  any claim to its
enforcement during  the Emergency. An that would then remain
to consider  would be  the exact point at which and the form
in which  the order  of the  Court denying the petitioner an
enforcement of	the right  could be passed. The last part of
the first  question, however,  also brings  into the area of
discussion the case where a petitioner alleges that "for any
reason" his  detention	fans  completely  outside  the	Act.
Detenues allege	 not merely  infraction of some provision of
the Act,  under which  a detention  is	ordered,  but,	more
often, that  the detention is for extraneous reasons falling
either entirely or partially outside the Act. "Malafides" is
almost invariably  alleged presumably on the assumption that
almost everything  the detenue	considers  either  wrong  or
erroneous or improper must be "mala fide".
</p><p id="p_504">     Arguments addressed  to us	 on behalf  of the  detenues
have raised  a host of hypothetical questions, such as: What
would be the position if the order of detention, on the face
of it,	either fans  outside the provisions of the Act or is
made mala  fide ? Would a detention order, by any Government
servant without	 even an  ostensible or	 purported statutory
authority to  support it, not stand on the same footing as a
detention  by	a  private   person?  Would  remedy  against
detention which	 may be	 patently illegal.  without need for
any real  investigation into  facts at	an also	 be barred ?
Could remedy  by way  of a writ of Habeas Corpus against any
illegal detention by any one in this country,
     22-833 Sup CI/76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">306</span>
under any  circumstances, be held to be suspended during the
Emergency ?  The next  steps in	 the argument  on behalf  of
detenues consisted  of attempts	 to show that there could be
no distinction	in principle,  between an  order  which	 is,
prima facie, ultra vires or made mala fide and one which can
be shown  to be	 that only  if the  facts and  circumstances
surrounding a  detention were fully investigated in a Court.
Processes of  reasoning, based	on  hypothetical  cases	 put
forward for consideration by us, by learned Counsel for tile
detenus	 seek,	 by  stages   to  so   expand  the  area  of
maintainability and  investigation on  claims for  writs  of
Habeas Corpus  in the  High Courts  that, if we accept them,
the result would be that <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1257">Article 359</a> of the Constitution and
the Presidential  orders of  1975 made under it would become
entirely meaningless and infructuous.
</p><p id="p_505">     It seems  to me  that the	two questions set out above,
could very wen be compressed into a single question: To what
extent, if  at an,  can a  High Court  be moved	 to assert a
right to  personal liberty,  by means  of a  petition  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1258">Article 226</a>  for a  writ of  Habeas Habeas Corpus during the
operation of the Presidential order of 27th June, 1975 ?
</p><p id="p_506">     Speaking for myself, I am extremely reluctant to embark
on a  consideration and	 decision of  any "pure" question of
law. In	  cases	 coming up before Courts, no question of law
can be	"pure" in  the sense  that it  has no bearing on the
facts of  a particular	case to which it must necessarily be
related.  Neither   <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_1259">Article  136</a>  nor  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1260">Article	226</a>  of	 the
Constitution is	 meant	for  the  exercise  of	an  advisory
jurisdiction. Attempts	to lay	down the  law in an abstract
form, unrelated	 to the	 facts of particular cases, not only
do not	appertain to  the kind	of jurisdiction exercised by
this Court  or by  the	High  Courts  under  the  provisions
mentioned above,  but may  result in  misapplications of the
law declared by Courts to situations for which they were not
intended at an.
</p><p id="p_507">     Learned Counsel for the detenus have tried to induce us
to  answer   many  questions   which  may  arise  in  purely
hypothetical situations	 some of  which seem to me to be far
removed from  the realms  of reality.  We cannot assume that
those who  exercise powers  of detention are bound to do so,
as a  rule, as though they were demented reports without any
regard for  law, justice,  reason, or  honesty	of  purpose,
solely for  achieving objects  other than  those  which	 are
really meant  to be  served by the Act. Both sides, however,
desire that  we should	answer questions  indicated above on
the assumption	that the  provisions of law contained in the
Act have  been infringed,  in some  way,  by  the  detaining
authorities in	a particular  case. They want us to indicate
degrees of  transgression of  the provisions  of the Act, if
any, which  can justify	 interference by  the High Courts in
Habeas Corpus  proceedings. As	the facts  of no  particular
case are  before s, we can only answer the questions before
us  with   the	help,	where  necessary,   of	 appropriate
hypothetical examples.
</p><p id="p_508">     The learned  Attorney General  has,  very	frankly	 and
honestly, submitted  that there	 was no	 need to bestow upon
actions of the detaining authorities the protection given to
them only for the duration of the Emergency proclaimed under
<a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_1261">Article 352(1 )</a> of the Constitution, if the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">307</span>
President did not really intend to confer certain immunities
from judicial  scrutiny and  interference upon detentions by
executive authorities, even if some of them were contrary to
the letter of the law, so that certain over-riding interests
of  national   security	 and   independence   may   not	  be
jeopardized. The  Attorney General's  submission is that the
risks of  misuse of  powers by	the detaining  officers	 and
authorities, which  are certainly there, must be presumed to
have been  over-ridden by  the	higher	claims	of  national
security which the proclamation of emergency denotes. It was
pointed out  that a  citizen, or  other person	who may have
been unfairly  or illegally detained due to some unfortunate
misapprehension	 or   error,  does   not  loose	 his  remedy
altogether.  Only   his	 right	to  move  a  Court  for	 the
enforcement of	any of	the rights  conferred by Part III of
the Constitution  would be  suspended for the time being. He
could always  approach higher  Governmental authorities. All
of them could not be so unreasonable as to deny redress in a
case of genuine injustice.
</p><p id="p_509">     The propositions thus stated appear to be so reasonable
and are	 so wen founded, as I shall endeavour to show later,
in the	course of  this judgment,  in the Constitutional and
legal history  and the	case law  of other countries, during
periods of Emergency, from whose constitutions what has been
described as  the "ancient  writ of  habeas Corpus" has been
taken and  transplanted into  our Constitution	that it	 may
seem somewhat  surprising that	their correctness  should be
doubted or denied at an. The propositions have, however, not
only been vehemently assailed but the attacks upon them were
sought to  be supported by attempts to engraft theories upon
our Constitution  which, if  accepted, win destroy the basic
principle of the supremacy of the written Constitution which
I attempted,  in <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_1262">Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain</a>
(1), to explain at some length.
</p><p id="p_510">     If the clear and unequivocal language of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1263">Article 359(1)</a>
of our	Constitution is	 the bed-rock  on which the Attorney
General's arguments to sustain the preliminary objections to
the maintainability  of Habeas	Corpus petitions  during the
Emergency rest,	 learned Counsel  for the  detenus have	 put
forward theories  of a nebulous natural law and a common law
which, on close scrutiny, appear to me to resolve themselves
into what  according to	 the notions  of learned Counsel for
the detenus,  the law  ought to	 be. Strenuous attempts have
been made  to dress  up these notions in the impressive garb
of the	"Rule of  Law" which  evokes the genuine and our and
respectful devotion of lawyers and public spirited citizens.
But,  the   mere  veneration   of  a   caption	without	  an
understanding of what it really denoted in the past and what
it  means   or	should	mean  today,  is  another  name	 for
obfuscation of thought.
</p><p id="p_511">     Even in  England, the  reputed home of the Rule of Law,
the rather loose, general, and in exact meaning given to the
term by	 Dicey to  describe and	 glorify  certain  assumedly
special characteristics	 of the	 English Constitution,	have
given place  to more  realistic,  critical,  and  scientific
views of the "Rule of Law" and what Dicey meant: by it. Sir

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">308</span>
<p id="p_512">Ivor Jennings,	in "The	 Law and the Constitution" (3rd Edn.
p. 296) pointed out: .
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_110">	  "Dicey  honestly   tried  (in	  The  Law   of	 the
     Constitution, not	in his	polemical works) to analyse,
     but, like most, he saw the Constitution through his own
     spectacles, and his vision was not exact. The growth of
     the new  functions of  the State  has made	 much of his
     analysis  irrelevant.   Moreover,	the   argument	from
     history  or,   what  is   the  same   thing,  from	 the
     Constitution must	be used with discretion. To say that
     a new  policy is  'unconstitutional' is  merely to	 say
     that it is contrary to tradition, and it must always be
     considered whether	 the tradition	is relevant  to	 new
     circumstances.  Even  if  the  rule  of  law  as  Dicey
     expounded	it  had	 been  exact,  it  would  not  be  a
     sufficient argument  to say  of any  proposal,  as	 the
     Committee on  Ministers' Powers  said on a minor point,
     that it was contrary to the rule of law".</blockquote>
<p id="p_513">     Those who	glibly talk of the Rule of Law, as expounded
by Dicey,  forget that	Prof. Dicey  had made a very gallant
and effective  (I would	 not like  to use  here a colloquial
expression, "desperate",  to describe  it) attempt  to repel
the correctness	 of what  he caned  "the dark  saying" of de
Tocqueville   that   the   largely   conventional   "English
Constitution has  no real  existence 'elle  n'existe point)"
(See: page  22 of  the Dicey's "Introduction to the Study of
the Law	 of the Constitution"-10th Edn.). He was at pains to
show that  the Constitutional  Law of Eng land did exist. It
lived and  functioned not  only in  the hearts	and minds of
Englishmen, also  reflected in	Parliament, but	 through the
force of  healthy conventions  and highly disciplined habits
of life and thought of the British people. These conventions
and habits  had, behind	 them, the  sanction not  only of  a
powerful and  intelligent public  opinion but  also  of	 the
control by  the Houses of Parliament, wrested from the Crown
in the course of historic constitutional struggles, over the
finances of  the nation. Dicey distinguished this peculiarly
British Constitutional	Law from  "political ethics"  which,
according to  him, was "mis-called Constitution Law". It was
not, he	 pointed  out,	International  law,  the  "vanishing
point" of law.
</p><p id="p_514">     Dicey succeeded,  at least	 so far	 as his statement of
the Rule  of Law  is concerned,	 in doing  nothing more than
indicating,  under  this  heading,  certain  common  guiding
principles for	Courts as  wen as Legislators to follow when
they needed  these. Hence,  he said that the Rule of law and
the legal  Sovereignty of Parliament were allies in England.
According to  him, both	 these principles  so operated as to
always support	and strengthen	each other.  This idealistic
rosy optimism,	reflecting the	Whig  tradition	 of  minimum
interference with  individual freedoms	and representing the
Constitutional jurisprudence  of the  hey-day of  a  laissez
faire  British	economic  prosperity,  was  destined  to  be
displaced by  the more "down to the earth" pragmatism of the
Twentieth  Century  Britain,  attempting  to  meet  economic
difficulties and  distress through  socialistic planning and
to build  a welfare  State by  making laws which appeared to
those brought  up on  the traditional  postulates of Dicey's
Rule of Law to deny the validity of its basic assumptions.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">309</span>
<p id="p_515">     The first of these assumptions or meanings was that any
depravation of personal liberty or property must not only be
for a  "distinct breach	 of law"  but  "established  in	 the
ordinary legal	manner before  the ordinary  Courts  of	 the
land". He  contrasted this  "with every system of government
based on  the exercise	by persons  in	authority  of  wide,
arbitrary,  or	 discretionary	powers	of  constraint".  He
concluded, from	 what he  regarded as a basic Feature of the
British Constitution,  that an	modes of dispensing justice,
through specialised  administrative authorities	 and bodies,
must necessarily  be autocratic	 and unfair. He compared the
British system	with the  one under which Voltaire, in 1717,
was "sent  to the  Bastille for	 a poem	 which	he  had	 not
written, of  which he  did not know the author, and with the
sentiments of which he did not agree". The second assumption
of Dicey's Rule of law was. "Every man, whatever be his rank
or condition,  is subject  to the  ordinary law of the realm
and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals".
He overlooked the not infrequent injustice caused in England
of his	time, due  to want  of adequate remedies against the
servants of  the Crown,	 by applications  of the maxim: "The
King can  do no	 wrong". He  wrote "With  us every official,
from the  Prime Minister  down to a constable or a collector
of taxes,  is under  the same  responsibility for  every act
done without  legal justification as any other citizen". The
third assumption  on which  Dicey's Rule  of Law  rested was
what he	 caned "the  predominance of the Legal Spirit" which
he  described	"as   a	  special   attribute	of   English
Institutions". He explained:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_111">	  "We may  say that  the constitution is pervaded by
     the  rule	of  law	 on  the  ground  that	the  general
     principles of  the constitution  (as  for	example	 the
     right to  personal liberty,  or  the  right  of  public
     meeting) are  with us  the result of judicial decisions
     determining the rights of private persons in particular
     cases brought  before the	Courts; whereas	 under	many
     foreign constitutions  the security  (such	 as  it	 is)
     given to  the rights of individuals results, or appears
     to	 result	  from	the   general  principles   of	 the
     constitution".
</blockquote><p id="p_516">Dicey observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_112">	  "There is  in the  English constitution an absence
     or these  declarations or definitions of rights so dear
     to	  foreign   constitutionalists.	  Such	 principles?
     moreover,	as   you  can	discover  in   the   English
     constitution  are,	  like	an   maxims  established  by
     judicial legislation, mere generalisations drawn either
     from the decisions or dicta of judges, or from statutes
     which, being  passed to meet special grievances, bear a
     close resemblance	to judicial  decisions, and  are  in
     effect  judgments	pronounced  by	the  High  Court  of
     Parliament. To  put what  is really the same thing in a
     somewhat different shape, the relation of the rights of
     individuals to  the principles  of the  constitution is
     not quite the same in countries like Belgium, where the
     Constitution is the result of a legislative act, as` it
     is in  England, where  the constitution itself is based
     upon legal decisions".</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">310</span>
<p id="p_517">     Thus, Dicey  depicted  the	 British  Parliament,  while
performing even-its  legislative functions,  as if  it was a
Court following	 the path  shown by  judges fined  with	 the
spirit of  law and with meticulous concern for an the canons
of justice.  He concluded: "Our Constitution, in short, is a
Judge-made Constitution	 and it	 bears on  its face  an	 the
features, good and bad, of judge made law".
</p><p id="p_518">     Dicey thought that the difference between the unwritten
British Constitution and a written Constituion, such as that
of Belgium,  was not  merely  a	 formal	 one,  but  revealed
entirely differing approaches to basic freedoms. He observed
.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_113">	  "The matter  to be  noted is, that where the right
     to individual  freedom is	a result  deduced  from	 the
     principles of the constitution, the idea readily occurs
     that the  right is	 capable of being suspended or taken
     away. Where, on the other hand, the right to individual
     freedom is	 part of  the  constitution  because  it  is
     inherent in  the ordinary law of the land, the right is
     one which	can hardly  be destroyed  without a  through
     revolution in  the	 institutions  and  manners  of	 the
     nation."</blockquote>
<p id="p_519">     After making  the distinction  mentioned  above,  Dicey
deals with  "the so-called  suspension of  the Habeas Corpus
Act". He said that it bears "a certain similarity to what is
caned in  foreign countries  'suspending the  constitutional
guarantees' ".. He euphemistically, explained:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_114">	  "But, after  an, a  statute suspending  the Habeas
     Corpus Act	 falls very  far short	of what	 its popular
     name seems	 to imply;  and	 though	 a  serious  measure
     enough, is	 not, in  reality, more than a suspension of
     one particular  remedy for	 the protection	 of personal
     freedom. The Habeas Corpus Act may be suspended and yet
     Englishmen may enjoy almost all the rights of citizens.
     The constitution  being based  on the  rule of law, the
     suspension of  the constituion,  as far as such a thing
     can be  conceived possible,  would mean with us nothing
     less than a revolution".
</blockquote><p id="p_520">If Dicey,  bewitched by the beauties of an unwritten British
Constitution  could   have  been   shocked  by	 any  modern
transgressions of the basic principles of his "Rule of Law"-
in the	Introduction to	 later editions	 of his	 book, Dicey
modified his  earlier views,  to  some	extent,	 about.	 the
nature and  purposes of	 "Droit Administratif", accepted the
inevitability	of   change,   and   noticed   the   logical
consequences of	 what he  himself had described, in his "Law
and opinion  in England", as the Collectivist or Socialistic
trend-he  would	  have	been   even  more   shocked  by	 the
proposition that  the cherished	 principles of	his Rule' of
Law  could  override  the  statute  law	 which	the  British
Parliament could  make and  unmake in  the exercise, of what
Dicey called  the "Sovereignty	of Parliament". The truth is
that Dicey  did not,  at first	visualise the possibility of
any conflict  between the  Rule of Law and the principles of
Parliamentary  Sovereignty   in	 England.   And,   correctly
understood and applied, there should not be serious conflict
between	 them.	 But,  are   principles	  always   correctly
understood and applied ?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">311</span>
<p id="p_521">     Jennings critically  commented upon Dicey's views (See:
"The Law and the Constitution" 3rd Edn. p. 294) as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_115">	  The rules  which in  foreign	countries  naturally
     form part of a constitutional code "mostly do not exist
     in England,  for the recognised (or legal) supremacy of
     Parliament presents  any  fundamental  distribution  of
     powers and forbids the existence of fundamental rights.
     The supremacy  of Parliament is the Constitution. It is
     recognised	 as   fundamental  law	just  as  a  written
     constitution is  recognised as  fundamental law Various
     Public.,  authorities   the  Crown,   the	 Houses	  of
     Parliament, the  courts, the administrative authorities
     have powers  and duties. Most of them are determined by
     statute. Some  are traditional, and so are 'determined'
     by	 the   common  law.  The  powers  of  administrative
     authorities in  respect of	 'fundamental liberties' are
     mainly contained  in statutes.  But even  if they	were
     not, I  do not understand how it is correct to say that
     the  rules	  are  the  consequence	 of  the  rights  of
     individuals and  not their	 source. The  powers of	 the
     Crown  and	 of  other  administrative  authorities	 are
     limited by	 the rights of individuals; or the rights of
     individuals  are	limited	 by   the  powers   of	 the
     administration. Both  statements are  correct; and both
     powers and rights come from the law-from the rules".</blockquote>
<p id="p_522">     Thus, Jennings  pointed out  that what was material was
the existence of rules, as a part of Constitutional law, and
not their  sources or forms. He tried to show that the basic
rule being  the supremacy  of Statutory	 law that  was	"The
Constitution" in  Britain. No  other rule could compete with
it or  stand in its way or be a substitute for it. Dicey, on
the other  hand, believed that the difference in sources and
forms of  rules made  a great  difference  in  approach	 and
outlook. But,  Dicey also treated the judge-made Rule of Law
and the	 rights "guaranteed"  by a  written constitution  as
alternatives or	 different modes  of protecting same species
of rights.  He never  dreamt of	 looking upon  them both  as
simultaneously	existing   and	available  Under  a  written
Constitution  in   addition  to	 what  such  a	Constitution
contained.
</p><p id="p_523">     Dicey, indicated  the  basic  distinction	between	 the
Constitutional	position   in  England"	 with  an  unwritten
Constitution where  the supremacy  of Parliament  prevailed,
and that  in the  United States	 of America,  with a written
Constitution which was supreme. But, despite the differences
in the logical consequences of an unwritten constitution, in
a  country  so	largely	 governed  by  its  conventions	 and
disciplined habits  of life  and thought as Dicey's England,
and those  of the  written Constitution	 of the	 U.S.A., one
common feature, snared by both English and American systems,
was the	 large amount  of judicial Constitutional law making
which took place in both countries.
</p><p id="p_524">     In Britain, although the Parliament is the supreme law-
giver, yet,  as Dicey pointed out, there was, out of respect
for the judicial function and the Rule of Law, an acceptance
of judge  made law  as the  constitutional law	of the	land
which the Parliament could alter, whenever it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">312</span>
liked, but  did not  think of altering presumably because it
served very  wen, the needs of British people who took pride
in their judge made law. Of course, if Parliament did make a
law  on	  any  subject	 and  it   has	made  some  laws  on
Constitutional matters	also the  Courts could	not think of
questioning the validity of the law so made.
</p><p id="p_525">     In America,  not only  was	 the  doctrine	of  judicial
review of  legislation, established  by Marshall,  C. J., in
Marbury v.  Madison  (1)  but  the  "due  process"  clauses,
introduced by  the 5th	amendment (1791)  and  by  the	14th
amendment (1868)  of the  American Constitution,  became the
most prolific  sources of  judicial law-making. They gave to
the American Courts an amplitude of power to indulge in what
is  caned  "judicial  legislation"  which  our	Constitution
makers, after  considerable debate, deliberately eschewed by
using the expression ''procedure established by law" instead
of the	"due process  of law". Willis, adverting to the very
skeletal character of the American Constitution, said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_116">	  "Our original Constitution was not an anchor but a
     rudder. The Constitution of one period has not been the
     Constitution of  another  period.	As  one	 period	 has
     succeeded another,	 the Constitution  has become larger
     and larger."</blockquote>
<p id="p_526">     <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_1264">In A.  K.	Gopalan	 v.  The  State	 of  Madras</a>,(2)	 the
earliest  case	 in  which  a  comprehensive  discussion  of
fundamental guaranteed	freedoms in  our  Constitution	took
place, Kania,  C. J.,  after referring	to  observations  of
Munro, of  James Russen	 Lowen, of  Winis, and of Cooley, on
the American  Constitution, noted  about the  nature of	 our
Constitution (at p. 109):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_117">	  "The	Constitution   itself  provides	  in  minute
     details the  legislative powers  of the  Parliament and
     the State	Legislatures. The same feature is noticeable
     in the  case of the judiciary, finance, trade, commerce
     and services.  It is  thus quite detailed and the whole
     of it  has to  be read  with the same sanctity, without
     giving undue  weight to Part III or <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1265">article 246</a>, except
     to the  extent one	 is legitimately and clearly limited
     by the other".</blockquote>
<p id="p_527">     The position  in this  country is	clearly one in which
the fundamental	 law found in the Constitution is paramount.
The Constitution  provides the	test for  the validity of an
other laws. It seeks to deter mine. the spheres of executive
and legislative and judicial powers with meticulous care and
precision. The judicial function, though wider in range when
interpreting or applying other articles of the Constitution,
particularly Articles 14 and 19, the enforcement of which is
also suspended	during the  current Emergency, is especially
constricted by	the elaborate  provisions of Articles 21 and
22,  which   deal  with	  personal  liberty  and  preventive
detention. The	wider the sweep of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1266">Article
21</a> and	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1267">22</a> the more drastic must be the effect of suspending

mean retention under a disguise.

<p id="p_530">     The only  Rule of Law which can be recognised by Courts
of our	 country  is what is deducible from our Constitution
itself. The  Constitution is,  for us, the embodiment of the
highest "positive  law" as  wen as  the reflection of an the
rules of  natural or  ethical or  common law Lying behind it
which can  be recognised  by Courts.  It seems	to me  to be
legally quite  impossible to  successfully  appeal  to	some
spirit of  the Constitution  or to  any law  anterior to  or
supposed to  lie behind	 the Constitution  to frustrate	 the
objects of  the express provisions of the Constitution. I am
not aware of any Rule of Law or reason which could enable us
to do  that. What  we are asked to do seems nothing short of
building some imaginary parts of a Constitution, supposed to
lie behind  our existing  Constitution, which could take the
place of  those parts  of our Constitution whose enforcement
is suspended  and then	to enforce  the substitutes. And, we
were asked  by some  learned Counsel,  though not  by an, to
perform this  ambitious task of judicial Constitution making
without even  using the	 crutches of  implied imperatives of
our Constitutional  provisions as though we had some plenary
legislative Constituent	 powers. Fortunately, Judges in this
country have  no such powers. And, those who are meant to so
function as  to keep  the other	 authorities and  organs  of
State within  the limits  of their  powers cannot themselves
usurp powers  they do  not possess.  That  is  the  path  of
descent into  the arena of political controversy which is so
damaging  for  the  preservation  of  the  impartiality	 and
prestige of  the Judicial  function. We	 cannot,  therefore,
satisfy those who may feel the urge, as Omar Khayyam did "to
shatter" what  they regard  as "this  sorry scheme of things
entire" and  to "remould" it nearer their "heart's desire"'.
I think	 we must make it clear that the spirit of law or the
Rule of	 Law, which  we recognise, cannot, however ominously
around like  some disembodied  ghost serving as a substitute
for the	 living Constitution  we actually have. It has to be
found always  within and operating in harmony with and never
outside or in contact with what our Constitution enjoins. An
that  we   can	do   is	 to   faithfully  explain  what	 the
Constitution and  its spirit  mean. We cannot alter or twist
these.
</p><p id="p_531">     The distinction made above between law as it exists and
as it  has to  be recognised  and enforced  by	the  State's
judicial organs, and "the law", if we may can it that at an,
which could  only constitute  some rules of ethics but could
not be	enforced at an, whatever may be its moral worth, was
thus stated  by John  Codman Hurd in his "Law of Freedom and
Bondage in  the United States" (Negro Universities Press New
York (Vol. I, at p. 3):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_118">	  "Now, jurisprudence  is taken to be the science of
     a rule  not merely	 existing, but one which is actually
     operative or  enforced in	or by  the win of society or
     the state.	 The Science  of what  rule ought to be made
     operative by the win of the state is a different thing;
     it is  a science  of rules	 regarded only	as existing,
     whether operative	in civil society-that is enforced-or
     not.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_119">	  A rule made operative by the authority of society,
     or	 of  the  state,  is  a	 rule  identified  with	 the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">314</span>
     ciety or  of the State. The win of the state, indicated
     in some  form of expression, is the law, the subject of
     jurisprudence, and	 no natural  rule which	 may  exist,
     forms a  part of the law unless identified with the win
     of the  state so  indicated. What the state wins is the
     conterminous measure  of law,  no pre  existing rule is
     the measure of that win".</blockquote>
<p id="p_532">     John Codman  Hurd went  on to  point out  that judicial
authorities constituted	 by the State can only carry out the
mandates  of   the  positive  law  which,  for	purposes  of
enforcement, must  be deemed  to embody	 an the pre-existing
enforceable natural and ethical values.
</p><p id="p_533">     Enforceability, as	 an attribute  of a legal right, and
the power of the judicial organs of the State to enforce the
right,	are   exclusively  for	 the  State,  as  the  legal
instrument of Society, to confer or take away in the legally
authorised manner.  It follows	from these basic premises of
our Constitutional  jurisprudence that Courts cannot, during
a constitutionally  enjoined period  of	 suspension  of	 the
enforceability of Fundamental Rights through Courts, enforce
what  may  even	 be  a	"fundamental  right"  sought  to  be
protected by  Part III	of the	Constitution.  The  Attorney
General has, very fairly and rightly, repeatedly pointed out
that no	 substantive right,  whether declared fundamental or
not. except the procedural rights converted into substantive
ones by <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1268">Article 32.</a> could be suspended. Even the enforcement
in general  of an  such rights	is not	suspended. Even	 the
enforcement of	specified rights through Courts is suspended
for the time being.
</p><p id="p_534">     The enforceability	 of a  right by	 a  constitutionally
appointed judicial  organ has necessarily to depend upon the
fulfillment of two conditions: firstly its recognition by or
under the Constitution as a right. and, secondly, possession
of the power of its enforcement by the judicial organs. Now,
if a  right is	established, on	 facts, as  a right, it will
certainly satisfy  the first condition. But, if the right is
unenforceable, because	the  power  of	its  enforcement  by
Courts is  constitutionally suspended  or inhibited, for the
duration  of   the  Emergency,	 its  mere   recognition  or
declaration by Courts, either as a right or as a fundamental
right, could  not possibly  help a  petitioner to secure his
personal liberty.  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1269">Article 226</a>	of the	Constitution is	 not
meant for  futile and  unenforceable declarations  of right.
The whole purpose of a writ of Habeas Corpus is to enforce a
right  to  personal  freedom  after  the  declaration  of  a
detention as illegal when it is so found upon investigation.
</p><p id="p_535">     It may be that many moral and natural obligations exist
outside the  Constitution and even outside any positive law-
this is	 not denied  by the  learned Attorney  General at an
but, their  existence is not really relevant for purposes of
petitions for  writs of	 Habeas Corpus	which  lie  only  to
enforce Legally	 enforceable rights.  Neither the  existence
nor the	 possibilities of  denials  of	any  rights  by	 the
detaining officers  of the State, due to frailities of human
nature and  errors of  judgment, are  denied by the Attorney
General. ALL  that is  denied  is  the	correctness  of	 the
assertion that	they are  enforceable, during  the period of
Emergency, through Courts, if they fan within the purview of
rights whose enforcement is suspended.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">315</span>
<p id="p_536">     The result	 of the	 few very  general observations made
above by me,  before examining, in greater depth, any of the
very large  number of  connected questions  and side  issues
raised I  doubt whether	 it is	necessary or of much use, in
view  of   my  opinion	 on   the   preliminary	  issue	  of
enforceability, to  consider an	 of then  even	if  it	were
possible for me to do so-may be summarised as follows .
</p><p id="p_537">     Dicey's Rule of Law, with special meanings given to it,
was meant  to prove  the existence  and peculiarities of the
uncodified English  Constitutional Law.	 According to  Dicey
himself, these	features either	 did not  exist elsewhere or
were  the   very  objectives   of  provisions	of   written
Costitutions of other countries. On Dicey's very exposition,
no ordinary  Judge-made law  or common	law could survive in
opposition to statutory law in England, or, in conflict with
a written  Constitution where  there was one. Enforceability
of rights,  whether they are constitutional or common law or
statutory,   in	   constitutionally   prescribed   ways	  by
constitutionally  appointed  judicial  organs,	is  governed
solely	by   he	 term	of  the	  written  instrument  in  a
constitution such as curs. The scope for judicial law making
on the	subject of  enforcement of  the	 right	to  personal
freedom was  deliberately  restricted  by  our	Constitution
makers. In  any case,  it is difficult to see any such scope
when "enforcement"  itself is suspended. All we can do is to
determine the  effect of  this suspension.  We have  now  to
consider in  greater detail:  What is  it the enforcement of
which is  suspended and	 what, if  anything  remains  to  be
enforced ?
</p><p id="p_538">     In this  country, the  procedure for the deprivation as
wen as	enforcement. Of	 a  right  to  personal	 freedom  is
governed partly by the Constitution and partly by ordinarily
statutes. Both fan within the purview of procedure". <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1270">Article
21</a> of  the Constitution	 guarantees, though the guarantee is
negatively framed,  that "no person shall be deprived of his
life or	 personal  liberty  except  according  to  procedure
established by	law. If	 an enforcement	 of this  negatively
framed right  is suspended,  a deprivation  contrary lo	 the
prescribed procedure  is not  legalised. The  suspension  of
enforcement  does   not	 either	  authorise  or	 direct	 any
authority to  violate the  procedure. It  has to  be clearly
understood that	 who.. is  suspended is really the procedure
for the enforcement of a right through Courts which could be
said to	 flow from the infringment of a statutory procedure.
If  the	  enforcement  of  a  right  to	 be  free  resulting
derivatively from  both	 the  Constitutional  and  statutory
provisions, based  on an  infraction of the procedure, which
is statutory in cases of preventive detention, is suspended,
it seems  to me to be impossible to lay down that it becomes
enforceable  when  that	 part  of  the	procedure  which  is
mandatory is  violated but  remains unenforceable so long as
the part  of the  procedure infringed  is directory.  Such a
view would,  in any  opinion, introduced a distinction which
is neither  warranted by  the language of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1271">Article 359</a> of the
Constitution nor by that of the Presidential orders of 1975.
If the	claim to  assert the right is one based on violation
Of  procedure,	the  degree  of	 violation  may	 affect	 the
question whether the right to be free is established at all,
but, it	 should not,  logically speaking,  affect the result
where the  enforcement of the right, even in a case in which
it has become apparent, is suspended.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">316</span>
<p id="p_539">     The question,  however, which  has been most vehemently
argued is:  Does <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1272">Article 21</a> exhaust every kind of protection
given to  rights to  personal freedom ? Another way in which
this question was put is <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1273">Article 21</a> of the Constitution "the
sole repository"  of the  substantive as  wen as  procedural
rights embraced	 by the	 expression "personal liberty" ? one
of the contentions before us was that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1274">Article 21</a> does not go
beyond the  procedural protection  to  persons	who  may  be
deprived of personal liberty.
</p><p id="p_540">     Mr. Jethmalani,  learned Counsel  appearing for  one of
the detenues,  contended that  personal	 freedom  was  a  by
product of  the removal	 of constraints or hindrances to the
positive freedom of action of the individual. The contention
seemed to  be that  procedure for  depreciation	 of personal
liberty	 being	 one  of   the	ways  of  imposing  positive
constraints, the removal of a negative procedural protection
could not  dispense with  the necessity to establish a right
of the	detaining authority under some positive or statutory
law to	deprive a person detained of his liberty whether the
authority concerned  followed the  right procedure or not in
doing so.  The argument	 is that  proof of a just and reason
able cause,  falling within  the objects of the Act so as to
create a liability to be detained, must precede the adoption
of any	procedure to  detail  a	 person	 under	the  Act.  A
"satisfaction"	that   one  of	the  grounds  of  detention,
prescribed by  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1275">Section 3</a> of the Act, is there, was thus said
to  be	 a  "condition	 precedent"  to	  the  exercise	  of
jurisdiction to detain. This argument obviously proceeded on
a restricted  meaning given to the "procedure established by
law". It  is very  difficult to	 see why  the  satisfaction,
required by  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1276">Section 3</a>	of the	Act, is	 not really  part of
"procedure established by law".
</p><p id="p_541">     There is,	however, an  even more formidable difficulty
in the	way of	this argument.	If, as it is undeniable, the
procedure  under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1277">Article  226</a>	 is  the  direct  procedural
protection,  which   is	 suspended   by	 the  terms  of	 the
Presidential order,  read with	<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1278">Article 359</a>, <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1279">Article 226</a> win
not be	available to  the detenue at an, for the time being,
for showing  absence of	 the required  "satisfaction", as  a
condition precedent  to	 a    valid  detention	order  under
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1280">Section 3</a>  of the  Act. If the "right to move any Court" can
be suspended  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1281">Article 359</a>  is very  clear on the point there
remains no  right, for	the time  being, to  an inquiry into
conditions which  may enable  a party  to secure  release in
assertion of  rights guarantee	either by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1282">Article 21</a>  or by
other articles whose "enforcement" is suspended. Indeed, the
clear object  of such  a suspension  seems to  me to be that
Courts should not undertake inquiries into the violations of
the alleged right.
</p><p id="p_542">     If	 the   fundamental  rights   in	 Part	III  of	 the
Constitution are  not suspended,  as they obviously are not,
but only  their enforcement  can be and is suspended what is
really affected is the power conferred on Courts by Articles
32 and	226 of	the Constitution. The power of the Courts is
the direct  and effective protection of the rights sought to
be secured  indirectly	by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1283">Article  21</a>,  and  perhaps	less
indirectly, by	some other  articles and laws. Indeed, it is
the  basic  protection	because	 other	protections  operate
through it and depend on it. If this is curtailed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">317</span>
temporarily,   the   other   affected	protections   become
automatically inoperative  or ineffective  so far  as Courts
are concerned.
</p><p id="p_543">     It is no answer to say that the Constitutional power of
High Courts cannot be affected by a Presidential order under
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1284">Article 359</a>  which is  as much a part of the constitution as
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1285">Article 226.</a>  Both articles were there from the commencement
of the	Constitution. I	 do not see how it can be reasonably
urged that  our Constitution-makers  did not  visualise	 and
intend that  the Presidential  order under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1286">Article 359</a> must,
for the	 duration of  the Emergency,  necessarily limit	 the
powers of High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1287">Article 226</a> albeit indirectly by
suspending rights to enforcement of fundamental rights.
</p><p id="p_544">     It is  also not possible for a detenue to fan back upon
the last  part of  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1288">Article 226</a>	of  the	 Constitution  which
enables the  use of  powers given  by this  Article "for any
other purpose".	 Sq long as that purpose is enforcement of a
right which  is covered	 by Articles  14 or  19 or  21 or 22
either separately  or conjointly, as the enforcement of each
of these  is now  suspended, the  inhibition win  be  there.
Moreover, we  have no  case before us in which a detenu asks
for an	order for  any purpose	other than the one which can
only be served by tho issue of a writ of Habeas Corpus. Each
detenu asks for that relief and for no other kind of writ or
order. Therefore,  there is  no need  to consider 'any other
purpose".
</p><p id="p_545">     It is  true that  some of	the learned  Counsel for the
detenus have  strongly	relied	upon  "any  other  purpose",
occurring at  the end  of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1289">Article 226</a>, for enabling the High
Court to  undertake  an	 investigation	suo  motu  into	 the
question whether  the executive	 is performing	its  duties.
Other Counsel  have submitted that such an enquiry such motu
can be	undertaken by  this Court  or by  a  High  Court  in
exercise of  powers to	issue writs  of Habeas	Corpus quite
apart from  the enforcement  of the right of a detenu to any
writ or	 order. As  I  have  indicated	earlier,  I  am	 not
prepared to  answer purely  hypothetical  questions,  except
within certain	limits, that is to say, only so far as it is
necessary for the purposes of illustrating my point of view.
I do  not think	 that the powers of Courts remain unaffected
by the	suspension of  rights or  locus standi of detenus. A
Court cannot,  in  exercise  of	 any  supposed	inherent  or
implied or  unspecified power,	purport	 to  enforce  or  in
substance enforce  a  right  the  enforcement  of  which  is
suspended. To permit such circumvention of the suspension is
to authorise  doing indirectly what law does not allow to be
done directly.	Assuming, for  purposes	 of  argument,	that
there is  some unspecified  residue of	judicial'  power  in
Courts of  Record in  this country, without deciding what it
could be,  as that  question does  not really arise in cases
before us,  there must be undeniable facts and circumstances
of some very grave, extraordinary, and exceptional character
to justify  the use  of such  powers, if  they exist  at and
either by  this Court  or by the High Courts. So long as the
powers	of   Government	 are   exercised   by	the   chosen
representatives of the people, their exercise is presumed to
be of  the people  and for the people. It has to be borne in
mind that the validity of the declaration of Emergency under
<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1290">Article 352</a>  has neither been nor can it be constitutionally
challenged in view of <a href="/doc/1937609/" id="a_1291">Article 352(5)</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">318</span>
of the	Constitution.  And,  the  validity  of	Presidential
orders of 1975 under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1292">Article 359</a> has not been questioned.
</p><p id="p_546">     So far,  I	 have  only  indicated	the  nature  of	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_547">(A)  "Rights conferred by Part In" from the point of view of
     personal freedom.
</p><p id="p_548">     It is somewhat difficult to reconcile the language of a
purported conferment  of rights	 upon themselves by citizens
of India  with their  political sovereignty. The language of
the preamble to the Constitution recites that it is they who
were establishing  the legally Sovereign Democratic Republic
with the  objects given	 there. Of  course, some  rights are
"conferred" even  on non-citizens,  but that does not remove
the semantic  difficulty which	gave rise  to some  argument
before us. It seems to me that if, as this Court has already
explained earlier  (e.g. by  me	 in  Shrimati  Indira  Nehru
Gandhi's  case	 (supra),  the	 Constitution,	given	unto
themselves by  the people, is legally supreme, it win not be
difficult  to	assign	its   proper  meaning  to  the	term
"conferred". I	do not	find the  theory  unacceptable	that
There was  a notional  surrender by  the people	 of India of
control	 over  their  several  or  individual  rights  to  a
sovereign  Republic   by  means	  of   a   legally   supreme
Constitution to	 which we owe allegiance. It only means that
we recognise that the Constitution is supreme and can confer
rights and  powers. We	have to	 look to  it alone  and	 not
outside it  for finding	 out the  manner in  which  and	 the
limits subject	to which  individual citizens  can  exercise
their separate	freedoms. There	 has to be necessarily, as a
result of  such a process of Constitution making, a notional
surrender  of  individual  freedom  so	as  to	convert	 the
possibility  of	  "licence"  to	  an,  which   ends  in	 the
exploitation and  oppression of	 the many  weak by  the	 few
strong, into  the actuality of a freedom for an regulated by
law or under the law applicable to an. This seems to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">319</span>
me to  be a  satisfactory explanation  of  the	language  of
conferment used with reference to rights.
</p><p id="p_549">     Apart from the explanation given above, of the language
or conferment,	the meaning  of placing	 some rights in Part
III, whatever  be tile	language in  which this was done, is
surely to  select  certain  rights  as	most  essential	 for
ensuring the  fulness of lives of citizens. The whole object
of guaranteed  fundamental rights  is to  make	those  basic
aspects of  human freedom,  embodied in	 fundamental rights,
more secure than others not so selected. In thus recognising
and declaring certain basic aspects of rights as fundamental
by the	Constitution of	 the country,  the  purpose  was  to
protect them  against undue  encroachments upon	 them by the
legislative, or	 executive,  and,  sometimes  even  judicial
(e.g. <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_1295">Article  20</a>) organs  of the  State. The  encroachments
must remain  within permissible	 limits and  must take place
only in	 prescribed modes.  The intention  could never be to
preserve something  concurrently in the field of Natural Law
or Common Law. It was to exclude an other control or to make
the Constitution  the sole  repository of  ultimate  control
over those  aspects of	human freedom  which were guaranteed
there.
</p><p id="p_550">     I have already referred to Dicey's attempt to show that
one of	the meanings  of the Rule of Law in England was that
the law	 made by  the ordinary Courts served purposes sought
to be  achieved in  other  countries  by  means	 of  written
Constitutions. This  meant  that  one  of  the	two  systems
governs the  whole field  of fundamental rights but not both
This very  idea is  thus put  by Keir  &amp; Lawson in "Cases in
Constitutional Law (5th Edn. p. 11) :"
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_126">	  "The judges  seem to	have in their minds an ideal
     constitution, comprising  those  fundamental  rules  of
     common law which seem essential to the liberties of the
     subject and the proper government of the country. These
     rules cannot  be repealed but by direct and unequivocal
     enactment. In the absence of express words or necessary
     intendment, statutes  win be  applied subject  to them.
     They do  not override  the statute, but are treated, as
     it were,  as implied  terms of the statute. Here may be
     found many of those fundamental rights of man which are
     directly and  absolutely safeguarded  in  the  American
     Constitution  or  the  Declaration	 des  droits  de  1'
     homme".</blockquote>
<p id="p_551">     In the  passage quoted above, Rules of Natural Justice,
which are  impliedly read  into statutes  from the nature of
functions imposed  upon statutory authorities or bodies, are
placed on  the same  footing as	 "fundamental rights  of men
which are  directly and	 absolutely safeguarded"  by written
Constitutions. There  is,  however,  a	distinction  between
these two  types of  basic  rights.  The  implied  rules  of
natural justice	 do not,  as has been repeatedly pointed out
by us,	over-ride the  express terms  of a statute. They are
only implied because the functions which the statute imposes
are presumed to be meant to the exercised in accordance with
these rules.  Hence, they  are treated	as though  they were
parts of enacted law. This Court has repeatedly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">320</span>
applied this  principle (see:  e.g. <a href="/doc/1455346/" id="a_1296">State  of Orissa  v. Dr.
(Miss) Binapani Dei &amp; Ors</a>)(1)
     The principles  of natural justice which are so implied
must always hang, if one may so put it, on pegs of statutory
provisions or  necessarily follows  from them. They can also
be said	 sometimes to  be implied  as necessary parts of the
protection  of	 equality  and	 equal	protection  of	laws
conferred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1297">Article 14</a> of the Constitution where one of the
pillars of Dicey's principles of the Rule of Law is found em
bodied.	 Sometimes,  they  may	be  implied  and  read	into
legislation dealing  with rights  protected by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1298">Article 19</a> of
the Constitution.  They	 could,	 at  times,  be	 so  implied
because restrictions  on rights	 conferred by  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1299">Article 19</a> of
the Constitution have to be reasonable. Statutory provisions
creating certain  types of  functions  may  become  unreason
able, and,  therefore, void  unless rules of natural justice
were impliedly annexed to them. And, the wen known method of
construction is:  ut res magis valeat guam pereat"-to prefer
the construction  which upholds	 rather than  the one  which
invalidates. Thus,  rules of natural justice, even when they
are read  into statutory  provisions,  have  no	 independent
existence.  They   are	annexed	  to  statutory	  duties  or
fundamental  rights  so	 long  as  they	 are  not  expressly
excluded. Their	 express exclusion  by statute may, when the
enforcement of	fundamental rights.  It	 is  not  suspended,
affect the validity of a statute. But, that is so because of
the requirements  of Articles  14 and 19 of the Constitution
and  not   because  they   are	outside	  the	Constitution
altogether.
</p><p id="p_552">     It is  also very difficult for me to understand what is
meant by  such "Common	Law" rights  as could  co-exist	 and
compete with  constitutional provisions	 or take their place
when the  constitutional provisions  become unenforceable or
temporarily inoperative.  The whole  concept of such alleged
Common Law  is based  on  an  utter  misconception  of	what
"Common Law"  means. The  origin of Common Law in England is
to be  found in	 the work  done by  the King's	Judges, who,
through their judicial pronouncements, gave to the people of
that country  a law common to the whole country in the place
of the	peculiar or  conflicting local customs. Let me quote
here from  a recent  book  by  Prof.  George  W.  Keeton  on
"English Law-The Judicial Contribution" (at p. 68-69), about
what Judges appointed by Henry the II of Anjou did:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_127">	  "It is in his reign that something recognisable as
     a Common  Law begins  to emerge.  It is  an amalgam  of
     Anglo  Saxon   and	 Danish	  customs  and	Norman	laws
     governing military	 tenures, both of which are about to
     be transformed  by several	 mighty	 agencies-the  ever-
     expanding body  of original  writs, of  which Glanville
     wrote; the	 assizes which Henry introduced and finally,
     by	 the   activities  of	his  judges,  whether  3  at
     Westminster or  on	 Circuit.  It  is  significant	that
     although for some centuries to come, English law was to
     remain remarkably	rich in	 local customs, we no longer
     hear, after  t Henry's  reign, of	the laws  of Mercia,
     Wessex and Northumbria, but of a Common Law of England-
     that is to say,
     (1)[1967] 2 S. C. R. 625.

     the calibre  of Bracton  and  Fleta  would	 be  written
     almost exactly  a century	later, and as the concluding

     they and  their judicial  colleagues were building, not
     for England  alone but 'for king less common-wealths on
     the other	shore of the Atlantic ocean and now, one can
     perhaps add, for many other commonwealths, too. This we
     owe ultimately,  not to a Norman Conqueror, nor even to
     a distinguished  line of  Saxon kings,  but to  a	bow-
     legged and unprepossessing prince of Anjou, of restless
     energy  and  great	 constancy  of	purpose	 who  built,
     perhaps, a good deal better than even he knew".</blockquote>
<p id="p_553">     Such were	the origins of the Common Law in England. It
is true	 that Common  Law did  try to dig its tentacles into
Constitutional Law  as well.  Chief Justice  Coke  not	only
denied to King James the 1st the power to administer justice
directly and  personally, but he went so far as to claim for
the King's Courts the power to proclaim an Act of Parliament
invalid, in  Dr. Bonham's  case, if  it sought	to violate a
principle of  natural law.  Such claims,  however, were soon
abandoned by Common Law Courts.
</p><p id="p_554">     It is  interesting to recall that, after his dismissal,
by King	 James the  1st, in  1616, Sir	Edward Coke  entered
politics and  became a	Member of  the House  of Commons  in
Liskeard. He led a group which resisted Royal claims. He was
the principal  advocate of  the	 Petition  of  Rights  which
Parliament compelled  a reluctant  King of England to accept
in 1628.  Courts  of  justice,	unable	to  withstand  Royal
onslaughts on  their authority, joined hands with Parliament
and laid  down some  of the rules which, according to Dicey,
gave the  Rule of  Law	to  England.  Thus,  the  judge-made
fundamental rights,  which Parliament would not disturb, out
of innate  respect  for	 them,	existed,  legally  speaking,
because Parliament,  representing the  people, wanted  them.
They could  not compete with or obstruct the legal authority
of Parliament. Coke's doctrine, however, found expression in
a constitution	which enabled judges to test the validity of
even legislation  P' with  reference to	 fundamental rights.
This is	 also one of the primary functions of Chapter III of
our own Constitution. Another function of provisions of this
chapter is  to test  the validity  of the  State's executive
action.
</p><p id="p_555">     So far  as <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1300">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is concerned,
it is  abundantly clear	 that  it  protects  the  lives	 and
liberties of  citizens primarily  from	legally	 unwarranted
executive  action.   It	  secures   rights   to	  'procedure
established by	law'. If that procedure is to be established
by statute  law, as  it is  meant  to  be,  this  particular
protection could  not, on  the face  of it,  be intended  to
operate as  a restriction upon legislative power to lay down
procedure although  other articles  affecting legislation on
personal freedom  might. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1301">Article  21</a> was  only meant, on the
face of	 it, to	 keep the  exercise of	executive powers  in
ordering deprevations  of life or liberty, within the bounds
of power prescribed by procedure established by legislation.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_141">322</span>
The meaning of the expression "procedure established by law"
came in	 for discussion	 at  considerable  length,  by	this
Court, in  A. K. Gopalan's case (supra). The majority of the
learned James  clearly held  there  that  it  furnishes	 the
guarantee of  "Lex", which is equated with statute law only,
and not	 of "Jus"  or a	 judicial concept of what procedural
law ought  really to  be. The  whole  idea,  is	 using	this
expression,   taken    deliberately   from    the   Japanese
Constitution of	 the advice,  amongst others, of Mr. Justice
Felix Frankfurter  of the  American  Supreme  Court  was  to
exclude	 judicial  interference	 with  executive  action  in
dealing with  lives and	 liberties of  citizens	 and  others
living in  our country	on any	ground other than that it is
contrary to  procedure actually	 prescribed by	law,  which,
according to the majority view in Gopalan's case, meant only
statute law.  The majority  view was  based on	the  reason,
amongst others,	 that, according  to well established canons
of  statutory  construction,  the  express  terms  of  "Lex"
(assuming, of  course, that  The "Lex"	is otherwise valid),
prescribing  procedure,	  will	exclude	 "Jus"	or  judicial
notions or "due process" or what the procedure ought to be.
</p><p id="p_557">     Appeals to	 concepts of  "Jus" or a just procedure were
made in Gopalan's case (supra), as implied by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1302">Article 21</a>, in
an attempted  application of  "Jus" for testing the validity
of  statutory  provisions.  Although  no  such	question  of
validity of the procedure established by the Act in ordering
actual deprivations  of personal  liberty has  arisen before
us, yet,  the argument before us is that we should allow use
of notions  of "Jus"  and the doctrine of ultra vires by the
various	 High	Courts	in   judging  the   correctness	  of
applications  of  the  established  procedure  by  executive
authorities to	each case  at a	 time when  the Presidential
order of  27th June  1975 precludes the use of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1303">Article 21</a> by
Courts for enforcing a right to personal liberty. Therefore,
the question which arises here is whether "Jus" held by this
Court. in Gopalan's case, to have been deliberately excluded
from the  purview of  procedure established  by law", can be
introduced by  Courts, through a back door, as though it was
an independent	right guaranteed  by Chapter  III or  by any
other Part  of the Constitution. I am quite unable to accede
to the suggestion that this could be done.
</p><p id="p_558">     We have been referred to the following passage in R. C.
Cooper v,  Union of  India(1) to substantiate the submission
that the  decision of  this Court in Gopalan's case (supra),
on the question mentioned above, no longer holds the field:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_129">	  "We  have   found  it	 necessary  to	examine	 the
     rationale of  the two  lines of authority and determine

     the law.  In  our	judgment,  the	assumption  in	A.K.
     Gopalan's	 case	that   certain	 articles   in	 the
     Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and
     in determining  where  there  is  infringement  of	 the
     individual's guaranteed rights, the object and the form
     of the  State action  alone  need	be  considered,	 and
     effect  of	 the  laws  on	fundamental  rights  of	 the
     individuals  in  general  will  be	 ignored  cannot  be

     validity  'of  law'  which	 authorises  deprivation  of
     property  and   'a	 law'  which  authorises  compulsory
     acquisition of  property for  a public  purpose must be
     adjudged by  the  application  of	the  same  tests.  A
     citizen may  claim in  an appropriate case that the law
     authorising compulsory  acquisition of property imposes
     fetters upon  his right  to hold property which are not
     reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general
     public".</blockquote>
<p id="p_559">     It seems  to me  that Gopalan's case (supra) was merely
cited, in  Cooper's case (supra), for illustrating a line of
reasoning which	 was held to be incorrect in determining the
validity of  "law" for	the acquisition	 of property  solely
with reference to the provisions of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_1304">Article 31.</a> The question
under  consideration  in  that	case  was  whether  Articles
19(1)(f) and  31(2) are	 mutually exclusive. Even if, on the
strength of  what was held in Cooper's case (supra), we hold
that the  effects of deprivation upon rights outside <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1305">Article
21</a> have	 also to be considered in deciding upon the validity
of "Lex",  and that  the line of reasoning in Gopalan's case
(supra), that  the validity  of a law relating to preventive
detention must	be  judged  solely  with  reference  to	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1306">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, is incorrect?
in view	 of the opinion of the majority of learned Judges of
this Court hl Cooper's case (supra), it seem to me that this
is hardly  relevant in	considering whether any claims based
on natural  law or  common law	can be enforced. There is no
challenge before us based on <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1307">Article 19</a>, to any provision of
the Act. Moreover, now that the enforcement of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1308">Article 19</a> is
also suspended,	 the question  whether a  law  dealing	with
preventive detention  may directly  or	indirectly  infringe
other rights  contained in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1309">Article 19</a> of the Constitution is
not relevant at all here for this additional reason.
</p><p id="p_560">     Mr. Shanti	 Bhushan, appearing  for some of the detenu,

of Kerala</a>.(1)  when he	submitted that, as the majority view
there was not that natural rights do not exist, these rights
could be  enforced in  place  of  the  suspended  guaranteed
fundamental rights.  One learned Judge after another in that
case emphatically rejected the submission that any theory of
natural	  rights    could   impliedly	 limit	 powers	  of
Constitutional amendment  contained in	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1311">Article 368</a>  of	 the

<p id="p_566">when plain  demands of justice failed to be met or caught in
the meshes of Common Law, or, were actually defeated by some
statute law which was being misused. The two streams, one of
Common Law  and an  other of Equity, were "mixed" or "fused"
by statute  as a result of the Judicature Acts in England at
the end	 of the	 last century  in the sense that they became
parts of  one body  of law  administered by the same Courts,
although they  are still  classified separately due to their
separate origins.  In Stroud's	Judicial Dictionary, we find
(See: Vol.  I, 4th  Edn. p. 517): "The common law of England
is that	 body of  law which has been judicially evolved from
the general custom of the realm".
</p><p id="p_567">     Here, all	that I	wish to	 indicate  is  that  neither
rights supposed	 to be	recognised by  some natural  law nor
those assumed  to exist	 in some  part of  Common Law  could
serve as  substitutes for those conferred by Part III of the
Constitution. They  could not be, on any principle of law or
justice or  reason, virtually  added to part III as complete
replacements for  rights whose enforcement is suspended, and
then  be   enforced,   through	 constitutionally   provided
machinery, as  the unseen  appendages of the Constitution or
as a separate group of rights outside the Constitution meant
for the Emergency which suspends but does not resuscitate in
a new form certain rights.
</p><p id="p_568">     A submission  of Dr. Ghatate, appearing for Mr. Advani,
was that we should keep in mind the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights  in interpreting the Constitution. He relied on
Article Sl  of the  Constitution, the relevance of which for
the cases  before us  is not  at all  evident to me. He also
relied on  the principle  recognised by	 British Courts that
International Law is part of the law of the land. Similarly,
it was urged, it is part of our law too by reason of <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1313">Article
372</a> of	the Constitution.  He seemed to imply that we should
read the  universal declaration	 of human  rights  into	 our
Constitution as	 India was  one of  the signatories  to	 it.
These submissions  appear to  me to  amount to	nothing more
than appeals  to weave	certain ethical rules and principles
into the  fabric of  our Constitution which is the paramount
law of	this country and provides the final test of validity
and enforceability  of rules  and rights  through Courts. To
advance such  arguments is  to forget  that our Constitution
itself embodies	 those rules and rights. It also governs the
conditions of  their operation and suspension. Nothing which
conflicts with	the provisions	of the Constitution could be
enforced here under any disguise.

     liberty.	And  the  first	 and  essential	 step  in  a

     as	 it   says  that  they	cannot	be  deprived  except
     according to the procedure established by law; in other
     words, it means that before a person can be deprived of
     his life  or liberty  as a	 condition  precedent  there
     should exist  some substantive law conferring authority
     for doing	so and	the law should further provide for a

     also  been	  protected  by	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1327">article  21  ?</a>	 The  answer
     suggested by learned counsel for the petitioner is that
     personal liberty as a substantive right is protected by

     which that	 right may  be taken  away. I  am unable  to
     accept this  contention. If this argument were correct,
     then it  would follow  that our  Constitution does	 not
     guarantee to  any person,	citizen or  non-citizen, the
     freedom of	 his life as a substantive right at all, for
     the substantive  right to life does not fall within any

     substantive fundamental  right to	which protection  is
     given and	does not purport to prescribe any particular
     procedure at  all. That  a person shall not be deprived
     of his  life or  personal liberty	except according  to
     procedure	established   by  law	is  the	 substantive
     fundamental right	to which  protection is given by the
     Constitution. The	avowed object  of the  article, as I
     apprehend it,  is to  define the  ambit of the right to
     life and personal liberty which is to be protected as a
     fundamental right.	 The  right  to	 life  and  personal
     Liberty protected	by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1332">article  21</a> is  not	an  absolute

<p id="p_578">     In Kharak	Singh v.  the State of U.P. &amp; Ors(1) he wide
import of  personal liberty,  guaranteed by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1334">Article 21</a>, was
considered. By	a majority  of 4 against 2 learned Judges of
this Court, it was held that the term "personal liberty", as
used in	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1335">Article 21</a>,  is a  compendious one and includes all
varieties of  rights to	 exercise of personal freedom, other
than those  dealt with	separately by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1336">Article 19</a> which could
fall under a broad concept of freedom of person. It was held
to include freedom from surveillance, from physical torture,
and from  all kinds  of harassment  of the  person which may
interfere with his liberty.
</p><p id="p_579">     Thus, even	 if <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1337">Article 21</a> is not the sole repository of
all personal  freedom, it  will be  clear, from a reading of
Gopalan's case (supra) and
     (1) [1964] 1 S. C. R. 332.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">329</span>
<p id="p_580">Kharak Singh's	case (Supra), that all aspects of freedom of
person are  meant to be covered by Articles 19 and 21 and 22
of the	Constitution. If  the enforcement of these rights by
Courts is  suspended during  the Emergency  an inquiry	by a
Court into  the question  whether any of them is violated by
an illegal deprivation of it by executive authorities of the
State seems futile.
</p><p id="p_581">     For the reasons indicated above I hold as follows:-
     Firstly, fundamental rights are basic aspects of rights
selected from  what may	 previously  have  been	 natural  or
common	law  rights.  These  basic  aspects  of	 rights	 are
elevated to  a new  level of importance by the Constitution.
Any other co-extensive rights, outside the Constitution, are
necessarily excluded  by their recognition as or merger with
fundamental rights.
</p><p id="p_582">     Secondly, the  object of making certain general aspects
of rights  fundamental is  to guarantee them against illegal
invasions of  these rights  by	executive,  legislative,  or
judicial organs	 of the	 State. This  necessarily means that
these  safeguards   can	 also	be  legally   removed  under
appropriate constitutional or statutory provisions. although
their  Suspension   does  not,	or  itself,  take  away	 the
illegalities or their legal consequences.
</p><p id="p_583">     Thirdly, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1338">Article  21</a> of  the  Constitution	 has  to  be
interpreted comprehensively enough to include, together with
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1339">Article 19</a>,  practically all aspects of personal freedom. It
embraces both  procedural and substantive rights. <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1340">Article 22</a>
merely makes  it clear that deprivations of liberty by means
of laws regulating preventive detention would be included in
"procedure established	by  law"  and  indicates  what	that
procedure should  be. In  that sense, it could be viewed as,
substantially, an  elaboration of  what is  found in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1341">Article
21</a>, although  it also  goes beyond it inasmuch as it imposes
limits on ordinary legislative power.
</p><p id="p_584">     Fourthly,	taken	by  itself,   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1342">Article  21</a>   of	 the
Constitution  is  primarily  a	protection  against  illegal
deprivations by	 the executive	action of the State's agents
or officials,  although, read  with other Articles, it could
operate	 also	as  a	protection   against   unjustifiable
legislative action  purporting to  authorise deprivations of
personal freedom.
</p><p id="p_585">     Fifthlty, the  most important  object or making certain
basic rights  fundamental by  the 'Constitution	 is to	make
them enforceable  against the State and its agencies through
the Courts.
</p><p id="p_586">     Sixthly, if the protection of enforceability is validly
suspended for  the duration  of an Emergency, declared under
constitutional	provisions  the	 Courts	 will  have  nothing
before them to enforce so as to be able to afford any relief
to a person who comes with a grievance before them.

powers of High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1343">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
     Reliance has  been placed	on behalf  of the detenus on
the following  statement of the law found in Halsbury's Laws
of England  (Vol. 11,  p. 27,  paragraph 15),  where dealing
with the  jurisdiction to  issue such writs in England it is
said:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">330</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_140">	  "The right  to the writ is a right which exists at
     common law	 independently of  any statute,	 though	 the
     right has	been confirmed	and regulated by statute. At
     common law	 the jurisdiction  to  award  the  writ	 was
     exercised by  the Court  of Queen's Bench, chancery and
     Common Pleas, and, in a case of privilege, by the Court
     of Exchequer".
</blockquote><p id="p_588">It is,	therefore, submitted that the High Courts as well as
this Court  which have	the same jurisdiction to issue writs
of Habeas  Corpus as English Courts have to issue such writs
at common law
     The argument  seems  to  me  to  be  based	 on  several
misconceptions
     Firstly, there  are no Courts of the King or Queen here
to  issue   writs  of	Habeas	Corpus	 by  reason  of	 any
"prerogative" of the British Monarch. The nature of the writ
of Habeas  Corpus is  given in the same volume of Halsbury's
Laws of	 England, dealing with Crown proceedings at page 24,
as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_141">	  "40. The  prerogative writ  of habeas	 corpus. The
     writ  of  habeas  corpus  and  subjiciendum,  which  is
     commonly known  as the  writ of  habeas  corpus,  is  a
     prerogative process  for securing	the liberty  of" the
     subject by	 affording an  effective means	of immediate
     release  from   unlawful  or  unjustifiable  detention,
     whether in	 prison or  in	private	 custody.  It  is  a
     prerogative writ  by which	 the Queen  has a  right  to
     inquire into  the causes  for which any of her subjects
     are deprived of their liberty. By it the High Court and
     the judges of that Court, at the in stance of a subject
     aggrieved, command	 the production of that subject, and
     inquire into the cause of his imprisonment. If there is
     no legal  justification for the detention, the party is
     ordered to	 be released.  Release on  habeas corpus  is
     not, however, an acquittal? nor may the writ be used as
     a means of appeal".</blockquote>
<p id="p_589">     It will  be seen  that the	 Common Law power of issuing
the writ  of Habeas  Corpus is	possessed  by  only  certain
courts which  could issue "prerogative" writs. It is only to
indicate the  origin and nature of the writ that the writ of
habeas corpus  is known	 here as  a "prerogative"  writ. The
power to  issue it  is of the same nature as a "prerogative"
power inasmuch	as the power so long as it is not suspended,
may carry  with it  an undefined  residue  of  discretionary
power. Strictly	 speaking. it  is a constitutional writ. The
power to  issue it  is conferred upon Courts in this country
exclusively by	our Constitution.  All	the  powers  of	 our
Courts flow  from the  Constitution which  is the  source of
their jurisdiction.  If any  provision of  the	Constitution
authorises the	suspension of  the right to obtain relief in
any type  of cases, the power of Courts is thereby curtailed
even though  a general	jurisdiction to afford the relief in
other cases  may be  there. If	they cannot  issue writs  of
Habeas Cor  pus to  enforce  a	light  to  personal  freedom
against executive  authorities	during	the  Emergency,	 the
original nature	 of this  writ issuing power comparable to a
"prerogative" power, cannot help the detenu.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">331</span>
<p id="p_590">     Secondly, as  I have  already indicated, whatever could
be formerly  even said	to  be	governed  by  a	 Common	 Law
prerogative power becomes merged in the Constitution as soon
as  the	 Constitution  makes  it  over	and  regulates	that
subject. This  is a well recognised principle or law. I will
only  cite  Attorney-General  v.  De  Keyser's	Royal  Hotel
Limited(1). Where  Lord Dunedin, in answer to a claim of the
Crown based on prerogative, said (at p. 526):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_142">	  None the  less, it  is equally certain that if the
     whole ground  of something	 which could  be done by the
     prerogative is  covered  by  the  statute,	 it  is	 the
     statute  that   rules.  On	  this	point  I  think	 the
     observation  of   the  learned   Master  of  the  Rolls
     unanswerable. He  says: "What  use could  there  be  in
     imposing  limitations,   if  the  Crown  could  at	 its
     pleasure disregard	 them and fall back on prerogative ?
     ".</blockquote>
<p id="p_591">     Thirdly,  if  there  is  no  enforceable  right  either
arising under  the Constitution	 or otherwise, it is useless
to appeal  to any general power of the Court to issue a writ
of Habeas  Corpus. The	jurisdiction to	 issue an  order  of
release, on  a Habeas  Corpus petition,	 is only exercisable
after due enquiry into the cause of detention. If the effect
of the	suspension of the right to move the Court for a writ
of Habeas  Corpus is  that no enquiry can take place, beyond
finding	 out   that  the   cause  is   one  covered  by	 the
prohibition, mere  possession of some general power will not
assist the detenu.
</p><p id="p_592">     If the right to enforce personal freedom through a writ
of habeas  corps suspended,  it	 cannot	 be  said  that	 the
enforcement can	 be restored  by  resorting  to	 "any  other
purpose". That other purpose could not embrace defeating the
effect of  suspension of the enforcement of a Constitutional
guarantee. To  hold that  would be  to make a mockery of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_593">     Therefore, I  am unable  to hold  that anything  of the
natural of  a writ  of habeas  corpus or any power of a High
Court under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1344">Article 226</a>  could come  to the aid of a detenu
when the  right to  enforce a  claim  to  personal  freedom,
sought to be protected by the Constitution, is suspended.

v. The	State of  West Bengal &amp; ors</a>.(2) preventive detention
is   to	  be   differentiated	from   punitive	  detention.
Nevertheless, it is evident, whether detention is preventive
or punitive,  it necessarily  results in  the imposition  of
constraints. which,  from the  point of	 view justice to the
detenu should  not be inflicted or continue without fair and
adequate and careful scrutiny into its necessity. This Court
pointed	 out  that,  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1346">Article  22</a>  of  the  Constitution	 was
designed to  guarantee these  requirements of  fairness	 and
justice which are satisfied by the provisions of the Act. It

	  "Constitution has  conferred rights  under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1347">Article
     19</a> and also adopted preventive detention to prevent the
     greater evil  of elements imperilling the security, the
     safety of	a State and the welfare of the Nation. It is
     not possible  to think  that a  person who	 is detained
     will  yet	 be  free   to	move  or  assemble  or	form
     association or union or have the right to reside in any
     part  of  India  or  have	the  freedom  of  speech  or
     expression
     Provision for  preventive detention,  in itself,  is  a
departure from	ordinary norms.	 It is generally resorted to
either in  times of war or of apprehended internal disorders
and disturbances  of a	serious nature.	 Its  object  is  to
prevent a  greater danger to national security and integrity
than any  claim which  could be based upon a right, moral or
legal, to individual liberty. It has been aptly described as
a "jurisdiction of suspicion." See: <a href="/doc/679149/" id="a_1348">Khudiram Das v. State of
West Bengal</a>.,  (1) <a href="/doc/554839/" id="a_1349">State  of Madras  v. V. G. Row</a>; (2) R. v.
Halliday (3). It enables executive authorities to proceed on
bare suspicion	which has  to give rise to a "satisfaction",
as the	condition precedent  to passing	 a  valid  detention
order, laid down as follows in <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1350">Section 3</a> of the Act:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_143">	  "3 (1) (a) if satisfied with respect to any person

<p id="p_598">     The satisfactions	as held consistently by a whole line
of authorities	of this	 Court, is  a "subjective"  one.  In
other words,  it is  not  possible  to	prescribe  objective
standards  for	reaching  that	satisfaction.  Although	 the
position in  law, as  declared repeatedly by this Court, has
been very clear and categorical that the satisfaction has to
be the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authorities,
yet, the  requirements for sup ply of grounds to the detenus
as provided  in <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_1351">Section	 8</a> of  the Act,	 in actual practice,
opened up  a means  of applying	 a kind of objective test by

<p id="p_601">subjective satisfaction	 of  Court  on	the  objective	data
provided by  the   grounds, as	to the	need to	 detain	 for
purposes of  the Act.  The`question  thus  arose:  Did	this
practice not frustrate the purposes of the Act ?
</p><p id="p_602">     The position  of the  detenu has  generally evoked	 the
sympathy of lawyers and law Courts. They cherish a tradition
as zealous  protectors of personal liberty. They are engaged
in pointing  out, day in and day out, the essentials of fair
trial. They  are used  to acting  strictly on  the rules  of
evidence  contained   in  the	<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1352">Indian	Evidence   Act</a>.	 The
possibility of	indefinite incarceration,  without  anything
like a trial, not unnaturally, seems abhorrent to those with
such traditions and habits of thought and action.
</p><p id="p_603">     There is an aspect which perhaps tends to be overlooked
in  considering	 matters  which	 are  generally	 placed	 for
weighment on  the golden  scales of  the sensitive  judicial
balance. It  is that we are living in a world of such strain
and stress, satirised in a recent fictional depiction of the
coming future, if not of a present already enveloping us. in
Mr. Alva  Toffler's "Future  Shock", with such fast changing
conditions of life dominated by technological revolutions as
well as	 recurring economic,  social, and  political crises,
with resulting	obliterations of  traditional  values,	that
masses of  people suffer from psychological disturbances due
to inability  to adjust	 themselves  to	 these	changes	 and
crises. An example of such maladjustment is provided by what
happened to  a very  great and	gifted nation  within having
memory. The great destruction, the inhuman butchery, and the
acute suffering	 and misery  which many very civilised parts
of  the	  world	 had   to   pass   through,   because	some
psychologically disturbed  people led  by Adolf Hitler, were
not prevented  in time	from misleading	 and misguiding	 the
German nation, is still fresh in our minds. Indeed the whole
world suffered,	 and  felt  the	 effects  of  the  unchecked
aberrant Nazi movement in Germany and the havoc it unleashed
when it	 acquired a  hold over the minds and feelings of the
German people  with all the vast powers of modern science at
their disposal.	 With such  recent examples  before them, it
was not	 surprising that  our constitution makers, quite far
sightedly, provided not only for preventive detention in our
Constitution but  also introduced  Emergency provisions of a
drastic	 nature	  in  it.   These  seem	 to  be	 inescapable
concomitants of	 conditions necessary to ensure for the mass
of the	people	of  a  backward	 country,  a  life  of	that
decipline without  which the  country's security, integrity,
independence, and  pace of  progress towards  the objectives
set before us by the Constitution will not be safe.
</p><p id="p_604">     I do  not know whether it was a too liberal application
of the	principle that	courts must  lean in  favour of	 the
liberty of  the citizen, which is, strictly speaking, only a
principle  of	interpretation	for   cases  of	  doubt	  or
difficulty, or,	 the carelessness with which detentions were
ordered by  Subordinate officers  in the  Districts, or	 the
inefficiency in	 drafting of the grounds of detention, which
were not  infrequently found  to be vague and defective, the
result of  the practice developed by Courts was that detenus
did, in quite a number of cases, obtain
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">334</span>
from High  Courts, and, perhaps even from this Court, orders
of release  on Habeas  Corpus petitions	 on grounds on which

Kamrup :&amp;  Ors. (1)  . I ventured, with great respect, in my
miniority opinion,  to suggest	that the  objects of the Act
may be	frustrated  if	Courts	interfere  even	 before	 the
machinery of  redress under the Act through Advisory Boards,
where questions relating to vagueness or irrelevance or even
sufficiency of	grounds could  be more	effectively thrashed
out than in Courts in proceedings under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1353">Article 32</a> or 226 of
the Constitution,  had been  allowed to	 complete  its	full
course of  operation. In some cases, facts were investigated
on exchange  of	 affidavits  only  so  as  to  arrive  at  a
conclusion that	 some of  facts upon  which detention orders
were passed  did not  exist at	all. In	 other cases, it was
held that  even if  a single  non-existent or  vague  ground
crept into  The grounds	 for detention,	 the detention order
itself was  vitiated as	 it indicated  either the effects of
extraneous matter or carelessness or non-application of mind
in making the order. Courts could not separate what has been
improperly considered  from what  was  properly	 taken	into
account. Hence	detentions were	 held to be vitiated by such
detects. In some cases, the fact that some matter ton remote
in  time   from	 the   detention  order	  was	taken	into
consideration, in  ordering the	 detention, was	 held to  be
enough to  invalidate the  detention. Thus, grounds supplied
always operated	 as an	objective test	for determining	 the
question whether  a nexus could reasonably exist between the
grounds given  and  the	 detention  order  or  whether	some
infirmities  had   crept  in.	The  reasonableness  of	 the
detention became  the justiciable issue really decided. With
great respect,	I doubt whether this could be said to be the
object of  preventive detention provisions authorised by the
Constitution and  embodied in  the Act.	 In any case, it was
the satisfaction of the Court by an application of a kind of
objective  test	 more  stringently  than  the  principle  of
criminal procedure, that a defective charge could be amended
and would  not vitiate	a trial	 without proof	of incurable
prejudice to  the accused,  which became,  for all practical
purposes, the test of the correctness of detention orders.

provisions whose validity is challenged before us.
</p><p id="p_610">     It appears to me that the object of the above mentioned
amendments was to affect the manner in which jurisdiction of
Courts in  considering claims  for  reliefs  by	 detenus  on
petitions for  writs of Habeas Corpus was being exercised so
that the  only available  means that  had been developed for
such cases  by the  Courts, that  is to say, the scrutiny of
grounds supplied under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_1360">section 8</a> of the Act" may be re moved
from the judicial armoury for the duration of the Emergency.
It may	be mentioned  here that	 <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_1361">Art. 22(5)</a> and <a href="/doc/1782826/" id="a_1362">22(6)</a> of the
Constitution provided as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_153">	  "22(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of
     the order	made under  any law providing for preventive
     detention, the  authority making  the order  shall,  as
     soon as  may he, communicate to such person the grounds
     on which  the order  has been made and shall afford him
     the earliest  opportunity of  making  a  representation
     against the order.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_154">	  22(6) Nothing	 in clause  (5)	 shall	require	 the
     authority making  any such	 order as  is referred to in
     that clause  to disclose  facts  which  such  authority
     considers	to   be	 against   the	public	interest  to
     disclose".</blockquote>
<p id="p_611">     The first	contention, that  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1363">Section 16A(9)</a> affects the
jurisdiction of	 High Courts  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1364">Article  226</a>,  which  an
order under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1365">Article 359(1)</a>  could not do, appears to me to,
be untenable.  I am  unable to	see how a Presidential order
which prevents	a claim for the enforcement of a fundamental
right from being advanced in a Court during the existence of
an Emergency,  could possibly  be said not to be intended to
affect the exercise of jurisdiction of Courts at all.
</p><p id="p_612">     The second	 argument, that	 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1366">Section 16A(9)</a> amounts to a
general	 legislative   declaration  in	 place	of  judicial
decisions  which   Courts  had	 themselves  to	 give  after
considering" on	 the facts  of each  case,  whether  <a href="/doc/1782826/" id="a_1367">Article
22(6)</a> could  be applied,  also does  not seem  to me  to be.
acceptable. The result of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1368">Section 16A(9)</a>, if valid, would be
to leave  the presumption  of correctness  of an order under
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1369">Section 3</a>  of the  Act, good on the face of it, untouched by
any investigation relating
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_156">337</span>
to its correctness. Now, if this be the object and effect of
the amendment,	it could  not be said to go beyond making it
impossible for	detenus to  rebut a presumptions of legality
and validity  which an	order under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1370">Section 3</a> of the Act, if
prima facie  good, would raise in any event. The same result
could have  been achieved by enacting that a detention order
under  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1371">section	 3</a>,  prima   facie  good,  will	 operate  as
"conclusive proof"  that the  requirements of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1372">Section 3</a> have
been fulfilled.	 But,  as  the	giving	of  grounds  is	 not
entirely dispensed  with under the Act even as it now exists
this may  have left  the question  in doubt  whether  Courts
could call  upon the  detaining authorities  to produce	 the
grounds. Enactment  of a  rule of conclusive proof is a well
established  form   of	enactments  determining	 substantive
rights in the form of procedural provisions.
</p><p id="p_613">     In any case, so far as the rights of a detenu to obtain
relief	are   hampered,	 the  question	raised	touches	 the
enforcement of	the fundamental	 right to  personal freedom.
Its effect  upon the  powers of	 the Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1373">Article 226</a>
is, as	I have already indicated, covered by the language of
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1374">Article 359(1)</a>	of the Constitution. It is not necessary for
me to consider the validity of such a provision if it was to
be applied  at a  time not  covered  by	 the  Emergency,  or
whether it  should be  read down  for the purposes of a suit
for damages  where the	issue is  whether the  detention was
ordered by  a particular officer out of "malice in fact" and
for reasons  completely	 outside  the  purview	of  the	 Act
itself. That  sort  of	inquiry	 is  not  open,	 during	 the
Emergency, in proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1375">Article 226.</a>
</p><p id="p_614">     On the  view I  take, for	reasons which  will be still
clearer after  a consideration	of the	remaining  questions
discussed below.,  I think  that even  the  issue  that	 the
detention order	 is vitiated by "malice in fact" will not be
justiciable  in	  Habeas  Corpus   proceedings	during	 the
Emergency although  it may  be in  an ordinary suit which is
not filed  for enforcing  a fundamental	 right but for other
reliefs. The  question of  bona fides  seems to be left open
for decision  by such suits on the language of <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_1376">Section 16</a> of
the Act itself which says:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_155">	  "16. No  suit or other legal proceedings shall lie
     against the  Central Government  or a State Government,
     and no  suit, prosecution	or other  legal	 proceedings
     shall lie	against any  person, for  anything  in	good
     faith done	 or intended to be done in pursuance of this
     Act.</blockquote>
<p id="p_615">     <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_1377">Section 16</a>	 of the	 Act seems to leave open a remedy by
way of	suit for  damages for  wrongful	 imprisonment  in  a
possible case of what may be called "malice in fact". In the
cases before  us, we  are only	concerned with Habeas Corpus
proceedings under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1378">Article 226</a>	of the Constitution where in
my opinion,  malice in	fact could not be investigated as it
is bound  to be	 an allegation subsidiary to a claim for the
enforcement of	a right	 to personal  liberty, a fundamental
right which cannot be enforced during the Emergency.

	  "The order  of the  President	 dated	November  3,
     1962, already  set out, in terms, suspends the right of
     any person to move any Court for the enforcement of the
     rights  conferred	 by  Arts.   21	 and   22   of	 the
     Constitution, during  the	period	of  Emergency  Prima
     facie, therefore,	the petitioner's  right to move this
     Court for	a writ of Habeas Corpus, as he has purported
     to do  by this  petition, will  remain suspended during
     the period	 of the Emergency. But even then it has been
     contended on  behalf of  the petitioner  that <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1381">Art.	 359</a>
     does not  authorise the  suspension of  the exercise of
     the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1382">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution,
     and that,	in terms,  the operation  of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1383">Art. 32</a> has not
     been suspended  by the  President. This  contention  is
     wholly unfounded.	Unquestionably, the Court's power to
     issue a  writ in  the nature  of habeas  corpus has not
     been  touched   by	 the   President's  order,  but	 the
     petitioner's right	 to move  this Court  for a  writ of
     that kind	has been  suspended  by	 the  order  of	 the
     President passed  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1384">Art.  359(1).</a> 'the	 President's
     order does	 not suspend  all the  rights  vested  in  a
     citizen to	 move this  Court  but	only  his  right  to
     enforce the  provisions of	 Arts. 21 and 22. Thus, as a
     result  of	  the  President's   order  aforesaid,	 the
     petitioner's right	 to move  this Court,  but Mot	this
     Court's power  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1385">Art. 32"</a> has been suspended during
     the operation  of the  Emergency, with  the result that
     the petitioner  has no  locus  standi  to	enforce	 his
     right, if any, during the Emergency".
</p><p id="p_619">     It is  true that  the Presidential	 order of 1975, like
the residential	 order of 1962, does not suspend the general
power of  this Court  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1386">Article 32</a> or the general powers
of High	 Courts under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1387">Article 226</a>, but the effect of taking
away enforceability  of the  right of  a detenu	 to personal
freedom against executive authorities is to affect the locus
standi in  cases which	are  meant  to	be  covered  by	 the
Presidential  order.   Courts,	 even	in   Habeas   Corpus
proceedings, do	 not grant relief independently if rights of
the person  deprived of	 liberty. If  the locus	 standi of a
deteneu is  suspended no  one can  claim,, on his behalf, to
get his	 right enforced.  The result is to affect the powers
of Courts,  even if this be an indirect result confined to a
class of  cases, but, as the general power to issue writs of
habeas Corpus  is not  suspended, this	feature	 was,  quite
rightly, I  respectfully think, pointed out by this Court in
Mohan Chowdhury's case (supra). It would not e correct to go
further and  read more	into the  passage cited	 above	than
seems intended	to have	 been laid  down there.	 The passage
seems to me to indicate quite explicitly, as the language of
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1388">article 359(1)</a> itself; shows that the detenu's right to move
the Courts  for the  enforcement of  his right	to  personal
freedom,  by   proving	an  illegal  deprivation  of  it  by
executive authorities  of the  State, is certainly not there
for the	 duration of  the Emergency. And, to the extent that
Courts do  not, and,  indeed. cannot reasonably, act without
giving the  detenu some	 kind of  a right  or locus  standi,
their power  to	 proceed  with	a  Habeas  petition  against
executive authorities  of the  State is	 itself impaired. It
may be that in form and even in subs-
</p><p id="p_620">     (1) [1964] 3 S. C. R. 442 @ 450.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">339</span>
<p id="p_621">tance, a  general power	 to issue  writs  of  Habeas  Corpus
remains with   Courts.	But, that  court only  be invoked in
cases  falling	 entirely  outside   the  purview   of	 the
Presidential order  and <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1389">Article	 359(1).</a> That is how I, with
great  respect,	  understand  the   effect  of	 Sree  Mohan
Chowdhury's case (supra).
</p><p id="p_622">     It is  possible that,  if a  case so patently gross and
clear of  a detention  falling, on  the face of the order of
detention or  the return  made to  a notice  from the  Court
outside the  provisions of the Act on the ground of personal
malice of  the detailing  authority, or,  some other  ground
utterly	 outside   the	Act,   arises  so  that	 no  further
investigation is  called for., it may be possible to contend
that it	 is not	 protected by the Presidential order of 27th
June, 1975,  and by  the provisions of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1390">Article 359(1)</a> of the
Constitution at	 all. If  that, could be patent, without any
real investigation  or inquiry	at all,	 it may stand on the
same  footing	as  an	 illegal  detention   by  a  private
individual.  The  mere	presence  of  an  official  seal  or
signature  on	a  detention   order,  in   such  a   purely
hypothetical case,  may not  be enough	to convert it into a
detention by  the State	 or its	 agents or officers. That is
the almost  utterly inconceivable  situation or type of case
which could  still be  covered by the general power to issue
writs of Habeas Corpus. There may, for example, be a case of
a fabricated order of detention which, the alleged detaining
officer, on  receipt of	 notice, disclaims.  It is  admitted
that Part  Ill of  the Constitution is only meant to protect
citizens against  illegal actions of organs of the State and
not against wrongs done by individuals. The remedy by way of
a writ	of Habeas  Corpus is  more  general.  It  lies	even
against illegal	 detentions by	private persons although not
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1391">Article	32</a>  which  is  confined	 to  enforcement  of
fundamental rights  (Vide: Shrimati Vidya Verma through next
friend R.  V. S.  Mani, v. Dr. Shiv Narain (1). The Attorney
General also concedes that judicial proceedings for trial of
accused persons	 would fall  outside the  interdict  of	 the
Presidential order  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1392">Article  359 ( 1 ) .</a> 'therefore it
is unnecessary	to consider  hypothetical cases	 of  illegal
convictions where  remedies under  the ordinary	 law are not
suspended.
</p><p id="p_623">     Now,  is  it  at  all  reasonably	conceivable  that  a
detention order	 would, on  the face of it, state that it is
not for	 one of	 the purposes for which it can be made under
the Act	 or that it is made due to personal malice or animus
of the	officer making	it ?  Can we,  for a moment, believe
that a	return made  on behalf	of  the	 State,	 instead  of
adopting  a   detention	 order,	 made  by  an  officer	duly
authorised to  act, even if there be a technical flaw in it,
admit that  it falls  outside the  Act or was made mala fide
and yet	 the State  is keeping the petitioner in detention ?
Can one	 reasonably conceive of a case in which, on a Habeas
Corpus petition,  a bare  look at  the detention order or on
the return  made, the Court could hold that the detention by
a duly	authorised officer under a duly authenticated order,
stands on  the same  footing as	 a detention  by  a  private
person? I  would not  like to  consider purely hypothetical,
possibly even  fantastically imaginary,	 cases lest  we	 are
asked to  act, as  we have practically been asked to, on the
assumption that	 reality is stranger than fiction., and that

<p id="p_625">cause, according  to the practice of determining validity of
detention orders by the contents of grounds served, a number
of detentions  were found,  in the  past, to be vitiated, we
should	not   present  that   executive	 officers  will	 act
according to law.
</p><p id="p_626">     Courts must  presume  that	 executive  authorities	 are
acting in  conformity with both the spirit and the substance
of the	law: "omina praesumutur rite esse acts", which means
that all official acts are presumed to have been rightly and
regularly done.	 If the	 burden to displace that presumption
is upon	 the detenu,  he cannot, on a Habeas Corpus petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1393">Article  226</a> of  the Constitution.,  ask the  Court to
embark upon  an inquiry,  during the Emergency, to allow him
to rebut this presumption. To do so would, in my opinion, be
plainly to countenance a violation of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_627">     A great  deal of  reliance was placed on, behalf of the
detenus, on  the principle  stated by  the Privy  Council in
Eshuqbayi Eleko	 v. Officer  Administering the Government of
Nigeria &amp; Anr. (1) where Lord Aktin said (at p. 670):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_156">	  "Their Lordships  are satisfied  that the  opinion
     which has	prevailed that the Courts cannot investigate
     the whole of the necessary conditions is erroneous. The
     Governor acting  under the	 ordinance acts solely under
     executive powers,	and in	no sense  as a Court. As the
     executive he  can only  act in  pursuance of the powers
     given  to	him  by	 law.  In  accordance  with  British
     jurisprudence no  member of the executive can interfere
     with the  liberty or  property  of	 a  British  subject
     except  on	 the  condition	 that  he  can	support	 the
     legality of  his action  before a court of justice. And
     it is  the tradition  of British  justice	that  judges
     should not	 shrink from  deciding, such  issues in	 the
     face of the executive. The analogy of the powers of the
     English Home Secretary to deport alience was invoked in
     this  case.   The	analogy	  seems	 very  close.  Their
     Lordships entertain no doubt that under the legislation
     in question,  in the  Home Secretary deported a British
     subject in	 the belief  that  he  was  an	alien,,	 the
     subject would  have the  right to question the validity
     of any  detention under  such order  by proceedings  in
     habeas corpus,  and that  it would	 be the	 duty of the
     Courts to investigate the issue of alien or not"."</blockquote>
<p id="p_628">     The salutary  general principle,  enunciated above,  is
available, no  doubt, to citizens of this country as well in
normal times.  But it  was certainly not meant to so operate
as to  make the	 executive answerable for all its actions to
the Judicature despite the special provisions for preventive
detention in  an Act  intended to  safeguard the security of
the nation,  and, muchless,  during an	Emergency" when	 the
right to  move Courts  for enforcing  fundamental rights  is
itself suspended.  Principles  applicable  when	 provisions,

     claimed   to   exercise   certain	 powers,   including

<p id="p_633">     Viscount Maugham,	in Greene  v. Secretary of State for
Home Affairs,(1)  after referring  to a	 very  comprehensive
opinion of  Wilmot C.  J. On  the nature  of  Habeas  Corpus
proceedings in	Common Law,  pointed out that a return, good
on its	face and  with no  affidavit in support of it, could
not be	disputed on  the application  for a  writ. At Common
Law, the  "sacred" character  of the return, as Wilmot C. J.
called it, even without a supporting affidavit, could not be
touched except	by the	consent of the parties", because the
whole object  of the  writ was to enquire into the existence
of a  legally recognised  cause of  detention, in  a summary
fashion, and  not into	the truth  of facts constituting the
cause. By  the Habeas  Corpus Act  of 1816,  the  powers  of
Courts were extended so that it became possible to go behind
the return in suitable cases other than those where a person
was confined for certain excepted matters including criminal
charges. In  these excepted  matters the  return was  and is
still collective	that English Courts do not go behind
them. In  Greene's case,  (supra), the	rule of	 presumptive
correctness of	the return was applied to the return made on
behalf of  the Secretary  of State to the extent of treating
it as  practically conclusive.	It was	held that  the	mere
production of  the Home	 Secretaries order, the authenticity
and good  faith of  which were	not impugned,  constituted a
complete answer	 to an	application for	 a  writ  of  Habeas
Corpus and  that it was not necessary for the Home Secretary
to file	 an affidavit.	It is  interesting to  note that, in
that case,  which arose	 during the  Emergency following the
war of 1939, the failure of the Advisory Committee to supply
the correct reasons for his detention to the petitioner were
not held  to be	 sufficient to invalidate his incarceration.
On the	other hand,  in these  country" a  violation of	 the
obligation  to	 supply	 grounds   of  detention   has	been
consistently held to be sufficient to invalidate a detention
before the  changes in the Act and the Presidential order of
1975.

</p><p id="p_642">     From the  inception of our Constitution, it was evident
that  the  framers  of	it  meant  to  establish  a  secular
democratic system  of  Government  with	 certain  objectives
before it  without which  real democracy is a mirage. Hence,
they provided  us not only with an inspiring Preamble to the
Constitution and  basic Fundamental  Rights to citizens, but
also with  Directive Principles	 of State  Policy so  as  to
indicate how  not  only	 a  political,	but,  what  is	more
important,  social  and	 economic  democracy,  with  maximum
practicable equality  of status	 and opportunity,  could  be
attained.  They	 foresaw  that	it  may	 be  necessary,	 for
preserving the	system thus  set up and for ensuring a rapid
enough march towards the objectives placed before the people
of India, to give    the executive branch of Government wide
powers, in  exceptional situations, so that it may deal with
all  kinds   of	 emergencies   effectively,  and.,  thereby,
safeguard    the foundations of good Government which lie in
discipline  and	  orderliness  combined	  with	speedy	 and
substantial justice.  The  late	 Prime	Minister  Jawaharlal
Nehru once  said: "You	may define  democracy in  a  hundred
ways, but  surely one  of its definitions is self-discipline
of the community. The more the self-discipline, the less the
imposed discipline".
</p><p id="p_643">     Laws and law Courts are only   part of a system of that
imposed discipline  which has  to take its course when self-
discipline fails.  Conditions  may supervene, in the life of
a nation,  in which  the basic	values we have stood for and
struggled  to	attain,	  the	security,   integrity,	 and
independence of the country, or the very conditions on which
existence of  law and order and of law courts depend, may be
imperilled By  forces operating	 from within or from outside
the country.  What these  forces are how they are operating,
what information  exists  for  the  involvement	 of  various
individuals, wherever placed, could not

for inquiry into or discussion in a Court of Law.
</p><p id="p_644">     In	 Liversidge   v.  Sir	John  Anderson	(supra)	 the
following passages  from Rex  v. Halliday,(2)  were cited by
Lord Romer  to justify principles   adopted by four out five
of their  Lordships in	Liversidges case in their judgments:
(1) Per Lord Atkins (at p. 271):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_163">	  "However precious  the  personal  liberty  of	 the
     subject may  be, there  is something  for which  it may
     well be,  to some extent sacrificed by legal enactment,
     namely, national  success in  the war,  of escape	from
     national plunder or enslavement  .
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_164">     (2) Per Lord Finlay, L.C. (at p. 269).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_165">	  "It	seems	obvious	  that	 no   tribunal	 for

     imagined less appropriate then a Court of law"
</blockquote><p id="p_645">After citing  the two  passages	 quoted	 above,	 Lord  Romer
observed in Liversidge's case (supra) (at p. 281):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_166">	  "I respectfully  agree. I  cannot believe that the
     legis legislature or the framers of the regulation ever
     intended to constitute the	  courts of this country the

<p id="p_646">     If, as indicated above, the opinion of the overwhelming
majority of	 the  Law Lords	 of England" in Liversidge's
cause (supra),	following the  principles laid	down earlier
also in Rex. v. Halide Ex Parte Zadig's (supra) was that the
jurisdiction of	 Courts is itself ousted by a statutory rule
vesting the  power		of detention on a subjective
satisfaction, based possibly on nothing more than a detenu's
descent from or relationship or friendship with nationals of
a country  with which  England may  be at  war, and that the
Secretary of  State's order indicating that he was satisfied
about one  of these  matters, on  hearsay information  which
could not  be  divulged	 in  courts,  in  the  interests  of
national safety	 and security,	was enough,  I do  not think
that either  our Constitution	  contemplating an ouster of
jurisdiction of	 Courts in such cases, or our Parliament, in
enacting provisions which have that effect, was going beyond
the limits  of	recognised  democratic	principles  as	they
operate during	emergencies.  In  fact.	 decisions  on	what
restraints should  be put  and on  which persons"  during  a
national emergency,  in the  interests of national security,
are matters  of policy as explained below, which are outside
the sphere of judicial determination.

</p><p id="p_649">     Let me  glance at the Constitutional History of England
from where we took the writ of Habeas Corpus.
</p><p id="p_650">     Sir Erskine  May wrote  (See: Constitutional History of
England, B Chapter XI):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_167">	  "The writ  of habeas	corpus is unquestionably the
     first security of civil liberty. It brings to light the
     cause of  every imprisonment,  approves its lawfulness"
     or liberates the prisoner. It exacts obedience from the
     highest  courts:	Parliament  itself  submits  to	 its
     authority. No  right is more justly valued. It protects
     the subject  from unfounded      suspicions,  from	 the
     aggressions  of   power,  and   from  abuses   in	 the
     administration of	justice. Yet,  this protective	law,
     which gives every man security and confidence, in times
     of tranquillity,  has been	 suspended, again and again,
     in periods	 of public  danger or apprehension. Rarely.,
     however,  has  this  been	suffered  without  jealousy,
     hesitation, and  re monstrance; and whenever the perils
     of the  State have been held sufficient to warrant this
     sacrifice	of   personal  liberty,	  no   Minister	  or
     magistrate has  been suffered to tamper with the law at
     his discretion.  Parliament  alone,  convinced  of	 the
     exigency of  each occasion,  has suspended, for a time,
     the right	of individuals,	 in  the  interests  of	 the
     State.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_168">	  The first  years after the Revolution were full of
     danger. A dethroned king, aided by foreign enemies, and
     a powerful	  body of English adherents, was threatening
     the new  settlement of  the Crown with war and treason.
     Hence,  the   liberties  of   Englishmen,	so  recently
     assured, were  several  times  made  to  yield  to	 the
     exigencies of the State. Again, on occasions of no less
     peril-the rebellion  of 1755 the Jacobite conspiracy of
     1722, and the invasion of the realm li by the Pretender
     in	 1745-the   Habeas   Corpus   Act   was	  suspended.
     Henceforth, for nearly half a century, the law remained
     inviolate. During the American War, indeed, it had been
     necessary	to   empower  the  king	 to  secure  persons
     suspected of  high treason, committed in North America,
     or on  the high seas, or of the crime of piracy: but it
     was  not	until  1794  that  the	civil  liberties  of
     Englishmen at  home were  again to	 be  suspended.	 The
     dangers and  alarms of  that dark	period have  already
     been recounted.  Ministers, believing  the State  to be
     threatened by  traitorous conspiracies once more sought
     power to countermine treason by powers beyond the law.</blockquote>
<p id="p_651">	  Relying upon the report of a secret committee, Mr.
     Pitt moved	 for a bill to empower his Majesty to secure
     and detain	 persons suspected of conspiring against his
     person and Government. He justified this measure on the
     ground that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_165">346</span>
     Whatever the  temporary danger of placing such power in
the hands of the Government" it was far less than the danger
with which  the Constitution and society were threatened. If
Ministers abused  the power entrusted to them, they would be
responsible for its abuse. It was vigorously op posed by Mr.
Fox, Mr.  Grey, Mr. Sheridan, and a small body of adherents.
They  denied   the  disaffection   imputed  to	 the  people
ridiculed the revelations of the committee and declared that
no such	 dangers threatened  the State	as would justify the
surrender of the chief safeguard of personal   freedom. This
measure would  give  Ministers	absolute  power	 over  every
individual in  the kingdom. It would empower them to arrest,
on suspicion,  any man whose opinions were abnoxious to then
the  advocates	 of  reform.,	even  the   members  of	 the
Parliamentary  opposition.   Who   would   be	safe,	when
conspiracies were  everywhere suspected,  and constitutional
objects and  language believed	to  be	the  mere  cloak  of
sedition'? Let	every man charged with treason be brought to
justice; in  the words	of Sheridan, 'where there was guilt,
let the	 broad axe  fall, but  why surrender		 the
liberties of the innocent ?"
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_169">	  "The strongest  opponents of	the  measure,  while
     denying  its  present  necessity,	admitted  that	when
     danger is	imminent, the liberty of the subject must be
     sacrificed to  the paramount  interests of	 the  State.
     Ring leaders  must	 be  seized,  outrages	anticipated,
     plots disconcerted,  and the  dark haunts of conspiracy
     filled with  distrust and	terror. And  terrible indeed
     was the  power now entrusted to the executive  . Though
     termed a  suspension of  the Habeas groups Act, it was.
     in truth,	a suspension  of Magna	Charta, and  of	 the
     cardinal principles  of the  common law.  Every man had
     hitherto been free from imprisonment until charged with
     crime, by	information upon  oath, and  entitled  to  a
     speedy trial,  and the  judgment of  his peers. But any
     subject  could   now  he	arrested  on   suspicion  of
     treasonable practices,  with  out	specific  charge  or
     proof of guilt, his accusers were unknown	    ; and in
     vain might he demand public accusation and trial. Spies
     and  treacherous  accomplices"  however  circumstantial
     in their  narratives to  Secretaries of  State and	 law
     officers,	shrank	 from  the  witness-box;  and  their
     victims rotted  in gaol. Whatever the judgment, temper,
     and good  faith of	 the executive,	 such  a  power	 was
     arbitrary,	 and  could  scarcely  fail  to	 be  abused.
     Whatever the  danger by  which it	was justified, never
     did the  subject; so  much need  the protection  of the
     laws, as  when Government	and society were filled with
     suspicions and alarm".</blockquote>
<p id="p_652">     It was  not until	1801 that the Act was considered "no
longer defensible  on grounds  of  public  danger  and	Lord
Thurlow announced  that he  could "not resist the impulse to
deem men  innocent until  tried and convicted". It was urged
in defence  of a  Bill indemnifying  an those  who may	have
misused or exceeded their powers during the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_166">347</span>
period of  suspension of  the Habeas Corpus in England that,
unless it  was passed,	"those channels of Information would
be stopped  on which  Government  relied  for  guarding	 the
public peace". Hence a curtain was drawn to shield all whose
acts could  have been  characterized as	 abuse or  excess of
power.
</p><p id="p_653">     It is  unnecessary to cite from dicey or modern writers
of  British   Constitutional  Law,  such  as  M/s  Wade	 and
Phillips, to  show how,	 in times of emergency, the ordinary
functions of  Courts, and,  in particular, powers of issuing
writs  of  Habeas  Corpus,  have  been	curtailed.  In	such
periods, legislative  measures known  as "suspension  of the
Habeas Corpus  Act". Followed  by Acts	of Indemnity,  after
periods	 of  emergency	are  over,  have  been	restored  to
England. But,  during the  first world	war of	1914 and the
last world war of 1939, it was not even necessary to suspend
the Habeas  Corpus Act	in England  . The Courts themselves,
on an  interpretation of  the relevant regulations under the
Defence of  Realm Act,	abstained from judicial interference
by denying, themselves power to interfere  .

whereas the  consequences given	 in <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1409">Article 358</a>, as a result
of a  Proclamation   under <a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_1410">Article  352 (1</a>),  are automatic,
Presidential orders  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1411">Article 359(1)</a> may have differing
consequences, from  emergency to  emergency, depending	upon
the terms  of the  Presidential orders	involved. And  then,
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1412">Article 359 (1A</a>), made operative retrospectively by the 38th
Constitutional amendment,  of 1st  August,  1975,  makes  it
clear that  both the Legislative and Executive organs of the
State, are  freed, for	the duration  of the Emergency, from
the limits imposed by Part III of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_659">     It	 is  unnecessary  to  refer  to	 the  provisions  of
Articles 356 and 357 except to illustrate the extremely wide
character of  Emergency powers of the Union Govt. which can,
by recourse  to these  powers,	make  immune  from  judicial
review, suspend	 the federal  features of  our	Constitution
which have,  sometimes, been  elevated to  the basic  level.
These provisions  enable the  Union Govt.  to supersede both
the legislative and executive wings of Government in a State
in the	event of  a failure  of Constitutional	machinery in
that State,  and to administer it through any person or body
of persons  under Presidential directions with powers of the
State Legislature  "exercisable by or under the authority of
Parliament". <a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_1413">Article  360</a>, applicable  only to Proclamations

</p><p id="p_661">     E.	 The   effect  of   the	 Presidential	orders	 and
particularly the  order of 27th June, 1975, on the rights of
detenus.
</p><p id="p_662">     The Presidential  order of 3rd November 1962 was issued
after the  proclamation of Emergency under <a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_1417">Article 352(1)</a> on
26th October, 1962. That proclamation said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_188">	  "......  a  grave  emergency	exists	whereby	 the
     security	of   India   is	  threatened   by   external
     aggression".
</blockquote><p id="p_663">On the	other hand,  the Presidential  order of	 27th  June,
1975, with  which we  are concerned  here was issued under a
proclamation which   declares "that a grave emergency exists
whereby the  security. Of  India is  threatened by  internal
disturbances".
</p><p id="p_664">     There was	also  a	 Presidential  proclamation  of	 3rd
December, 1971,	 repeating the	terms of the proclamation of
26th October, 1962, as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_189">	  "In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1)

     President of India, by this Proclamation declare that a
     grave emergency exists whereby the security of India is
     threatened by external aggression .</blockquote>
<p id="p_665">     The Presidential  order of 3rd November, 1962, reads as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_190">	  "In exercise	of the	powers conferred	  by
     clause (1)	 of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1419">article  359</a> of  the  Constitution,	 the

     1962 (4 of 1962) or any rule or order made thereunder".</blockquote>
<p id="p_666">     The Presidential  order of	 27th June,  1975,  runs  as
follows:

     22</a> of  the Constitution  and ail proceedings pending in

     which the	Proclamations of Emergency made under clause
     (1) of  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1427">article 352</a>  of the  Constitution	on  the	 3rd
     December, 1971  and on  the 25th June, 1975 are both in
     force
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_171">352</span>
	  (2) This  order shall	 extend to  the whole of the
     territory of  India  except  the  State  of  Jammu	 and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_192">	  (3) This  order shall be in addition to and not in
     derogation	   of any order made before the date of this
     order  under   clause  (1)	  of  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1428">article	359</a>  of	 the
     Constitution".</blockquote>
<p id="p_667">     The striking  differences	in  the	 terms	of  the	 two
Presidential orders set out above are:
</p><p id="p_668">     (1) The  Presidential order  of 1962  did	not  specify
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1429">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, but <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1430">Article 14</a>, guaranteeing
equality before	 the law and equal protection of laws to all
persons in  India, is  mentioned in  the 1975  order. To  my
mind, this  does make some difference between the intentions
behind and effects of the two Presidential orders.
</p><p id="p_669">     (2) The Presidential order of 1962 expressly hedges the
suspension    of  the specified	 fundamental rights with the
condition, with	 regard to  deprivations covered by articles
21 and	22 of  the Constitution	 that, "if  such  person  is
deprived of  such right	 under the  Defence of	India,	Act,
1962, or any rules or order made thereunder". In other words
on the terms of the 1962 Presidential order, the Courts were
under a	 duty to  see whether  a deprivation satisfies these
conditions or  not. They  could adjudicate upon the question
whether a  detention was  under	 the  Act  or  a  rule	made
thereunder. On	the other  hand, the  Presidential order  of
1975 unconditionally  suspends the enforcement of the rights
conferred upon	"any person  including a  foreigner" to move
any Court  for the  enforcement of  the rights	conferred by
Articles 14, 21, and 22 of the Constitution. The Courts are,
therefore, no longer obliged or able to test the validity of
a detention  by examining  whether they conform to statutory
requirements. They  will have  to be content with compliance
shown with forms of the law.
</p><p id="p_670">     (3) Presidential  order of	 1962 makes  no	 mention  of
pending proceedings, but the 1975 order suspends all pending
proceedings for	 the enforcement  of  the  rights  mentioned
therein. This  further clarifies  and  emphasizes  that	 the
intention behind  the Presidential  order  of  1975  was  to
actually  affect   the	jurisdiction   of  Courts  in  which
proceedings were  actually pending.  The inference from this
feature also is that all similar proceedings in future will,
similarly, be affected.
</p><p id="p_671">     The result	 is that  I think that there can be no doubt
whatsoever that	 the Presidential  order of 27th June, 1975,
was a part of an unmistakably expressed intention to suspend
the ordinary  processes. Of law in those cases where persons
complain of  infringement of their fundamental rights by the
executive authorities  of the  State. The  intention of	 the
Parliament itself  to bring  about this	 result, so that the
jurisdiction of Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1431">Article 226</a>, in this particular
type of	 cases is  itself affected  for the  duration of the
emergency, seems clear enough from the provisions of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1432">Section
16A(9)</a> of  the Act,  introduced by Act No. 14 of 1976, which
received Presidential  assent on  25th January	1976, making
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1433">Section 16A(9)</a>	operative retrospectively  from	 25th  June,
1975.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_172">353</span>
<p id="p_672">     The question before us is: What is the intention behind
the Presidential order of 27th June, 1975. After assigning a
correct meaning to it, we have to determine whether what was
meant to  be done  lay within  the scope of powers vested by
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1434">Article 359</a>  of the  Constitution in the President. There is
no doubt  in my	 mind that  the object	of the	Presidential
order of  27th June,  1975, by suspending the enforcement of
the specified rights, was to affect the powers	of Courts to
afford relief  to those	 the enforcement of whose rights was
suspended. I  have already  indicated, this  was within	 the
purview of  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1435">Article 359(1)</a>  is the  Constitution. Hence, the
objection that the powers of the Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1436">Article 226</a> may
indirectly be affected is no answer to the direct suspension
of rights which was bound to have its effect upon the manner
in which  jurisdiction is  or could  reasonably be exercised
even if that jurisdiction cannot be itself suspended for all
types of  cases. It  is enough	if the ambit of the power to
suspend under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1437">Article 359(1)</a> is such as to make exercise of
the jurisdiction  to protect  guaranteed fundamental  rights
not reasonably possible.
</p><p id="p_673">     <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1438">Section 16A(9)</a>  also appears  to me, as held by My lord
the Chief  Justice, to	make it	 impossible  for  Courts  to
investigate questions  relating to  the existence or absence
of bona	 fides at  least in proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1439">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution.  It is  clear that the validity of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1440">Section
16A(9)</a> cannot  be challenged  on the ground of any violation
of Part III of the Constitution in view of the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1441">Article 359 (1A) .</a>
</p><p id="p_674">     No	 previous  decision  of	 this  Court  deals  with  a
situation which	 results  from	the  combined  effect  of  a
Presidential order  couched in	the language of the order of
27th June  1975, and  a statutory provision, such as <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1442">Section
16A(9)</a>	of   the  Act,	the  validity  of  which  cannot  be
challenged. Hence,  strictly speaking, earlier decisions are
not applicable.	 I will,  however, consider  them under	 the
next heading as considerable argument has taken place before
us on  the assumption  that these  cases do  apply to such a
situation.
</p><p id="p_675">     (F)The Rule  of Law  as found  in our Constitution, and
     how it operates during the Emergency.
</p><p id="p_676">     As I  have indicated earlier in this judgment, the term
Rule of Law is not a magic wand which can be waved to dispel
every difficultly.  It is  not an Aladin's Lamp which can be
scratched to  invoke a	power which  brings to any person in
need whatever  he or  she may  desire to  have. It  can only
mean, for  lawyers with	 their feet  firmly planted  in	 the
realm of  reality, what	 the law  in a	particular State  or
country is  and what  it enjoins. That law in England is the
law made  by Parliament.  That is why Sir Ivor Jennings said
(See: Law  and the  Constitution-III Edn.)  that "in England
supremacy of Parliament is the Constitution". And naturally,
the Constitution  of a	country and not something outside it
contains the  Rule of  Law of  that country. This means that
the Rule  of Law  must	differ	in  shades  of	meaning	 and
emphasis from  time to time and country to country. It could
not be	rigid unchanging, and immutable like the' proverbial
laws of	 the Medes  and Persians.  Nevertheless, one  has to
understand clearly what it means
25-833 Sup C I/76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_173">354</span>
in a  particular context.  It cannot  be like  some brooding
omnipotence in	the skies. Its meaning cannot be what anyone
wants to  make	it.  It	 has  to  be,  for  each  particular
situation, indicated  by the  Courts which are there to tell
the people what it means.
</p><p id="p_677">     This Court	 has, in  no unmistakable  terms,  indicated
what the Constitution means and how the Rule of Law embedded
in it works even during Emergencies.
</p><p id="p_678">     A statement  of the  Rule of  Law by  Jackson,  J.,  in
Youngstown Sheet  &amp;  Tube  Co.	v.  Sawyer(1),	quoted	with
approval by  this Court,  in Chief  Settlement Commissioner,
Rehabilitation Department Punjab &amp; ors. etc. v. Om Prakash &amp;
ors.(2) etc. (at page 661):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_193">	  "With all  its defects  delays and  inconveniences
     men have  discovered no  technique for  long preserving
     free government  except that the Executive be under the
     law,  and	 that  the  law	 be  made  by  Parliamentary
     deliberations".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_194">     It was explained there:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_195">	  In our constitutional system, the central and most
     characteristic feature  is the  concept of	 the rule of
     law which	means, in the present context, the authority
     of the  law courts to test all administrative action by
     the  standard   of	 legality.   The  administrative  or
     executive action  that does  not meet the standard will
     be	 set  aside  if	 the  aggrieved	 person	 brings	 the
     appropriate action	 in the competent court. The rule of
     law rejects  the conception  of the Dual State in which
     governmental action  is placed in a privileged position
     of immunity  from control	of law.	 Such  a  notion  is
     foreign to our basic constitutional concept".</blockquote>
<p id="p_679">     This statement,  no  doubt,  includes  the	 concept  of
determination by  Courts of the question whether an impugned
executive action  is within  the bounds	 of law. However, it
presupposes:  firstly,	 the  existence	  of  a	  fixed	  or
identificable rule  of law which the executive has to follow
as distinguished  from a  purely policy	 decision open to it
under  the   wide  terms   of  the   statute  conferring   a
discretionary power to	act. and, secondly, the power of the
Courts to  test that  action by reference to the Rule. Even,
in Emergencies,	 provided the  power of the Court to so test
the legality  of some executive act is not curtailed, Courts
will apply  the test  of legality  "if the  person aggrieved
brines the action in the competent Court". But, if the locus
standi of  the person  to move	the Court  is gone  and	 the
competence of  the Court  to enquire  into the	grievance is
also  impaired	 by  inability	to  peruse  the	 grounds  of
executive    action  or their relationship with the power to
act, it	 is no	use appealing  to this particular concept of
the Rule  of law  set out  above. It is just inapplicable to
the situation  which arises  here. Such	 a situation	  is
governed by  the Emergency  provisions of  the	Constitution
These provisions contain the Rule of Law for such situations
in our country.

decision of  this Court was sought to be made a foothold for
several arguments  on behalf  of the  detenus. It,  however,
seems to  me to	 have  laid  down  more	 propositions  which
demolish various  contentions  advanced	 on  behalf  of	 the
detenus	 than  those  which  could  assist  them.  One	main
question  considered   in  that	 case  was  whether  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1447">Section
491(1)(b)</a> of  the Code	of Criminal Procedure could afford a
statutory remedy,  by an order or direction in the nature of
a writ of Habeas Corpus, at a time   when enforcement of the
fundamental right  to personal	liberty was suspended by the
Presidential order  of	1962  already  set  out	 above.	 The
suggestion that a Common Law remedy by way of writ of Habeas
Corpus exists,	even after <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1448">Section 491</a> was introduced in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1449"> the

<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1450">Article	 359(1)</a>	  of  the   Constitution,  taking   in	 the
jurisdiction of	 "any Court", was  held wide enough to cover
any  kind   of	relief	claimed	 by  a	petitioner  for	 the
enforcement of a specified fundamental right. Inter alia, it
was held (at p. 821-822):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_196">	  "If <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1451">Art.  359(1)</a> and the Presidential order issued

     491(1)(b)</a>	 the fact  that the  court can	act suo motu
     will not  make any difference to the legal position for
     the simple	 reason that  if a  party is  precluded from
     claiming his  release on  the ground  set out by him in
     his petition,  the Court  cannot, purporting to act suo
     motu, pass	 any order  inconsistent with the provisions
     of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1453">Art.  359(1)</a> and the Presidential order issued under
     it. Similarly,  if the  proceedings under	s. 491(1)(b)
     are hit  by <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1454">Art. 359(1)</a> and the Presidential order, the
     arguments based  on the  provisions of <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1455">Art. 372</a> as well
     as Arts.  225 and 375 have no validity. The obvious and

     his specified  fundamental rights	is  to	suspend	 the
     jurisdiction of the Court pro tanto in that behalf"

     It was  also held	in Makhan Singh`s case (supra) that,
as no  attack on the validity of the Defence of India Act of
1962 and  the Rules  framed thereunder,	 on  the  ground  of
violation  of	fundamental  rights,  was  open	 during	 the
emergency, no  petition was  maintainable on  the ground  of
such alleged invalidity. It was held (at p. 825-826) there:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_197">	  "Therefore, our conclusion is that the proceedings

     High Courts  challenging their  detention on the ground
     that the  impugned Act  and the  Rules are void because

     for the  reason that  the fundamental  rights which are

<p id="p_687">     After having decided the questions actually calling for
determination in that case, Gajendragadkar, J., speaking for
the majority,  ex pressed  some views  on the possible pleas
which may still be open to petitioners in hypothetical cases
despite the  Presidential order	 of  1962,  set	 out  above,
passed under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1456">Article 359(1).</a> He said (at page 828):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_198">	  "If in  challenging the  validity of his detention
     order, the	 detenu is  pleading any  right outside	 the
     rights specified  in the  order, his  right to move any
     court in  that behalf  is not  suspended, because it is
     outside  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1457">Art.   359(1)</a>  and  consequently	outside	 the
     Presidential Order	 itself. Let  us take a case where a
     detenu has	 been detained in violation of the mandatory
     provisions of  the Act.  In such a case, it may be open
     to the  detenu to contend that his detention is illegal
     for the reason that the mandatory provisions of the Act
     have been	contravened. Such  a plea  is  outside	<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1458">Art.
     359(1)</a> and	 the right  of the  detenu to  move for	 his
     release on	 such a	 ground cannot	be affected  by	 the
     Presidential order."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_199">     Again, it was observed (at page 828-829):
	  "Take also a case where the detenu moves the Court
     for a  writ of  habeas corpus  on the  ground that	 his
     detention has  been  ordered  malafide.  It  is  hardly
     necessary to  emphasis that  the exercise	of  a  power
     malafide  is  wholly  outside  the	 scope	of  the	 Act
     conferring the  power and	can always  be	successfully
     challenged. It  is true that a mere allegation that the
     detention or  malafide would  not be enough, the detenu
     will have to prove the malafides. But in the mala fides
     are  alleged,  the	 detenu	 cannot	 be  precluded	from
     substantiating his	 plea  on  the	ground	of  the	 bar
     cleated by <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1459">Art. 359(1)</a> and the Presidential order. That
     is another kind of plea which is outside the purview of
     <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1460">Art. 359(1)"</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_688">The two	 passages set  out above,  stating what	 may be	 the
position in purely hypothetical cases, are the mainstrays of

ments for  the petitioners  But, none of the Counsel for the
petitioners has stated how these observations are applicable
to facts  of the  case to the particular petitioner for whom
he appears.  Assuming, however,	 that the hypothetical cases
indicate good  grounds on  which a  Habeas  Corpus  petition
could be  allowed even in an Emergency, it was certainly not
decided in  Makhan Singh`s  case (supra)  what	the  process
could be  for ascertaining  that one of these grounds exist.
if that	 process involves  a consideration  of	evidence  in
support of a plea, such as that of mala fides in proceedings
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1461">Article  226"</a> the	 most important,  evidence would  be
grounds of  detention. These  grounds constituted  the lever
which could  have been and was used in the past by Courts to
reach decisions	 on various pleas, such as the plea that the
order was  not passed  after due  application of mind to the
facts of the detenu's case or that the' satisfaction reached
was not	 with regard  to legally relevant grounds at all. No
such means  are available now. This difficulty was certainly
not in the way at the time of the decision in Makhan Singh`s
case (supra).
</p><p id="p_689">     I am therefore, of the opinion that pleas which involve
any adduction  of' evidence  would, at any rate, be entirely
excluded  by  the  combined  effect  of	 the  terms  of	 the
Presidential order of 27th June, 1975, read with the amended
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1462">Section 16A(9)</a>  of the  Act. A  perusal of <a href="/doc/802267/" id="a_1463">S.
Pratap Singh  v. State	of Punjab</a>,(1)  will show the kind of
evidence which	often becomes necessary to justify a plea of
"malice in  fact". Pleas  about vires of the detention order
itself e.g.  whether it	 is based  on, irrelevant grounds or
was not	 passed after due application of mind) often require
investigation or  questions of	fact involving	scrutiny  of
actual grounds	of detention  which is	hit by	the  embargo
against an  assertion of  a right to move for enforcement of
the  right   to	 personal`freedom  and	prohibition  against
disclosure of  grounds. So long as the executive authorities
of  the	  State	 purport   to  act  under  the	Act,,  their
preliminary objection  against further	hearing will prevail
unless, of  course, the officer purporting to detain had, in
fact, not  been invested at all with any authority to act in
which case  the detention  would, in  my opinion,  be on the
same footing  as one  by a  private person  who has no legal
authority whatsoever to detain. But, such a defect has to be
apparent either	 on the face of the order or admitted in the
return. Moreover,  it can  be cured  by an  adoption of	 the
order by the State.

enforcement of specified fundamental rights operates only to
protect	 infringements	of  rights  by	the  State  and	 its
authorised agents,  acting or purporting to act? in official
capacities which they could and do hold. A claim to an order
of release  from such a patently illegal detention, which is
not by	the State  or on  its behalf. could be enforced even
during the  current Emergency.	But there  is no  such	case
before us. All the cases before us are, as far as I know. OF

this Court  relied upon	 strongly on  behalf of	 detenus. In
that case, an order prohibiting	 petitioner from residing in
a specified area under section 3(1)(b) of the Madhya Pradesh
Public Security	 Act, 1959,  which was	found  to  be  void,
because	 the   provision  infringed   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1465">Article  19</a>   of	 the

Constitution. The  ground  of  the  decision	  was  that,
although, the  empowering  provision  could  not  have	been
challenged if  it was  contained in an enactment made during
the emergency,	yet as	the provision  was made	 by  an	 Act
passed	at   a	time  when  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1467">Article  19</a>	 was  operative	 the
invalidity of  the provision  could be	demonstrated despite
the existence of the emergency. I do not think that there is
any such  case before  us. It  seems to me to he possible to
distinguish the	 case on  the ground  that it  was a case of
patent voidness of the order passed so that the principle of
legality, which	 is not	 suspended, could  be affirmed	even
apart from  enforcement of  a specified fundamental right. I
think it  was placed  on such a footing by Shah J., speaking
for this Court.

Anr</a>.,(2) another  decision of the Constitution Bench of this
Court, was  also cited.	 There, an illegal order prohibiting
the sending  out of jail by a detenu of a book on matters of
scientific interest  only, for publication, was quashed by a
High Court,  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1469">Article  226</a> of the Constitution" despite
the  Presidential   order   under   <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1470">Article   359</a>   of	 the

that an	 ultra vires order could be set aside. This could be
done under  the residuary  jurisdiction of  the High  Court,

this Court  did, in  a petition	 under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1473">Article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution apply  the test  of a  satisfaction required on
relevant grounds,  by Rule  30, subrule	 1, Defence of India
Rules, 1962,  as a condition precedent to detention, because
the grounds  of detention  were mentioned  in the  detention
order itself so that they could be used to determine whether
the detention order fell within the purposes of the Act. The
writ petition  was allowed.  The alleged satisfaction of the
District Magistrate,  who was  the detaining  authority, was
found, on  the ground  given for  detention, to fall outside
Rule 30.  It was  held that  the  Presidential	order  under
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1474">Article 359</a>  was not  intended to  condone violations of the
defence of  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1475">India Act</a>  or the  rules made thereunder and did
not authorise  ultra vires  or mala  fide detentions. It was
pointed out  here that satisfaction about the need to detain
in the	interests of "law and order ' was not the same thing
as one	in the	interests of "public order". In this case, a
well-known distinction	between `'public order" and "law and
order", was  drawn by  Hidayatullah, J.,  in  the  following
terns:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_200">	  "It will  thus appear	 that just as "public order"
     in the rulings of the Court (earlier cited) was said to
     comprehend	 disorders   of	 less	gravity	 than  those
     affecting "security  of State",  "law and	order"	also
     comprehends  disorders   of  less	gravity	 than  those
     affecting "public	order". One  has  to  imagine  three
     concentric	 circles.   Law	 and  order  represents	 the
     largest  circle   within  which   is  the	next  circle
     representing  public  order  and  the  smallest  circle
     represents security  of State.  It is  then easy to see
     that an  act may  affect law  and order  but not public
     order just	 as an	act may	 affect public order but not
     security  of   the	 State.	  By  using  the  expression
     'maintenance of law and. Order" the District Magistrate
     was widening  his own  field of action and was adding a
     clause to the Defence of India Rulers.</blockquote>
<p id="p_696">     I take  the decision  of this Court in Dr. Lohia`s case
to mean	 that if  the order,  on the face of it., is bad and
does not  satisfy the  requirements of	the law	 authorising
detention, the	detenu may  be released. Sarkar, J., pointed
out there:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_201">	  "The	satisfaction   of   the	  Government   which

     satisfaction. A  court cannot  enquire whether  grounds
     existed which  would have	created that satisfaction on
     which alone  the order could have been made in the mind
     of a  reasonable person.  If that is so-and that indeed
     is what  the respondent  State contends  it seems to me
     that when an order is on the face of it not in terms of
     the  rule	 a  court   cannot  equally  enter  into  an
     investigation whether  the order  of detention  was  in
     fact, that is to say, irrespective of what is stated in
     it, in  terms of  the rule.  In other  words. in such a
     case the State cannot be heard to say or prove that the
     order was	in fact	 made for  example, to	prevent acts
     prejudicial to public. Order which would

     so. To  allow that	 to be	done would  be to  uphold  a

<p id="p_697">     The  case	was  also  decided  on	a  consideration  of
evidence on  the ground	 that there  was an  area of enquiry
opened up  by the grounds given for entry by the Court. I do
not know  how any  decision could  have been  given  in	 Dr.
Lohia's case  if grounds  of detention	were not found to be
bad on the very face of the order stating those grounds, or,
if there  was no door left open for judicial scrutiny due to
a provision  such a  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1476">Section 16A(9)</a>  of the  Act before	 us.
Thus, the law considered and applied in Dr. Lohia`s case was
different from	the law	 we have  to apply under a different
set of circumstances as explained above.

	  "The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised
     the doctrine  of separation  of powers  in its absolute
     rigidity but  the functions  of the  different parts of
     branches of  the Government    have  been	sufficiently
     differentiated and	 consequently it  can very  well  be
     said  that	  our  Constitution   does  not	 contemplate
     assumptions, by  one organ	 or part  of the  State,  of
     functions	that  essentially  belong  to  another.	 The
     executive	 indeed	  can	exercise   the	 powers	  of
     departmental or  subordinate    legislation  when	such
     powers are delegated to it by the legislature".
He further added:

     policy  and   its	transmission  into  law	 though	 the

could  be   no	question   of  violating  any  principle  of
separation  of	 powers	 by   placing  preventive  detention

Quarterly Review"  (1942) (Vol.	 58-p. 2).,  the  celebrated
jurist and  authority on  English Constitutional history and
law, Sir  William Holdsworth,  supporting majority  decision
there, opined:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_204">	   "The question  turns not, as Lord Atkin says upon
     whether  the   common  law	  or  the  statute  law	 has
     postulated a 'reasonable ' cause  for a  decision or an
     action, but  upon	the  question  whether	or  not	 the
     decision or  the action  to be  taken on  a  reasonable
     cause raises  a justifiable issue. Clearly the question
     whether a	person is  of hostile origin or associations
     so that  it is  necessary to exercise control over him,
     raises,  not   a  justifiable,,   but  a  political  or
     administrative issue".
</blockquote><p id="p_711">He added
	   "On principle  this distinction seems to me be he
     clearly right.  If the  issue is  justifiable, if, that
     is, it  raises an	issue within the legal competence of
     the Court	to try,	 the Court  can decide	on the facts
     proved before  it whether	a cause	 or a  suspicion  is
     reasonable, for  it knows the law as to what amounts in
     the circumstances	to a  cause or	a suspicion which is
     reasonable. If,  on the  other hand,  the issue  is not
     justifiable, if,  that is, it turns, not on a knowledge
     of the law as to what amounts in the circumstances to a
     reasonable cause  or suspicion,  but  on  political  or
     administrative  considerations	   it  can  have  no
     knowledge of the weight to be attached to facts adduced
     to prove  the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the
     cause or  suspicion.. for	it has neither the knowledge
     nor the  means of acquiring the know ledge necessary to
     adjudicate upon  the weight  to be	 attach	 ed  to	 any
     evidence which  might be  given as	 to the existence of
     circumstances of  suspicion or as to the reasonableness
     of belief	Since, therefore,  it is impossible to apply
     an objective    standard  through	the  agency  of	 the
     Courts? the  only possible	 standard to  be applied the
     subjective standard,  so that  the Secretary of State's
     statement that  he had  a reason  able  cause  for	 his
     belief must be conclusive".
</p><p id="p_712">     If the  meaning of	 the  emergency	 provisions  in	 our
Constitution and  the provisions  of the Act is clearly that
what lies  in the  executive  field,  as  indicated  above.,
should not  be subjected  to judicial  scrutiny or judged by
judicial standards  of correctness,  I am  unable to see how
the Courts  can arrogate unto themselves a power of judicial
superintendence which  they do not, under the law during the

<p id="p_713">     Dean Roscoe  Pound, in the Green Foundation Lectures on
"Justice h  According to  Law" (Yale University Press, 1951)
begins his answer to the question as to what justice is by a
reference to  the jesting Pilate, who would not stay for the
answer because	he knew that philosophers disagreed so much,
in  their   answers,  that  there  could  be  no  completely
satisfactory answer.  He divides  justice itself  into three
heads according	 to the three types of bodies or authorities
which could  administer it, and discusses the advantages and
disadvantages of  each: Legislative, Executive, Judicial. He
rejects "Legislative Justice", said to be most responsive to
popular will,  as too  "uncertain, unequal, and capricious'.
He said	 that its  history, even in modern times, was filled
with "legislative  lynchings"" and that this kind of justice
was  ton   susceptible	to   "the  influence   of   personal
solicitation, lobbying, and even corruption", and subject to
guests of  passion, prejudice,	and partisanship. He thought
that executive	or  administrative  justice,  which  becomes
inevitable in carrying out vast schemes of modern socialistic
control and  planning of economic, social, and cultural life
of the	people by  the	State  was  also,  despite  its	 own
mechanisms of  control against misuse of power" fraught with
serious dangers	 indicated by him. Finally, Dean Pound finds
judicial justice, though not entirely immune from error-and,
sometimes, grievous  and costly	 error-to be superior to the
other  two   types  of	justice	 despite  its  own  inherent
shortcomings as	 compared with	executive or  administrative
justice for special types of cases.
</p><p id="p_714">     Now ,  the question  before us  is not  whether  Courts
should apply the high standards of "judicial justice" to the
facts of  each individual  case which  are not before us for
consideration at  all. The  question before us is purely one
of the	interpretation of  laws as  we find  them. If.	on a
correct interpretation of the legal provisions, we find that
the jurisdiction  of Courts  was itself	 meant to be ousted,
for the	 duration af  the emergency, to scrutinise the facts
or reasons  behind detention  orders purporting to have been
made under  the Act.  because the  judicial process  suffers
from inherent  limitations in  dealing with  cases  of	this
type, we  are bound,  by the  canons of	 "judicial  justice"
itself	to declare that this is what the laws mean.
</p><p id="p_715">     It appears to me that it does not follow from a removal
of the	normal judicial superintendence, even over questions
of vires,  of detention orders, which may require going into
facts behind  the returns,  that there	is no  Rule  of	 Law
during the  emergency or  that the principles of ultra vires
are not	 to be	applied at all by any authority except when,
on the	face af	 the return  itself, it	 is demonstrate in a
Court of  Law that the detention does not even purport to be
in exercise  of the  executive	power  or  authority  or  is
patently outside  the law authorising detention. It seems to
me that the intention behind emergency provisions and of the
Act is	that  although	such  executive	 action	 as  is	 not
susceptible  to	  judicial  appraisement,   should  not	  be
subjected to  it, yet,	it should be honestly supervised and
controlled  by	 the  hierarchy	  of  executive	 authorities
themselves  It	enhances  the  powers  and,  therefore,	 the
responsibilities of the Executive.
</p><p id="p_716">     A maxim  of justice  is sometimes	said to	 be :"Let the
heavens fall  but justice  must be  done ".  As	 applied  to
judicial justice, it means
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_183">364</span>
that justice  must accord  with	 the  highest  standards  of
objective, impartial   ,  unruffled dictates	    a  clear
judicial conscience  working  "without	t  fear	 or  favour,
affection or  ill-will". It does not mean that the object of
"judicial justice"  is either  to make	the heavens fall' or
that it	 should be  oblivious to  consequences	of  judicial
verdicts on  the fate of the nation. It fully recognises the
legal validity of the principle adopted by the English House
of Lords  in both  Sadiq`s case (supra and Liversidge's case
(supra): "Salus	 Populi Est  Supreme Lex"  (regard  for	 the
public welfare	is the	highest law). This is the very first
maxim given  Broom's Legal Maxim under the first head "Rules
founded on public policy" (See Broom's 'legal Maxims" p. 1).
</p><p id="p_717">     It is not my object to animadvert here at length on any
weakness in  our legal	or judicial system. I would however,
like to point out that judicial justice can only be "justice
according to  law". It tends more often to accord with legal
justice than  moral justice.  Not only	are the fact finding
powers of Courts limited by rules of evidence and procedure,
but the	 process of  fact finding  and adjudication can miss
their objects  due to  the buying  power of money over venel
witnesses and the capacity of the wealthy to secure the best
forensic talents  in the country even if we do not take into
account the  liability of  judges. like	 the rest  of  human
beings, to  err. Ends  of justice  can be  frustrated by all
kinds of abuses of the processes of Courts
     The machinery  of executive  justice, though  not hide-
bound by technical rules of evidence and procedure, can also
be and	often is  inordinately dilatory.  Its wheels  can be
clogged by  red-tape and  by corrupt  clerical underlings if
their palms  are not  greased by honest citizens. Even those
in the	upper echelons	of the	bureaucracy can be sometimes
hopelessly  unable   to	 see   the  true   objects   of	  an
administrative	scheme	or  of	the  policy  embodied  in  a
statute. They  tend to	be  more  anxious  to  please  their
superiors than	to do  justice	so  that  matters  in  which
executive heads	 may not  get interested  are liable  to  be
neglected for  years and  even forgotten, whereas others, in
which they  are interested,  received speedy attention. They
are not even aided by lawyers who, whatever else may be said
about	them,	have   undoubtedly   imagination,   courage,
independence, and  devotion to	their client's interests. In
any  case,   executive	justice	  lacks	 the  appearance  of
detachment. Justifiable	 disputes between  the State and the
citizen.  On   principles  of	natural	  justice?   require
independent authorities for their resolution. It is for this
reason	that   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1484">Article	226</a>   of  the	Constitution  places
administrative action  and inaction,  even  at	the  highest
levels, under  judicial superintendence, when it impinges on
rights of  persons, although  this may	have given  rise  to
problems of its own either due to misuse by litigants of the
powers of  High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1485">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
or want	 of clarify  in the  drafting of our statutes or the
difficulties  experienced   by	the  executive	officers  of
Government in  understanding the laws or the manner in which
their own duties are to be carried out.
</p><p id="p_718">     Considerations, such  as those mentioned above, arising
out of	alleged carelessness  with which,  according to	 the
learned Counsel	 for the  detentes, detentions are sometimes
ordered, were placed before us so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">365</span>
that we	 may not  deny powers  of rectification	 of apparent
errors of  detaining officers  to High Courts. It was stated
by one	learned Counsel	 that a	 detention  order  was	once
issued	against	  a  person  who  was  dead.  Obviously,  no
detention order	 could be executed against a dead person and
no writ	 petition could be moved on behalf of such a person.
I have,	 however., no  doubt,  that  the  machinery  of	 the
preventive detention  is not  so  defective  as	 to  prevent
executive authorities  at  the	highest	 levels	 from  doing
justice in  appropriate cases  where real  injustice due  to
misrepresentations or  mis-apprehensions of  fact is brought
to  their.  notice.  Not  only	are  the  highest  executive
authorities, under  whose supervision  the administration of
preventive detention  laws is expected to take place, better
able than  the High  Courts, acting under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1486">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution, to go into every question of fact and are in a
much better  position to  know all relevant facts, but their
knowledge f  the meaning  of laws to be administered and the
policies underlying them could not be less, even if they are
not better,  known to them than to the High Courts on such a
matter as  preventive detention.  As already  indicated,  it
raises essentially  matters of	policy. Courts cannot decide
what  individuals   with  what	 kind  of  associations	 and
antecedents  should   be  detained.   In  some	cases,,	 the
associations and  affiliations of individuals with groups or
originations may  certainly  be	 matters  of  common  public
knowledge. But, it is only the membership		 and
associations of	 persons which	may  be	 matters  of  public
knowledge. The	nature of  information, and  the  manner  in
which  individuals   or	 organisations	 concerned  may	  do
something, which  may constitute a danger to the security of
the State,  are matters	 of appraisement  of situations	 and
policies  on   which  information  could  certainly  not  be
broadcast.
</p><p id="p_719">     I, therefore, think that a challenge to the validity of
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1487">Section 16A(9)</a>	based either  on the submission that grounds
for detention  do not call for secrecy or that the provision
is an  unwarranted invasion  of judicial  power, even  in an
emergency, is  not well-founded.  I will  indicate below the
safeguards which  exist in  the	 Act  itself  for  obtaining
redress on  the	 executive  side  in  cases`  of  preventive
detention. As  was held	 by this Court in Ram Jawaya Kapur's
case (supra),  there is	 no such strict separation of powers
under  our   Constitution  as  one  finds  in  the  American
Constitution. No  particular provision	of the	Constitution
could be  pointed out  in support  of the  proposition	that
preventive  detention	is  a	matter	in   which  judicial
superintendence must  necessarily be  preserved as a part of
the doctrine of separation of powers.
</p><p id="p_720">     <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1488">Section 3</a>.	 sub. sec.  3 of  the  Act  shows  that	 the
detaining officer has to submit a report forthwith on a case
of preventive  detention, to ether with grounds of detention
and particulars	 of the	 case, for the approval of the State
Government. The	 detention order  itself unless	 approved by
the State Government, lapses automatically after 12 days. In
special cases,	covered by <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_1489">Section 8</a> of the Act, the proviso
to <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1490">Section  3</a>, sub. sec. 3, makes the initial order, subject
to the	approval of  the State	Government" operative for 22
days. In cases covered by <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1491">Section 16A(2)</a> and (3) of the Act,
in which  no grounds  of detention are to be supplied to the
detenu, the  State Government  has to review and confirm the
order if the detention is to continue beyond 15 days.

<p id="p_721"><a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_1492">Section 14</a>  of the  Act provides for revocation of detention
orders without	prejudice to the provisions of <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_1493">Section 21</a> of
the General  Clauses Act,  1897. The power of revocation may
be exercised  not only	by the	detaining officer concerned,
but by	the State Government or the Central Government	also
Temporary release  of persons  detained is also provided for
by <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1494">Section  15</a> of  the Act  on the  order of the appropriate
Government as  to prevent undue hardship and to Meet special
con contingencies.  The provisions  of <a href="/doc/1496488/" id="a_1495">Article 353(a)</a> of the
Constitution also  the Union  Government to issue directions
to a  State Government	relating to  the manner	 in which  a
State's executive  power  is  to  be  exercised	 during	 the
Emergency. Means  of redress,  in cases	 such  as  those  of
mistaken identity  or misapprehension of facts or detentions
due to	false and  malicious reports  circulated by enemies,
are thus  still open  to a  detenu by  approaching executive
authorities. There  is no  bar against	that.  What  is	 not
possible is  to secure	a release  by an order of a Court in
Heabeas Corpus	proceedings after  taking the Court behind a
duly authenticated prima facie good return.
</p><p id="p_722">     An argument  before us,  to which	would like to advert
here, was  that, notwithstanding  the emergency provisions.,
some undefined	or even	 defined principles  of Rule of Law,
outside the  emergency provisions,    can be enforced by the
High Courts in exercise of their powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1496">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution  because the  Rule of	Law has been held by
this Court  to be a part of the inviolable 'basic structure"
of the	Constitution. It  was submitted	 that, as this basic
structure was  outside even  the powers	 of amendment of the
Constitution under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1497">Article 368</a> of the Constitution, it could
not be	affected by emergency provisions or by provisions of
the Act.  We were  asked to  atleast interpret the emergency
provisions and	the Act	 in such  a way	 as to preserve what
was`represented to  be the  "Rule of  Law" as  a part of the
basic structure of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_723">     It seems  to me  that the theory of a "basic structure"
of the	Constitution  cannot  be  used	to  build  into	 the
Constitution an imaginary part which may be in conflict with
Constitutional provisions.  The Constitution  cannot have  a
base cut away from the super-structure. Indeed, as explained
above, it  seems to  me that  the emergency provisions could
themselves be regarded as part of the basic structure of the
Constitution. At  any rate,  they are meant to safeguard the
basis of all orderly Government according to law.
</p><p id="p_724">     Speaking for myself, I do not look upon the theory of a
basic structure	 of the constitution an anything more than a
part of a well recognised mode of construing a document. The
constitution, like  any other  document, has  to be read and
construed as  a whole.	  This is the common principle which
was applied,  though in	 different ways	 and with  differing
results, both  by Judges  taking the  majority as  well	  as
minority views in Kesavananda Bharti`s case (supra). Some of
the learned  Judges thought  that, by an application of this
rule, the  scope of  the power	of amendment,  contained  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1498">Article 368</a>  of the  Constitution   , was limited by certain
principles which,  though not expressly laid down in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1499">Article
368</a>, could  be read  into the  word "amendment"	 as  implied
limitations upon powers under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1500">Article 368.</a> On the other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_186">367</span>
hand other  learned Judges  (including myself) took the view
that, considering  the provisions  of the  Constitution as a
whole, the  powers  of	amendment  of  the  Constitution  in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1501">Article 368</a>, which operated on all parts of the Constitution
itself and  embraced even  the power of amending <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1502">Article 368</a>
of the Constitution, could not reasonably be so limited. The
theory,	 therefore,  was  nothing  more	 than  a  method  of
determining the intent behind the constitutional provisions.
It could  not and  did not  build and  add a new part to the
Constitution
     It was then urged that want of bona fides was expressly
left open  for determination  by Courts even in an emergency
in Liversidge`s	 s case.  It must not, however, be forgotten
that Liversidge`s  case was  not a  decision upon  a  habeas
corpus proceeding,  but, it came to the House of Lords at an
interlocutory  stage   of  a  suit  for	 damages  for  false
imprisonment  when   Liversidge	  was	denied	 access	  to
particulars  of	 grounds  of  his  detention.  The  question
considered there  was whether  he could	 ask for  them as  a
matter of right. The House of Lords denied him that right.
</p><p id="p_725">     In	 Greene's   case  (supra)"   which  was	 heard	with
Liversidge's  case  (supra)  by	 the  House  of	 Lords,	 the
decision was that the return made on behalf of the Secretary
of State  could not  be questioned.  It is true that even in
Greene's case  (supra), a  theoretical	exception  was	made
for a  case of	want of	 bona fides. I call it "theoretical"
because	   such a case is perhaps not, easily conceivable in
England. It  also requires some explanation as to what could
be meant  by holding  that a return is "conclusive", but the
bona fides  of the  order can be challenged. The explanation
seems to  me to	 be that  want of  bona fides  or "malice in
fact" was  placed  on  the  same  footing  as  fraud,  which
nullifies and  invalidates the	most solemn  proceedings. It
may, however, be pointed out that, in Greene`s case (supra),
it was	not held  that mala  fides or any other invalidating
fact could  be proved  during the emergency in habeas corpus
proceedings. An	 explanation of	 an almost  formal exception
for a  case  of	 want  of  bona	 fides	could  be  that	 the
reservation  of	  such	a  plea	 was  meant  only  for	such
proceedings in	which "malice  in fact"	 could reasonably be
gone into  and adjudicated  upon. The  position	 before	 us,
however., is  very clear. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1503">Section 16A(9)</a> imposes a bar which
cannot	be   overcome  in   Habeas  Corpus  proceedings.  In
addition, a  specific suspension or enforcement of the right
of personal freedom against executive authorities places the
presumption arising  from a  duly authenticated	 order of  a
legally authorised  detaining officer  on a  higher  footing
than a	merely ordinary	 rebuttable presumption for purposes
of proceedings	under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1504">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. These
are, as already indicated summary proceedings.
</p><p id="p_726">     I may point out here that the term "mala fide" is often
very loosely  used. Even  in England, the scope of malice is
wide enough  to include	 both "malice in law" and "malice in
fact". Lord Haldane in Shearer v. Shields,(1) said:
	 "Between 'malice in fact' and 'malice in law' there
     is a  broad distinction  which is	not peculiar  to any
     system of	jurisprudence. The  person  who	 inflicts  a
     wrong or  an injury upon any person in contravention of
     the law is not allowed
     (1) [1914] A.C. 808.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_187">368</span>
<p id="p_727">     to say  that he  did so  with an  innocent mind.  He is
     taken to  know the law and can only act within the law.
     He may,  therefore,  be  guilty  of  'malice  in  law',
     although. so far as the state of his mind was concerned
     he acted  ignorantly, and	in  that  sense	 innocently.
     'Malice in	 fact' is  a different	thing. It  means  an
     actual malicious  intention on  the part  of the Person
     who has done the wrongful act".
</p><p id="p_728">     Now, applying  the broad  concepts of "malice in law`',
as stated  t above,  it has  often been argued before us, in
cases of  preventive detention,	 that the burden is upon the
executive authorities of proving   the strict  legality	 and
correctness of	every step  in the  procedure adopt  ed in a
case of	 deprivation  of  personal  liberty.  To  ask	 the
executive authorities  to satisfy  such	 a  requirements  in
accordance with	 what  has  been  called  the  principle  in
Eshuqbayi Eleko's  case (supra))  would be in my opinion, to
nullify the  effect of	the suspension of the enforceability
of the	procedural  protection	to  the	 right	of  personal
freedom. To  do so  is really to make the Presidential order
under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1505">Article	 359(1)</a>	 of  the  Constitution	ineffective.
Therefore, no  question of  "malice in	law'  can  arise  in
Habeas	Corpus	 proceedings  when   such  a  protection  is
suspended. As  regards the  issue of  "malice in fact", as I
have already  pointed out,  it cannot  be tried	 at all in a
Habeas Corpus proceeding  although it may be possible to try
it in a regular suit the object of which is not be enforce a
right to  personal freedom  but only to obtain damages for a
wrong done which is not protected by the terms of <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_1506">Section 16</a>
of the Act. The possibility of such a suit should be another
deterrent against dishonest use of these powers by detaining

detenus, con  tended that state of emergency, resulting from
the Presidential order of 27th June, 1975, cannot be equated
with a	situation in  which Martial Law has been proclaimed.
The argument  seems to be that if the jurisdiction of Courts
to enforce the right ht to personal freedom is affected, the
resulting position  would be  no different  from that  which
prevails when Martial Law is declared.
</p><p id="p_730">     There  is	no  provision  in  our	Constitution  for  a
declaration of	Martial Law. Nevertheless, <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_1507">Article 34</a> of the
Constitution recognises	 the possibility  of Martial  Law in
this country. It provided:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_205">	   "34 notwithstanding	anything  in  the  foregoing
     provisions	 of   this  Part,   Parliament	may  by	 law
     indemnify any  person in the service of the Union or of
     a State  or any  other t  person in  respect of any act
     done by  him in  connection  with	the  maintenance  or
     restoration of  order in  any area within the territory
     of India where martial law was in force or validate any
     sentence  passed,	 punishment  inflicted,	  forfeiture
     ordered or	 other act  done under	martial law  in such
     area?'
     As there  is no separate indication in the Constitution
of conditions in which Martial Law could be "proclaimed", it
could be urged that a Presidential order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1508">Article
359(1)</a> has a similar effect and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_188">369</span>
was intended  to provide for situations in which Martial Law
may have  to be	 declared in any part of the country. But, a
Presidential order  under <a href="/doc/206932/" id="a_1509">Article 339(1)</a> of the Constitution
would, ordinarily,  have a wider range and effect throughout
the country  than  the	existence  of  Martial	Law  in	 any
particular   part   of	 the   country.	  The	Presidential
Proclamations are  meant generally to cover the country as a
whole. "Martial	 Law" is  generalIy of	a locally restricted
application. Another  difference is that conditions in which
what is	 called "Martial  Law" may  prevail result in taking
over by Military Courts of powers even to try offences; and,
the ordinary  or civil	Courts will  not interfere with this
special jurisdiction  under extraordinary conditions. Such a
taking over  by Military  Courts is  certainly	outside	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1510">Article 359(1)</a>  of the  Constitution taken by
itself. lt  could perhaps  fall	 under	Presidential  powers
under Articles	53 and	73 read	 with <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_1511">Article  355.</a>  <a href="/doc/327898/" id="a_1512">Article
53(2)</a> lays down:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_206">	  "53 (2) Without prejudice to the generality of the
     foregoing provision  the supreme command of the Defence
     Forces of	the Union  shall be  vested in the President
     and the exercise thereof shall be regulated by law".
     And, <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_1513">Article 355</a> provides:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_207">	  "355. It shall be the duty of the Union to protect
     every State  against external  aggression and  internal
     disturbance and  to ensure that the government of every
     State is  carried on  in accordance with the provisions
     of this Constitution."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_208">A similarity  in results  however between  Martial  Law	 and
conditions,  resulting	 from  a  Presidential	order  under
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1514">Article 359(1)</a> is that, if no provision is made by an Act of
Indemnity  the	 civil	liabilities  of	 military  or  civil
officers, acting  mala fide  and outside  the law,  are	 not
removed ipso facto by either Martial Law or the Proclamation
of Emergency.</blockquote>
<p id="p_731">     In Halsbury's  Laws of  England (4th  Edn. vol. 8, para
982, page  625), an  explanation of  Martial Law,  as it  is
known in British Constitutional Law, is given as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_209">	  "The Crown  may not  issue commissions  in time of
     peace to try civilians by martial law; but when a state
     of actual	war, or	 of insurrection,  riot or rebellion
     amounting to war exists, the Crown and its officers may
     use the  amount of force necessary in the circumstances
     to restore order. This use or force is sometimes termed
     "martial law".  When once	a state of actual war exists
     the civil	courts have no authority to call in question
     the actions  of the military authorities, but it is for
     the civil	courts to  decide, if  their jurisdiction is
     invoked, whether  a state of war exists which justifies
     the application  of martial  law. The  powers. such  as
     they are,	of the	military authorities cease and those
     of	 the  civil  courts  resumed  ipso  facto  with	 the
     termination of  the State of war. and in the absence of
     an act  of Indemnity, the civil courts may inquire into
     the
24-833SCI\76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_189">370</span>
     legality of  anything done	 during the  state  of	war.
     Even if  there is	an Act	of Indemnity  couched in the
     usual terms,  malicious acts  will	 not  be  protected.
     Whether this  power of  using extraordinary measures is
     really a  prerogative of  the Crow,  or whether  it  is
     merely an	example of  the common law right and duty of
     all, ruler	 and subject  alike, to	 use the  amount  of
     force necessary to suppress disorder, is not quite free
     from  doubt.  it  is,  however,  clear  that  so-called
     military courts set up under martial law are not really
     courts at	all, and So an order of prohibition will not
     issue to  rest rain  them. Probably the correct view to
     take of'  martial law  itself is  that it	is no law at
     all.</blockquote>
<p id="p_732">     It is  not at  all necessary  for the  purposes of	 the
decision of  cases before  us to determine how proclamations
of emergency  are related  to the more drastic conditions in
which "Martial	Law" if	 it is	"law"  at all, may come into
existence due  to the very necessities of a situation. It is
evident that  the emergency  provisions of  our Constitution
arc very comprehensive. They are intended not merely to deal
with situations	 when actual  out-break of  hostilities with
another country	 try has  taken place  and a war is going on
but also when the country's   peace, progress, security	 and
independence are  threatened by	 dangers either	 internal or
external or  both. Whether  there is  a	 "grave	 emergency",
falling within	<a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_1515">Article 352(1</a>), is a matter entirely for the
President to determine.
</p><p id="p_733">     Attempts were  made by  some learned  Counsel to  paint
very gloomy  pictures of possible consequences if this Court
held  that   no	 relief	 was  open  to	petitioners  against
deprivation of their personal freedoms by executive officers
in an  emergency of  indefinite duration,  when a  number of
cases of  serious misuse  of their  powers by  the detaining
officers were said to be in evidence. I do not think that it
is either  responsible advocacy	 or the	 performance of	 any
patriotic  or	public	duty   to  suggest  that  powers  of
preventive  detention  are  being  misused  in	the  current
emergency when	our attention  could not  be  drawn  to	 the
allegations in	a single case even by way of illustration of
the alleged  misuse  instead  of  drawing  upon	 one  s	 own
imagination	 to conjure up	phantoms. In  fact, I  asked
some learned  Counsel to  indicate the	alleged facts of any
particular case before us to enable us to appreciate how the
power of  preventive detention had been misused. Mostly, the
answers given  were that  the facts  of the  cases were	 not
before	us   at	 this  stage  which  is	 true.	But,  it  is
significant that  no case  of alleged "malice in fact" could
be even brought to our notice.
</p><p id="p_734">     It seems  to me  that Courts  can	safely	act  on	 the
presumption that  powers of  preventive	 detention  are	 not
being abused.  The theory that preventive detention serves a
psycho-therapeutic purpose  may not  be	 correct.  But,	 the
Constitutional duty  of every  Govt. faced  with threats  of
wide-spread disorder  and chaos	 to meet it with appropriate
steps cannot be denied. And, if one can refer to a matter of
common knowledge, appearing from newspaper reports, a number
of detenus  arrested last  year have  already been released.
This shows  that  whole situation  is periodically reviewed.
Furthermore, we under-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_190">371</span>
<p id="p_735">stand that  the care  and  concern  bestowed  by  the  State
authorities   upon the	welfare	 of  detenus  who  are	well
housed, well fed, and well treated. is almost maternal. Even
parents have  to take  appropriate preventive action against
those children	who May threaten to burn down the house they
live in.
</p><p id="p_736">     If there  are, under  our	Constitution,  some  supreme
obligations  or	 overriding  powers  or	 duties,  vested  in
superior Court-s,  as learned Counsel for the detenus seemed
to  be	 contending  for,   to	 enforce   the	 claims	  of
constitutionality, quite apart from the suspended powers and
duties of  Courts to  enforce  fundamental rights, I am sure
that the  current emergency, justified not only by the rapid
improvement. due  to it in the seriously dislocated national
economy and  discipline but  also by  the rapid	 dangers  of
tomorrow, apparent  to those  who have the eyes to see them,
averted by  it, could  not possibly provide the occasion for
the discharge  of such obligations towards the nation or the
exercise of such powers, if any, in the Courts set up by the
Constitution. Where  there are	such great  obligations	 and
powers they  must always  be guided by the principle already
indicated: "Sauls  Populi Est  Suprema Lex".  Indeed,  as  I
understand  even  the  majority	 view  in  Golaknath`s	case
(supra),  it   was   that,   despite   the   invalidity	  of
constitutional	 amendments    of   provisions	  containing
fundamental 1)	rights, to  give effect to the view would be
contrary to  this principle. The case for the detenus before
us, however, fails on preliminary hurdles. Despite strenuous
efforts, their learned Counsel were quite unable to show any
constitutional invalidity, directly or indirectly, in any of
the measures  taken, whether legislative or executive, by or
on behalf of the State.
</p><p id="p_737">     The real  question for determination by us relates only
to  the	  meaning  and	effect	of  the	 Constitutional	 and
statutory provisions  indicated above  which are  applicable
during the  current  Emergency.	 A  large  number  of  other
questions including  even some quite remotely connected with
the real question involved, were permitted	Court to  be
argued because	of the	great concern  and anxiety  of	this
Court when problems relating to personal liberty are raised.
On the	interpretation of the relevant provisions adopted by
me, the validity of detention orders purporting to be passed
under  the  Act	 cannot.  be  challenged  in  Habeas  Corpus
proceedings. Judicial  proceedings in  criminal Courts,	 not
meant for  the enforcement  of fundamental  rights, are not,
either at  the initial	or appellate  or revisional  stages,
covered by  the Presidential  order of	1975. Habeas  Corpus
petitions are  not maintainable	 in such  cases	 on  another
ground. It  is that  the prisoner  is deemed to be in proper
custody under orders of a Court.
</p><p id="p_738">     My answer to the two questions set out in the beginning
of this	 judgment   which  I  compressed  into	one,  is  as
follows:
</p><p id="p_739">     A prima  facie valid  detention order,  that is to say,
one duly  authenticated and  passed by an officer authorised
to make	 it, recording	purported satisfaction to detain the
petitioner under  the maintenance  of Internal Security Act,
which is  operative either  before or after its confirmation
by the	Government, is a complete answer to a petition for a
writ of Habeas Corpus. Once such an order is shown
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_191">372</span>
to exist  in response  to a  notice for	 a  writ  of  Habeas
Corpus, the  High Court	 cannot inquire into its validity or
vires on  the ground  of either mala fides of any kind or of
non-compliance with  any provision  of	the  Maintenance  of
Internal Security  Act in  Habeas  Corpus  proceedings.	 The
preliminary objection  of the State must be accepted in such
a case.
</p><p id="p_740">     The result	 is that  the appeals  before us are allowed
and the judgment and order of the High Court in each case is
set aside.  The High Court concerned will itself now pass an
order on  each petition	 in accordance with law as laid down
by this	 Court and  the provisions  of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1516">Article 359(1)</a> of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_741">     CHANDRACHUD,  J.  During,	the  last  few	years,	many
questions of  far-reaching  constitutional  importance	have
engaged the  attention of  this	 Court	but  these  appeals,
perhaps, present  problems of  the gravest  magnitude.	They
involve	   an	 adjustment    between	  two	 conflicting
considerations, the  liberty of	 the individual	 on one hand
and exigencies	of the State on the other. This balancing of
the most  precious of  human freedoms  the  liberty  of	 the
subject as  against  the  most	imperative  of	the  State's
obligations the	 security of  the State gives rise to multi-
dimensional problems  quite beyond  the scope and compass of
each right  considered separately  and in isolation. Can the
freedom of  the individual be subordinated to the exigencies
of the	State and  if so,  to what extent ? The Constitution
concedes to the Executive the power of Preventive detention,
but in	the  name  of	   national  security	   can	that
jurisdiction of	 suspicion be  so exercised as to reduce the
guarantee of  personal liberty	to a  mere husk	 ? Detention
without trial is a serious inroad on personal freedom but it
bears the  sanction of	our  Constitution.  The	 Constituent
Assembly composed  of politicians.  statesmen,	lawyers	 and
social workers	who had	 attained a  high  status  in  their
respective specialities and many of whom had experienced the
travails of  incarceration owing  solely to  their political
beliefs resolved  to put <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1517">Article 22</a>, clauses (3) to (7) into
the Construction.  may be as a necessary evil. But does that
mean that,  more as  a rule than as an exception, any person
can be	detained without disclosing the grounds of detention
to him	or to  the Court which may be called upon to try his
Habeas Corpus  petition ?  And	can  such  grounds  and	 the
information on	which the  grounds are	based be deemed by a
rule of	 evidence to  relate to	 the affairs  of the  State,
therefore, confidential	 , and therefore privileged ? Blind,
unquestioning obedience	 does not  flourish on English soil,
said Lord  Simonds in  Christie v.  Leachinsky(1).  Will  it
flourish one  Indian soil  ? These broadly are the sensitive
questions for  decision and  importantly, they	arise in the
wake of Proclamations of Emergency issued by the President.

     Constitution."
</p><p id="p_766">     Various persons detained under section 3(1) of the MISA
filed petitions	 in different  High Courts  for the issue of
the writ of Habeas  Groups. When those petitions can. up for
hearing, the Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_195">376</span>
raised a  preliminary objection	 to their maintainability on
the ground  that in  asking for release by the issuance of a
writ  of  habeas  corpus,  the	detenus	 were  in  substance
claiming that  they had	 been  deprived	 of  their  personal
liberty in  violation of  the procedure	 established by law,
which plea  was available  to them  under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1552">Article  21</a>  f  he
Constitution only.  The right to move for enforcement of the
right conferred by that Article having been suspended by the
Presidential  order  dated  June  27,  1975  the  petitions,
according to  the Government, were liable to be dismissed at
the threshold.	The preliminary	 objection has been rejected
for one	 reason or  another by the High Courts of Allahabad,
Bombay,	 Delhi,	  Karnataka,  Madhya   Pradesh,	 Punjab	 and
Rajasthan. Broadly,  these High	 Courts have  taken the view
that despite  the Presidential	order  it  is  open  to	 the
detenus to  challenge their  detention on the ground that it
is ultra  vires, as  for example,. by showing that the order
on the face of it is passed by an authority not empowered to
pass it,  or it	 is in	excess of the power delegated to the
authority, or  that the power has been exercised in breach 0
the conditions	prescribed in  that behalf  by the Act under
which the  order is  passed, or	 that the  order is  not  in
strict conformity  with the  provision of  the Act.  Some of
these High  Courts have	 further held  that the	 detenus can
attack the  order of  detention on  the grounded  that it is
malafide, as  for example,  by showing	that  the  detaining
authority  did	 not  apply   its  mind	  to  the   relevant
considerations, or  that the  authority	 was  influenced  by
irrelevant  considerations,   or  that	 the  authority	 was
actuated by improper motives. Being aggrieved by the finding
recorded by these High	 Courts on the preliminary point the
State Governments  and the  Government of  India have  filed
these appeals,	some under  certificates granted by the High
Courts and  some by special leave granted by this Court. The
High Courts of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Madras have upheld
the preliminary objection.
</p><p id="p_767">     During the	 pendency of  these appeals  and   while the
hearing was in Progress, the President issued an order dated
January 8,  1976 under	<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1553">Article 359(1)</a>	declaring  that	 the
right to  move any  court for  the enforcement of the rights
conferred by  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1554">Article 19</a>  and the proceedings pending in any
court for  the enforcement  of those  rights shall suspended
during the operation of the Proclamations of Emergency dated
December 3, 1971 and June 25, 1975.
</p><p id="p_768">     On behalf of the appellants, the appeals were argued by
the learned  Attorney-General  and  the	 learned  Additional
Solicitor-General. The	learned Advocates-General of various
States argued  in support  of their contentions. A string of
counsel appeared  on behalf of the respondents, amongst them
being Shri  Shanti Bhushan,  Shri V. M. Tarkunde, Shri R. B.
Jethmalani, Shri  S. J.	 Sorabji, Shri A. B. Dewan,  Shri C.
K. Daphtary,  Dr. N.  M. Ghatate,  Shri G.  C. Dwivedi. Shri
Santokh Singh,	Shri Sharad  Manohar, Shri Daniel Latifi and
Shri Mayakrishnan.  The learned	 Advocate-General of Gujarat
generally supported their submissions.
</p><p id="p_769">     The learned  Attorney-General contended that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1555">Article 21</a>
is the	sole repository	 of the	 right to  life and personal
liberty	 and  if  the  right  to  move	any  court  for	 the
enforcement of that right is suspended by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_196">377</span>
the Presidential  order issued	under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1556">Article	359(1</a>),	 the
detenus have  no locus standi to file the writ petitions and
therefore these	 petitions must	 be  dismissed	without	 any
further inquiry	 into the relevance of the material on which
the grounds  of detention  are based or the relevance of the
grounds or the bona fides of the detaining authority. If the
MISA  permits  the  non-disclosure  of	grounds	 and  indeed
prevents their disclosure, there is no question of inquiring
into the  reasons or  grounds of  detention and	 courts must
accept at  its face value the subjective satisfaction of the
detaining authority  has recorded in the order of detention.
"There is  no half-way house" asserted the Attorney-General.
But, not  inconsistently with  the basic submission that the
detenus have  no locus	standi to  file	 the  petitions	 for
habeas corpus,	he conceded  that the court may grant relief
if the	detention order	 is on	the face  of it	 bad, as for
example, if  it is passed by a person not authorised to pass
it, or if it is passed for a purpose outside those mentioned
in section  3(1) of  the MISA  or if  it does  not bear	 any
signature at all.
</p><p id="p_770">     The  learned   Additional	Solicitor-General  indicated
during the  course of  his argument  the limits	 of judicial
review	in  the	 event	of  the	 court	rejecting  the	main
submission  of	 the  Attorney-General.	 He  contended	that
section 16A(9)	of MISA contains but a rule of evidence	 and
is therefore  not open	to attack  on  the  ground  that  it
encroaches upon	 the jurisdiction  of the  High Court  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1557">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. Since <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1558">section 16A(9)</a> is not
unconstitutional, no  court can	 ask for  the prosecution of
the file  relating to a detente or ask for the disclosure of
the grounds of detention. If such disclosure is not made, no
adverse inference can be raised by holding that by reason of
non-disclosure,	 the  detenu  case  stands  unrebutted.	 The
learned Additional  Solicitor-General contended	 that  there
was no	warrant for  reading down  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1559">section 16A(9)</a>  so as  to
permit disclosure  to the  court to  the  exclusion  of	 the
petition and  if any  inquiry is  permissible at  all into a
habeas corpus  petition, the  inquiry must be limited to the
following points:  (1) Whether the order is made in exercise
or purported  exercise of  power conferred by a law; (ii) If
such law  was pre-emergency  law, is  it a  valid law; (iii)
whether	 the  authority	 which	passed	the  order  is	duly
empowered to  do so  by the  law. (iv)	Whether	 the  person
sought to  be detained	is the	person named in the order of
detention; (v)	Whether the  stated purpose of the detention
is one	that comes  within the law; (vi) Have the procedural
safeguards enacted by the law been followed; and (vii) Where
grounds are  furnished (i.e.  when 16-A	 does not  apply) do
such  grounds  ex-facie	 justify  the  apprehension  of	 the
detaining authority  or is  it vitiated	 by a  logical	non-
sequitur  ?  Such  an  inquiry,	 according  to	the  learned
counsel, can  never extend  to an objective appraisal of the
material and  the information for the purpose of testing the
validity of  the subjective  satisfaction of  the  detaining
authority.
</p><p id="p_771">     The arguments  advanced on	 behalf of  the	 respondents
covered a evidence   but they may be summarized thus: H
</p><p id="p_772">     1.	  The object  of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1560">Article 359(1)</a> and the effect of an
	  order issued	under it  is  to  remove  restraints
	  against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_197">378</span>
	  Legislature so  that during  the emergency,  it is
	  free to  make laws in violation of the fundamental
	  rights mentioned in the Presidential	 order.
</p><p id="p_773">     2.	  Under a Constitution which divides State functions
	  into	Executive,  Legislative	 and  Judicial,	 the
	  executive    functions    must    be	  discharged
	  consistently with  the valid	  laws passed by the
	  Legislature and  the orders  and decrees passed by
	  the Judiciary.  The suspension  of  the  right  to
	  enforce fundamental rights cannot confer any right
	  on the  Executive to	flout the law by which it is
	  bound as  much in   times of emergency as in times
	  of peace.  Since there  is a	valid law regulating
	  preventive  detention,  namely,  the	MISA,  every
	  order of  detention passed  by the  Executive must
	  confconfirm to  the conditions  prescribed by that
	  law.
</p><p id="p_774">     3.	  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1561">Article 359(1)</a>  may remove fetters imposed by Part
	  Ill but  it cannot  remove those  arising from the
	  principle or	rule of law or from The principle of
	  the limited  power  of  the  Executive  under	 the
	  system of  checks and balances based on separation
	  of powers  .
</p><p id="p_775">     4.	  The obligation  cast on  the Executive  to act  in
	  accordance	with the law does not arise from any
	  particular Article  of the  Constitution but	from
	  the  inherent	 com  compulsion  arising  from	 the
	  principle of	rule  of  law  which  is  a  central
	  feature      our constitutional  system and	is a
	  basic feature	 of the Constitution. The suspension
	  of the  right	 to  enforce  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1562">Article  21</a>  does	 not
	  automatically entail the suspension of the rule of
	  law. Even during emergency, the rule of law is not
	  and cannot be suspended.

	  the enforcement of fundamental rights mentioned in
	  the order  by a  petition under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1564">Article 32</a> before
	  the Supreme  Court. But,  the	 Presidential  order
	  cannot bar  the enforcement  of rights  other than
	  fundamental  rights  by  a  petition	filed  under
	  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1565">Article 226</a> in the High Court.
</p><p id="p_777">     6.	  Common law  rights as	 well as statutory rights to

</p><p id="p_788">The validity  of the  38th and 39th Constitution (amendments
Acts was not challenged by the respondents.
</p><p id="p_789">     The key  to these rival contentions can be found in the
emergency provisions  contained	 in  Chapter  XVIII  of	 the
Constitution. The  Presidential declaration  of emergency is
made final,  conclusive and non-justiciable by clause (5) of
<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1576">Article 352</a>,  which was	 introduced by	the  38th  Amendment
retrospectively.  But	apart  from   the  fact	  that	 the
Constitution itself  has given	Finality to  declarations of
emergency made	by the President, it is difficult to see how
a Court of law can look at the declaration of emergency with
any mental reservations. The facts and circumstances leading
to the declaration of emergency are and can only be known to
the  Executive,	  particularly	when  an  emergency  can  be
declared, as  provided in  <a href="/doc/1276323/" id="a_1577">Article 352(3</a>), before the actual
occurrence  of	 war,  external	  aggression   or   internal
disturbance, so	 long as  the President	 is  satisfied	that
there is  imminent danger  thereof. The actual occurrence of
war or	external aggression  or internal  disturbance can be
there for  anyone to  see but  the imminent  danger of these
occurrences depends  at any  given moment  On the perception
and evaluation	of the	national or international situation,
regarding which	 the court  of law can neither have full and
truthful information  nor the  means  to  such	information.
Judge and Jury alike may form their personal assessment of a
political situation  but whether  the  emergency  should  be
declared or  not is  a	matter	of  high  State	 policy	 and
questions of  policy are  impossible to examine in courts OF
law. The High Courts whose judgements are under appeal have,
with  the   greatest  respect,	 failed	 to   perceive	this
limitation on  the  power  of  judicial	 review,  though  in
fairness to  them it  must be  stated that  none of them has
held that  the declaration  of emergency is open to judicial
scrutiny. But  at the  back of	one's  mind  is	 the  facile
distrust of  executive declarations  which recite  threat to
the  security  of  the	country,  particularly	by  internal
disturbance. The  mind then  weaves cobwebs of suspicion and
the Judge,  without the	 means to  knowledge of	 full facts,
covertly weighs the pros and cons of the political situation
and substitutes	 his personal  opinion for the assessment of
the Executive,	which, by  proximity and  study,  is  better
placed to  decide whether  the security	 of the	 country  is
threatened by  an imminent danger of internal disturbance. A
frank and  unreserved  acceptance  of  the  Proclamation  of
emergency, even	 in the	 teeth of one's own pre-disposition,
is conducive  to a more realistic appraisal of the emergency
provisions.
</p><p id="p_790">     A	declaration   of  emergency   produces	far-reaching
constituencies. While it is in operation the executive power
OF the	Union, by  reason of <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_1578">Article 353</a>, extends the giving
of directions  to any  State as	 to the	 manner in which the
executive power	 thereof is  to be  exercised. Secondly, the
power of  Parliament to	 make laws  with respect     to	 any
matter includes,  during emergency,  the power	to make laws
conferring powers  and imposing	 duties or  authorising	 the
conferring of powers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_200">381</span>
and imposition	of duties  upon the  Union or  Officers	 and
authorities  of	  the  Union   as  respects   that   matter,
notwithstanding that  the matter  is not  enumerated in	 the
Union List.  <a href="/doc/1457920/" id="a_1579">Article 354</a>  confers  power  on  the  President
direct that  the provisions  of Articles  268 to  279, which
deal with distribution of revenues between the Union and the
States, shall  have effect  subject to	such  exceptions  or
modifications as the President thinks fit, but not extending
beyond the  expiration of  the financial  year in  which the
proclamation ceases  to operate. A Proclamation of emergency
automatically curtails	the  operation	of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1580">Article  19.</a>  As
provided in  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1581">Article  358</a>,  while  the	Proclamation  is  in
operation nothing  in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1582">Article 19</a> shall restrict the power of
the State  to make  any law  or to take any executive action
which the  Stale would	but for	 the provisions contained in
Part III  be competent	to make	 or to take. Any law so made
ceases to  have effect	to the extent of the incompetency as
soon as the proclamation ceases to operate.
</p><p id="p_791">     Then comes	 <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1583">Article 359</a>  which is directly in point. It
authorises the	President to  issue an	order declaring	 the
suspension  of	 the  right   to  move	any  court  for	 the
enforcement of	such of	 the rights conferred by Part III as
the President  may specify  in his  order. Clause (1A) which

<p id="p_792">     The principal question for decision in these appeals is

petition  in  the  High	 Court	under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1594">Article	226</a>  of	 the
Constitution for the writ of habeas corpus.
</p><p id="p_793">     The writ  of habeas  corpus is  described by May in his
'Constitutional History	 of England(1) as the first security
of civil  liberty. Julius Stone in 'Social Dimensions of Law
and  Justice(2)	  calls	 it   a	 picturesque  writ  with  an
extraordinary scope  and  flexibility  of  application.	 The
Latin term  "habeas corpus"  means 'you	 must have the body'
and a writ for securing the liberty of the person was called
habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. The writ affords an effective
means of immediate release from an unlawful or unjustifiable
detention whether  in prison or in private custody. The writ
is of  highest	constitutional	importance  being  a  remedy
available to  the lowliest subject against the most powerful
government.

<p id="p_796">     The liberty  of the individual is the most cherished of
human freedoms	and even in face of the gravest emergencies,
Judges have  played a historic role in guarding that freedom
with real  and	jealousy,  though  within  the	bounds,	 the
farthest bounds,  of constitutional  power.  The  world-wide
interest generated by the lively debate in Liversidge v. Sir
John Anderson and Anr.(1) has still not abated. And repeated
citation has  not blunted  the edge  of Lord Atkin's classic
dissent where he said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_214">	  "I view  with apprehension  the attitude of judges
     who on  a mere  question of  construction when  face to
     face with	claims involving  the liberty of the subject
     show  themselves	more  executing	  minded  than	 the
     executive. In this country, amid the clash of arms, the
     laws are  not silent.  They may  be changed,  but	they
     speak the same language in war as in peace In this case
     I have  listened to  arguments which  might  have	been
     addressed acceptably  to the  Court of  King's Bench in
     the time of Charles I."</blockquote>
<p id="p_797">     Sir William Blackstone in his 'Commentaries on the Laws
of  England'(2)	 says  that  the  preservation	of  personal
liberty is  of great  importance to the public because if it
were left  in the  power  of  ever  the	 highest  person  to
imprison anyone	 arbitrarily there  would soon	be an end of
all other  rights and immunities. "To bereave a man of life,
or by  violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation
or trial,  would  be  so  gross	 and  notorious	 an  act  of
despotism, as  must at	once convey  the  alarm	 of  tyranny
throughout the whole kingdom; but confinement of the person,
by secretly  hurrying him  to gaol, where his sufferings are
unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and
therefore a  more dangerous engine of arbitrary government."
The learned commentator goes on to add: "And yet, sometimes,
when the  state is  in real  danger,  even  this  may  be  a
necessary measure. But the happiness of our Constitution is,
that it is not left to the executive power to determine when
the danger  of the  state is  so great,	 as to	render	this
measure	 expedient;  for  it  is  the  parliament  only,  or
legislative  power,  that,  whenever  it  sees	proper,	 can
authorize the Crown, by suspending the Habeas Corpus Act for
a short	 and limited  time, to	imprison  suspected  persons
without giving any reason for so doing.''
     May in  his Constitutional	 History of  England(3) says
that during the course of the last century every institution
was popularise	and every  public liberty  was extended	 but
long before  that period  English   men had enjoyed personal
liberty as  their birthright.  It was  more prized  and more
jealously guarded  than and  other civil  right.  "The	Star
Chamber had  fallen: the power of arbitrary imprisonment had
been wrested  from the	Crown and Privy Council: liberty had
been guarded by the Habeas Corpus Act ....". Speaking of the
writ of	 habeas corpus May says that it protects the subject
from unfounded suspicions, from the aggressions of power and
from abuses in the

gives every   man  security  and  confidence,  in  times  of
tranquillity,  has  been  suspended,  again  and  again,  in
periods of  public danger  or apprehension. Rarely, however,
has this  been suffered	 without jealousy,  hesitation,	 and
remonstrance; and whenever the perils of the State have been
held  sufficient  to  warrant  this  sacrifice	of  personal
liberty, no  Minister or  magistrate has  been	suffered  to
tamper with  the law  at his  discretion. Parliament  alone,
convinced of  the exigency  of each occasion, has suspended,
for a  time, the  rights of individuals, in the interests of
the State."
</p><p id="p_801">     Dicey in  his Introduction	 to the	 Study of the Law of
the Constitution(1) says that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_215">	  "During periods  of political excitement the power
     or duty of the courts to issue a writ of habeas corpus,
     and thereby  compel the  speedy  trial  or	 release  of
     persons  charged	with  crime,   has  been   found  an
     inconvenient or  dangerous Limitation  on the authority
     of the  executive	government.  Hence  has	 arisen	 the
     occasion for situates which are popularly called Habeas
     Corpus Suspension Acts."</blockquote>
<p id="p_802">     E.C.S. Wade  and  Godfrey	Phillips  observe  in  their
Constitutional	 Law(2) that  in  times	 of  grave  national
emergency,  normal   constitutional   principles   must	  if
necessary give	way of	the overriding need to deal with the
emergency. According to the learned authors:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_216">	  "It has always been recognised that times of grave
     national emergency	 demand the  grant of special powers
     to the  Executive. At  such times	arbitrary arrest and
     imprisonment may  be legalised  by Act  of	 Parliament.</blockquote>
<p id="p_803">     Modern war	 demands the abandonment of personal liberty
     in	 that	the  duty  of  compulsory  national  service
     necessarily takes	away for the time being the right of
     the individual to choose his occupation.'
The learned authors refer to the English practice of passing
Habeas Corpus  Suspension Acts	in times  of danger  to	 the
State. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1595">These  Act</a>s prevented the use of habeas corpus and as
soon as the period of suspension was over anyone who for the
time being  had been denied the assistance of the writ could
bring an  action for  false imprisonment. Suspension did not
legalise illegal  arrest, it  merely suspended	a particular
remedy and  therefore, a  practice grew	 under which  at the
close of  the period of suspension an <a href="/doc/528544/" id="a_1596">Indemnity Act</a> would be
passed in  order to  protect officials from the consequences
or any	illegal acts  which they  might have committed under
cover of the suspension of the prerogative writ.

<p id="p_807">the writ  of habeas  corpus by	which  the  liberty  of	 the

expressly declared  in	the  American  Constitution,  it  is
recognised in Article I, <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_1597">section 9</a>, cl. 2 which says that:

</blockquote><p id="p_808">It would  appear that  in America  something similar  lo the

</p><p id="p_809">     Thus, though  the liberty of the individual is a highly
prized free  dom and  though the  writ of habeas corpus is a
powerful weapon	 by  which  a  common  man  can	 secure	 his
liberty, there are times in the history of a Nation when the
liberty of  the individual is required to be subordinated to
the larger  interests  of  the	State.	In  times  of  grave
disorders, brought  about by external aggression or internal
disturbance, the stability of political institutions becomes
a sine	qua non	 of the	 guarantee of  all other  rights and
interests.   "To   assert   an	 absolute   exemption	from
imprisonment in	 all cases,  is inconsistent with every idea
of law	and political  society; and in the end would destroy
all   civil    liberty,	  by	rendering   its	  protection
impossible.(1) The "clear and present danger test" evoked by
Justice Holmes	in Schenck  v. United Slates(-), may well be
extended to  cases like	 the present where there is a threat
of external  aggression. On the heels of American entry into
the first  World War  on June 15, 1917, the Congress adopted
the Espionage  Act creating  three new	offences which	went
beyond the prohibition of spying and sabotage. It prescribed
punishment  of	a  fine	 of  10,000  dollars  and  20  years
imprisonment. A	 year later,  the Act was amended by what is
popularly called  the Sedition	Act  which  is	rendered  it
illegal even  to say anything to obstruct the sale of United
States bonds  or to  say anything contemptuous regarding the
form of	 Government of	the United States. A unanimous court
upheld Schenck's  conviction under  the Act  for propagating
that compulsory service in the Armed Forces was "a monstrous
wrong against  humanity in  the interest  of  Wall  Street's
chosen few". The judgment was delivered in 1919 when the war
was already  over and Holmes J. held that things that can be
said in	 times of  peace will not be endured during times of
war and	 no court  will regard	them  as  protected  by	 any
constitutional right.
</p><p id="p_810">     The emergency  provisions were  incorporated  into	 our
Constitution on the strength of experience gained in England
and U.S.A.  But the object of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1598">Article 359</a> is to confer wider
power on  the President than the power to merely suspend the
right to  file a  petition for	the writ  if habeas  corpus.
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1599">Article 359</a>  aims at empowering the President to suspend the
right to  enforce all  or  any	of  the	 fundamental  rights
conferred by Part III. It is in order to achieve that object
that <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_1600">Article

<p id="p_812">359 does not provide that the President may declare that the
remedy	 by way	 of' habeas corpus shall be suspended during
emergency. Personal  liberty is	 but one  of the fundamental
rights conferred  by Part  III and the writ of habeas corpus
is peculiar  to the  enforcement of  the right	to  personal
liberty. lt  must follow that the suspension of the right to
enforce the  right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1602">Article 21</a> means and implies
the suspension of the right to file a habeas corpus petition
or to  take any	 other proceeding  to enforce  the right  to
personal liberty conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1603">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_813">     But then  it is urged on behalf of the respondents that
by their writ petitions, respondents did not seek to enforce
the right  to personal	liberty conferred  by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1604">Article  21</a> or
possessed by  them apart from it. They were really seeking a
declaration that  the order of detention was illegal for the
reason that  it did  not comply with the requirements of the
law under  which it  was passed. In support of this argument
reliance  is   placed  upon   a	 passage  in  H.W.R.  Wade's
Administrative Law(1)  to the effect that habeas corpus is a
remedy not only for the enforcement of the right to personal
liberty but  is also  a remedy	for the	 enforcement of	 the
principle of  ultra vires. This argument lacks substance and
overlooks the realities of the situation. lt ay be open to a
detenu by filing a petition for the writ of habeas corpus to
contend that order under which he is detailed is ultra vires
of the	statute to  which the  order owes its existence. But
one must  have regard to the substance of the matter and not
to mere	 from the  real and  substantial  relief  which	 the
detention for  by a  writ of habeas corpus is that he should
be freed  from detention  and the  reason for  the relief is
that the  order of  detention is  ultra vires.	It is clear,
apart from  the Form  in which	the relief may or may not be
clothed, that  the respondents	through their writ petitions
were moving  the High  Courts for  enforcing their  right to
personal liberty.  The history	of the writ of habeas corpus
which  is   succinctly	narrated  in  the  late	 Mr.  M.  C.
Setalvad's 'The	 Common Law in India'(1) shows that the writ
of habeas  corpus  which  was  in  its	inception  a  purely
procedural writ	 gradually developed  into a  constitutional
remedy furnishing  a most  powerful safeguard for individual
freedom.  Mr.	Setalvad  quotes  that	the  writ  has	been
described as  "the key	that unlocks  the door	to freedom".
Respondents were  surely  not  interested  in  obtaining  an
academic declaration  regarding the  ultra vires ' character
of their  detention. They  wanted the  door to freedom to be
opened by the key of the habeas corpus writ.
</p><p id="p_814">     Equally untenable	is the	contention that	 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1605">article 226</a>
which occurs in Chapter V, Part VI of the Constitution is an
entrenched provision  and, therefore,  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1606">Article  368</a> no

other Article  of the  Constitution stands  thereby amended.
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1610">Article 359(1)</a>	provides for  the passing of an order by the
President declaring that the right to move for the enforcing
of fundamental	rights	mentioned  in  the  order  shall  be
suspended. That	 may, in  effect, affect the jurisdiction of
the High  Courts to entertain a petition for the issuance of
the writ of habeas corpus. But that does not bring about any
amendment of  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1611">Article 226</a> within the meaning of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1612">Article 368</a>,
which speaks  of  amendments  to  the  Constitution  by	 the
Parliament in  the exercise  of	 its  constitutional  power.
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1613">Article 226</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1614">Article  359(1)</a>  are	parts  of  the	same
fundamental instrument	and a  certain interpretation of one
of these  Articles cannot  amount to  an  amendment  of	 the
other.
</p><p id="p_815">     It is  also not  correct to  say  that  any  particular
interpretation of  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1615">Article 359(1)</a> will mean the abolition of
the jurisdiction  and  power  of  the  Supreme	Court  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1616">Article 32</a>  and of  the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1617">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. The true implication of the Presidential order
is to  take away  the right  of any person to move any court
for the enforcement of the rights mentioned in the order. In
strict legal  theory the  jurisdiction	and  powers  of	 the
Supreme Court  and the High Courts remain the same as before
since the  Presidential order  merely takes  away the  locus
standi of  a person to move these Courts for the enforcement
of certain  fundamental rights	during the  operation of the
Proclamation of	 Emergency. It	is important  to  appreciate
that the  drive of  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1618">Article 359(1)</a> is not against the courts
but is	against individuals, the object of the Article being
to deprive  the individual  concerned of his normal right to

was necessary  further to  provide that no person would have
any right  to move  for the  enforcement of  his fundamental
rights mentioned  hl the Presidential order and that pending

which it  is bound as much in times of emergency as in times
of peace.  Therefore, the  argument proceeds,  there being a
valid law  regulating preventive detention, namely the MISA,
every order  of	 detention  passed  by	the  Executive	must
conform to  the	 conditions  prescribed	 by  that  law.	 The
current of  thought underlying this argument was highlighted
by a  learned counsel  for the respondents by saying that it
is strange  that  in  the  face	 of  a	law  passed  by	 the
Parliament, which  in passing  the law	must assume  that it
will be	 obeyed,  the  Executive  can  flout  the  law	with
impunity by  relying on	 the Presidential order issued under
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1645">Article 359(1).</a>	 Yet another point of view presented on this
aspect of the case was that permitting the Executive to defy
and-disobey the law made by the Legislature is tentamount to
destroying one	of  the	 important  basic  features  of	 the
Constitution that the Executive is bound by the laws made by
the Legislature.  Finally, it was urged that the Preamble to
the Constitution  speaks of  a Sovereign Democratic Republic
and, therefore,	 the Executives	 which is subordinate to the
Legislature cannot  act to the prejudice of the citizen save
to  the	 extent	 permitted  by	laws  validly  made  by	 the
Legislature which   is	the  chosen  representative  of	 the
people.
</p><p id="p_821">     In view of the true scope and object of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1646">Article 359(1</a>),
which has  already been	 dealt with  above, these  arguments
have to	 be rejected. In the first place, it is difficult to
appreciate the	argument of  'basic features' because we are
not  concerned	 to  pronounce	upon  tile  validity  of  an
amendment  made	 to  the  Constitution	by  a  parliamentary
measures. We  are  concerned  to  understand  the  scope  of
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1647">Article 359(1)</a>	and what it implies. That Article is as much
a basic	 feature of  the Constitution  as any  other and  it
would be  inappropriate to hold that because in normal times
the Constitution  requires the	Executive to  obey the	laws
made by	 the Legislature, therefore, <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1648">Article 359(1)</a> which is
an emergency  measure, must  be construed  consistently with
that position.	The argument  of basic	feature is wrong for
yet another reason that <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1649">Article 359(1)</a> does not provide that
the Executive  is free	to disobey  the	 laws  made  by	 the
Legislature. Al	 the cost of repetition it must be said that
what <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1650">Article 359(1)</a> achieves is merely the suspension of the
right of an individual to move a court for the assertion of'
his fundamental	 rights which  have been  mentioned  in	 the
Presidential order, even if such rights are contravened
 either	 by the Legislature or by the Executive. To permit a
challenge in  a court of law to an order of detention, which
is an  executive  action,  on  the  ground  that  the  order
violates a  fundamental right  mentioned in the Presidential
order, is  to permit  the detenu  to enforce  a	 fundamental
right during emergency in a manner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_208">389</span>
plainly contrary  to <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1651">Article  359(1).</a> The  language of	that
Article,  it   is  admitted  on	 all  hands,  is  clear	 and
unambiguous.
</p><p id="p_822">     The constitutional	 consequences of  a Proclamation  of
Emergency are  grave  and  far-reaching.  Legislatures	can,
during emergency,  make	 laws  in  violation  of  the  seven
freedom guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1652">Article 19</a> the President has the power
to suspend  the right  to move for the enforcement of all or
any of	the fundamental rights mentioned in the order issued
under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1653">Article  359(1);</a> the  Executive  power  of  the  Union
extends during emergencies to giving directions to any State
or to  the manner in which the executive power thereof is to
be exercised.  This particular	power conferred on the Union
Executive is in total violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_1654">Article
162</a> of	the Constitution and indeed of the federal structure
which is  one of the principal features of our Constitution;
in any	State Executive	 fails to comply with the directions
given by  the Union  Executive	under  <a href="/doc/1496488/" id="a_1655">Article	353(a</a>),	 the
"President's rule"  can	 be  imposed  on  that	State  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_1656">Article 356</a>, in which event the Parliament is entitled under
<a href="/doc/741845/" id="a_1657">Article 357(1)</a>	to confer  on the President the power of the
Legislature of	that State  to make  laws The Parliament can
even authorize	the President  to delegate  such legislative
power to  any other  authority. The  democratic structure of
the Constitution stands severely eroded in such a situation.
Finally, Parliament acquires during emergencies the power to
make laws  on matters which are numerated in the State List.
If consequences	 so fundamentally  subversive of  the  basic
federal structure  of the  Constitution	 can  ensure  during
emergencies, it	 is not	 as revolting  as may  be appear  at
first sight  that even	if the	Executive does	not obey the
mandate of the Legislature, the citizen is powerless to move
any court  for the  protection of his fundamental rights, if
these rights are mentioned in the Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_823">     A facet of the same argument was presented on behalf of
the respondents	 with even  greater force. It was urged that
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1658">Art. 359(1)</a>  may remove	 fetters imposed  by Part III but it
cannot ever remove the fetters arising from the principle of
rule of	 law or	 from the  principle of the limited power of
the Executive under a system of checks and balances based on
separation of  powers. The  obligation cast on the Executive
to act	in accordance  with law	 does not,  according to the
respondents,  arise  from  any	particular  article  of	 the
Constitution but  it arises  from the inherent compulsion of
the rule  of law  which is  a central  basic feature  of our
constitutional	system.	 The  suspension  of  the  right  to
enforce	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1659">Article   21</a>  cannot	automatically	entail	 the
suspension of  the  rule  of  law  because  even  during  an
emergency the  argument proceeds, the rule of law is not and
cannot be  suspended. The  Executive has a limited authority
under the  Indian Constitution	and it	can act	 within	 the
residual area  as it  pleases, so long as it does not act to
the prejudice  of the citizen. It is always incumbent on the
Executive to  justify its  action on  the basis	 of law	 and
this, according	 to the	 respondents, is  the  principle  of
legality or the rule of law.
</p><p id="p_824">     The respondents'  argument that  all  executive  action
which operates	to the	prejudice of  a person must have the
authority of  law to  support it  is indisputably  valid  in
normal	situations.   In  the  absence	of  Proclamation  of
Emergency and in the absence of a Presidential order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_209">390</span>
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1660">Article 359(1)</a> of the kind that we have in the instant case,
the I  executive is  under an obligation to obey the law and
if it acts to the prejudice of anyone by disobeying the law,
its action  is liable  to be  challenged by  an	 appropriate
writ. That  the rule  of law must prevail in normal times is
the rule  of law  under the  Indian Constitution.  But it is
necessary  to	clear  a   misconception.  Even	 though	 the
compulsion to  obey the law is a compulsion of normal times,
<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1661">Article 358</a> takes in those cases only in which the executive
purports to  act under	the authority  of a law. It does not
envisage that  the executives  can' act without the apparent
authority of  law. In  other words,  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1662">Article 358</a> enables the
Legislature to	make laws in violation of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1663">Article 19</a> and the
Executive to act under those laws, despite the fact that the
laws constitute	 an infringement  of the  fundamental rights
conferred by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1664">Article 19.</a>
</p><p id="p_825">     The argument  of the  respondents that the Presidential
order under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1665">Article 359(1)</a>  cannot ever suspend the rule of
law requires  a close  examination, particularly  in view of
some of the decisions of this Court which apparently support
that contention.
</p><p id="p_826">     <a href="/doc/766560/" id="a_1666">In State  of Madhya  Pradesh &amp;  Anr. v.  Thakur  Bharat
Singh</a>(1) the  State Government,	 on April  24, 1963  made an
order under  section 3 of the Madhya Pradesh Public Security
Act, 1959  directing that the respondent shall not be in any
place in  Raipur District, that he shall immediately proceed
to and reside in a named town and that he shall report daily
to a  police station  in that town. The order was challenged
by the	respondent by a writ petition under Articles 226 and
227 of	the  Constitution  on  the  ground  that  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1667">section  3</a>
infringed  the	fundamental  rights  guaranteed	 by  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_1668">Article
19(1)(d)</a>  and	<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1669">(e)</a>  of	 the  Constitution.  The  respondent
succeeded in  the High	Court which  declared a	 part of the
order invalid  on the  ground that  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1670">section 3</a> (1) (b) of the
Act was	 violative of  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_1671">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the Constitution.
In appeal.  it was  contended in this Court on behalf of the
State Government  that so  long as  the state  of  emergency
declared on  October 20,  1962 was  in force, the respondent
could not  move the  High Court	 by a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1672">Article
226</a> on	the plea  that by the impugned order his fundamental
right guaranteed  under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_1673">Article	 19(1)(d)</a> was  infringed. It
was further contended on behalf of the State Government that
even if	 <a href="/doc/188392346/" id="a_1674">section 3(1)(b)</a>  was held  to be  void. <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1675">Article 358</a>
protected legislative  as well	as  executive  action  taken
after the  Proclamation of Emergency and therefore the order
passed by  the Government  after the  emergency was declared
could not be challenged as infringing <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1676">Article 19.</a> Describing
this latter  argument  as  involving  "a  grave	 fallacy"  a
Constitution Bench  of	this  Court  dismissed	the  State's
anneal holding,	 that for  acts done to the prejudice of the
respondent after  the declaration of emergency under Article
</p><p id="p_827">352. no	 immunity from"	 the process  of the  Court could be
claimed under  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1677">Article 358</a>  of the  Constitution  since	 the
order was  not supported  by and,  valid legislation. Shah J
who spoke  on behalf  of the  Bench observed in his judgment
that an	 executive action which operates to the prejudice of
any person  must have the authority of law to support it and
that the
     (1) [1967] 2 S.C.R.454
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_210">391</span>
terms of  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1678">Article 358</a> do not detract from that rule. <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1679">Article
358</a>,  according to this Court, did not purport to invest the
State  with  arbitrary	authority  to  take  action  to	 the
prejudice of citizens and others but it merely provides that
so long	 as the Proclamation of Emergency subsists, laws may
be enacted and executive action may be taken in pursuance of
lawful authority, which if the provisions of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1680">Article 19</a> were
operative would have been invalid.
</p><p id="p_828">     It is  important to  bear in  mind that  Bharat Singh's
case was  concerned with  a pre-emergency  law,	 though	 the
impugned order was passed thereunder during the operation of
emergency. The	law having  been passed	 in 1959,  which was
before the  declaration of  emergency, it had to comply with
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1681">Article 19</a>  and if  it did not, it was void to the extent of
the inconsistency. Since the law was held to be violative of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1682">Article 19</a>  it could  not claim any protection under Article
</p><p id="p_829">358. That  article lifts  restrictions on  legislative power
"while a proclamation of Emergency is in operation," that is
to say,	 it enables  laws to  be made  during the emergency,
ever if they conflict with <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1683">Article 19.</a> The executive is then
free to	 act under  those laws.	 But, if the law is void for
the reason  that having	 been made prior to the emergency it
violates <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1684">Article  19</a>, or if there is no law at all under the
purported authority  of which  the executive  has acted, the
executive action  is not  protected by	<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1685">Article 358.</a>  Bharat
Singh's case  is distinguishable  for the  additional reason
that it	 was only  concerned with  the effect of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1686">Article 358</a>
and no	question arose	therein with regard to any executive
action	infringing   a	fundamental  right  mentioned  in  a
Presidential order  issued  under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1687">Article  359(1).</a>  I	have
already indicated  the vital  difference between <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1688">Article 358</a>
and <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1689">Article  359(1).</a> The  latter bars the enforcement of any
fundamental  right  mentioned  in  the	Presidential  order,
thereby rendering  it incompetent for any person to complain
of its violation whether the violation is by the Legislature
or by the Executive. In other words, <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1690">Article 359(1)</a> bars the
remedy by  depriving an	  grieved  person of  his  locus  to
complain of the violation, of such of his fundamental rights
as are mentioned in the Presidential Order.
</p><p id="p_830">     Respondents  also	 relied	 in   support  of  the	same

359 the	 Constitution as  the President had declared a state
of emergency on October 20, 1962. This question was answered
in the negative on the ground that the executive order which
was immune  from attack	 is only  that order which the State
was competent  to make	but for	 the provisions contained in
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1694">Article	 19.</a>   Since  the  executive  action  of  the  State
Government was	invalid apart  from <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1695">Article  19</a>, it  was not
immune	from   attack  merely	because	 a  Proclamation  of
Emergency  was	 in  operation.	  The  important   point  of
distinction is	that in	 Ibrahim's case,  the impugned order
was not	 made under the authority reserved by the Defence of
India ordinance	 or the rules made thereunder but was issued
merely in  pursuance of	 the policy laid down by the Central
Government  in	 entrusting  the   distribution	  of   sugar
exclusively to	co-operative societies.	 In Bennett  Coleman
Company's case	the impugned Newsprint Control Policy was an
emanation of  the old  policy which  was enunciated prior to
the Proclamation of Emer ency. Relying on Ibrahim's case and
Bharat Singh's	case, this  Court held that <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1696">Article 358</a> does
not authorise  the taking  of detrimental  executive  action
during the emergency without any legislative authority or in
purported exercise of power conferred by a pre-emergency law
which was  invalid when	 enacted. The  decision	 in  Bennett
Coleman Company's case was followed in Meenakshi Mills' case
where the  executive action  taken during  the emergency did
not have  the authority	 of any	 valid law  and the impugned
orders having  been made  under a pre-emergency law were not
immune from attack under <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1697">Article 358.</a>
</p><p id="p_833">     Respondents relied	 on a  passage in  the	judgment  of
Ramaswami who  spoke  on  behalf  of  the  Court  in'  Chief
Settlement Commissioner, Rehabilitation Department, Punjab &amp;
Ors etc.  v. Om	 Parkash &amp; ors. etc.,(1) to the. effect that
whatever  legislative  Power  the  executive  administration
possesses must	be derived  directly from  the delegation of
the legislature and exercised validly only within the limits
prescribed. The	 Court emphatically  rejected the  notion of
inherent or  autonomous law-making  power in  the  executive
administration of  the country and observed that the rule of
law rejects  the conception  of	 the  Dual  State  in  which
governmental action  is placed	in a  privileged position of
immunity from  control by  law on  the ground  that  such  a
notion is  foreign to  our  basic  constitutional  connects.
Respondents also  relied upon  the  decision  of  the  privy

accordance with	 the British  jurisprudence no member of the

British subject	 except on the condition that he can support
the legality  of his  action before  a Court of Justice. Our
attention was repeatedly drawn to a further observation made
by Lord Atkin that it is a tradition of British justice that
judges should  not shrink  from deciding  such issues in the

noble and  eloquent but	 it was	 necessary to have regard to
the provision of our Constitution by which were governed and
which has  itself made	emergency  provisions  in  order  to
enable	the   nation  to  meet	the  challenge	of  external
aggression or internal disturbance. The principle enunciated
in  Eleko's   case,  however  lofty  and  stirring,  has  no
relevance here	because we  have to consider the meaning and
effect of  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1698">Article 359	(1)</a> which  has no  parallel  in	 the
English law.  Eleko's principle is unquestionably supreme in
times of  peace and  so is  the validity of the observations
made by	 Ramaswami J.  in Om  Prakash's case.  Both of those
cases were  concerned with  a totally different problem, the
problem of peace, not of war or internal disturbance.

be a  brooding and  omnipotent rule  of law  drowning in its
effervescence the emergency provisions of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_838">     The Advocate  General of  Gujarat had peculiar problems
to voice.  arising out	of the fluid and uncertain political
situation in  his State. He was unable to appreciate how the
Executive Government of the State could defy a parliamentary
mandate	 contained  in	the  MISA,  either  as	regards	 the
procedural or the substantive part of that law. Whatever may
be the	requirements of	 emergency he seemed to contend, the
Gujarat Government  could not,	save at	 grave peril  to its
existence,  defy  the  provisions  of  a  law  made  by	 the
Parliament. The	 anguish and  embarrassment of	the  learned
Advocate General is understandable, but the short, answer to
his contention	is that,  on the  record. the  Government of
Gujarat has  not been  asked to flout the MISA and indeed no
one can	 dispute the right of the State Government to ensure
compliance with	 the laws  of the  land. Indeed	 that is its
plain and foremost duty. The important consideration is that
in the	event of State Government coming to pass an order of
detention in violation of MlSA the detenu will have no right
to enforce  his Corresponding  fundamental right  if  it  is
mentioned in  the Presidential	order. The  learned Advocate
General built  his argument  as if.  during emergencies, the
executive is  under an	obligation to flout the law or the h
ind.  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1700">Article	359(1)</a>	neither	 compets  nor  condones	 the

372</a>  of	 the  Constitution,  since  those  rights  were	 not
repugnant to  any provision  of	 the  Constitution.  If	 the
fundamental right  to personal	liberty is  suspended by the
Presidential order,  the pre-Constitution laws will begin to
operate by  reason of  the their  of eclipse.  There  is  no
authority for  the proposition	that on	 the  conferment  of
fundamental rights  by the  Constitution, the  corresponding
pre-existing rights  Merged in	the fundamental	 rights	 and
that  with   the  suspension   of  fundamental	rights,	 the
corresponding  pre-existing   rights  also   got  suspended.
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1707">Article 21</a> is different in content from the common law right
to personal  liberty which  was	 available  against  private
individuals also. Since <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1708">Article 21</a> merely elevates the right
of personal  liberty to	 the status  of a fundamental right,
the pre-Constitution  rights  cannot  be  suspended  by	 the
Presidential order.  The object of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1709">Article 21</a> is to give and
not to	take. In  fact, the  very language  of that  Article
shows that  instead of	conferring  the	 right	to  personal
liberty, it  assumed its  existence in	the first  place and
then proceeded	by a  negative	provision  to  prohibit	 its
deprivation. Examples of such pre-Constitution rights are:
</p><p id="p_842">     (1) rights	 available under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1710">  the Indian  Penal Code</a> and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1711">
the Criminal Procedure Code</a>; (ii) rights available under the
law of	torts. especially  the rights to sue for damages for
false imprisonment.  and (iii)	the remedy  of habeas corpus
available under	 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1712">section 491</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1713"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>, since
the year 1923.

     (4) Non-fundamental  constitutional rights	 like  those
arising under Articles 256, 265 and 361(3) or natural rights
or contractual	rights or  the statutory  rights to personal
liberty	 are   not  affected   by  the	Presidential  order.
Statutory rights  can only  be taken  away in  terms of	 the
statute and  not by  an executive flat. By reason of Article
</p><p id="p_845">256.  the   executive  power  of  every	 state	must  ensure
compliance  with  the  laws  made  by  the  Parliament.	 The
executive power	 of the	 States must  therefore comply	with
<a href="/doc/1670784/" id="a_1714">section 56</a>  and <a href="/doc/571025/" id="a_1715">57</a>  of the  Criminal Procedure	Code  and  a
person aggrieved  by the  violation of	those provisions can
enforce his  statutory right to personal liberty in spite of
the Presidential  order. By <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_1716">Article 265</a> no tax can be levied
or collected  except by	 authority of law. A person affected
by the	violation of this provision can enforce his right to
property even  if <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1717">Article  19</a> is  suspended.  If  a  process
happens to  be issued  against the  Governor of	 a State  in
contravention of  <a href="/doc/1280300/" id="a_1718">Article 361(3</a>),  the Governor can exercise
his right to personal liberty despite the Presidential order
under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1719">Article  359(1) .</a>	 Similarly, in	cases not covered by
section 16A  of the  MISA, if the Advisory Board opines that
the detention  is unjustified,	the detenu  can	 compel	 the
Government  to	 accept	 that	opinion,  in  spite  of	 the
Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_846">     (5) Even  after the  passing of  a Presidential  order,
Parliament may	create new  rights to  personal liberty	 and
such rights  can be  enforced in  spite of  the Presidential
order.
</p><p id="p_847">     (6)  Civil	  liberty  or  personal	 liberty  is  not  a
conglomeration of position rights. It operates in an area of
free action and no law can possibly curtail it.
</p><p id="p_848">     (7)  If  a	 law  affecting	 the  fundamental  right  to
personal  liberty   is	void   for   want   of	 legislative
competence.,  it   can	be   challenged	 in   spite  of	 the
Presidential order
     (8) The  suspension of  the right	to enforce  personal
liberty cannot	confer a  licence on  executive officers  to
commit offences	 against the law of the land, and if they do
so, they can be brought to book in spite of the Presidential
order.
</p><p id="p_849">     I look  at the question posed by the respondents from a
different   angle.   The   emergency   provisions   of	 the
Constitution are  designed to  protect the  Security of	 the
State and  in order  to achieve that purpose, various powers
have been  conferred on	 the Parliament and the President by
Chapter XVIII  of the Constitution. One of such powers is to
be found in <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1720">Article 359(1)</a> under which the President, during
the  operation	 of  the   emergency,  can  issue  an  order
suspending the	right to  move any court for the enforcement
of all	or any	of the	fundamental rights conferred by Part
III. Proceedings  commenced prior to the issuance of such an
order, including proceeding s taken prior to the declaration
of the	emergency  itself,  automatically  remain  suspended
during the  emergency or  for such  shorter  period  as	 the
President may in his order specify. The object of empowering
the  President	to  issue  an  order  under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1721">Article  359(1)</a>
suspending the	enforcement of the right to personal liberty
conferred by Part III of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_215">396</span>
Constitution cannot  be to save all other rights to personal
liberty except	the one	 conferred by Part III, which to the
seems totally  devoid  of  meaning  and	 purpose.  There  is
nothing peculiar  in the  content of  the right	 to personal
liberty conferred  by Part  III	 so  that  the	Constitution
should provide	only for  the suspension  of  the  right  to
enforce that  particular kind  of right,  leaving all  other
rights to personal liberty intact and untouched. In times of
emergencies    the    executive,    unquestionably    though
unfortunately, is  constrained	to  take  various  forms  of
action in  derogation of  the rights of citizens and others,
including the  cherished  right	 to  personal  liberty.	 The
Constitution aims  at protecting  the executive,  during the
operation of  emergency, from attacks on the action taken by
it in  violation of  the rights of individuals. Accordingly,
in so  far as the right to personal liberty, for example, is
concerned one of the objects of the emergency pro visions is
to ensure  that no  proceeding will be taken or continued to
enforce	 that	right  against	 the  executive	 during	 the
operation of  the emergency. The executive is then left free
to devote  its undiluted  attention to meeting the threat to
the security  of the  State. This  purpose  cannot  ever  be
achieved by  interpreting <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1722">Article  359(1)</a> to mean that every
right to  personal liberty  shall be  enforceable and  every
proceeding involving  the enforcement  of such	right  shall
continue during the emergency, except to the extent to which
the right  is conferred by Part III of the Constitution, The
existence of  the right	 to personal  liberty  in  the	pre-
Constitution period  was surely	 known to  the makers of the
Constitution. The  assumption  underlying  the	respondent's
argument is that in spite of that knowledge, the Constituent
Assembly decided that all those rights will reign supreme in
their pristine glory even during the emergency and what will
remain in  abeyance is	only the enforcement of the right to
personal  liberty  conferred  by  Part	III.  The  right  to
personal liberty  has no  hallmark and	therefore  when	 the
right is  put in action it is impossible to identify whether
the right  is one  given by the Constitution or is one which
existed in the pre-Constitution era. If the arguments of the
respondents is	correct no  action to  enforce the  right to
personal liberty  can at all fall within the mischief of the
presidential order  even if  it mentions  Articles19, 20, 21
and  22	  because,  every   preliminary	 objection   by	 the
Government to  a petition  to enforce  the right to personal
liberty can  be effectively answered by contending that what
is' being  enforced is	either the natural right to personal
liberty or generally, the pre-Constitution right to personal
liberty. The  error of the respondents' argument lies in its
assumption, and	 in regard  to the  argument of	 some of the
counsel	 in   the  major   articulate  premise,	  that	 the
qualitative  content   of  the	non-constitutional  or	pre-
constitutional right  to personal  liberty is different from
the content  of the  right to  personal liberty conferred by
Part III  of the Constitution. The right to personal liberty
is the	right or the individual to personal freedom. nothing
more and  nothing less.	 That right along with certain other
rights was  elevated to the status of a fundamental right in
order that  it may  not be tinkered with and in order that a
mere majority should not be able to trample over it. <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1723">Article
359 (1)</a>	 enables the  President to  suspend the	 enforcement
even of	 those rights  which were sanctified by being lifted
out of the common morass of human rights. If the enforcement
of the fundamental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_216">397</span>
rights can  be suspended  during an emergency, it is hard to
accepts	  That the  right to  enforce non-fundamental rights
relating to the same subject matter should remain alive.
</p><p id="p_850">     <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1724">Article 359(1)</a>  contains three  important clauses:	 (1)
The Proclamation  of Emergency	must be	 in operation at the
time when  the President issues his order; (2) The President
must issue an order declaring the suspension of the right to
move any  court; and  (3) The  power  of  the  President  to
declare such  suspension can  extend to	 such rights only as
are conferred  by Part	III. If	 these three  conditions are
satisfied, no  person can move any court for the enforcement
of such of the rights conferred by Part III as are mentioned
in the Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_851">     The  first	  and  foremost	  question  to	ask  when  a
proceeding is  filed to	 enforce  a  right  as	against	 the
Government while a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation
is, whether the right is mentioned in the Presidential order
and whether  it is  the Kind of right conferred by Part III.
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1725">Article 21</a>,  for example,  confers the	right  to  life	 and
personal liberty.  The	power  of  the	President  therefore
extends under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1726">Article 359(1)</a> to the suspension of the right
to move	 any court  for the enforcement of the right to life
and personal  liberty.	The  President	cannot	suspend	 the
enforcement of	any right  unless that	right is included in
Part III which confers fundamental rights. The President, in
my opinion,  would be acting within the strict bounds of his
constitutional power if, instead of declaring the suspension
of the right to enforce the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1727">Article 21</a> he
were to	 declare that  "the right not to be deprived of life
and  personal	liberty	 except	  according   to   procedure
established  by	  law"	shall	remain	suspend	 during	 the
emergency.
</p><p id="p_852">     <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1728">Article 359  (1)</a> does not really contemplate that while
declaring the suspension of the right to move any court, the
President must or should specify the Article or the Articles
of the	Constitution the  enforcement of rights conferred by
which shall  be suspended. What <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1729">Article 359 (1)</a> contemplates
is that	 the President	can declare  the suspension  of	 the
right to  move any  court for  the enforcement cf the rights
mentioned in  Part III.	 The words  "conferred by  Part III"
which occur in <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1730">Article 359(1)</a> are not intended to exclude or
except from the preview of the Presidential order, rights of
the same  variety or  kind as  are mentioned in Part III but
which were  in existence prior to the Constitution or can be
said to	 be in existence in the post Constitution era, apart
from the  Constitution. The  emphasis of  the Article is not
the right  to suspend  the enforcement of the kind of rights
mentioned in  Part III and not on the fact that those rights
are conferred  by Part III. To put it differently. the words
''conferred by	Part III" are used only in order to identity
the particular	rights	the  enforcement  of  which  can  be
suspended by  the President  and not  in order	to impose  a
limitation on the power of' the President so as to put those
rights	which	exist  or   which  existed  apart  from	 the
Constitution, beyond  the reach	 of' the Presidential order.
The respondents by their petitions are enforcing their right
to personal  liberty and  that right is a right conferred by
or mentioned in Part III or the Consti
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_217">398</span>
tution. As  I have said above, if instead of saying that the
right to  enforce the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1731">Article 21</a> shall be
suspended the President were to say that the right not to be
deprived of  life or  personal liberty	except according  to
procedure established  by  law	will  remain  suspended,  no
argument of  the kind  made before  us could reasonably have
been made. The true effect of the Presidential order, though
worded in  the way it is, is the same as it would have been,
had it been worded in the manner I have indicated.
</p><p id="p_853">     It therefore  does not  make any difference whether any
right to  personal liberty  was in  existence prior  to	 the
enactment of  the Constitution,	 either by  way of a natural
right,	statutory   right,  common  law	 right	or  a  right
available under the law of torts. Whatever may be the source
of the	right and  whatever may	 be its	 justification,	 the
right in  essence and  substance is  the right	to  personal
liberty. That  rights having  been included in Part III, its
enforcement will  stand suspended  if it is mentioned in the
Presidential order issued under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1732">Article 359(1).</a>
</p><p id="p_854">     The view  which I have taken above as regards the scope
and meaning  of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1733">Article	 359(1)</a>	 affords  in  my  opinion  a
complete answer	 to the	 contention of	the respondents that
since <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1734">Article  21</a> is not the 1) sole repository of the right
to personal  liberty, the suspension of the right to enforce
the right  conferred by that Article cannot affect the right
to enforce the right of personal liberty which existed apart
from that Article. I have held that on a true interpretation
of the	terms of  the Presidential  order read	with <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1735">Article
359(1</a>), what  is suspended  is the  right to  move  for	 the
enforcement of	the right  to personal	liberty whether that
right is  conferred by Constitution or exists apart from and
independently of  it. Otherwise,  the Constitution  has only
done much ado about nothing.
</p><p id="p_855">     All the  same I  would like,  briefly, to deal with the
argument of  the respondents  on its own merit, particularly
the illustrations cited in support of that argument.
</p><p id="p_856">     It is  true that  in view	of the	decision in the Bank
Nationalisation case,(1)  the right conferred by Articles 21
and 19	cannot be  treated as  mutually exclusive.  But	 the
suspension of  the right  to enforce  the right	 of personal
liberty means  the suspension  of that	right wherever it is
found unless  its content  is totally  different as from one
Article to  another-. The "right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1736">Article 21"</a> is
only a description of the right of personal liberty in order
to  facilitate	 its  exact   identification  and   such   a
description cannot  limit the  operation of the Presidential
order to  those cases  only  where  the	 right	to  personal
liberty is claimed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1737">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_857">     The  circumstance	 that  the  pre-Constitution  rights
continued in  force after  the enactment of the Constitution
in view	 of <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1738">Article 372</a> does not make any difference to this
position because,  even	 assuming  that	 certain  rights  to
personal  liberty   existed  before   the  Constitution	 and
continued thereafter  as they  were  not  repugnant  to	 any
provision
     (1) [1970] 3 S. C. R. 530, 578
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_218">399</span>
of the	Constitution, all  rights to personal liberty having
the same  content as the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1739">Article 21</a> would
fall within the mischief of the Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_858">     The theory	 of 'eclipse'  has no  application  to	such
cases  because;	  that	theory	applies	 only  when  a	pre-
Constitution law  becomes  devoid  of  legal  force  on	 the
enactment of the Constitution by reason of its repugnancy to
any provision  of the  Constitution. Such  laws are not void
but they  are under  an eclipse	 so long  as the  repugnancy
lasts. When  the repugnancy  is removed, the eclipse also is
removed and he law becomes valid.
</p><p id="p_859">     As regards	 the doctrine  of 'merger' it is unnecessary
to go  to the  length of  saying that  every prior  right to
personal liberty  merged in  the right	to personal  liberty
conferred by  Part III.	 Whether it merged or not, it cannot
survive the  declaration of suspension if the true effect of
the Presidential  order is  the suspension  of the  right to
enforce all  and every	right to  personal liberty.  In that
view, it  would also make no difference whether the right to
personal liberty arises from a statute or from a contract or
from a constitutional provision contained in some Part other
than Part III.
</p><p id="p_860">     As regards	 the illustrations, it is neither proper nor
possible to  take each	one of	them separately	 and  answer
them. Hypothetical  illustrations cannot  establish a  point
and practical  difficulties have  to be	 solved as  and when
they arise.  But some  of the  more important  illustrations
taken by  the respondents'  counsel seem  to me	 to  have  a
simple answer.	For example,  when an accused challenges his
conviction for	murder and  the sentence of death imposed on
him for	 that offence, his remedy by way of an appeal is not
barred by  the Presidential  order because he is only trying
to get	rid of	a judgment which holds him guilty of murder.
It is  not he  who moved  the court for his personal liberty
but it	is the prosecution which dragged him to the court to
prove the  charge of  murder against  him. The	accused only
defends the charge of criminality whether it is in the trial
court or  in a	higher court.  Similarly,  if  a  person  is
wrongfully confined,  the prosecution of the offender is not
intended or calculated to secure the personal liberty of the
victim he  court may in proper cases pass an order releasing
the complainant	 from  wrongful	 confinement  but  the	true
object of  the prosecution  is to  punish the person who has
committed an  offence against  the penal law of the land. As
regards decretal  rights against  the Government,  what	 the
decree-holder enforces	in execution  is not  his  right  to
property. The  original cause of action Merges in the decree
and therefor  what is  put  into  execution  is	 the  rights
arising under  the decree.  The illustration  regarding	 The
issuance of  a process	against the Governor of a State need
not be	pursued seriously  because such	 an event  is hardly
ever likely  to happen	and id	it does,  the  gubernatorial
rights may  possibly withstand	the Presidential order under
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1740">Article 359(1)	.</a> As  regards the flouting of the opinion of
the Advisory  Board by	the Government,	 a writ	 of mandamus
compelling the Government to obey the mandate of the law may
perhaps stand  on a  different hooting as the very nature of
such a	proceeding is  basically different.  Lastly,  it  is
unrealistic  to	 believe  that	after  the  passing  of	 the
Presidential order suspending the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_219">400</span>
existing constitutional	 rights, Parliament would create new
rights to  personal liberty  so as  to nullify the effect of
the Presidential  order. The  easier way  for the Parliament
would be to disapprove of the Proclamation of emergency when
it is  placed before  it under	<a href="/doc/978335/" id="a_1741">Article 352(2)	(b)</a>  of	 the
Constitution or	 to disapprove	of  the	 Presidential  order
issued under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1742">Article 359(1)</a>  when it  is placed  before  it
under <a href="/doc/804833/" id="a_1743">Article 359(3)</a> of the Constitution. But as I have said
earlier, it  is difficult  to furnish  a  clear	 and  cogent
answer to  hypothetical illustrations.	In  the	 absence  of
necessary facts	 one can  only make  an ad  hoc answer, as I
have attempted	to do  regarding the  possible issuance of a
process against	 the Governor  of a State. Actually, <a href="/doc/1280300/" id="a_1744">Article
361(3)</a> speaks  of a "Process" for the arrest or imprisonment
of a Governor issuing from any court. Fundamental rights can
be  exercised	as   against   judicial	  orders   but	 the
circumstances in which such
 a process may come to be issued, if at all, may conceivably
affect the  decision of	 the question whether a presidential
order issued  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1745">Article  359(1)</a> can bar the remedy of an
aggrieved Governor.
</p><p id="p_861">     In so far as the illustrative cases go, I would like to
add that  <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_1746">Article 256</a> which was chosen by the respondents as
the basis  of an  illustration cases  not seem to confer any
right on  any individual.  That Article	 appears in  Part XI
which deals with relations between the Union and the States.
A failure  to comply  with <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_1747">Article  256</a> may  attract serious
consequences  but   no	court	is  likely  to	entertain  a
grievances at the instance of the private party that <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_1748">Article
256</a> has	 not been  complied with  by a	State Government. As
regards the claim to personal liberty founded on a challenge
to an  order on the ground of excessive delegation, I prefer
to express no firm opinion though the greater probability is
that such  a challenge	may fail  in face  of a Presidential
order of the kind which has been passed in the instant case.
</p><p id="p_862">     I have  held above	 that the  existence of	 common	 law
rights prior  to  the  Constitution  will  not	curtail	 the
operation of  the  Presidential	 order	by  excepting  those
rights from  the purview  of the  order. I  may add that the
decision of  this Court	 in <a href="/doc/594226/" id="a_1749">Dhirubha  Devisingh Gohil v. The
State of  Bombay</a>(1) is an authority for the proposition that
if  any	 pre-Constitution  right  has  been  elevated  as  a
fundamental right by its incorporation in Part III, the pre-
existing  right	  and  the   fundamental  right	 are  to  be
considered as  having been  grouped together  as fundamental
rights "conferred"  by the  Constitution.  The	decision  in
<a href="/doc/834589/" id="a_1750">Makhan Singh  v. State of Punjab</a>) also shows that once right
to obtain  a direction in the nature of habeas corpus became
in 1923 a statutory right to a remedy after the enactment of
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1751">section 491</a>  of the  Code of  Criminal Procedure, it was not
open to	 any party  to ask  for a writ of habeas corpus as a
matter of common law.
</p><p id="p_863">     It was  contended for  the respondents  that  the	High
Court have jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1752">Article 226</a> to issue writs and

<p id="p_866">fundamental rights  the High  Courts had the jurisdiction to
issue appropriate writs or directions upholding those rights
in spite  of the Presidential order. This argument cannot be
accepted because  the entire  claim of the resonants is that
the order  of detention	 are in violation of the MISA, which
in substance  means that  the respondents have been deprived
of their  personal liberty in violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1753">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution. By  that Article, no person can be deprived of
his life  or personal  liberty except according to procedure
established by law. The grievance of the respondents is that
they  have  been  deprived  of	their  personal	 liberty  in
violation of  the procedure established or prescribed by the
MISA. In  substance therefor  they are	complaining  of	 the
violation of  a fundamental  right, which  it is not open to

</p><p id="p_867">     This judgment,  long  as  it  is,	will  be  incomplete
without least  a brief	discussion of  some of the important
decisions of  this Court  which were  referred to during the
course of  arguments time  and again.  Before  doing  so,  a
prefatory observation seems called for. The Earl of Halsbury
L. C. said in Quinn v. Leathem(') that the generality of the
expressions which  may	be  found  in  a  judgment  are	 not
intended to be expositions of the whole law but are governed
and qualified  by the  particular facts of the case in which
such expression	 are to be found. This Court in the State of
orissa v.  Sudhansu  Sekhar  Misra  &amp;  Ors.(2)	uttered	 the
caution that  it is  not a  profitable	task  to  extract  a
sentence here and there from a judgment and to build upon it
because the  essence of	 the decision  is its  ratio and not
every observation  found therein.  Counsel have not done any
such shearing  but I  thought I	 might beging  the study  of
cases with I se1f-admonition.
</p><p id="p_868">     A decision of this Court on which the greatest reliance
was placed  by the  respondents is  <a href="/doc/834589/" id="a_1755">Makhan Singh v. State of
Punjab</a> (3)  The appellants  therein were detained under Rule
30(l ) (b) of the Defence of India Rules made by the Central
Government  under   section  3	 of  the  Defence  of  India
Ordinance, 1962.  They applied	for  their  release  to	 the
Punjab and  Bombay High Court under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1756">section 491(1)(b)</a> of the
Code of	 Criminal Procedure?  their  contention	 being	that
certain section	 of the	 Defence of India Act and Rule 30(l)
</p><p id="p_869">(b) of	the Defence  of India  Rules  were  unconstitutional
since  they   contravened  their  fundamental  rights  under
Articles 14,  21 and  22(4) (5) and (7) of the Constitution.
The High  Court held  that in view of the Presidential order
which was  issued on  November 3,  1962 under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1757">Art. 359(1)</a> of
the Constitution, the petitions of habeas corpusfiled by the
appellants  were  barred.  Being  aggrieved  by	 the  orders
dismissing their  petitions, the  detenus filed	 appeals  in
this  Court   which  were  heard  by  a	 Constitution  Bench
consisting of  7 Judges.  The judgment	of the	majority was

     Both the majority and the minority judgments agree that
the Presidential order would take away the right to move the
Supreme Court  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1758">Art.  32</a> and  the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1759">Art.
226</a> for	 the enforcement  of the  rights  mentioned  in	 the
order. But  while  the	majority  took	the  view  that	 the
petition under	<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1760">section 491</a>  of the  Criminal Procedure Code
was also  barred, Subha	 Rao J.	 held that  the petitioners'
right to  ask for  relief by  filing  an  application  under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1761">section 491</a> was not affected by the Presidential order. This
difference in  the view	 of the majority and the minority is
now of no consequence as <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1762">section 491</a> has ceased to be on the
Statute Book  after April  1, 1974  when  the  new  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1763">Code  of</a>

<p id="p_875">     After recording these conclusions the majority judgment
proceeded to consider the question as to which are the pleas
which are  open to  a person  to  take	in  challenging	 the
legality or  the propriety  of his  detention, either  under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1787">section 491</a>  (	I  )  (b)  or  under  <a href="/doc/452476/" id="a_1788">Art.  226(1  )  .</a>	 The
conclusions of the Court on this question are as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_231">	  (a)  "If  in	 challenging  the  validity  of	 his
	       detention order,	 the detenu  is pleading any
	       right outside  the rights  specified  in	 the
	       order, his  right to  move any  court in that
	       behalf  is   not	 suspended,  because  it  is
	       outside <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1789">Art.  359(1)</a> and consequently outside
	       the  Presidential  order	 itself."  (Emphasis
	       supplied) Accordingly if a detenu is detained
	       in violation  of the  mandatory provisions of
	       the Act	it would  be open  to him to contend
	       that his	 detention is  illegal. "Such a plea
	       is outside  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1790">Art. 359(1)</a>	and the right of the
	       detenu to  move for  his release	 on  such  a
	       ground cannot be affected by the Presidential
	       order.'`
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_232">	  (b)  The exercise  of a  power malafide  is wholly
	       outside the  scope of  the Act conferring the
	       power  and`   can  always   be	successfully
	       challenged.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_233">	  (c)  It is  only in  regard to that class of cases

	       bar would  be  inapplicable  and	 proceedings
	       taken on behalf of the detenu will have to be
	       tried in accordance with law.</blockquote>
<p id="p_876">	  (d)  If  a  detenu  contends	that  the  operative
	       provision  of  the  law	under  which  he  is
	       detained suffers	 from the  vice of excessive
	       delegation and  is, therefore. ill valid, the
	       plea thus  raised by the detenu cannot at the
	       threshold  be   said  to	 be  barred  by	 the
	       Presidential order.  In terms, it is not plea
	       which is	 relatable to the fundamental rights
	       specified in  the said  order. lt  is a	piea
	       which is	 independent of	 the said rights and
	       its validity  must be  examined. (The  Court,
	       however, rejected  the  contention  that	 the
	       impugned provisions  of the Act suffered from
	       the vice of excessive delegation.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_224">405</span>
     No judgment  can be  read as if it is a statute. Though
the judgment of the majority contain the conclusions set out
in (a)	to (d)	above, I see no doubt that these conclusions
owe their  justification to  the  peculiar  wording  of	 the
Presidential order  which was issued in that case. The order
dated November	3, 1962,  which was  the subject  matter  of
Makhan Singh's	case, has  been set  out at the beginning of
this judgment.	That order suspends the right of a person to
enforce the  rights conferred by Articles 14, 21 and 22 "if.
such person  has been  deprived of any such rights under the
Defence of  India Ordinance, 1962 (4 of 1962) or any rule or
order made  thereunder". The  Presidential order  dated June
27, 1975  with which  we are  concerned in  the instant case
docs not  contain ally	clause similar	to the one extracted
above from  the order  dated November 3, 1962. The inclusion
of that	 clause ill  the earlier  order	 has  a	 significant
impact on  the question	 under consideration  because, under
the earlier  Presidential order	 the right to Move the court
was taken  away only i-f a person was deprived of his rights
under the  Defence of  India ordinance	or under any rule or
order made under the ordinance. A petition for habeas corpus
file(l during  the operation of the Presidential order dated
November 3,  1962   was not  barred at the threshold because
the detenu was entitled to satisfy the court that though his
detention  purported  to  be  under  the  Defence  of  India
Ordinance or  the Rules	 it was	 in fact  not so. The detenu
could establish	 this  by  satisfying  the  court  that	 the
detaining authority  had no power to detain him, which could
be shown  by pointing  out that	 the pre-conditions  of	 the
power to  detain were not fulfilled. It was also open to the
petitioner to  establish that the order was vitiated by mala
fides because  a mala fide order has no existence in the eye
of law	and mala  fides would  take the	 order	out  or	 the
statute.
</p><p id="p_877">     The same  state of	 affairs  continued  under  the	 two
subsequent Presidential	 orders dated November 16, 1 974 and
December 23  , l974.  All the  three orders were conditional
and were  dependent for their application on the fulfillment
of the	condition that	the person concerned was deprived of
his rights  under the Defence of India ordinance or any rule
or order  made under  it. The Presidential order of June 27,
1975 makes  a conscious	 and deliberate	 departure from	 the
three earlier  orders, the object obviously being to deprive
the detenu  of the  argument that he has been detained under
an  order   only  purports  to	have  been  passed  under  a
particular Act	but is	ill fact  n derogation	thereof, the
terms of the Act having not been complied with. The order of
June 27, 1975 is not subject to ally condition-precedent for
its application	 and, therefore, there is no question of the
detenu satisfying  the court  that any	pre-condition of the
power  of   detention  has   not  fulfilled.   Some  of	 the
observations in	 Makhan Singh case may appear to support the
argument that  certain pleas  which are refferred to therein
are outside  the scope of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1794">Article 359(1)</a> itself. Which great
respect, those	observations really  mean that the pleas are
outside the  Presidential order.  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1795">Article 359(1)</a>  is only an
enabling provision  and the  validity of  a plea  cannot  be
tested which  reference to that Article. The right to move a
court for  the enforcement  of the  rights conferred by Part
III is not taken away by <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_1796">Article 359 (1)</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_225">406</span>
It is  the Presidenial	order passed  in  pursuance  of	 the
powers	conferred   by,	 that	Article	 by   which  such  a
consequence can be brought about.
</p><p id="p_878">     It would  be useful  in this connection to refer Lo the
decision of  this Court in <a href="/doc/1733535/" id="a_1797">Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia v. State of
Bihar &amp;	 ors.(') The</a>  appellant therein	 was  also  detained
under rule 30(l)(b) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962, and
he moved this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1798">Article 32</a> of the Constitution for
his release.  the petition  was argued	on the basis that it
was filed  for the  enforcement of  the	 right	to  personal
liberty under  Articles 21  and 22  of the  Constitution.  A
preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the Government
that the  petition was	barred by reason of the Presidential
order dated  November 3, 1962, the same as in Makhan Singh's
case  (supra)  Sarkar  J.,  who	 shared	 the  majority	view
repelled  the  preliminary  objection  by  saying  that	 the
petition could	have been  dismissed at the threshold if the
order of  November 3,  1962 were  to take away all rights to
personal liberty  under Articles 21 and 22. According to the
learned Judge,	the particular Presidential order did not do
so in  that, it	 was a	conditional order  which deprived  a
person of his right to move a court for the enforcement of a
right to  personal liberty  only if he was deprived of it by
the Defence of India Act or any rule or order made under it.
"If he	has not	 been so  deprived, the	 order does not take
away his  right to  move a  court." This  shows that  if the
first Presidential order was unconditional like the order in
the instant  case, Dr.	Lohia's	 petition  would  have	been
rejected by  this Court	 at the	 threshold. The	 judgment of
Hidayatullah J.,  who on  behalf of  himself and Bachawat J.
concurred with	the view  of Sarkar  J., also shows that the
conditional Presidential  order left an area of inquiry open
as to  whether the action was taken by a competent authority
and was	 in accordnce  with the Defence of India Act and the
rules made thereunder.
</p><p id="p_879">     Yet another  case arose  under  rule  30(l)(b)  of	 the
Defence of India Rules, 1962 involving the interpretation of
the first  Presidential order  dated November  3, 1962. That
case is	 <a href="/doc/1740805/" id="a_1799">K.  Anandan  Nambiar  &amp;  Anr  v.  Chief  Secretary,

Makhan Singh's	case and pointed out that the sweep of the..
Presidential order dated November 3, 1962 was limited by its
last clause  and, therefore,  it was  open to  the detenu to
contend that  the order	 of detention  was contrary  to	 the
conditions prescribed in that behalf by the Defence of India
Act or the rules made thereunder

Constitution for  an appropriate  direction and	 after	that
petition was  allowed by the A High Court, the Government of
Maharashtra filed an appeal in this Court. Subba Rao J., who
delivered  the	 judgment  of	the  Bench,  observed  while
dismissing the	appeal	that  the  President's	order  dated
November 3,  1962 was a conditional order and, therefore, if
a person  was deprived of his personal liberty not under the
Act or	a rule or order made thereunder but in contravention
thereof, his  right to	move the  court in that regard would
not be suspended.
</p><p id="p_880">     These judgments  bring out	 clearly the ratio of Makhan
Singh's case which arose out of the first Presidential order
dated November 3, 1962. The Presidential order with which we
are concerned in The instant case is not subject to the pre-
condition that	the detenu  should have been deprived of his
rights under  any particular Act and, therefore, there is no
scope for  the inquiry whether the order is consistent or in
conformity  with   any	particular   Act.   This   important
distinction has	 not been  fully appreciated  in some of the
judgments under appeal.
</p><p id="p_881">     The observations  contained in the majority judgment in
Makhan Singh's	case that  the exercise of a power mala fide
is wholly  outside the scope of the Act conferring the power
and can always be successfully challenged at once raises the
question whether  in spite  of the  Presidential order dated
June 27, 1975 it is open to the respondents to show that the
order of  detention in	any particular	case is	 vitiated by
mala fides.  The proposition  that a  mala fide order has no
existence in  the eye  of law  is  not	peculiar  to  Makhan
Singh's case  but has  been accepted in various decisions of
this Court,  two of them being <a href="/doc/610740/" id="a_1803">Jaichand Lall Sethia v. State
of West	 Bengal</a>	  or.(2), and  <a href="/doc/761361/" id="a_1804">Durgadas Shirali	 v. Union of
India &amp;	 ors</a>.(2) A  mala fide  exercise of  power  does	 not
necessarily imply  'any moral  turpitude and  may only	mean
that the  statutory power  is exercised	 for purposes  other
than those  for which  the power  was intended	by law to be
exercised.  In	view  of  the  fact  that  an  unconditional
Presidential order  of the  present kind  affects the  locus
standi	of   the  potitioner  to  move	any  court  for	 the
enforcement of	any of	his fundamental	 rights mentioned in
the order,  it would  not be  open to  him to  show that the
statutory power	 has been exercised for a purpose other than
the one	 duly appointed under the . So long as the statutory
prescription can  be seen  on the  face of the order to have
been complied  with, no further inquiry is permissible as to
whether the order is vitiated by legal mala fides.
</p><p id="p_882">     As regards	 mala fides  in the sence of malice-in-fact,
the same  position must	 hold good  because the Presidential
order operates	as a  blanket ban  on any and every judicial
inquisition into the validity of the detention order. Makhan
Singh's case  as also  Jaichand Lall  Sethia's and  Durgadas
Shirali's arose	 under the  Defence of India Rules, 1962 and
the relevant  Presidential order  which applied	 was the one
dated November	3, 1962 which, as stated above, was a condi-

appears on the very face of it to be actuated by an ulterior
motive, the  court would  have jurisdiction  to set it aside
because no  judicial inquiry  of any  sort is required to be
undertaken in  such a  case.  But  short  of  such  ex-facie
vitiation, any challenge to a detention order or. the ground
of actual mala fides is also excluded under the Presidential
order dated June 27, 1975.

Third Amendment Ordinance, 16 of 1975, with effect from June
29, 1975  must make a significant difference to the question

detaining authority  was under	an obligation  by reason  of
section 8(1)  of the  MISA to  communicate to the detenu the
grounds of  detention. The  only exception  was as stated in
<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_1806">section 8</a>  (2 ),  that	the  detaining	authority  need	 not
disclose facts	which it  considers to be against the public

of operation of Proclamation of Emergency issued on December
3, 1971	 and on	 June 25,  1975 or for a period of 12 months
from June 25, 1975 whichever period is the shortest. By sub-

whether the  detention	of  such  person  is  necessary	 for
dealing effectively with the emergency. the answer be in the
affirmative,  the   Government	is   required  to   make   a
declaration to	that effect  By sub-section (3), whenever an
order of detention is made under the Act after June 29, 1975
the officer making the order of detention or the appropriate
Government is  similarly required  to consider	whether	 the
detention  of	the  persons   is  necessary   for   dealing
effectively with  the emergency.  If  so  a  declaration  is
required to  be made  to that  effect. Sub-section (9)(a) of

that does  not mean  that the  grounds on which the order of

matters of  State which would be against the public interest
to disclose. Instead of leaving each individual matter to be
judged under  <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_1830">section 123</a> of the Evidence Act by the Head of
the Department	concerned, who	can  give  or  withhold	 the

much more  satisfactory to provide that they shall be deemed

compel any public officer to disclose communications made to
him in official confidence if the officer considers that the

to matters  of State. But these provisions do not constitute
an invasion  of the  High Court's jurisdiction under Article

ideologies, laws  will now  be silent  but in times when the
Nation is  believed to	be going  through great	 strains and
stresses, it  may be necessary to entrust sweeping powers to
the State.  And it is no smail comfort that those powers are
granted with  the consent  of the  Parliament. The people of
this country  are entitled  to expect  when they  go to	 the
ballot-box  that   their  chosen  representatives  will	 not
willingly suffer an erosion of the rights of the people. And
the Parliament.	 while arming  the executive  with great and
vast powers of Government, may feel fairly certain that such
powers will  be reasonably exercised. The periodical reviews
of detention orders. the checks and counter-checks which the
law provides and above all

the lofty  faith in democracy which ushered the birth of the

depriving a  few of their liberty for a temporary period has
to be to give to many the perennial fruits of freedom.

<p id="p_906">     BHAGWATI,	J.-These  appeals  by  special	leave  raise
issues of  gravest constitutional  importance.	They  affect
personal liberty which is one of our most cherished freedoms
and impinge  on the  rule of  law which	 is one of the great
principles that lies at the core of constitutional democracy
and gives  content to  it. Does	 a Presidential	 order under
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1859">Article 359</a>,  clause (1)  specifying <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1860">Article  21</a> silence the
mandate of  the law and take away personal liberty by making
it unenforceable  in  a	 court	of  law,  or  does  judicial
scrutiny  of  legality	of  detention  stand  untouched	 and
unimpaired, so	that, despite  such  Presidential  order,  a
person who  is illegally  detained can	seek his  freedom by
invoking  the	judicial  Process.  That  is  the  anodizing
question before the Court.
</p><p id="p_907">     The facts	giving rise to these appeals have been fully
set out	 in the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice and it
is not	necessary for  me to reiterate them as nothing turns
on the	facts. None of the writ petitions out of which these
appeals arise  has in  fact  been  finally  disposed  of  on
merits. Barring the writ petitions before the Rajasthan High
Court and  the Nagpur  Bench of the Bombay High Court, where
one  additional	 question  has	been  considered,  the	only
question that has been decided in these writ petitions is as
to their  maintainability. in view of the Presidential order
dated 27th  June, 1975	issued under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1861">Article 359</a>, clause (1)
of the	Constitution. The  High Courts	of Allahabad, Madhya
Pradesh, Andhra	 Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka and Rajasthan and
the Nagpur  Bench of the Bombay High Court before whom these
writ petitions	were heard  on the  preliminary issue  as to
maintainability, took  the view that the Presidential order,
dated  27th   June,   1975,   did   not	  wholly   bar	 the
maintainability of  these petitions,  but left	open certain
grounds of  challenge which  could yet	be urged against the
validity of  the order	of detention.  These different	High
Courts were  not  agreed  upon	what  were  the	 grounds  of
challenge which	 were thus available to an applicant despite
the Presidential  order dated  27th June,  1975. There	were
differences of	opinion amongst them, but for the purpose of
the present  appeals, it  is not necessary to refer to those
differences as	they are  not material.	 The Rajasthan	High
Court and  the Nagpur  Bench of	 the Bombay  High Court also
considered the	interpretation and  validity of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1862">section 16A</a>,
sub-section (9) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act,
1971  and  while  the  Rajasthan  High	Court  accepted	 the
interpretation of  that sub-section  canvassed on  behalf of
the  Government	  and  upheld  its  validity  even  on	that
interpretation, the  Nagpur Bench  of the  Bombay High Court
held the  sub-section to  be valid  by reading it down so as
not to exclude the power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1863">Article 226</a>
of the Constitution to call for the grounds, information and
materials on  which the	 order of detention was based. Since
in the	view of	 these High Courts, the writ petitions filed
by the	detenus were maintainable, though on certain limited
grounds	 of  challenge,	 each  of  the	writ  petitions	 was
directed to  be set  down for hearing on merits. There- upon
each of	 the aggrieved	State Governments  obtained  special
leave to  appeal against  the decision of the concerned High
Court and  that is  how the present appeals have come before
this Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_235">416</span>
<p id="p_908">     Two questions arise for consideration in these appeals.
They have  been formulated  by the  learned Attorney General
appearing on  behalf of	 the Union of India in the following
terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_244">	  (1)  Whether, in  view of  the Presidential  order
	       dated June  27,	1975  under  clause  (1)  of
	       <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1864">Article 359</a>,  any writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1865">Article
	       226</a> before  a High Court for habeas corpus to
	       enforce the  right to  personal liberty	of a
	       person detained under MISA on the ground that
	       the  order  of  detention  or  the  continued
	       detention is  for any reason, not under or in
	       compliance With MISA is maintainable ?
	  (2)  If such	a petition  is maintainable, what is
	       the scope  or extent  of	 judicial  scrutiny,
	       particularly,   in    view   of	 tile	said
	       Presidential order  mentioning,	inter  alia,
	       clause (5)  of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1866">Article 22</a> and also in view of
	       sub-section (9) of section 16A of MISA?</blockquote>
<p id="p_909">     So far  as the  second question is concerned, it may be
pointed out  straightaway that	the learned Attorney General
with his  usual candor conceded that if his first contention
in regard  to maintainability  of a writ petition for habeas
corpus is  not	accepted  and  the  writ  petition  is	held
maintainable, the area of judicial scrutiny would remain the
same as	 laid down  in the  decisions of this Court, subject
only to	 the qualification that the grounds, information and
materials, on  which the  order of detention is based, would
not be	available either  to the detenu or to the High Court
by  reason   of	 suspension  of	 enforcement  of  the  right
conferred by  clause (S)  of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1867">Article 22</a> and the enactment of
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1868">section 16A</a>,  sub-section (9) of the Maintenance of Internal
Security Act,  1971. The  only point which would, therefore,
require to  be considered  under the  second question  is in
regard to the interpretation and validity of sub-section (9)
of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1869">section 16A</a>.
</p><p id="p_910">     Before we	proceed to consider the first question which
turns  on   the	 true	interpretation	and  effect  of	 the
Presidential order  dated 27th	June, 1975, it would help to
place the  problem in  its proper  perspective if  we  first
examine what  is  an  emergency	 and  how  institutions	 and
procedures  different	from  those   in  normal  times	 are
necessary to  combat it.  It would  be both  profitable	 and
necessary to  embark upon this inquiry, because <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1870">Article 359</a>,
clause (1)  under which	 the Presidential  order dated	27th
June, 1975  has been  issued is	 a  consequential  provision
which comes  into operation when a Proclamation of emergency
is issued  by the President under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1871">Article 352.</a> It is evident
that a	national emergency  creates problems for a democracy
no  less   than	 for   other  governments.   A	totalitarian
Government   may    handle   such    a	 situation   without
embarrassment. But the apparent necessities evoked by danger
often conflict gravely with the postulates of constitutional
democracy. The question arises-and that was a question posed
by Abraham Lincoln on July 4, 1861: can a democ-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_236">417</span>
<p id="p_911">ratic  constitutional	government  beset   by	a   national
emergency be  strong enough  to maintain  its own  existence
without at  the same  time being so strong as to subvert the
liberties of  the people  it has  been instituted to defend.
This question is answered affirmatively by the incontestable
facts of  history if  we have  regard to  the experience  of
emergency governments  of three large modern democracies-the
United States,	Great Britain and France. There is no reason
why the	 Indian experience should be otherwise, if the basic
norms of constitutionalism in assumption of emergency powers
are observed. What are these basic norms in a constitutional
democracy and  what is	the  purpose  behind  assumption  of
emergency  powers   are	 matters  which	 I  shall  presently
discuss. But  before I do so, let me first consider what are
the different  types  of  emergency  which  may	 plague	 the
government of a country.
</p><p id="p_912">     There are	three types  of crisis	in  the	 life  of  a
democratic  nation,   three  well  defined  threats  to	 its
existence both	as nation  and democracy. The first of these
is war,	 particularly a	 war to repel invasion when "a State
must convert  its peace-time political and social order into
a war-time  fighting machine  and over-match  the skill	 and
efficiency of  the enemy". There may be actual war or threat
of war	or preparations	 to meet imminent occurrence of war,
all of	which may  create a  crisis situation of the gravest
order. The  necessity of  concentration of greater powers in
the Government	and of	contraction of	the normal political
and social  liberties cannot  be disputed  in such  a  case,
particularly when the people are faced with a grim horror of
national  enslavement.	 The  second  crisis  is  threat  or
presence of  internal subversion  calculated to	 disrupt the
life of	 the country  and jeopardize  the  existing  of	 the
constitutional government.  Such activity  may stem  from  a
variety of  causes. Perhaps the most common is disloyalty to
the existing  form of  government, often  accompanied  by  a
desire to effect changes by vio1ent means. Another cause may
be strong  disaffection with  certain  government  policies.
Communal demands for States within the Federal on linguistic
or religious  lines may	 fall within  this category.  Or the
presence  of  powerful	lawless	 elements  with	 perhaps  no
political motivation,  but for	various reasons	 beyond	 the
scope of  ordinary machinery  of the  law, may	give rise to
this problem.  The third crisis, one recognised particularly
in  modern   times  as	 sanctioning  emergency	  action  by
constitutional government,  is break down or potential break
down of	 the economy. It must be recognised that an economic
crisis is  as direct  a	 threat	 to  a	nation's  continuing
constitutional existence  as a	war or	internal subversion.
These are  three kinds	of emergencies	which may ordinarily
imperil the existence of a constitutional democracy.
</p><p id="p_913">     Now,  it	is  obvious   that  the	 complex  system  of
government  of	 a  constitutional   democratic	  State	  is
essentially  designed  to  function  under  normal  peaceful
conditions and	is often  unequal to  the  exigencies  of  a
national crisis. When there is an emergency arising out of a
national
 29-833 Sup CI/76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_237">418</span>
crisis, a  constitutional democratic  government has  to  be
temporarily altered to whatever degree necessary to overcome
the peril  and restore	normal conditions.  This  alteration
invariably involves  government of a stronger character. The
government has	to assume  larger power in order to meet the
crisis situation  and that  means that the people would have
fewer rights.  There can  be no doubt that crisis government
means strong  and arbitrary government and as pointed out by
Cecil Carr  in his  article on	"Crisis Legislation in Great
Britain" published  during the	Second	World  War  "in	 the
eternal dispute between Government and liberty, crisis means
more government	 and less  library." In	 fact Scrutton, L.J.
never a	 fulsome admirer of government departments, made the
classic remark	in his	judgment in Ronnfeldt v. Phillips(')
that war cannot be carried on according to the principles of
Magna Carta  and there	must be	 same  modification  of	 the
liberty of  the subject	 in the	 interests of the State. The
maxim salus populi suprema lex esto, that is publicsafety is
the highest  law of all, must prevail in times of crisis and
the people  must submit	 to temporary  abdication  of  their
constitutional liberties  in order  to enable the government
to combat the crisis situation which might otherwise destroy
the continued existence of the nation.
</p><p id="p_914">     While dealing  with the  emergency powers	which may be
assumed by  a constitutional  democracy to  deal effectively
with a	national crisis,  it is	 necessary to  refer to	 the
celebrated writ	 of habeas  corpus. It	is the most renowned
contribution of	 the English common law to the protection of
human liberty.	It is one of the most ancient writs known to
the Common  Law of  England. It	 is  a	writ  of  immemorial
antiquity "throwing  its roots	deep into the genius" of the
Common Law.  It is  not necessary to trace the early history
of this	 writ which  is to  be found in the decision of this
Court in  <a href="/doc/953550/" id="a_1872">Kanu Sanyal  v. District  Magistrate, Darjeeling &amp;
ors</a> (2)	 Suffice it  to state  that by the 17th Century this
writ had assumed great constitutional importance as a device
for impugning  the validity of arbitrary imprisonment by the
executive and by invoking it, a person unlawfully imprisoned
could secure  his release.  As pointed	out by Holdsworth in
Vol. 1 of his "History of English Law", "its position as the
most efficient	protector of  the liberty of the subject was
unquestioned after  the great  Rebellion". It  was for	this
reason that  men began	to assign as its direct ancestor the
clauses of  the Magna  Carta which  prohibited	imprisonment
without due  process  of  law.	This  may  not	be  strictly
accurate, but there can be no doubt that, far more effective
than any  other remedy,	 this writ  helped to  vindicate the
right of freedom guaranteed by the famous words of the Magna
Carta. The  decision in	 Darnel's case(3)  was a set-back in
the struggle  for liberty since it eroded to some extent the
effectiveness of  the writ  by taking the view that a return
that the arrest was "by the special command of the King" was
a good and sufficient return to the writ, which meant that a
lawful cause  of imprisonment was shown. But the Petition of
Right. 1627 overruled this decision by declaring such a case
of imprisonment to
 (1) 35 Times Law Reports 46.
</p><p id="p_915"> (2) [1973] 2 S.C C. 674.
</p><p id="p_916"> (3) (1627) 3 ST 1.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_238">419</span>
<p id="p_917">be unlawful.  In the  same way, it was enacted in the Habeas
Corpus A  Act, 1640  abolishing the  Star Chamber  that	 any
person committed  or imprisoned by order of the Star Chamber
or similar  bodies or  by the  command of the King or of the
Council should	have his  habeas  corpus.  There  were	also
various other  defects which were revealed in course of time
and with  a view  to remedying	those defects and making the
writ more efficient as an instrument of securing the liberty
of the	subject unlawfully detained, reforms were introduced
by the	Habeas Corpus Act, 1679, and when even these reforms
were found  insufficient, the  Habeas Corpus Act, 18 1 6 was
enacted by which the benefit of the provisions of the Habeas
Corpus Act,  1679 was  made  available	in  cases  of  civil
detention and  the judges were empowered to inquire into the
truth of  the facts  set out  in the return to the writ. The
machinery of  the writ was thus perfected by legislation and
it became  one of  the	most  important	 safeguards  of	 the
liberty of the subject and, as pointed out by Lord Halsbury,
L.C., in  Cox v. Hakes,(i) it has throughout "been jealously
maintained by  courts of  law as  a check  upon the  illegal
usurpation of  power by	 the executive	at the	cost of	 the
liege .
</p><p id="p_918">     Now, in the United States of America, the right to this
important writ	of habeas  corpus  by  means  of  which	 the
liberty of  a citizen is protected against arbitrary arrest,
is not	expressly declared  in the  Constitution, but  it is
recognised in  Article I,  Placitum 9,	clause	(2)  of	 the
Constitution which  declares that "The privilege of the writ
of habeas  corpus shall	 not be	 suspended, unless,  when in
cases of  rebellion  or	 invasion,  the	 public	 safety	 may
require	 it".	Cooley	in   his  "General   Principles	  of
Constitutional Law  in the U.S.A." points out: The privilege
of the	writ consists in this: that, when one complains that
he is  unlawfully imprisoned  or deprived of his liberty, he
shall be  brought without  delay before	 the proper court or
magistrate  for	  an  examination  into	 the  cause  of	 his
detention, and shall be discharged if the detention is found
to be  unwarranted. The suspension of the privilege consists
in taking  away this  right  to	 an  immediate	hearing	 and
discharge, and in authorising arrests and detentions without
regular process	 of law." The suspension of the privilege of
the writ  does not legalise what is done while it continues:
it merely  suspends for	 the time  being the  remedy of	 the
writ.
</p><p id="p_919">     The  decision   of	 Chief	 Justice  Taney	  in  ex  P.
Merryman(2) contains  the leading American discussion of the
suspension of  the writ	 of habeas  corpus  in	a  temporary
emergency. In  the spring  of 1861.  the eve of the American
Civil War,  President Lincoln  was confronted  by a state of
open insurrection  in the  State of  Maryland following	 the
fall of	 Fort Sumter  on April 15. Railroad communication to
the  northern	United	States	 had  been  severed  by	 the
Marylanders on	April 20 and the Sixth Massachusetts Militia
reached Washington  only after	fighting its way through the
City of	 Baltimore. In	these circumstances  and  under	 the
increasing threat  of secession,  President Lincoln issued a
Proclamation on	 April 27  authorising General Pinfield Scot
to suspend H
 (1) [1890] 15 A. C.506.
</p><p id="p_920"> (2) 17 Fed. Cas. 144 (C. C. D. Md. 1861).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_239">420</span>
<p id="p_921">the writ  of habeas  corpus "at	 any  point  on	 or  in	 the
vicinity of the military line which is now, or shall be used
between	 the   City  of	  Philadelphia	and   the  City	  of
Washington". Another  Proclamation of  July 2  extended this
power to  a similar  area between  Washington and  New York.
John Merryman  who  was	 a  Marylander	openly	recruited  a
company of  soldiers to	 serve in  the Confederate  Army and
became their drill master and in consequence he was arrested
by the army of Lincoln and held prisoner in Fort McHenry. He
applied for  a	writ  of  habeas  corpus  and,	despite	 the
Presidential authorisation  suspending the writ, the Supreme
Court presided	over by Chief Justice Taney granted the writ
on the	view that  the power to suspend the privilege of the
writ  is  a  legislative  power	 and  the  President  cannot
exercise it  except as	authorised by  law. History tells us
that President	Lincoln declined  to implement	the order of
the Supreme  Court and	this  would  have  led	to  a  major
constitutional crisis,	but the Congress hastened to resolve
the controversy	 by  enacting  legislation  authorising	 the
President to  suspend the  privilege of the writ whenever in
his judgment  the  public  safety  requires  it.  It  would,
therefore, be  seen that  even in  United States of America,
where personal liberty is regarded as one of the most prized
possessions of	man, the  Congress has	the power to suspend
the writ  of habeas corpus and this power has been exercised
in the past, though very sparingly.
</p><p id="p_922">     So also  in Great	Britain the  writ of  habeas  corpus
which, as  May points  out,  "is  unquestionably  the  first
security of  liberty" and  which "protects  the subject from
unfounded suspicions,  from aggressions	 of power"  has been
suspended, again  and again,  in periods of public danger or
apprehension. Parliament, convinced of the exigencies of the
situation, has	on several occasions suspended, for the time
being, the  rights of  individuals in  the interests  of the
State. This  of course	has had	 the effect  of	 arming	 the
executive with	arbitrary  power  of  arrest  by  making  it
impossible for	a person detained to secure his release even
if his	detention is  illegal.	It  has	 resulted  in  great
diminution  in	 the  interest	of  personal  freedom,	for,
suspension of  habeas corpus  is verily,  in  substance	 and
effect, suspension  of the right of personal liberty granted
in Magna Carta, But it has been justified on the ground that
whatever be  the temporary  danger of  placing such power in
the hands  of the Government, it is far less than the danger
with which  the constitution and the society are threatened,
or to  put it  differently "when  danger  is  imminent,	 the
liberty of  the subject	 must be sacrificed to the paramount
interests of the State". Moreover, on each occasion when the
writ of	 habeas corpus has been suspended, the suspension of
the writ has invariably been followed by an Act of Indemnity
"in  order   to	 protect   officials  concerned	  from	 the
consequences of any incidental illegal acts which they might
have committed	under cover of suspension of the propogative
writ". During  the period  of emergency,  many	illegalities
might have  been committed by the executive in order to deal
with a	crisis situation and all such illegalities have been
retrospectively legalised by an <a href="/doc/528544/" id="a_1873">Indemnity Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_923">     I may  now turn  to consider  the emergency  provisions
under  our   Constitution.  Unlike   many   of	 the   older
constitutions, our  Constitution speaks	 in  detail  on	 the
subject of emergency in Part XVIII. That Part
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_240">421</span>

<a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_1875">Article 360.</a>  A <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1876">Article	 352</a> enacts that if the President is
satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security
of India  or  of  any  part  of	 the  territory	 thereof  is
threatened,  whether   by  war	or  external  aggression  or
internal  disturbance,	he  may,  by  Proclamation,  make  a
declaration to that effect and such Proclamation is required
to be  laid before  each House of Parliament and approved by
resolutions of	both Houses  before the	 expiration  of	 two
months. It  is not  necessary that  there should  be  actual
occurrence  of	 war  or  external  aggression	or  internal
disturbance in order to justify a Proclamation of Emergency.
It is enough if there is imminent danger of any such crisis.
It will	 be seen  that this Article provides for emergencies
of the	first two  types mentioned  above. The third type of
emergency threatening  the financial  stability of  India or
any part thereof is dealt with in <a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_1877">Article 360</a> but we are not
concerned with	it and hence it is not necessary to consider
the provisions of that Article. So far as the emergencies of
the  first  two	 types	are  concerned,	 the  constitutional
implications of a declaration of emergency under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1878">Article 352</a>
are much  wider than  in the United States or Great Britain.
These are  provided for	 in the	 Constitution itself. In the
first place,  <a href="/doc/497125/" id="a_1879">Article 250</a> provides that while a Proclamation
of Emergency  is in  operation, Parliament  shall  have	 the
power to  make laws  for  the  whole  or  any  part  of	 the
territory of  India with  respect  to  any  of	the  matters
enumerated in  the State  List, which means that the federal
structure based on separation of powers is put out of action
for the	 time being.  Secondly, <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_1880">Article	 353</a>  declares	that
during the  time that Proclamation of Emergency is in force,
the executive  power of	 the Union  of India shall extend to
the giving  of direction  to any  State as  to the manner in
which the  executive power  thereof is	to be  exercised and
this provision	also derogates	from the  federal  principle
which forms  the basis of the Constitution. If there is non-
compliance by  any State  with the  directions given  by the
Union under <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_1881">Article 353</a>, such non-compliance may attract the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_1882">Article 356</a>  and 'President's  rule'  may  be
imposed under  that Article  and in  such event.  Parliament
may, under  <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_1883">Article 357</a>, clause (1), confer on the President
the power  of the  legislature of the' State to make laws or
to delegate  such legislative  power to any other authority.
This not  only contradicts the federal P principle, but also
strikes at  the root  of representative	 form of Government.
Then there  are two  Articles, <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1884">Article	358</a> and	 <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1885">Article 359</a>
which set out certain important consequences of Proclamation
of Emergency and they read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_245">	  "358. While  a Proclamation  of  Emergency  is  in
     operation nothing	in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1886">article  19</a>	shall  restrict	 the
     power of  the State  as defined in Part III to make any
     law or  to take  any executive  action which  the State
     would but	for the provisions contained in that Part be
     competent to  make or  to take,  but any  law  so	made
     shall, to the extent of the incompetency. cease to have
     effect as	soon as	 the Proclamation ceases to operate,
     except as	respects things	 done or  omitted to be done
     before the law so ceases to have effect.
	  "359. (1)  Where a Proclamation of Emergency is in
     operation, the  President may by order declare that the

     rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the
     order and	all proceedings pending in any court for the
     enforcement of  the rights	 so mentioned  shall  remain
     suspended for  the period during which the proclamation
     is in  force or  for such	shorter	 period	 as  may  be
     specified in the order.

     said Part	to make	 any law  or to	 take any  executive
     action which  the State  would but	 for the  provisions
     contained in that Part be competent to make or to take,
     but any  law so  made  shall,  to	the  extent  of	 the
     incompetency, cease to have effect as soon as the order

     House of Parliament."
</blockquote><p id="p_924">It may	be pointed out that clause (1A) did not form part of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1887">Article 359</a> when the Constitution was originally enacted but
it  was	  introduced  with   retrospective  effect   by	 the
Constitution (Thirty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1975. We are not
directly concerned  in these appeals with the interpretation
of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1888">Article  358</a> and clause (1A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1889">Article 359</a>, but in order
to arrive  at the proper meaning and effect of clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1890">Article 359</a>,  it will  be relevant  and somewhat  useful  to
compare and  contrast the  provisions  of  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1891">Article  358</a>	 and
clause (1A)  of <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_1892">Article 35</a> on the one hand and clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1893">Article 359</a> on the other.
</p><p id="p_925">     It would  be convenient  at this  stage to	 set out the
various steps  taken by the Government of India from time to
time in	 exercise of  the emergency  powers conferred  under
Part XVIII  of the  Constitution. When hostilities broke out
with  Pakistan	in  the	 beginning  of	December  1971,	 the
President issued  a  Proclamation  of  Emergency  dated	 3rd
December, 1971	in exercise  of the  powers conferred  under
clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1894">Article 352</a> declaring that "a grave emergency
exists whereby	the  security  of  India  is  threatened  by
external aggression".  This was	 followed by two orders, one
dated 5th  December, 1971 and the other dated 23rd December,
1974, issued  by the  President under  clause (1) of Article
</p><p id="p_926">359. It is not necessary to reproduce the terms of these two
Presidential orders  since they	 were subsequently rescinded
by a  Presidential order  dated 25th  December, 1975  issued
under  clause	(1)  of	  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1895">Article  359.</a>	  Whilst  the  first
Proclamation of	 Emergency dated 3rd December, 1971 based on
threat	of  external  aggression  continued  in	 force,	 the
President issued  another Proclamation	of  Emergency  dated
25th June,  1975 declaring  that "a  grave emergency  exists
whereby the  security of  India is  threatened	by  internal
disturbance". This Proclamation of Emergency was also issued
in exercise  of the  powers confer  red under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1896">Article	352</a>,
clause (1) and it was followed by a fresh Presi-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_242">423</span>
<p id="p_927">dential order  dated 27th  June, 1975  under clause  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1897">Article 359.</a>  A The  President, by  this  order	 made  under
clause ( l ) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1898">Article 359</a>, declared that "the right of any
person, (including  a foreigner)  to move  any court for the
enforcement of	the rights  conferred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1899">Article 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1900">Article
21</a> and	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1901">Article 22</a>  of the  Constitution and all proceedings
pending in  any court  for  the	 enforcement  of  the  above
mentioned rights  shall	 remain	 suspended  for	 the  period
during which  the  Proclamations  of  Emergency	 made  under
clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1902">Article	352</a> of	the Constitution  on the 3rd
December, 1971	and on	the 25th  June,	 1975  are  both  in
force". The  writ petitions out of which the present appeals
arise were  filed after the issue of this Presidential order
and it	was on	the basis of this Presidential order that it
was contended  on behalf  of the  State Governments  and the
Union  of   India  that	  the  writ   petitions	  were	 not
maintainable, since,  by  moving  the  writ  petitions,	 the
detenus sought	enforcement of	the right  of  conferred  by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1903">Article 21.</a>  This contention  was substantially negatived by
the High  Courts and  hence the present appeals were brought
by the	State Governments and the Union of India raising the
same contention	 as  to	 the  maintainability  of  the	writ
petitions. It  may be  pointed out  that whilst	 the present
appeals were pending before this Court, the President issued
another order  dated 8th  January, 1976	 under clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1904">Article	 359</a>   suspending  the	enforcement  of	 the  rights
conferred by  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1905">Article 19.</a>  This Presidential  order  is	 not
material, but  I have  referred to it merely for the sake of
completeness.
</p><p id="p_928">     Now the  orders of	 detention challenged by the detenus
in the	different writ	petitions were	all expressed  to be
made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the
Maintenance of	Internal Security  Act,	 1971.	The  detenus
challenged them	 on various  grounds, namely,  the orders of
detention were	not in accordance with the provisions of the
Act, they  were not  preceded by  the  requisite  subjective
satisfaction,  which  constitutes  the	foundation  for	 the
making of  a valid order of detention, they were actuated by
malice in  law or  malice in  fact or  they were outside the
authority conferred  by the  Act.  The	substance  of  these
grounds according  to the  Union  of  India  and  the  State
Governments, was  that, by  these orders  of detention,	 the
detenus, were  deprived of  their personal liberty otherwise
than in	 accordance with  the procedure	 established by law.
This  constituted   infraction	of   the  fundamental  right
conferred by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1906">Article 21</a>  and  the  writ  petitions  of	 the
detenus were, therefore, clearly proceedings for enforcement
of that fundamental right. But by reason of the Presidential
order dated 27th June, 1975, the right to move any court for
enforcement of the fundamental right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1907">Article 21</a>
was suspended  during the  period when	the Proclamations of
Emergency dated	 3rd December, 1971 and 25th June, 1975 were
in force  and, therefore, the detenus had no locus standi to
file the  writ petitions and the writ petitions were barred.
The answer to this contention given on behalf of the detenus
was-and here  we are  setting out  only	 the  broad  general
argument-that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1908">Article  21</a> merely  defines an  area  of	free
action and does not confer any right and hence it is outside
the scope  and ambit  of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1909">Article  359</a>,	clause	(  I  )	 and
consequently outside  the Presidential	order itself. It was
also urged  on behalf  of the  detenus that  it is  a  basic
principle of the rule of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_243">424</span>
law that  no member  of the executive can interfere with the
liberty of  a person  except in	 accordance  with  law.	 The
principle of  the rule of law was recognised and declared by
the Judicial  Committee of  the Privy  Council in  Eshugbayi
Eleko v.  Officer Administering the Government of Nigeria(l)
and it	was uniformly administered by courts in India as the
law of	the land  prior to  the coming	into  force  of	 the
Constitution.  It   was	 consequently  law  in	for  in	 the
territory of  India immediately	 before the  commencement of
the Constitution  and by reason of <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1910">Article 372</a>, it continued
in  force   ever  after	  the  coming	into  force  of	 the
Constitution  and   since  then	  it  has   been  repeatedly
recognised and	adopted by  this Court	as  part  of  Indian
jurisprudence in several decided cases. Moreover, apart from
being continued	 under <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1911">Article	372</a> as	law in	force,	this
principle of  the rule	of law stems from the constitutional
scheme itself which is based on the doctrine of distribution
of  powers   amongst  different	  bodies  created   by	 the
Constitution. Under  the constitutional scheme the executive
is a  limited executive and it is bound to act in accordance
with law  and not  go against  it. This	 obligation  of	 the
executive not  to act  to the  detriment of a person without
the authority  of law  can be  enforced under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1912">Article 226</a> by
issue of a writ "for any other purpose". When a detenu files
a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1913">Article 226</a> challenging the validity of the
order  of  detention  on  the  ground  that  it	 is  not  in
accordance  with   the	Act  or	 is  outside  the  authority
conferred by  the Act,	he seeks  to enforce this obligation
against	 the   State  Government   and	the   suspension  of
enforcement of	the fundamental	 right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1914">Article 21</a> does
not affect  the maintainability	 of his	 writ petition.	 The
detenus also  contended that  in  any  event  the  right  to
personal liberty was a statutory right and the suspension of
the fundamental	 right conferred  by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1915">Art.  21</a> did  not carry
with it	 suspension of	the enforcement	 of  this  statutory
right. The Union of India and the State Governments rejoined
to this	 contention of the detenus by saying that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1916">Article 21</a>
was the sole repository of the right of personal liberty and
there was  no common  law or statutory right in a person not
to be  deprived of his personal liberty except in accordance
with law,  apart from  that  contained	in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1917">Article  21</a>	 and
therefore, the	writ petitions	filed by the detenus were in
substance and  effect petitions for enforcement of the right
conferred  by	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1918">Article	 21</a>   and  hence   they	  were	 not
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_929">     Before we	proceed to  consider these contentions which
have been  advanced before  us, it  is necessary  to  remind
ourselves that the emergency provisions in Part XVIII of the
Constitution make no distinction whether the emergency is on
account of  threat to  the  security  of  India	 by  war  or
external aggression  or on account of threat to the security
of India  by internal  disturbance. The	 same provisions are
applicable  alike   in	 both	situations   of	  emergency,
irrespective of	 the reason  for which	emergency, has	been
declared.  The	 legal	consequences   are  the	  same	and,
therefore, whatever  interpretation we place on <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1919">Article 359</a>,
clause (1)  in the present case which relates to declaration
of emergency  on account of internal disturbance would apply
equally where the emergency is declared on account of war or
external aggression  by a hostile power. If we take the view
that the  Presidential order  under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1920">Article  359</a>, clause (1)
suspending enforcement of
     (1) [1931] A. C. 662.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_244">425</span>
<p id="p_930"><a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1921">Article 21</a>  does not  bar the remedy of a detained person to
seek his  release  on  the  ground  that  his  detention  is
illegal, it  would be open to a detained person to challenge
the legality  of his  detention even when there is emergency
on account  of war  or external aggression, because, barring
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1922">Article 359</a>, there is no other provision in the Constitution
which can even remotely be suggested as suspending or taking
away the  right to  move  the  Court  in  cases	 of  illegal
detention. The	consequence would be that even in a perilous
situation when	the nation  is engaged in mortal combat with
an enemy,  the courts  would be free to examine the legality
of detention  and even	if a  detention has  been  made	 for
efficient prosecution  of the  war or  protecting the nation
against enemy  activities it  would be	liable to  be struck
down by	 the courts  if some  procedural safeguard  has been
violated  though   it  may   be	 bona	fide   and   through
inadvertence. This  would imperil  national security and the
Government of  the day	would be helpless to prevent it. The
question is:  whether such  is the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1923">Article
359</a>, clause  (1). Of  course, if  that is  the only possible
interpretation, we  must give effect to it regardless of the
consequence, leaving  it to  the  constituent  authority  to
amend the  Constitution, if it so thinks fit. But we may ask
ourselves: could  the Constitution-makers have intended that
even in times of war or external aggression, there should be
no power in the President, as the head of the Nation, to bar
judicial scrutiny  into legality  of detention.	 It  may  be
pointed out  that even	in the United States of America, the
President has  power under  Article I Placitum 9, clause (2)
of the	United States  Constitution to suspend the privilege
of the	writ of habeas corpus "when in cases of rebellion or
invasion the  public safety  may require  it".	The  British
Parliament  has	 also  on  several  occasions  in  the	past
suspended  the	 writ  of   habeas  corpus   by	 legislative
enactment,  though   in	 limited   classes  of	 cases.	 The
Constitution-makers were  obviously aware that even in these
countries which	 are essentially democratic in character and
where the  concept of  constitutional government has had its
finest flowering,  the power  to exclude  judicial review of
legality of  detention through the means of a writ of habeas
corpus has been given to the Supreme legislature or the head
of the	State and  they must  have realised  that this was a
necessary power in times of national peril occasioned by war
or external  aggression. Could	the Constitution-makers have
intended to  omit to provide for conferment of this power on
the head of the State in our Constitution ?
</p><p id="p_931">     We must  also disabuse  our mind of any notion that the
emergency declared by the Proclamation dated 25th June, 1975
is not genuine, or to borrow an adjective used by one of the
lawyers appearing on behalf of the interveners, is 'phoney'.
This  emergency	 has  been  declared  by  the  President  in
exercise of  the powers	 conferred on him under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1924">Article 352</a>,
clause (1)  and the  validity of the Proclamation dated 25th
June, 1975  declaring this  emergency has  not been assailed
before US.  Mr. Shanti Bhushan and the other learned counsel
appearing on  behalf of	 the detenus in fact conceded before
us that,  for the  purpose of  the present  appeals, we	 may
proceed on  the assumption that the declaration of emergency
under the  Proclamation dated  25th June, 1975 is valid. But
if this emergency is taken as valid, we must equally presume
that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_245">426</span>
it is  genuine and  give full  effect  to  it,	without	 any
hesitation or reservation.
</p><p id="p_932">     With these	 prefatory observations	 I will	 now turn to
examine clause	(1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1925">Art. 359</a> under which the Presidential
order has  been issued. The language of this clause is clear
and  explicit	and  does  not	present	 any  difficulty  of
construction. It says that where a Proclamation of Emergency
is in  operation, the  President may  by order	suspend	 the
right to  move any  court for the enforcement of such of the
rights conferred  by Part  III as  may be  mentioned in	 the
order. Any  or all  of the  rights conferred by Part III can
find  a	  place	 in   the  Presidential	 order.	 Whilst	 the
Presidential order  is in  force, no  one can move any court
for the	 enforcement of	 any of	 the  specified	 fundamental
rights. I  shall presently discuss whether <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1926">Article 21</a> can be
said to	 confer any right, but assuming it does-and, as will
be evident  shortly, that is my conclusion-the right to move
any court  for the  enforcement	 of  the  fundamental  right
guaranteed by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1927">Article 21</a>  may be suspended by specifying it
in the	Presidential order.  When that	is done,  no one can
move any  court, and  any court	 would	mean  any  court  of
competent jurisdiction,	 including the	High Courts  and the
Supreme Court.,	 for enforcement  of the  right conferred by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1928">Article 21.</a>  The words	"the right to move any court for the
enforcement" are  wide enough "to include all claims made by
citizens in  any court	of competent jurisdiction when it is
shown that the said claims cannot be effectively adjudicated
upon without  examining	 the  question	as  to	whether	 the
citizen is,  in substance,  seeking to	enforce any  of	 the
specified fundamental rights". Vide Makhan Singh v. State of
Punjab(1). Therefore,  there can be no doubt that in view of
the  Presidential  order  which	 mentions  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1929">Article  21</a>,	 the
detenus would  have no	locus standi  to maintain their writ
petitions, if it could be shown that the writ petitions were
for enforcement of the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1930">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_933">     That  should   logically  take   me   straight   to   a
consideration of  the question	as to  what is the scope and
content of  the right  conferred by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1931">Art.  21</a>,	for  without
defining it,  it would	not be possible to determine whether
the right sought to be enforced by the detenus in their writ
petitions is  the right	 guaranteed under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1932">Article 21</a> or any
other distinct right. But before I examine this question, it
would be  convenient first  to	deal  with  clause  (1A)  of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1933">Article 359</a>  and ascertain  its meaning	 and effect.  Clause
(1A) of	 <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1934">Art. 359</a>  did not  find a place in the Constitution
when it	 was originally	 enacted, but  it was  inserted with
retrospective effect  by  the  Constitution  (Thirty-eighth)
Amendment Act,	1975. It  provides that	 while an order made
under cl.  (1) of  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1935">Article 359</a>	mentioning any of the rights
conferred by  Part III is in operation, nothing in that Part
conferring those  rights shall	restrict the  power  of	 the
State to  make any law or to take any executive action which
the State  would, but  for the	provisions contained in that
Part, be  competent to	make or	 to take. It will be noticed
that the  language of  cl. (1A)	 of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1936">Art.  359</a> is in the same

<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1938">Article 358</a>  would, therefore,	afford considerable guidance

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_246">427</span>
<p id="p_934">turn to	 those decisions, let me try to arrive at the proper
meaning of  that clause	 on a  plain interpretation  of	 its
language.
</p><p id="p_935">     In the  first place,  it is  clear that  clause (1A) of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1940">Art. 359</a>  is prospective in its operation, for it says that,
while a	 Presidential order  is in operation, nothing in the
Articles mentioned  in the Presidential order shall restrict
the power  of the  State to  make any  law or  to  take	 any
executive  action   which  the	State  would,  but  for	 the
provisions contained in Part III, be competent to make or to
take. This clause does not operate to validate a legislative
provision or  executive action	which was invalid because of
the constitutional  inhibition before  the  Proclamation  of
Emergency. Secondly,  it may  be noted	that the fundamental
rights operate	as restrictions	 on the	 power of the State,
which includes	the executive  as well	as the	legislature.
When a	Presidential order  is	issued	under  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1941">article	359</a>,
clause	(1),   the  fundamental	  right	 mentioned   in	 the
Presidential order  is suspended, so that the restriction on
the power of the executive or the legislature imposed by the
fundamental right  is lifted while the Presidential order is
in operation and the executive or the legislature is free to
make any  law or  to take any action which it would, but for
the provisions	contained in  Part III, be competent to make
or to  take. The  words "but for the provisions contained in
that Part",  that is,  but for the fundamental rights, means
"if the	 fundamental rights  were not  there". The  question
which has,  therefore, to  be asked  is: if  the fundamental
rights	were  not  there  in  the  Constitution,  would	 the
executive or  the  legislature	be  competent  to  make	 the
impugned law  or to  take the impugned executive action'? If
it could, it would not be restricted from doing so by reason
of  the	  particular  fundamental  right  mentioned  in	 the
presidential order. The Presidential order would, therefore,
have the  effect of  enlarging the power of the executive of
the legislature	 by freeing  it from the restriction imposed
by the	fundamental  right  mentioned  in  the	Presidential
order, but  it would  not  enable  the	legislature  or	 the
executive to  make any	law or	to take any executive action
which it was not otherwise competent to make or to take. Now
it is  clear that,  if the fundamental rights were not there
in the	Constitution, the  executive being  limited  by	 law
would still be unable to take any action to the prejudice of
a person  except by  authority of law and in conformity with
or in  accordance with	law  and,  therefore,  even  if	 the
Presidential order  mentions <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1942">Art. 21</a>, clause (1A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1943">Article
359</a> would  not enable  the executive  to deprive a person of
his personal  liberty without  sanction of law and except in
conformity with	 or in	accordance with	 law. If an order of
detention is  made by the executive without the authority or
law, it	 would be  invalid and	its invalidity	would not be
cured by  clause (1A)  of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1944">Article  359</a>, because	 that clause
does not  protect  executive  action  taken  without  lawful
authority. An  unlawful order  of  detention  would  not  be
protected from	challenge under	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1945">Article  21</a>  by  reason  of
clause (1A)  of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1946">Article 359</a> and the detenu would be entitled
to complain of such unlawful detention as being in violation
of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1947">Article  21</a>, except	in so  far as  his right to move the
court for  that purpose	 may be held to have been taken away
by clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1948">Article 359.</a>
</p><p id="p_936">     This interpretation  of clause  (1A) of  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1949">Article 359</a> is
clearly supported  by the decision of this Court in State of
Madhya Pradesh v.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_247">428</span>
<p id="p_937">Thakur	Bharat	 Singh(l)  and	 the  subsequent   decisions
following it,  which relate  to the  interpretation  of	 the
similarly  worded  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1950">Article  358.</a>  What	happened  in  Bharat
Singh's case  (supra) was  that whilst	the Proclamation  of
Emergency dated October 20, 1962 was in operation, the State
Government made	 an order under sub-section (1) of section 3
of the	Madhya Pradesh	Public Security	 Act, 1959 directing
that Bharat  Singh shall  not be  in  any  place  in  Raipur
District and  shall immediately	 proceed to  and  reside  in
Jhabua. Bharat	Singh challenged  the validity	of the order
inter alia  on the  ground that sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1951">section 3</a>
of the Act infringed the fundamental rights guaranteed under
clauses (d)  and (e)  of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_1952">Article 19(1).</a> The State Government
sought to  meet the challenge by pleading the bar of Article
</p><p id="p_938">358. But this Court held that <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1953">Article 358</a> had no application
because sub-section  (1) of  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1954">section 3</a>	of the Act which was
impugned in  the petition  was a  pre-emergency legislation.
This Court, speaking through Shah, J. observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_248">	  "<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1955">Article 358</a> which suspends the provisions of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1956">Art.
     19</a> during	an emergency declared by the President under
     <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_1957">Art.  352</a>	 is  in	  terms	  prospective:	 after	 the
     proclamation of  emergency nothing in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1958">Art. 19</a> restricts
     the power	of the	State to  make laws  or to  take any
     executive action which the State but for the provisions
     contained in  Part III  was competent  to make or take.
     <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1959">Article 358</a>  however does	not operate  to	 validate  a
     legislative provision  which was invalid because of the
     constitutional inhibition	before the  proclamation  of
     emergency."
</blockquote><p id="p_939">This Court accordingly proceeded to consider the validity of
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1960">section 3</a>,  sub-section (1)  of the Act and held that clause
</p><p id="p_940">(b) of that sub-section was unconstitutional as it infringed
the fundamental	 rights under  clauses (d)  and (e)  of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_1961">Art.
19(1)</a> and  if it  was  void  before  the    proclamation  of
Emergency, "it was not revived by the Proclamation".
</p><p id="p_941">     But on this view, another contention was put forward on
behalf of the State Government and that was that <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1962">Article 358</a>
protects not  only legislative	but  also  executive  action
taken after  the Proclamation  of Emergency  and, therefore,
executive action  taken by  the State would not be liable to
be  challenged	 on  the   ground  that	  it  infringes	 the
fundamental rights  under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1963">Art.	19</a>,  and  consequently,	 the
order of  the State  Government, though	 made under void law
was  protected	 against  challenge   under  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1964">Art.  19.</a>	This
contention was	also rejected  by the Court in the following
words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_249">	  "In our  judgment, the  argument involves  a grave
     fallacy. All  executive action  which operates  to	 the
     prejudice of  any person  must have authority of law to
     support it,  and the  terms of  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1965">Art. 358</a> do not detract
     from that	rule. <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1966">Article 358</a> does not purport to invest
     the State	with arbitrary	authority to  take action to
     the prejudice  of	citizens  and  others  .  it  merely

<blockquote id="blockquote_250">     gency subsists  laws  may	be  enacted,  and  executive
     action may	 be taken  in pursuance of lawful authority,
     which if the provisions of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1967">Art. 19</a> were operative would
     have been invalid.
</blockquote><p id="p_942">The view  taken by  the Court  was that	 it  is	 only  where
executive action  ii taken  in pursuance of lawful authority
that it is immune from challenge under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1968">Art. 19</a> and in such a
case even  if  it  conflicts  with  the	 fundamental  rights
guaranteed under  that Article,	 it would be valid But where
executive action  is taken  without lawful authority, as for
example, where	it is taken without the authority of any law
at all	or in  pursuance of  a law  which is void, it is not
protected from challenge under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1969">Art. 19</a> by <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1970">Article 358</a> and it
would be void to the extent it violates <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1971">article 19.</a>
</p><p id="p_943">     The same  view was	 taken by  this	 Court	in  <a href="/doc/264147/" id="a_1972">District
Collector of  Hyderabad v.  M/s Ibrahim	 Co</a>.(1)	 where	this
Court said,  without referring	expressly to the decision in
Bharat Singh's	case (supra)  that i'  the  executive  order
immune from  attack is	only that  order which the State was
competent, but	for the	 provisions contained  in Art 19, to
make", and  that "executive  action of the State Government,
which is otherwise invalid, is not immune from attack merely
because the  Proclamation of  Emergency is in operation when
it is taken". The reference here was to immunity from attack
under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1973">Art.  19</a> and  it was  held that executive action which
was contrary to law and hence invalid was not protected from
attack under  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1974">Art. 19</a>  by reason  of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1975">Art.  358.</a> So  also  in
<a href="/doc/125596/" id="a_1976">Bennett Coleman	 &amp; Co.	v. Union  of  India</a>(2),	 this  Court
referred to  the decisions in Bharat Singh' case (supra) and
Ibrahim's case (supra) and observed: "Executive action which
is  unconstitutional   is  immune   during  Proclamation  of
Emergency. During  the Proclamation  of Emergency <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1977">Art. 19</a> is
suspended.  But	  it  would  not  authorise  the  taking  of
detrimental executive  action during the emergency affecting
fundamental  rights  in	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1978">Art.  19</a>  without  any	 legislative
authority or  any purported  exercise of  power conferred by
any pre-emergency  law which was invalid when enacted". This
Court also  said to the same effect in <a href="/doc/1758272/" id="a_1979">Shree Meenakshi Mills
Ltd. v.	 Union of  India</a>(3): "-if  it can  be shown that the
executive action taken during the emergency has no authority
of a  valid law,  its constitutionality	 can be challenged".
These observations  clearly show that where executive action
is taken  without any  legislative authority or in pursuance
of a law which is void it would not be protected by <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1980">Art. 358</a>
from   challenge   under   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1981">Art.	  19</a>   and   it	  would	  be
unconstitutional to  the extent	 to which  it conflicts with
that Article.
</p><p id="p_944">     If this  be the interpretation of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_1982">Art. 358</a> as laid down
in  the	  decisions  of	  this	Court,	a  fortiori  a	like
interpretation must be placed on clause (1A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1983">Art. 359</a>, as
both are  closely similar  in form  as well  as language. It
must, therefore,  be held  that even  though a	Presidential
order issued  under clause  (1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1984">article 359</a> mentions <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1985">Art.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_249">430</span>
<p id="p_946">authority or  in other	words, the  detention is without the
authority of law, whether by reason or there being no law at
all or	by reason  of the  law under  which the detention is
made being  void, clause ( 1A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1986">Art. 359</a> would not protect
it from	 challenge under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1987">Art. 21</a> and it would be in conflict
with that  Article. The	 only question then would be whether
the detenu  would be  entitled to  challenge the validity of
tile detention	as being  in breach  of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1988">Art.  21</a>, in view of
clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_1989">Art.  353</a> read  with the	 Presidential  order
mentioning <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1990">Art. 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_947">     Now, at  the outset,  a  contention  of  a	 preliminary
nature was  advanced by Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned Advocate
appearing on  behalf of some of the detenus, that clause (1)
of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1991">article 359</a> can have no operation in cases where a detenu
seeks  to   enforce  his   right  of   personal	 liberty  by
challenging  the  legality  of	his  detention.	 Mr.  Shanti
Bhushan contended,  and in  this contention  he was strongly
supported by  Mr. Jethmalani, that personal liberty is not a
conglomeration of  positive rights  but is merely a negative
concept denoting  an area  of free  action to  the extent to
which law  does not  curtail it or authorise its curtailment
and such  a negative  right cannot by its very nature be the
subject of conferment under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1992">Art. 21.</a> The argument of counsel
based on  this contention  was that when <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1993">Art. 359</a> clause (1)
speaks of suspension of "the right to move any court for the
enforcement of	such of	 the rights conferred by Part III as
may be	mentioned in the order", it cannot include reference
to the	right of  personal liberty in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1994">article 21</a>, because it
cannot be  said of such a right that it is conferred by art.
</p><p id="p_948">21.  It	  was  urged   that  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1995">article   21</a>  cannot  therefore
appropriately find  a place  in a  Presidential order  under
clause (l)  of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1996">article	359</a> and	 even if  it is	 erroneously
mentioned there;  it can  have no  legal sequitur and cannot
give rise  to the  consequences set  out in  clause  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1997">article 359.</a>  This argument  was sought	 to be	supported by
reference to two well known text books on jurisprudence, one
by Salmond  and the  other by Holland and the Declaration of
the Rights  of Man  and the  Citizen adopted  by the  French
National Assembly  was also  relied upon  for this  purpose.
There is,  however, no	merit in  this argument.  The  words
'rights conferred  by Part III' cannot be read in isolation,
`nor can  they be  construed by	 reference to theoretical or
doctrinaire considerations. They must be read in the context
of the	provisions enacted in Part III in order to determine
what are  the rights  conferred by  the provisions  in	that
Part. Part  III is headed ''Fundamental Rights" and it deals
with fundamental  rights under seven heads, namely, right to
equality, right	 to  freedom,  right  against  exploitation,
right to  freedom  of  religion,  cultural  and	 educational
rights,	 right	to  property  and  right  to  constitutional
remedies. Arts.	 19 to	22 occur under the heading "Right to
Freedom" and  what is enacted in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1998">Art. 21</a> is a right, namely,
the right to life and personal liberty. It is true that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1999">Art.
21</a> is couched in negative language, but it is axiomatic that
to confer  a right it is not necessary to use any particular
form of language. It is not uncommon in legislative practice
to use	negative language  for conferring  a right.  That is
often done  for lending greater emphasis and strength to the
legislative enactment.	One instance may be found in<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2000"> s. 298</a>,
sub-s. (1)  of the  Government	of  India  Act,	 1935  which
provided that  no subject  of His Majesty domiciled in India
shall on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_250">431</span>
grounds only  of religion, place of birth descent, colour or
any of	them A	be ineligible  for office under the Crown in
India, or  be prohibited on any such grounds from acquiring,
holding	 or   disposing	 of  property  or  carrying  on	 any
occupation, trade,  business or profession in British India.
Though this  provision was couched in negative language, the
Judicial Committee  of the  Privy Council in <a href="/doc/208970/" id="a_2001">Punjab Province
v. Daulat  Singh</a>(1) construed  it as  conferring a  right on
every subject of His Majesty, domiciled in India. B
     Similarly, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2002">Art.  14</a> also  employs negative language and
yet it	was construed to confer a fundamental right on every
person within  the territory  of India,	 S.  R.	 Das,  C.J.,
pointed out  in <a href="/doc/761967/" id="a_2003">Basheshar Nath v. The Commissioner of Income
Tax, Delhi &amp; Rajasthan</a>(2) that it is clear from the language
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2004">Art.	 14</a> that "The command of that Article is directed to
the State  and the reality of the obligation thus imposed on
the State  is the  measure of  the fundamental	right  which
every person  within the  territory of	India is  to enjoy."
(emphasis supplied).
</p><p id="p_949">     <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2005">Article 31</a>,  clause (1)  is also  couched	in  negative
language: it  is almost	 in the	 same form  as	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2006">Article	 21.</a>
Speaking about	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2007">Article 31</a>,  S. R. Das, J. Observed in <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_2008">State
of Bihar  v. Maharajadhiraj  Kameshwar Singh of Dharbhanga &amp;
ors</a>.(3). "It  confers a	 fundamental right  in so  far as it
protects  private  property  from  State  action.  The	only
limitation put upon the State action is the requirement that
the authority of law is prerequisite for the exercise of its
power to deprive a person of his property. This confers some
protection on the owner, in that, he will not be deprived of
his property save by authority of law and this protection is
the measure  of the  fundamental right.	 It is	to emphasise
this immunity from State action as a fundamental right (that
the clause  has been  worded in	 negative language  . .	 . "
(emphasis supplied)  If <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2009">Article	 31 (1</a>), by giving a limited
immunity from  State action, confers a fundamental right, it
should follow  equally on a parity of reasoning that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2010">Article
21</a> also	 does so. In fact, this Court pointed out in so many
terms in  <a href="/doc/525184/" id="a_2011">P. D. Shamdasani v. Central Bank of India Ltd</a>.(4):
that clause  (1) of-<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2012">Art. 31 "</a>is a declaration of fundamental
right of private property in the same negative form in which

is deprived  of	 his  personal	liberty	 otherwise  than  in
accordance with	 the procedure	established by law and there
is infringement	 of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2022">Art.  21</a>,	such  person  would  not  be
entitled to  move the  Supreme Court  for a  writ of  habeas
corpus under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2023">Art. 32</a>, for that Article is available only for
enforcement of	the rights conferred by Part III. That would
be a  startling consequence, as it would deprive the Supreme
Court of  a wholesome  jurisdiction to	protect the personal
liberty of  an individual  against illegal detention. Let it
not be	for gotten that the Supreme Court has exercised this
jurisdiction in	 a large  number of  cases over	 the last 25
years and  set many  detenus at	 liberty where it found that
they  were   illegally	detained.   All	 this	exercise  of
jurisdiction in the past would be rendered illegal and void.
Ever since  the commencement of the Constitution, this Court
has always regarded <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2024">Article 21</a> as conferring the fundamental
right of  personal liberty  which can  be enforced  in	this
Court by  a petition  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2025">Article  32</a>  and  there  is  no
justification  for   departing	from   this   well   settled
constructional position.
</p><p id="p_959">     What then	is the	scope and  ambit of this fundamental
right conferred	 by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2026">Article  21 ?</a>  The first  question	that
arises in  this connection  is:	 what  is  the	meaning	 and
content of  the word  'personal liberty'  in this  Article ?
This question  came up	for consideration  before a Bench of
six judges  of this Court in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. &amp;
Ors.(1).   The majority judges took the view "that 'personal
liberty' is  used in  the Article  as a	 compendious term to
include within	itself all  the varieties of rights which go
to make	 up the 'personal liberties' of man other than those
dealt with  in the  several of	clauses of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_2027">Article 19(1).</a> In
other words,  while  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_2028">Article  19(1)</a>  deals  with  particular
species or attributes of that freedom, 'personal liberty' in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2029">Article 21</a> takes in and comprises the residue". The minority
judges, however	 disagreed  with  this	view  taken  by	 the
majority and  explained	 their	position  in  the  following
words: "No  doubt the  expression 'personal  liberty'  is  a
comprehensive one  and	the  right  to	move  freely  is  an
attribute of  that freedom personal liberty. It is said that
the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty
and, therefore, the expression 'personal liberty' in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2030">Article
21</a> excludes  that attribute.  In our  view, this  is  not  a
correct approach.  Both are  independent fundamental rights.
though there  is overlapping.  There is	 no question  of one
being carved  out of  another. The fundamental right of life
and personal  liberty have  many attributes and some of them
are found  in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2031">Article  19.</a> If  a person's  fundamental right
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2032">Article 21</a> is infringed, the State can rely upon a law
(1) [1964] 1 S. C. R. 332.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_252">433</span>
<p id="p_960">to sustain  the action, but that cannot be a complete answer
unless the  said law satisfies the test laid down in <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_2033">Article
19(2)</a> so  far as the attributes covered by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_2034">Article 19(1)</a> are
concerned." There  can be  no doubt  that  in  view  of	 the
decision of  this Court	 in R.	C. Cooper's case (supra) the
minority view  must be	regarded as correct and the majority
view must  be held  to have  been overruled. No attribute of
personal liberty  can be  regarded as having been carved out
of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2035">Article  21.</a> That  Article  protects	 all  attributes  of
personal liberty  against  executive  action  which  is	 not
supported by law. lt is not necessary for the purpose of the
present appeals	 to decide  what those	attributes are or to
identify or  define them.  It is  enough to  say that when a
person is detained, there is deprivation of personal liberty
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2036">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_961">     Now <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2037">Article  21</a> gives protection against deprivation of
personal liberty  but what  is the nature and extent of this
protection ?  In the  first place, it may be noted that this
protection is  only against  State action  and	not  against
private individuals.  <a href="/doc/525184/" id="a_2038">Vide P.  D. Shamdasani v. Central Bank
of India  Ltd</a>. (supra)	and <a href="/doc/829084/" id="a_2039">Smt.  Vidya Verma  v.  Dr.	Shiv
Narain</a>(l). Secondly,  it is  clear from the language of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2040">Art.
21</a> that	 the protection it secures is a limited one. It says
and I  am quoting  here only  that part of the Article which
relates to  personal liberty,  that no one shall be deprived
of his	personal liberty  except by the procedure prescribed
by law.	 The meaning  of the  word 'law'  as  used  in	this
Article came to be considered by this Court in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_2041">A. K. Gopalan
v. State  of Madras</a>(2) and it was construed to mean 'enacted
law' or	 'State law'.  Kania, C.J., observed: "It is obvious
that-law must  mean enacted  law", and	to the	same  effect
spoke Patanjali	 Sastri, J.,  when he  said: "In  my opinion
'law' in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2042">Art. 21</a>  means 'positive  or State made law' ". So
also Mukherjee,	 J., said  that his  conclusion was that "in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2043">Art. 21</a>	 the word  'law' has been used in the sense of State
made law",,and	Das J.	too expressed  the view	 that law in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2044">Art. 21</a> must mean State made law. The only safeguard enacted
by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2045">Article  21</a>,	 therefore,  is	 that  a  person  cannot  be
deprived  of   his  personal  liberty  except  according  to
procedure prescribed by 'State made law. If a law is made by
the State  prescribing the  procedure for depriving a person
of his personal liberty and deprivation is effected strictly
in accordance  with such  procedure, the terms of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2046">Article 21</a>
would be satisfied and there would be no infringement or the
right guaranteed under that Article.
</p><p id="p_962">     Now, based	 on the	 phraseology  "except  according  to
procedure established by law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2047">Article 21</a>, an argument was
advanced on  behalf of	the detenus  that it  is only  where
procedure prescribed  by the  law as  not been	followed  in
making the  order of  detention that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2048">Article 21</a> is attracted
and the	 right conferred by that Article is breached and not
where an  order of detention is made without there being any
law at	all or	where there  is a law, outside the authority
conferred by  it. It  was  urged  that	where  an  order  of
detention is challenged as mala
(1) [1955] 2 S. C. R. 983.
</p><p id="p_963">(2) [1950] S. C. R. 88.
</p><p id="p_964">833 SCI/76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_253">434</span>
fide or as having been made without the requisite subjective
satisfaction, the  challenge would  not be  on the ground of
breach of  the procedure  prescribed by the Act but it would
be on  the ground that the order of detention is outside the
authority of  the Act  and such	 a challenge  would  not  be
covered by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2049">Article 21.</a>	 This argument	is, in	my  opinion,
wholly	unsustainable.	 It  is	  clear	 on   plain  natural
construction of	 its language  that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2050">Article  21</a> imports	 two
requirements:  first,	there  must  be	 a  law	 authorising
deprivation of personal liberty, and secondly, such law must
prescribe a  procedure.	 The  first  requirement  is  indeed
implicit  in  the  phrase  "except  according  to  procedure
prescribed by  law". When  a law  prescribes a procedure for
depriving a  person of	personal liberty, it must a fortiori
authorise such	deprivation. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2051">Article  21</a> thus  provides both
substantive as	well  as  procedural  safeguards.  This	 was
pointed out  by Patanjali  Sastri, J.  in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_2052">A.  K. Gopalan  v.
State of  Madras</a> (supra) at page 195 of the Report where the
learned Judge said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_252">	  "If <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2053">article  21</a> is  to be  understood as providing
     only procedural  safeguards, where	 is the	 substantive
     right to  personal liberty	 of non-citizens to be found
     in the  Constitution  ?  Are  they	 denied	 such  right
     altogether ?  If they  are to have no right of personal
     liberty, why  is the procedural safeguard in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2054">article 21</a>
     extended to  them ?  And where is that most fundamental
     right of  all, the	 right to  life, provided for in the
     Constitution? The truth is that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2055">article 21</a>,-presents an
     example of	 the fusion  of procedural  and	 substantive
     rights in	the same  provision-the first  and essential
     step  in  a  procedure  established  by  law  for	such
     deprivation  must	 be  a	 law  made  by	a  competent
     legislature authorising such deprivation."
</blockquote><p id="p_965">Mahajan, J. also pointed out in the same case at page 229 of
the Report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_253">	  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2056">Article 21</a>,  in my  opinion, lays down substantive
     law as  giving protection	to life and liberty inasmuch
     as	 it   says  that  they	cannot	be  deprived  except
     according to the procedure established by law; in other
     words, it means that before a person can be deprived of
     his life  or liberty  as a	 condition  precedent  there
     should exist  some substantive law conferring authority
     for doing	so and	the law should further provide for a
     mode of procedure for such deprivation."</blockquote>
<p id="p_966">     S. R.  Das, J.  too spoke	in the	same strain  when he
negatived  the	 argument  "that   personal  liberty   as  a
substantive right  is protected by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_2057">Article 19(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2058">article
21</a> gives  only an  additional protection  by prescribing the
procedure according  to which that right may be taken away."
It would,  therefore, be  seen that  both the  safeguards of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2059">Article 21</a>,  substantive as  well as  procedural, have to be
complied with in order that there should be no infraction of
the right  conferred by	 that Article.	Where there is a law
authorising deprivation of personal liberty, but a person is
detained otherwise  than in  conformity with  the  procedure
prescribed by such law, it would clearly constitute
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_254">435</span>
violation of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2060">Article 21.</a>  And so also there would be breach
of Article  A 21, if there is no law authorising deprivation
of personal  liberty and  yet a person is detained, for then
the substantive	 safeguard provided  in the Article would be
violated. Therefore,  when a  detenu challenges	 an order of
detention made	against him  on the  ground that  it is mala
fide  or   is  not  preceded  by  the  requisite  subjective
satisfaction, such  challenge would fall within the terms of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2061">Article 21.</a> B
     It is also necessary to point out two other ingredients
of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2062">Article  21.</a> The  first is  that there must not only be a
law authorising	 deprivation of	 personal liberty, but there
must also  be a	 procedure prescribed  by law,	or in  other
words, law  must prescribe a procedure. Vide observations of
Fazal Ali, J. at page 169, Patanjali Sastri, J. at page 205,
Mahajan, J.  at pages  229 and 230 and S. R. Das, J. at page
319 of	the Report  in A  . K.	Gopalan's case	(  supra)  .
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2063">Article 21</a>,  thus, operates  not merely	 as a restriction on
executive action  against deprivation  of  personal  liberty
without authority  of law, but it also enacts a check on the
legislature by	insisting that	the  law,  which  authorises
deprivation, must  establish a procedure. What the procedure
should be  is not  laid down in this Article, but there must
be some	 procedure and	at the least, it must conform to the
minimal requirements  of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_2064">Article  22.</a> Secondly, 'law' within
the meaning  of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2065">Article	 21</a> must be a valid law and not only
must  it   be  within  the  legislative	 competence  of	 the
legislature enacting  it, but  it must also not be repugnant
to any	of the	fundamental rights  enumerated in  Part III.
Vide Shambhu  Nath Sarkar v. The State of West Bengal(1) and
<a href="/doc/679149/" id="a_2066">Khudiram Das v. The State of West Bengal &amp; ors</a>.(2).
</p><p id="p_967">     It was contended by Mr. Jethmalani on behalf of some of
the  detenus   that  when   a  Presidential  order  suspends
enforcement of the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2067">Art. 21</a>, its effect is
merely	to   suspend  enforcement   of	the   aforesaid	 two
ingredients and,  therefore, the  only claims which a detenu
is interdicted from enforcing, whilst the Presidential order
is  in	 operation,  are:   (1)	 that  the  law	 authorising
deprivation does  not prescribe a procedure, and (2) that it
does not  impose  reasonable  restrictions  on	the  freedom
guaranteed  under   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2068">Art.  19.</a>  This  contention	 is  plainly
erroneous and  does not	 need much argument to refute it. In
the  first   place,  the  requirement  that  the  law  which
authorises deprivation	of personal  liberty should not fall
foul of	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2069">Article 19</a>,  or for  the matter  of that,  with any
other fundamental  right set  out in  Part  III,  is  not  a
requirement of	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2070">Article 21</a>,  but it is a requirement of Art.
</p><p id="p_968">13. Secondly,  the effect  of suspension  of enforcement  of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2071">Article 21</a> by the Presidential order is that no one can move
any court  for a  enforcement of the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2072">Art.
21</a>, whilst the Presidential order is in operation. The right
conferred by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2073">Article 21</a>  is the right not to be deprived of
personal liberty except according to procedure prescribed by
law. Therefore,	 when the executive detains a person without
there being any law at all authorising detention or if there
is  such   law,	 otherwise   than  in  accordance  with	 its
provisions, that  would clearly be in violation of the right
conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2074">Art. 21</a> and such vio-

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_255">436</span>
<p id="p_971">lation would  a fortiori toe immune from challenge by reason
of the	Presidential order:  It must  follow inevitably from
this that  when a detenu challenges an order of detention on
the ground that it is mala fide or is not in accordance with
the provisions	of the	Act  or	 is  outside  the  authority
conferred by  the Act,	he would  be seeking  to enforce the
right of personal liberty conferred on him under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2075">Art. 21</a> and
that would be inhibited by the Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_972">     That takes	 me to a consideration of the concept of the
rule of	 law on	 which so much reliance was placed on behalf
of the	detenus in  order to  save their writ petitions from
the lethal  effect of the Presidential order. The contention
on behalf  of the detenus was that their writ petitions were
for enforcement	 of the	 right of the personal iiberty based
on the	principle of  the rule	of law	that  the  executive
cannot interfere  with the  liberty of	a person  except  by
authority of  law and  that was not within the inhibition of
the Presidential  order.  The  question	 is:  what  is	this
principle of  the rule	of law	and does  it exist under our
Constitution  as  a  distinct  and  separate  constitutional
principle, independently and apart from <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2076">Article 21</a>, so as to
be capable  of enforcement  even when enforcement of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2077">Article
21</a> is suspended by the Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_973">     The Great	Charter of  Liberties of  England,  commonly
known as the Magna Carta, was granted under the seal of King
John in the meadow called Runnymede on 15th June, 1215. This
was followed  within a	couple of years by a revised version
of the	Charter which was issued in the name of Henry III in
1217 and  ultimately with slight amendments, another Charter
was re-issued  by Henry	 III in	 1225 and  that document has
always been  accepted as  containing the  authorised text of
Magna Carta.  Whenever reference  is made to Magna Carta, it
is to  the Charter  of 1225.  which is	also described as "9
Henry III  (1225)".  Magna  Carta,  according  to  Sir	Ivor
Jennings symbolises  "what we  should now  call the  rule of
law,  government   according  to   law	 or   constitutional
government" which  means that all power should come from the
law and	 that "no  man, be  he king  or minister  or private
person is  above the law". It recognised that "the liberties
of England,  which means  the liberties	 of  all  free	men-
depended on the observance of law by King, lord and commoner
alike", and  "without law  there is  no liberty".  Cap. XXIX
contains the famous clause of the Magna Carta which provided
that: "No  free	 man  shall  be	 taken,	 or  imprisoned,  or
dispossessed, of  his free  tenement, or  liberties, or free
customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed;
nor will  we condemn  him, nor will we commit him to prison,
excepting by the legal judgment of his peers, or by the laws
of the	land." Thus  for the  first time the great principle
was enunciated-though even before, it was always part of the
liberties of  the subject-that no one shall be imprisoned or
deprived of  his liberty  except by the authority of the law
of the	land. The power of the King to arrest a person or to
deprive him of his liberty was circumscribed by law. That is
why Bracton  said about the middle of the 13th Century "-the
king himself ought not to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_256">437</span>
under man  but under  God and under the law, because the law
makes A	 the King.  Therefore, let the King attribute to the
law what  the law  attributes to  the King, namely, lordship
and power,  for there  is no king where will governs and not
law". Magna  Carta was	confirmed again	 by  the  successive
kings on the insistence of Lords and commons and the rule of
law embodied in Magna Calla governed the actions of the King
vis-a-vis his  subjects. But this great principle of liberty
was placed  in jeopardy in the 17th Century when a claim was
made by	 the King  that he had a prerogative right to arrest
and detain  subject and this prerogative right was necessary
for the	 defence of the Realm. When the King sought to raise
moneys	from  the  subjects  without  the  sanction  of	 the
Parliament, it	was resisted  by Darnel	 and others and they
were on that account committed to prison under the orders of
the King.  On the  application of these persons, who were so
imprisoned, a writ of habea corpus was issued and the return
made to	 it on	behalf	of  the	 King  was  that  they	were
imprisoned per speciale mandate Domini Regis (1627 St. Tr. 1
warnel's case).	 This return  was considered  sufficient and
the writ  was discharged.  The effect  of this	decision was
that King  needed no  authority of law in order to deprive a
subject of  his personal  liberty. But	the  Parliament	 was
quick to  nullify this	decision by enacting the Petition of
Right, 1628  and it reaffirmed the right to personal liberty
in <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2078">section  3</a> of  that Act  and declared  such	a  cause  of
imprisonment  to   be  unlawful.   The	principle  that	 the
Executive cannot  interfere with  the liberty  of a  subject
unless such  interference is  sanctioned by the authority of
law was thus restored in its full vigour.
</p><p id="p_974">     Blackstone in  his Commentaries on the Laws of England,
vol. 1,	 4th ed. p. 105 stated the principle in these terms:
E
	  "-the	 law   of  England   regards,  asserts	 and
     preserves the  personal liberty  of  individuals.	This
     personal liberty  consists in  the power of locomotion,
     of changing  situation, or	 removing  one's  person  to
     whatsoever place  one's own inclination may direct, for
     imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law-
     It cannot	ever be	 abridged at  the mere discretion of
     the magistrate, without the explicit per mission of the
     laws. Here again, the language of the Great Charter is,
     that no  free man	shall be taken or imprisoned, but by
     the lawful judgment of his equals, or by the law of the
     land." (emphasis supplied)
Since then,  the validity  of this  principle has never been
doubted and  the classical statement of it is to be found in
the oft	 quoted passage	 from the  judgment of Lord Atkin in
Eshugbayi (Eleko) v. Officer Administering the Government of
Nigeria (supra) where the learned Law Lord said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_254">	  "The Governor	 acting	 under	the  ordinance	acts
     solely under executive powers, and in no sense a Court.
     As the.  executive he  can only act in pursuance of the
     powers given  to him by law. In accordance with British
     jurisprudence no  member of the executive can interfere
     with the liberty or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_257">438</span>
     property of  a British  subject except on the condition
     that he can support the legality of his action before a
     Court of  Justice. And  it is  the tradition of British
     justice that  Judges should  not shrink  from  deciding
     such issues in the face of the executive."
</blockquote><p id="p_975">Since in  this country	prior to  the  commencement  of	 the
Constitution, we  were administering  British jurisprudence,
this constitutional  principle was  equally applicable here.
That was  the direct  result of the binding authority of the
decision of  the Privy	Council in  the aforementioned case.
But quite  apart from  that, the  courts in  India uniformly
accepted this constitutional principle as part of the law of
the  land.  Vide  Secretary  of	 State	for  <a href="/doc/1591621/" id="a_2079">India  v.	Hari
Bhanji</a>(1) and  <a href="/doc/1954356/" id="a_2080">Province of  Bombay v.  Khushaldas Advani</a>(2).
Bose, J.,  in P.  K. Tare v. Emperor(3) quoted with approval
the aforesaid  passage from  the judgment  of Lord Atkin and
pointed out  that before  the executive	 can claim  power to
override the  rights of	 the subject  "it must show that the
legislature has	 empowered it  to do  so". The learned Judge
also referred  to the  following passage from the dissenting
judgment of  Lord Atkin in Liversidge v. Anderson(4) "It has
always been  one of  the pillars  of  freedom,	one  of	 the
principles of liberty for which, on recent authority, we are
now fighting that the Judges are no respecter of persons and
stand between the subject and any attempted encroachments on
his liberty by the executive; alert to see that any coercive
action is  justified  in  law."	 (emphasis  supplied),	and,
pointing out that Lord Macmillan and Lord Wright also agreed
with this  principle,  observed	 that  these  principles  of
liberty "to  which Lord Atkin refers, apply as much to India
as elsewhere".	So also	 in Vimlabai Deshpande v. Emperor(5)
the same  two passages,	 one from the judgment of Lord Atkin

in Liversidge's	 case (supra) were referred to with approval

of Lord	 Atkin in  Eshugbayi Eleko's case (supra) and relied
on the	decision in  Jitendranath Ghosh's  case (supra)	 and
particularly the observations from the judgment in that case
which I	 have just  reproduced. These  observations  clearly
show that in our country, even in pre-constitution days, the
executive was  a limited  executive, that  is, an  executive
limited by law and it could act only in accordance with law.
B
     It would  be seen	from the above discussion that, even
prior to the Constitution, the principle of rule of law that
the executive  cannot act  to  the  prejudice  of  a  person
without the  authority of  law was recognised as part of the
law of	the land  and  was  uniformly  administered  by	 the
courts. It  was clearly	 'law in  force' and  ordinarily, by
reason of <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_2081">Article 372</a>, it would have continued to subsist as
a distinct  and separate  principle of	law even  after	 the
commencement of	 the Constitution. But when the Constitution
was enacted,  some aspects  of this principle of rule of law
were   expressly   recognised	and   given   constitutional
embodiment  in	different  Articles  of	 the  Constitution..
Thereafter they	 did not  remain in  the realm	of unwritten
law. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2082">Article  21</a> enacted one aspect of the principle of rule
of law that executive cannot deprive a person of his life or
personal liberty  without  authority  of  law  and  added  a
requirement that  the law  which authorises such deprivation
must prescribe	a procedure. Another aspect of the principle
of rule	 of law	 was enacted  in clause	 (1) of	 <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2083">Article 31.</a>
namely, that  no one  shall be deprived of his property save
by authority of law. That is why it was pointed out by Shah,
J. in  R .C. Cooper's case (supra) that "Clauses (1) and (2)
of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2084">Article  31</a> subordinate  the exercise of the power of the
State to  the basic  concept of	 the rule  of law".  A third
aspect was  constitutionailsed	in  various  sub-clauses  of
clause	(1)   of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2085">Article  19</a>  inhibiting  executive  action
unsupported by	law, which  conflicted	with  the  different
freedoms guaranteed  in these  sub-clauses. Then <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_2086">Article 265</a>
recognised and	enacted a yet fourth aspect, namely, that no
tax shall  be levied and collected without authority of law.
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2087">Article 19</a>,  clause (1),  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2088">Article 21</a>, <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2089">Article 31</a>, clause (1)
and  <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_2090">Article  265</a>  thus	 embody	 different  aspects  of	 the
principle of  rule of law. We are concerned in these appeals
only with  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2091">Article 21</a>  and, therefore,	I shall	 confine  my
discussion only to that Article.
</p><p id="p_984">     Now, to  my mind,	it is clear that when this principle
of rule of law that the executive cannot deprive a person of
his liberty  except by	authority of  law, is recognised and
embodied as  a fundamental  sight and  enacted	as  such  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2092">Article 21</a>,  it is  difficult to  comprehend  how  it  could
continue  to   have  a	 distinct  and	separate  existence,
independently and  apart from  this Article  in which it has
been given  constitutional vesture.  l fail  to see  how  it
could continue	in  force  under  <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_2093">Article  372</a>	when  it  is
expressly recognized  and embodied as a fundamental right in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2094">article 21</a>  and finds  a place	in the express provisions of
the Constitution.  Once this  principle	 is  recognised	 and
incorporated in	 the Constitution  and forms  part of it, it
could  not  have  any  separate	 existence  apart  from	 the
Constitution, unless  it were  also enacted  as a  statutory
principle by some positive law of the State. This position
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_259">440</span>
indeed become  incontrovertible when  we notice	 that, while
recognising and	 adopting this principle of rule of law as a
fundamental right,  the Constitution  has defined  its scope
and ambit  and imposed	limitation on  it in  the  shape  of
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2095">Article 359A</a>,  clauses (1)  and (1A). When the constitution-
makers have  clearly intended  that  this  right  should  be
subject to the limitation imposed by <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2096">Article 359</a>, clause (1)
and (1A), it would be contrary to all canons of construction
to  hold   that	 the   same   right   continues	  to   exist
independently, but  free  from	the  limitation	 imposed  by
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2097">Article 359</a>, clauses (1) and (1A). Such a construction would
defeat the object of the constitution-makers in imposing the
limitation under  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2098">Article 359</a>, clauses (1) and (1A) and make
a mockery  of that  limitation. The  consequence of  such  a
construction would be that, even though a Presidential order
is issued  under clause	 (1) of	 <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2099">Article 359</a>  suspending the
right to  move	the  court  for	 enforcement  of  the  right
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2100">Article 21</a>, the detenu would be entitled to
ignore the Presidential order and challenge the order of the
detention on  the ground  that it is made otherwise, than in
accordance with	 law, which  is precisely the thing which is
sought to  be interdicted  by the  Presidential	 order.	 The
Presidential order would in such case become meaningless and
ineffectual. Can  an interpretation  be accepted which would
reduce	to   futility  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2101">Article	 359</a>,  clause	(l)  in	 its
application  in	  relation  to	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2102">Article  21   ?</a>  Could	 the
constitution-makers have  intended such	 a meaning? The only
explanation which  could be offered on behalf of the detenus
was that  the object of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2103">Article 359</a>, clause (1) is merely to
prevent a person from moving the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2104">Article
32</a> for enforcing the right of personal liberty and it is not
intended to  effect the enforcement of the right of personal
liberty based  on the  rule of	law by moving the High Court
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2105">Article	 226.</a>  But   this  explanation	 is   wholly
unconvincing.  It   is	difficult   to	understand  why	 the
constitution-makers should  have intended  to bar  only	 the
right to  move the  Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_2106">Article 37</a> in so far
as the.	 right of personal liberty is concerned. There would
be no  point in preventing a citizen from moving the Supreme
Court directly	under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2107">Article  32</a> for  securing his  release
from illegal  detention, while	at the	same time leaving it
open to	 him to	 move the High Court for the same relief and
then to	 come to  the Supreme Court in appeal, if necessary.
That would  be wholly  irrational and meaningless Therefore,
the only way in which meaning and effect can be given to the
Presidential order  suspending the  enforcement of the right
of personal  liberty  guaranteed  under	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2108">Article  21</a>  is  by
holding	 that  the  principle  of  rule	 of  law,  that	 the
executive cannot  interfere with the personal liberty of any
person except  by authority of law, is enacted in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2109">Article 21</a>
and it	does not  exist as a distinct and separate principle
conferring a  right of	personal liberty,  independently and
apart from  that Article. Consequently, when the enforcement
of the	right of personal liberty conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2110">Article 21</a> is
suspended  by	a  Presidential	 order,	 the  detenu  cannot
circumvent the Presidential order and challenge the legality
of his	detention by  falling back  on the supposed right of
personal liberty based on the principle of rule of law.
</p><p id="p_985">     It was  also said	on behalf  of the detenus that under
our constitutional  set up, the executive is bound to act in
accordance with law and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_260">441</span>
this obligation	 of the executive arises from the very basis
of the	doctrine of distribution of powers amongst different
bodies created by the Constitution as also from the terms of
Articles  73,	154  and   256	of  the	 Constitution.	This
obligation, contended the detenus, could be enforced against
the executive  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2111">Article 226</a> by issue of a writ "for any
other purpose". Now, it is true that under our Constitution,
the executive  is a limited executive and it is bound to act
in accordance  with  law  and  cannot  disobey	it.  If	 the
Maintenance of	Internal Security  Act, 1971  says that	 the
executive shall	 be entitled  to detain a person only on the
fulfillment  of	  certain  conditions  and  according  to  a
specified procedure, it cannot make an order of detention if
the prescribed conditions are not fulfilled or the specified
procedure is  not followed.  The executive  is	plainly	 and
indubitably subordinated  to r	the law	 and it cannot flout
the mandate  of the  law but must act in accordance with it.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council pointed out this
constitutional position in Eastern Trust Company v. Mckenzie
Mann &amp;	Co. Ltd.(')  in an  appeal from the Supreme Court of
Canada: "The  non-existence of	any right to bring the Crown
into Court does not give the Crown immunity from all law, or
authorize the  interference by the Crown with private rights
at its	own mere  will-It is  the duty	of the	Crown and of
every branch  of the Executive to abide by and obey the law.
(emphasis supplied)".  This rule  must naturally  apply with
equal force  in our  constitutional set	 up  and  -that	 was
recognised by  this Court  in <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_2112">Rai  Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur v.
The State  of Punjab</a>(2)	 where Mukherjea,  J.,	speaking  on
behalf of  the Court  said: "In	 India, as  in England,	 the
executive  has	 to  act  subject  to  the  control  of	 the
legislature"  and   proceeded  to   add:   "-the   executive
Government are	bound to  conform not only to the law of the
land but  also to  the provisions  of the  Constitution-" In
Bharat Singh's	case (supra)  also, this  Court pointed oui:
"our federal  structure is  founded on	certain	 fundamental
principles: (1)	 the sovereignty  of the people with limited
Government authority  i.e. the	Government must be conducted
in accordance  with the	 will of the majority of the people.
The people  govern themselves through their representatives,
whereas the  official agencies	of the	executive Government
possess only such powers as have been conferred upon them by
the people;  (2) There is distribution of powers between the
three  organs	of  the	  State-Legislative,  executive	 and
judicial-each organ  having some check direct or indirect on
the other.  and (3)  the rule of law which includes judicial
review of arbitrary executive action". The obligation of the
executive to  act according  to law  and  not  to  flout  or
disobey it  is, therefore,  unexceptionable  and  cannot  be
disputed. But this obligation, in so far as personal liberty
is concerned,  is expressly  recognised	 and  enacted  as  a
constitutional provision  inter alia  in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2113">Article 21</a> and when
the Constitution itself has provided that the enforcement of
this obligation may be suspended by a Presidential order, it
is difficult  to see  how the intention of the constitution-
makers can  be allowed	to be  defeated by holding that this
obligation exists  independently of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2114">article 21</a> and it can be
enforced   despite    the   limitation	  imposed   by	 the
constitutional provision The same reasoning which I

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_261">442</span>
have elaborated	 in the	 preceding paragraph  would  equally
apply to repel the present argument.
</p><p id="p_987">     Before I  go to  the decided cases, I must refer to one
argument which strongly supports the view I am taking. It is
almost conclusive.  It is  an  argument	 for  which  I	must
express my  indebtedness to  Prof. P.  K.  Tripathi.  In  an
article written	 on 'Judicial  and Legislative	Control over
the Executive  during Martial  Law'  and  published  in	 the
Journal Section	 of All	 India Reporter at page 82, Prof. P.
K. Tripathi has suggested that considerations of Martial Law
may  support   the  conclusion	that  a	 Presidential  order
mentioning <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2115">Article 21</a> takes away, wholly and completely, the
right of  an individual	 to obtain  a writ  of habeas corpus
challenging the	 legality of his detention. I must of course
hasten to  make it  clear that	there is  no Martial law any
where in  the  territory  of  India  at	 present  and  I  am
referring to  it only  in order	 to buttress  the conclusion
otherwise reached  by me. The concept of Martial law is well
known in  the British  and American  jurisprudence.  When  a
grave emergency	 arises in  which the executive finds itself
unable to  restore order by employing the ordinary `civilian
machinery and  it becomes  necessary for it to use force, it
may declare  what is  commonly termed 'martial law'. Martial
law means  that the  executive calls the military to its aid
and the	 military, acting under the general authority of the
executive, proceeds  to quell  violence	 by  violence.	When
martial law  is in force, it is well settled that the courts
cannot issue  a writ of habeas corpus or otherwise interfere
with the  military authorities	or the	executive to protect
the life  or liberty  of an  individual, even  if illegal or
mala fide  action is  taken or threatened to be taken by the
military authorities  or the  executive. To  give  only	 one
example: In Ireland in John Allen's case('), the martial law
authorities ordered  all persons  to deposit their fire arms
within twenty-four  hours with	the army authorities on pain
of death.  John Allen.	who failed to obey, was arrested and
sentenced by  the military  tribunal, which  was, in  law, a
mere body  of army  men advising  the officer commanding, to
death, and the martial law authorities announced the day and
date when  he was  to be  executed. The	 court was  moved on
behalf of  John Allen  on the  ground that  the order of the
military tribunal  was invalid,	 but the  court	 refused  to
interfere on  the theory  that when  martial law is properly
declared, the  court will not issue habeas corpus during the
period when  martial law  is  in  force.  It  is  the  basic
characteristic and  essence of	martial law  that during the
time that  it is in force, the individual cannot enforce his
right to  life and  liberty by resorting to judicial process
and the	 courts cannot	issue the  writ of  habeas corpus or
pass any similar orders.
</p><p id="p_988">     Now, under our Constitution there does not appear to be
any express  provision conferring  power on the executive to
declare martial	 law. But  it is  implicit in  the  text  of
<a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_2116">Article 34</a>  of the  Constitution  that	the  Government	 may
declare martial	 law in	 any area  within the  territory  of
India. What  are the  legal implications and consequences of
declaration of	martial law is not provided any where in the
Cons-
</p><p id="p_989">     (1) [1921] 2 Irish Reports 241.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_262">443</span>
<p id="p_990">titution. It  is, therefore,  obvious that  merely declaring
martial law  Would not, by itself, deprive the courts of the
power to  issue the  writ of  habeas corpus or other process
for the protection of the right of the individual to lie and
liberty. In  our country,  unlike England, the right to life
and liberty  is secured as a fundamental right and the right
to move	 the Supreme  Court for enforcement of this right is
also guaranteed	 as a  fundamental right.  Also the power to
issue a	 writ or  order in  the nature	of habeas corpus has
been  expressly	  conferred  of	  the  High   Courts  by   a
constitutional provision,  namely, <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2117">Article  226.</a>  Therefore,
the declaration	 of martial law, which is not even expressly
provided in the Constitution, cannot override the provisions
of the	Article conferring  the right to life and liberty as
also of	 Articles 32  and 226  and, unless  the right  of an
individual to  move the	 courts for enforcement of the right
to life	 and liberty  can be  suspended or  taken away by or
under  an   express  provisions	 of  the  Constitution,	 the
individual would  be entitled  to enforce  the right to life
and liberty  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2118">Article 32</a> or <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2119">Article 226</a> or by resorting
to the	ordinary process  of law,  even during	martial law.
That would  be contradictory  of  the  basic  and  essential
feature of  martial law	 and make  it impossible  to  impose
effective martial  law anywhere at any time in the territory
of India.  Such a consequence could never have been imagined
by the	constitution-makers. They  could never have intended
that the Government should have the power to declare martial
law and	 yet it	 should be  devoid of the legal effect which
must  inevitably  follow  when	martial	 law  is  in  force.
Moreover, <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_2120">Article  34</a> itself  presupposes that acts contrary
to law	may be	committed by The military authorities or the
executive during  the time  when martial law is in force and
that is why it provides that after the martial law ceases to
be in  force, Parliament may by law indemnify "any person in
the service  of the  Union or of a State or any other person
in respect  of any  act done  by him  in connection with the
maintenance  or	 restoration  of  order	 in  any  area-where
martial law  was in  force or  validate any sentence passed,
punishment inflicted,  forfeiture ordered  or other act done
under martial  law in  such area".  This  provision  clearly
postulates that	 during the  time that	martial	 law  is  in
force, no judicial process can issue to examine the legality
of any act done by the military authorities or the executive
in connection  with the maintenance or restoration of order.
But,  how   is	this   result  to   be	achieved  under	 the
Constitution ?
</p><p id="p_991">     The only provision in the constitution which authorises
temporary suspension  or taking	 away of  the  right  of  an
individual to move any court for enforcement of his right to
life and  liberty is  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2121">Article 359</a>,  clause (  I )  . If	 the
Presidential  order   under  clause   (1)  of	<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2122">Article	 359</a>
suspending  enforcement	  of  the  fundamental	right  under
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2123">Article 21</a>  were construed not to have the effect of barring
an individual  from  moving  the  court	 for  impugning	 the
legality of  the act  of the  executive interfering with his
life or	 liberty, on  the assumption that in doing so, he is
merely enforcing his right to life or personal liberty based
on the	rule of	 law. the result would be that even when and
where martial  law is in force, courts will continue to have
the power  to  examine	the  legality  of  the	act  of	 the
executive, because, as explained earlier, the mere
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_263">444</span>
declaration of martial law does not, under our Constitution,
have the  effect of  taking away  that power.  That would be
plainily an  insufferable situation  which would  carry	 the
power of  courts even  beyond that  claimed  by	 the  United
States courts  in the case of the ex parte Milligan(') which
case went  to the  farthest limit  and which  has  for	that
reason been  criticised by  great  authorities	like  E.  S.
Corwin and  has not  been consistently	followed even by the
United States  Supreme Court  Vide Moyer  v. Peabody(2)	 and
Duncan v.  Kohanmeku.(3) There	can be	no two opinions that
during martial	law the	 courts cannot	and should  not have
power to  examine the legality of the action of the military
authorities or	the  executive	on  any	 ground	 whatsoever,
including the ground of mala fide. But, if the courts are to
be prevented  from exercising such power during martial law,
that situation	call be brought about only by a Presidential
order issued  under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2124">Article  359</a>, clause (1) and in no other
way and	 the Presidential order in so far as it suspends the
enforcement of the right of personal liberty conferred under
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2125">Article 21</a>  must  be  construed	 to  bar  challenge  to	 the
legality of  detention in  any court,  including the Supreme
Court and  the High Courts, whilst the Presidential order is
in operation.
</p><p id="p_992">     I may  also in this connection refer to the decision of
the House  of Lords in Attorney General Y. De Keyser's Royal
Hotel.(4) There,  in May  1916, the Crown, purporting to act
under the  Defence of  Realm Consolidation Act, ]914 and the
Regulations made  thereunder took  possession of a hotel for
the purpose  of Housing	 the Headquarters'  personnel of the
Royal Flying Corps and denied tthe legal right of the owners
to compensation.  The owners  yielded  up  possession  under
protest and  without prejudice	to  their  right  and  by  a
Petition of  Right, they  asked for  a declaration that they
were entitled  to compensation	under the <a href="/doc/272958/" id="a_2126">Defence Act</a>. 1842.
The Crown  was plainly	liable to pay compensation under the
Statute, but  it sought	 to justify  its  action  in  taking
possession of  the hotel  without payment  of  compensation,
under the  sanction of	the Royal Prerogative. Tile question
which, therefore,  arose for  consideration before the House
of Lords  was whether the Royal Prerogative was available to
the  Crown  for	 taking	 possession  of	 the  Hotel  without
compensation, when  the statute	 authorised taking  of	such
possession but	on condition on payment of compensation. The
House of  Lords	 unanimously  held  that,  in  view  of	 the
statutory provision on the subject, the Royal Prerogative to
take  property	without	 payment  of  compensation  did	 not
subsist and  the principle  laid  down	was  that  where  by
Statute,  the  Crown  is  empowered  to	 do  what  it  might
heretofore have done by virtue of its prerogative, it can no
longer act  under the  prerogative and	must act  under	 and
subject to  the conditions  imposed  by	 the  statute.	Lord
Dunedin in the course of his speech observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_255">	  "None the  less, it is equally certain that if the
     whole ground  of something	 which could  be done by the

<p id="p_997">Lord Atkinson  quoted with  approval the  following pregnant
passage A  from the  judgment of  the Master of the Rolls in
the same case .
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_256">	  "Those  powers   which  the	executive  exercises
     without Parliamentary authority are comprised under the
     comprehensive term	 of the prerogative. Where, however,
     Parliament has  intervened and  has provided by statute
     for powers,  previously within  the prerogative,  being
     exercised in  a particular	 manner and  subject to	 the
     limitations and  provisions contained  in the  statute,
     they can  only be	so exercised.  otherwise,  what	 use
     would there  be in	 imposing limitations,	if the Crown
     could at  its pleasure  disrgard them  and fall back on
     prerogative ?",
and pointed  out that  the question  posed by the Maqster of
the Rolls  was	unanswerable.  The  learned  Law  Lord	then
proceeded to add:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_257">	  "It is  quite obvious that it would be useless and
     meaning less for the Legislature to impose restrictions
     and limitations  upon, and to attach conditions to, the
     exercise by  the Crown  of the  powers conferred  by  a
     statute, if  the Crown  were free	at its	pleasure  to
     disregard	these  provisions,  and	 by  virtue  of	 its
     prerogative do the very thing the statutes empowered it
     to do."

also made  observations to  the same effect in the course of
their speeches.</blockquote>
<p id="p_998">     Now it is obvious that the contention of the detenus in
the present  case is very similar to that advanced on behalf
of the	Crown in  De Keyser's Royal Hotel's case (supra). It
almost seems  to be  an echo  of that contention and it must
inevitably be  answered the  same way.	When  the  right  of
personal liberty  based on  the rule  of law  which  existed
immediately prior  to the  commencement of  the Constitution
has been  enacted in the Constitution as a fundamental right
in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2129">Article  21</a> with  the limitation  that, when	 there is  a
Proclamation of Emergency, the President may, by order under
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2130">Article 359</a>,  clause (1)  suspend  its	enforcement,  it  is
impossible to  imagine how  that right	of personal  liberty
based on the rule of law can continue to exist as a distinct
and  independent  right	 free  from  the  limitation  as  to
enforcement contained  in <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2131">Article  359</a>, clause (1). It would
be meaningless	and futile  for the  constitution-makers  to
have imposed this limitation in regard to enforcement of the
right of  personal liberty  guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2132">Article 21</a>, if the
detenu could,  with impunity,  disregard such limitation and
fall back on the right of personal liberty based on the rule

This contention	 of the	 petitioner was negatived and it was
held by this Court speaking through Jagannatha Das, J.:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_259">	  "When	 <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_2140">Article   31-B</a>	 protects   is	not  a	mere
     "contravention of	the provisions"	 of Part  III of the
     Constitution but  an attack  on the  grounds  that	 the
     impugned Act  is "inconsistent  with or  takes away  or
     abridges any  of the rights conferred by any provisions
     of this Part." one of the rights secured to a person by
     Part III  of the  Constitution  is	 a  right  that	 his
     property shall be acquired only for public purposes and
     under a'law  authorising such acquisition and providing
     for compensation  which is	 either	 fixed	by  the	 law
     itself or regulated by principles specified by the law.
     That is  also  the	 very  right  which  was  previously
     secured  to   the	person	under  section	299  of	 the
     Government of  India Act. The challenge now made to the
     validity of  the impugned	Act is	based on the alleged
     violation of that right." '7 But it is urged, that even
     so, <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_2141">article  31-B</a> protects	 only the  violation of	 the
     fundamental right	in so  far as  "it was	conferred by
     Part III  of the  Constitution"  and  that	 this  right
     cannot  be	  said	to  have  been	"conferred"  by	 the
     Constitution. We  cannot agree  with  this	 contention.
     This is  clearly a case where the concerned right which
     was secured  under section	 299 of	 the  Government  of
     India Act	in the form of a fetter on the competency of
     the  Legislature	and  which   in	 substance   was   a
     fundamental right,	 was lifted into the formal category
     of a  fundamental right  along with  other	 fundamental
     rights recognised in the present Constitution. There is
     therefore nothing	inappropriate in  referring to	this
     right which  was pre  existing, along  with  the  other
     fundamental rights	 for the  first time secured by this
     Constitution, when grouping them
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_266">447</span>
     together, as  fundamental	rights	"conferred"  by	 the
     Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_1001">This Court  held that  when <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_2142">Article  31-B</a> protected  the Act
against attack	on the	ground that the Act is "inconsistent
with or	 takes away  or abridges any of the rights conferred
by any	provisions of  "Part III, the protection extended to
giving immunity	 against violation of the 8 right secured by
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2143">section 299</a>, subsection (2) of the Government of India, 1935
because that  was the very right lifted into the category of
fundamental right  and enacted	as <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2144">Article 31</a>, clause (2) of
the   Constitution    and   it	  could	  accordingly	with
appropriateness, be  referred to  as the  right conferred by
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2145">Article 31</a>,  clause (2).  On the parity of reasoning, it may
be said that the right based on the principle of rule of law
that no	 one shall  be deprived	 of  his  life	or  personal
liberty except by authority of law, which was a pre-existing
right, was lifted into the category of fundamental right and
enacted as  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2146">Article 21</a>	and hence  it became  a	 fundamental
right conferred	 by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2147">Article  21</a>  and  ceased  to  have	 any
distinct and separate existence.
</p><p id="p_1002">     The maxim	'expressum facit  cessare tacitum'  that  is
what is	 expressed makes  what is  silent cease,  would also
clearly be  applicable in  the present	case. This  maxim is
indeed a  principle of logic and common sense and not merely
a technical  rule of  construction. It	was applied  in	 the
construction of	 a constitutional  provision in <a href="/doc/44591/" id="a_2148">Shankara Rao
Badami	v.  State  of  Mysore</a>(1).  The	argument  which	 was
advanced in  that case	was that  the  existence  of  public
purpose	 and   the  obligation	 to  pay  compensation	were
necessary concomitants	of compulsory acquisition of private
property and  so the  term 'acquisition' in Entry 36 of List
II of  the Seventh  Schedule to	 the  Constitution  must  be
construed as  importing	 by  necessary	impliction  the	 two
conditions  of	 public	 purpose  and  payment	of  adequate
compensation, and  consequently, the  Mysore  (Personal	 and
Miscellaneous) Inams Abolition Act, 1955, which provided for
acquisition of the rights of the inamdars in inam estates in
Mysore	State	without	 payment   of  just   and   adequate
compensation was  beyond the  legislative competence  of the
State Legislature.  This argument was rejected on the ground
that the  limitations  of  public  purpose  and	 payment  of
compensation being  expressly provided	for as conditions of
acquisition in	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2149">Article	 31  (2</a>),  there  was  no  room	 for
implying either	 of these  limitations in the interpretation
of the term 'acquisition' in Entry 36 of List II. Ramaswamy,
J., speaking on behalf of the Court observed- G
	  "It is  true that  under the Common law of eminent
     do main  as recognised in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence the
     State cannot  take the  property of  its subject unless
     such property  is required	 for a	public	purpose	 and
     without compensating  the owner  for its loss. But when
     these limitations are expressly provided for in <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_2150">Article
     32(2)</a> and	it is further enact- cd that no law shall be
     made which takes away or abridges
(1) [1969] 3 S. C. R. 1.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_267">448</span>
<p id="p_1003">     these safeguards,	and any	 such law, if made, shall be
     void, there  can be  no room  for implication,  and the
     words 'acquisition	 of property'  in entry	 36 must  be
     understood	 in  their  natural  sense  of	the  act  of
     acquiring property,  without importing  into the phrase
     an obligation  to pay compensation or a condition as to
     the existence  of a  public purpose. In other words, it
     is	 not   correct	to   treat  the	 obligation  to	 pay
     compensation as implicit in the legislative entry 33 of
     List I  or legislative  entry 36  of List	II for it is
     separately and expressly provided for in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2151">Article 31(2).</a>
     The well  known maxim  expresum fact cessare tacitum is
     indeed a  principle of  logic and	commonsense and	 not
     merely a  technical rule  of construction.	 The express
     provision in  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2152">Article 31  (2)</a> that a law of acquisition
     in order  to be  valid must  provide  for	compensation
     will, therefore,  necessarily exclude all suggestion of
     an	 implied  obligation  to  provide  for	compensation
     sought to	be imported  into the  meaning of  the	word
     "acquisition" in  entry 36	 of List  II. In the face of
     the express  provision of	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2153">Article 31(2</a>), there remains
     no	 room  for  reading  any  such	implication  in	 the
     legislative heads."
</p><p id="p_1004">Similarly, in  the present  case, on  an application  of the
maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum, the express provision
in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2154">Article  21</a> that  no person shall be deprived of his life
or personal liberty except according to procedure prescribed
by law	will necessarily  exclude a  provision to  the	same
effect to  be gathered	or implied from the other provisions
of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1005">     I find  myself fortified in this conclusion by the view
taken on  a similar  question under  the Irish	Constitution
which  also   contains	a   catena  of	articles  conferring
fundamental rights  Kelly  in  his  book  one,	'Fundamental
Rights in  the Irish  Law and Constitution' points out "that
the  various   fundamental  rights   which  were  previously
notionally present  in the  common law have been subsumed in
and replaced  by the  written guarantees"  and,	 therefore.,
these  rights	cannot	be   found  elsewhere  than  in	 the
Constitution. The  decision of	the High Court of Justice in
Ireland	 in   'State  (Walsh   and  others)  v.	 Lennon	 and
others"(1) has	also adopted  the same view. The petitioners
in this	 case, who  were detained  in Arbour  Hill  Military
Detention Barracks  awaiting trial  on a  charge  of  murder
before a  Military Court  established under Emergency Powers
(No. 41)  order, 1940, made an application to the High Court
for an	order of  habeas corpus	 directed to the Governor of
the Detention  Barracks in  which they	were held and for an
order of  prohibition directed	to the President and members
of  the	 Military  Court  before  whom	it  was	 ordered  by
Emergency Powers  (No. 41F)  order, 1941 that they should be
tried. The application inter alia challenged the validity of
the Emergency  Powers (No.  41 F)  order, 1941 on the ground
that it	 was ultra vires the Government, as it directed that
the Military Court, which was to try the petitioners. should
try them together and so precluded the Court from exercising
its discretion	and control  over its  own procedure and was
thus violative	of the	right of a citizen to insist that he
shall not be

The respondents relied on <a href="/doc/1734560/" id="a_2159">Article 28</a>, <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2160">section 3</a>, sub-section
(3) of	The Constitution  which provided:  "Nothing in	this

of securing  the public	 safety and  the preservation of the
State in time of war or armed rebellion or to nulify any act
done or	 purported to be done in pursuance of any such law."
and  contended	 that  by  reason  of  this  provision,	 the
Emergency Powers  (No. 41  F) Order, 1941 was protected from
challenge on  the ground  of contravention  of	<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_2161">Article	 38</a>,
<a href="/doc/1093366/" id="a_2162">section 1</a>  and <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_2163">Article	40</a>, <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_2164">section  4</a>, sub-section ( 1 ) of
the Constitution.  This contention clearly had the effect of
putting the  petitioners out  of court	and" therefore, they
sought to  get round  this difficulty  by arguing  that	 the
constitutional rights,	which  they  claimed  to  have	been
infringed were	derived not  from the  written constitution,
but from  the  Common  Law,  and  consequently	<a href="/doc/1734560/" id="a_2165">Article	 28</a>,
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2166">section 3</a>, sub-section (3) of the Constitution did not stand
in their  way. This  argument, which was very similar to the
present argument  advanced  before  us,	 was  unhesitatingly
rejected by  all the  three judges  who	 took  part  in	 the
decision. Maguire J. said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_260">	  "The	contention   is	 that	the   constitutional
     principles which  assure  to  a  citizen  his  personal
     liberty, his right to resort to this Court for an order
     of habeas	corpus, his right that he shall not be tried
     on a criminal charge save in due course of law, have as
     their source  the Common  Law, and	 exist side  by side
     with these	 rights	 in  the  written  Constitution.  In
     support of	 this contention  reliance is  placed on the
     decision of  the Supreme  Court in	 Burke's Case (1940)
     I.R. 136),	 particularly on the passage in the judgment
     of Murnaghan  J. at  p. 171,  where  he  says  'certain
     constitutional   principles    are	  stated    in	 the
     Constitution but  many other  important  constitutional
     principles have  been accepted  as existing  in the law

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_261">	  I do	not find  in the judgment of Murnaghan J. Or
     else where	 in the judgments in that case any basis for
     the contention  that these	 rights are to be found in a

     written Constitution  having their source in the Common
     Law, and  of equal	 validity with the principles stated
     in the  Constitution, and	which on  the argument here,

     cannot be found elsewhere than in the Constitution.</blockquote>
<p id="p_1007">	  The  advantages  of  a  written  Constitution	 are
     manifest. Such a Constitution can, and our Constitution
     does, give
31-833SCI/76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_269">450</span>
     rights such as these definite and clear expression. Our
     Constitution can,	and does, protect them against being
     whittled away  save with  great difficulty. The framers
     of the  Constitution  have	 provided  that,  after	 the
     passage of	 a limited time, many, though not all of the
     rights which  it gives  are put  beyond  the  reach  of
     interference by ordinary law. The framers have however,

</p><p id="p_1008">     Gavan Duffy, J. also observed to the same effect:
	  "The applicants  seek, in the alternative, to base
     their claims  to habeas  corpus  and  prohibition	upon
     antecedent rights of personal liberty and regular trial
     at Common	Law; but, whether or not the imminent Common
     Law of Ireland needed generally any <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_2173">Art. 50 (containing
     the laws in force)</a> to retain its vigour, the particular
     Common Law	 principles here  invoked must	both, in  my
     opinion,  of  necessity  have  merged  in	the  express
     provisions declaring  how the  two corresponding rights
     are to  be in force under the new polity established by
     An Bunreacht."
</p><p id="p_1009">     And so did Martin Maguire, J. when he said:
</p><p id="p_1010">	  "It is  argued, in  the alternative,	that,  apart
     from the  Constitution and	 existing side	by side with
     it,, there	 is a body of constitutional law, founded on
     Common Law,  and  comprising  the	same  constitutional
     rights which  the prosecutors  seek to  assert, and  in
     respect of	 which they  demand the	 relief	 claimed  in
     these   proceedings.   This   argument   involves	 the
     propositions that	the State has two Constitutions, the
     one enacted  by the  people, written  and	defined	 the
     other un-written and undefined, and that the latter may
     be invoked,  or called  in aid,  to the  extent even of
     defeating the  clear terms	 of the Constitution where a
     conflict real  or apparent	 is  alleged  between  them.
     There is  no authority  for these	propositions.  I  am
     unable to accept this argument."
</p><p id="p_1011">On this	 view, all  the three  judges of the High Court held
that the  Emergency Powers (No. 41-F) Order" 1941 was immune
from challenge	by reason  of <a href="/doc/1734560/" id="a_2174">Article  28</a>, <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2175">section  3</a>,	sub-
section (3)  of the Constitution. This decision was taken in
appeal and  affirmed by	 the Supreme  Court, but  this point
about the  continuance of the common law rights side by side
in the	constitution, was  not examined since it was obvious
that the  Emergency Powers  (No. 41 F) order, 1941 could not
be set at naught on the ground of repugnancy to any supposed
Common Law  rights. It	will be	 seen that  there is a close
analogy between	 this decision	of the	High Court  and	 the
present case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_270">451</span>

these decisions	 do not	 lay down any such proposition as is
contended for on behalf of the detenus. What these decisions
say is	only this, namely, that <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_2177">Article 358</a> protects against
challenge under	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2178">Article 19</a> only such executive action ac is

in <a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_2182">Bidi	 Supply Co. v. Union of India</a>.(1) There,- an omnibus
order was  made under  <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_2183">section 5</a>,  sub-section (7<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2184">A)  of	 the

being outside  `the power  conferred under  <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_2185">section 5</a>,	sub-
section (7A)  and hence	 violative of the fundamental rights
guaranteed to  him by  Articles 14, 19(1)(if) and (b) and 31
of the	Constitution. This Court held that the omnibus order
made in this case was not contemplated or sanctioned by sub-
section (7A) of <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_2186">section 5</a> and. therefore, the petitioner was
still entitled	to the	benefit of  the provisions  of	sub-
sections (1)  and (2) of <a href="/doc/1050291/" id="a_2187">section 64</a> and since the Income Tax
authorities had	 by an	executive order, unsupported by law,

contrary to  sub-sections (1)  and (2)	of <a href="/doc/1050291/" id="a_2190">section  64</a>,	 the
impugned order	was held to be bad. Hence it will be noticed

was a  petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2196">Article 32</a> of the Constitution and the
action of  the officers	 of the State Government impugned in
this case  was forcible	 dispossession of the petitioners of
properties which  were in  their management  and possession.
The challenge  to the impugned action of the officers of the
State Government  was based  on violation of the fundamental
right guaranteed  under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2197">Article 31.</a> This Court
upheld the  challenge and struck down the impugned action as
being without  the authority of law and while doing so. made
the following observations which were strongly relied onp on
behalf of  the detenus:	 "Before we  part with this case, we
feel it	 our duty  to say that the executive action taken in
this case  by the  State and  its officers is destructive of
basic principle	 of  the  rule	of  law-the  action  of	 the
Government  in	 taking	 the   law  into   their  hands	 and
dispossession the  petitioners	by  the	 display  of  force,
exhibits a  callous disregard  of the normal requirements of
the rule  of law-We  have here	a highly  discriminatory and
autocratic act	which deprives a person of the possession of
property without  reference to	any law or legal authority".
(emphasis supplied).  These observations Made in the context
of a petition for enforcement of the fundamental right under
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2198">Article 31.</a> clause (1) clearly show that this Court regarded
the principle  of rule	of  law	 that  no  person  shall  be
deprived of  his property  "without reference  to any law or
legal authority'"  as embodied in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2199">Article 31</a>, clause (1) and
did not	 rely upon  this principle  of	rule  of  law  as  a
distinct and  independent principle  apart from	 <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2200">Article 31</a>,
clause (1):  otherwise the  petition under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2201">Article 32</a> would
not have  been maintainable  and this  Court could  not have
granted relief.

of one	Bipat Gope  from illegal  detention. This Court held
that the  State Government  had failed	to show	 under	what

the same  A jurisprudence  which has  been adopted  in	this

on behalf  of the  detenus to  contend that the principle of
rule of	 law in	 Eshugbayi Eleko's  case (supra) was held by
this Court to have been adopted in this country and it must,
there fore,  be enforced  independently of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2204">Article 21.</a> But I
do not	think that  is the elect of these observations. What
Kapur, J.,  said was only this, namely that the principle of

adopted in this country. He did not make it clear how it had
been adopted  nor did  he say  that it had been adopted as a
distinct  and	independent   principle	  apart	  from	 the

in Eshogbayi  Eleko's case  (Supra) had been adopted in this
country in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2205">Article 21</a>	to the	extent to  which it protects
personal liberty.  I will,  therefore, be seen that there is

Singh v.  State of  Punjab</a>  (supra)  on	 which	very  strong
reliance was  placed on	 behalf of  the detenus.  That was a
decision given	in a  batch of	twenty-six appeals  from the
decisions of  the High	Courts of  Bombay  and	Punjab.	 The
appellants in  these six  appeals were detained respectively
by the	Punjab and  the Maharashtra  State Governments under
Rule 30(i)(b)  of the  Defence of  India Rules	made by	 the
Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred on it
by<a href="/doc/1468473/" id="a_2208"> s.  3</a> of  the Defence  of  India  ordinance,	 1962.	They
applied	 to   the  Punjab   and	 the   Bombay  High   Courts
respectively under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2209"> s. 491(1)</a>  (b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2210"> of  the Code</a>	 of Criminal
Procedure and  alleged that  they had  been  improperly	 and
illegally detained. Their contention was that<a href="/doc/10106652/" id="a_2211"> s. 3(2)(15)(i)</a>
and s.	40 of  the Defence of India Act, 1962 which replaced
the Defence of India ordinance and Rule 30(l)(b) under which
they were  detained were  constitutionally  invalid  because
they contravened their fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21
and 22(,4)  (5) and  (7) of  the Constitution  and  so	they
claimed that  an order	should be  passed  in  their  favour
directing the  respective State	 Governments to	 set them at
liberty There  was in  operation at that time a Proclamation
of  Emergency	dated  26th  October,  1962  issued  by	 the
President under	 <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_2212">Art. :352</a>,  clause (1	) on  account of the
Chinese aggression.  The President  had also issued an order
dated  3rd   November,	1962  under  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2213">Art.  359</a>,	 clause	 (1)
suspending the right of any person to move any court for the
enforcement of	the rights  conferred by  articles 21 and 22
"if such  person has been deprived of any ,such rights under
the Defence of India ordinance, 1962 (4 of 1962) or any rule
or order  made thereunder."  The  contention  of  the  State
Governments based  on this  Presidential order	was-and that
contention found  favour  with	both  High  Courts-that	 the
Presidential  order   created  a  bar  which  precluded	 the
appellants from	 maintaining  the  petitions  under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2214"> s.	 491</a>
(1)(b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2215">	of   the  Code</a>	 of  criminal	Procedure.  On	this
contention. two	 questions arose  for  determination  before
this Court.  The first was as to what was the true scope and
effect of  the Presidential order and the second was whether
the bar created by the Presidential order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_273">454</span>
operated in  respect of	 applications made by the appellants
under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2216"> s.  491(1)</a> (b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2217"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure. This
Court in  a majority  judgment delivered  by Gajendragadkar,
J., analysed  the pro  visions of  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2218">Art. 359</a>,  clause (1) and
held that  the words  "any court"  in that  Article must  be
given their  plain grammatical meaning and must be construed
to mean	 any court  of competent  jurisdiction	which  would
include the  Supreme Court  and the High Courts before which
the specified  rights can  be enforced by the citizens". The
majority judgment  then proceeded to add: "The sweep of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_2219">Art.
359(1)</a> and  the Presidential  order issued  under it is thus
wide enough  to include	 all claims  made by citizens in any
court of  competent jurisdiction  when lt  is shown that the
said claims  cannot be	effectively adjudicated upon without
examining the  question as  to whether	the citizen  is,  in
substance, seeking  to enforce	any of	the  said  specified
fundamental  right"   Having  thus  disposed  of  the  first
question, the  majority judgment  went on  to  consider	 the
second question	 and  after  analysing	the  nature  of	 the
proceedings under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2220"> s. 491(1)(b)</a>	 of  the  Code	of  Criminal
Procedure, held	 that the prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2221">Art. 359</a>,
clause (1)  and the  Presidential order would apply "as much
to proceedings under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2222"> s. 491</a> ( 1 ) (b) as to those under <a href="/doc/452476/" id="a_2223">Art.
226(1)</a> and  <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_2224">Art. 32  (1)".</a> It was obvious that on this view,
the petitions  under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2225"> s.	 491(1)(b)</a>  were  not  maintainable"
since the only ground on which they challenged the orders of
detention was  that the provisions of<a href="/doc/10106652/" id="a_2226"> s. 3(2)(15)(i)</a> as well
as rule	 30(l)(b) were invalid as offending against Articles
14, 21	and 22 and in the circumstances it was not necessary
for the.;  Court to  express any opinion on the questions to
what were  the	pleas  available  to  a	 citizen  under	 the
Presidential order  in challenging the legality or propriety
of his	detention.  Still  however,  the  majority  judgment
proceeded to  give its	opinion	 on  this  question  in	 the
following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_264">	  It still  remains to	consider what  are the pleas
     which  are	 now  open  to	the  citizens  to  take	 ill
     challenging the  legality or  the	propriety  of  their
     detentions either	under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2227"> s.  491(1)</a> (b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2228">  of the Code</a> or
     <a href="/doc/452476/" id="a_2229">Art. 226(1)</a>  of the  Constitution. We have already seen
     that the  right to move any court which is suspended by
     <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_2230">Art. 359(1 )</a> and the Presidential order issued under it
     is the  right for the enforcement of such of the lights
     conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order.
     If in  challenging the validity of his detention order,
     the detenu	 is pleading  any right	 outside the  rights
     specified in  the order, his right to move any court in
     that behalf`  is not  suspended, because  it is outside
     <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2231">Art. 359(l)</a>  and consequently  outside the Presidential
     order itself.  Let us  take a  case where	a detenu has
     been detained  in violation of the mandatory provisions
     of the  Act. In  such a  case, it	may be	open to	 the
     detenu to contend that his detention is illegal for the
     reason that  the mandatory	 provisions of	the Act have
     been contravened.	Such a	plea is	 outside <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_2232">Art. 359(1)</a>
     and the  right of the detenu to move for his release on
     such a  ground cannot  be affected	 by the Presidential
     order.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_274">455</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_265">	  Take also  a case where the detenu moves the Court
     for A  a writ  of habeas  corpus on the ground that his
     detention has  been  ordered  malafide.  It  is  hardly
     necessary to  emphasise that  the exercise	 of a  power
     malafide  is  wholly  outside  the	 scope	of  the	 Act
     conferring the  power and	can always  be	successfully
     challenged. It  is true that a mere allegation that the
     detention is  malafide would  not be  enough the detenu
     will have	to prove the malafides. But if the malafides
     are  alleged,  the	 detenu	 cannot	 be  precluded	from
     substantiating his	 plea  on  the	ground	of  the	 bar
     created by <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_2233">Art. 359(1)</a> and the Presidential order. That
     is another kind of plea which is outside the purview of
     <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_2234">Art. 359(1).</a>  We ought  to add that these categories of
     pleas have been mentioned by us by way of illustration"
     and so,  they should  not be read as exhausting all the
     pleas which  do not  fall within  the  purview  of	 the
     Presidential order."</blockquote>
<p id="p_1020">     The strongest  reliance was  placed on  behalf  of	 the
detenus on  these observations	in the majority judgment. It
was contended on behalf of the detenus that the observations
clearly showed	that if	 an order of detention is challenged
on the	ground that  it is  in violation  of  the  mandatory
provisions of the Act or is made malafide, such a plea would
be outside <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2235">Art. 359</a>, clause (1) and would not be barred by a
Presidential order  specifying	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2236">Art.  21.</a>  The	detenus,  in
support of this contention leaned heavily on the words 'such
a plea is outside <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_2237">Art. 359(1)</a> and the right of the detenu to
move for  his release on such a ground cannot be affected by
the Presidential  order", and  "that is another kind of plea
which is  outside the  purview of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2238">Art. 359</a><a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_2239">(,1)"</a> occurring in
these observations and urged that such a plea was held to be
permissible because  it was  outside the purview of Art 359,
clause (1)  and not  because it was outside the terms of the
particular Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_1021">     Now, at  first blush,  these observations	do  seem  to
support the  contention of  the detenus.  But there  are two
very good  reasons why I do not think these observations can
be of  much help in the determination of the question before
us. In the first place, the questions to what were the other
pleas available	 to a  detenu in challenging the legality or
propriety of  his detention,  despite the Presidential order
dated 3rd  November, 1962, was not in issue before the Court
and  did   not	fall   to  be	decided	 and  the  aforesaid
observations made  by  the  Court  on  this  question  were,
therefore,  clearly   obiter.	These	observations   would
undoubtedly be entitled to great weight, but, as pointed out
by this	 Court in  <a href="/doc/660275/" id="a_2240">H. Maharajadhiraja  Madhav Rao Jiwaji Rao
Scindia Bahadur	 &amp; Ors.	 v. Union  of  India</a>(1)	 "an  obiter
cannot take the place of the ratio. Judges are not oracles".
These observations  do	not,  therefore,  have	any  binding
effect and  they cannot	 be regarded  as conclusive  on	 the
point. Moreover,  it must  be remembered  that when  we	 are
considering the	 observations of  a high  judicial authority
like this Court, the greatest possible care must be taken to
relate the  observations of  a judge  to the  precise issues
before him
     (1) [1971] 3 S. C. R. 9.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_275">456</span>
<p id="p_1022">and to	confine such  observations, even though expressed in
broad terms,  in the  general compass of the question before
him" unless  the makes it clear that he intended his remarks
to have	 a wider ambit. It is not possible for judges always
to express  their judgments  so as  to exclude	entirely the
risk that  in some  subsequent case  their language  may  be
misapplied and	any attempt at such perfection of expression
can only lead to the opposite result of uncertainty and even
obscurity as  regard the case in hand. It may be noted that,
in this	 case the  Presidential order  dated  3rd  November,
1962, which came up for consideration before the Court,, was
a conditional  order, inasmuch as it operated to suspend the
right of any person to move any court for enforcement of the
rights conferred  by Articles  21 and  22, only	 if  he	 was
deprived of  any such rights under the Defence of India Act,
1962 or	 any rule  or order  made under	 it. It	 was in	 the
context	 of  this  Presidential	 order	that  the  aforesaid
observations were made by this Court. It is obvious that, on
the terms  of this  Presidential  order,  if  a	 person	 was
deprived  of   his  personal   liberty	otherwise   than  in
accordance with	 the provisions of the Defence of India Act,
1962 or	 any rule  or order made under it, his right to move
the Court  for enforcement  of his right of personal liberty
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2241">Article  21</a> would	 not be	 barred by  the Presidential
order. That  is why  it was  said in this case, that, if the
detention is  illegal for  the	reason	that  the  mandatory
provisions of the Defence of India Act,, 1962 or any rule or
order made  thereunder have  been contravened  or  that	 the
detention has  been ordered mala fide, such a plea would not
fall within the terms of the Presidential order and hence it
would be  outside the  purview of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2242">Art. 359</a>, clause (1). That
is the	only way in which these observations can and must be
understood. It	was pointed out by the House of Lords as far
back as	 1901 in Queen v. Leatham(l) "Every judgment must be
read as	 applicable  to	 the  particular  facts	 proved,  or
assumed	 to   be  proved,   since  the	 generality  of	 the
expressions which  may be found there are not intended to be
exposition of  the whole law, but are governed and qualified
by the	particular facts in which such expressions are to be
found." This  Court had	 also occasion	to point  out in the
<a href="/doc/1656601/" id="a_2243">State  of  Orissa  v.  Sudhansu	 Sekhar	 Misra</a>(')  that	 the
observations in	 a judgment  must be "only in the context of
the question  that arose  for decision."  It  would  not  be
right, as  observed by	this Court in <a href="/doc/660275/" id="a_2244">Madhav Rao v. Union of
India</a> (supra),	"to regard  a word,  a clause  or a sentence
occurring in  a judgment  of this  Court, divorced  from its
context, as  containing a  full exposition  on the  law on a
question" particularly	"when the question did not even fall
to be answered in that judgment". Here, in the present case,
unlike the  Presidential order	dated  3rd  November,  1962,
which was  a conditional order, the Presidential order dated
27th June,  1975 is, on the face of it. an unconditional one
and as	such there  is a vital difference ill effect between
the Presidential  order dated  3rd November,  1962  and	 the
present Presidential order. In fact, it appears that because
of the	interpretation and  effect of the Presidential Order
dated  3rd  November,  ]962  given  in	this  case  and	 the
subsequent cases  following it,	 the President	deliberately

<p id="p_1024">made the  present Presidential	order an  unconditional one.
These observations  made in  the context  of  a	 conditional
Presidential order cannot, therefore, be read as laying down
that a	plea that an order of detention is not in accordance
with the  provisions of	 law or	 is mala fide is outside the
purview of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2245">Art. 359"</a> clause (1) and would not be barred even
by an  unconditional Presidential  order such  as the one we
have in the present case.
</p><p id="p_1025">     This distinguishing  feature of  Makhan  Singh's  case.
(supra) was.  in fact  highlighted  and	 emphasised  in	 the
subsequent decision  of this  Court in	<a href="/doc/1740805/" id="a_2246">A. Nambiar  v. Chief
Secretary</a>.(1).	There  Gajendragadkar,	C.J.,  stressed	 the
conditional nature  of	the  Presidential  order  dated	 3rd
November, 1962 and indicated that it was in view of the last
clause	of   the  Presidential	Order,	that  the  aforesaid
observations were made by this Court in Makhan Singh's case.
The learned  Chief Justice  explained the  position  in	 the
following words .
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_266">	  "<a href="/doc/1335930/" id="a_2247">In Makhan Singh Tarsikka v. The State of Punjab</a> a
     Special  Bench  of	 this  Court  has  had	occasion  to
     consider the  effect of  the Proclamation	of Emergency
     issued by the President and the Presidential order with
     which we  are concerned in the present writ petitions.-
     this Court	 took the precaution of pointing out that as
     a	result	of  the	 issue	of  the	 1  Proclamation  of
     Emergency and  the Presidential  order, a citizen would
     not be  deprived of  his right  to move the appropriate
     court for	a writ	of habeas  corpus on the ground that
     his detention has been ordered mala fide. Similarly, it
     was pointed  out that  if a  detenu contends  that	 the
     operative provisions  of the Defence of India ordinance
     under which  he is	 detained suffer  from the  vice  of
     excessive delegation,  the	 plea  thus  raised  by	 the
     detenu cannot,  at the  threshold, be said to be barred
     by the Presidential order, because, in terms, it is not
     a plea  which is  relateable to  the fundamental rights
     specified in the said order.</blockquote>
<p id="p_1026">     Let us  refer to  two other  pleas which  may not	fall
within the purview of the Presidential Order. If the detenu,
who is	detained under an order passed under Rule 30(1) (b),
contends that  the said	 order has been passed by a delegate
outside the  authority conferred  on him  by the appropriate
Government under  s. 40	 of the	 Defence of India Act, or it
has  been  exercised,  inconsistently  with  the  conditions
prescribed in  that behalf.,  a preliminary  bar against the
competence or  the detenu's  petition cannot be raised under
the Presidential  order, because  the  last  clause  of	 the
Presidential order  would not  cover such  a  petition,	 and
there is  no doubt that unless the case falls under the last
clause of  the Presidential  order, the	 bar created  by  it
cannot	be   successfully  invoked   against   cl   decided.
Therefore, our	conclusion is  that the	 learned  Additional
Solicitor-General is  not justified  in contending  that the
present petitions  are incompetent  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2248">Art. 32</a> because of
the Presidential  Order. The  petitioners contend  that	 the
relevant Rule under which the
     (1) [1966] 2 S. C. R. 106.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_277">458</span>
<p id="p_1027">     impugned orders  of  detention  have  been	 passed,  is
     invalid on	 grounds other than those based on Arts. 14,
     19, 21  and 22"  and if  that plea is well-founded, the
     last clause  of the presidential Order is not satisfied
     and the  bar created  by it  suspending  the  citizens'
     fundamental rights	 under Articles 14, 21 and 22 cannot
     be pressed into service."
</p><p id="p_1028">These observations, and particularly the portions underlined
by me,	clearly show-that  it was because of the conditional
nature of  the Presidential  Order that	 the view  was taken
that if	 a detenue  contents that the order of detention has
been made mala fide or that it has been passed by a delegate
outside the authority conferred on him under the Act or that
it has	been exercised	inconsistently with  the  conditions
prescribed in that behalf", that is, it is not in accordance
with the  provisions of law, such a plea would not be barred
at the	threshold by the Presidential order. The conditional
nature of  the Presidential  order was also stressed by this
Court  in   <a href="/doc/850821/" id="a_2249">State  of  Maharashtra  v.	Prabhakar  Pandurang
Sangzgiri</a>(1) where  this Court,	 speaking through Subba Rao,
J., pointed  out that  in view	of the	last  cause  of	 the
Presidential  order,  "if  a  person  was  deprived  of	 his
personal liberty  nor under  the Act or a rule or order made
thereunder, but	 in contravention thereof, his right to move
the said  courts", that	 is the	 High Court  and the Supreme
Court "in that regard would not be suspended'.
</p><p id="p_1029">     lt was  then contended on behalf of the detenus that in
any event  the right  of personal liberty is a natural right
which inheres  in every one from the moment of his birth and
this right  can always be enforced by the detenus under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2250">Art.
226</a> by	a writ	"for any other purpose" and the Presidential
order does  not operate	 as a  bar. When,  in answer to this
contention the	Union of  India and  the  State	 Governments
relied on  High Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru
v. State  of. Kerala,(2)  the detenus  urged that Kesavanand
Bharati's case	(supra) did not say that there is no natural
right inhering	in a  person, but  all that it said was that
natural rights	do not	stand in the way of amendment of the
Constitution. Kesavanand Bharati's case (supra) according to
the  detenus,	did   not   negative   the   existence	 and
enforceability of natural rights. But this contention of the
detenus is  clearly  belied  by	 the  observation  from	 the
judgments of  at  last	seven  of  the	judges	who  decided
Kesavanand Bharati's  case (supra). Ray, C. J. said at pages
419 of	the Report: "Fundamental rights are conferred by the
Constitution.  There   are  no	 natural  rights  under	 our
Constitution." Palekar,	 J., also  said at  page 594  of the
Report: "The so called natural rights-have in course of time
lost their  utility as	such in	 the fast changing world and
are recognised in modern political constitutions only to the
extent that  organised society	is able to respect them." So
also Khanna, J. said at page 703 of the Report: "- the later
writers have  generally taken  the view	 that natural rights
have no	 proper place  outside the constitution and the laws
of the	State. It  is up to the State to incorporate natural
rights, or such
     (1) [1966] I S. C. R. 702.
</p><p id="p_1030">     (2) [1963] Supp. S. C. R. 1.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_278">459</span>
<p id="p_1031">of them	 as  are  deemed  essential,  and  subject  to	such
limitations  as	  are	considered   appropriate,   in	 the
constitution of	 the laws  made by  it. But independently of
the constitution  and the  laws of the State, natural rights
can have  no legal sanction and cannot be enforced." Mathew,
J., too,  spoke to  the same effect when he said at page 814
of the	Report: 'Although  called 'rights', they are not per
se enforceable	in courts  unless recognised by the positive
law of	a State".  Beg, J.  also discounted  the  theory  of
natural rights	at pages  881 and  882	of  the	 Report	 and
Dwivedi, J.  Observed at  page 910  of the  Report  that  to
regard fundamental  rights as  natural rights  overlooks the
fact that  some of  These rights  did not  exist before	 the
Constitution and  "were begotten  by our  specific  national
experience". Chandrachud, J., was equally emphatic in saying
at pages  975 and 976 of the Report that "There is intrinsic
evidence in  Part III  of the  Constitution to show that the
theory.	 Of   natural  rights  was  not	 recognised  by	 our
constitution-makers-The natural theory stands, by and large,
repudiated today-The  belief is now widely held that natural
rights have  no other  than  political	value".	 It  may  be
pointed out that Subba Rao, J., also in l.<a href="/doc/120358/" id="a_2251">C. GolakNath &amp; Ors
v. Slate of Punjab</a>(1) at page 789 of the Report rejected the
theory	of   natural  rights   independent  and	 apart	from
fundamental rights  in Part  III. He  said:  '.	 Fundamental
rights are  the modern name for what have been traditionally
known as  natural rights". There is, therefore, no scope for
the  contention	  that	even   if  the	enforcement  of	 the
Fundamental right  conferred by	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2252">Article 21</a>  is suspended by
the Presidential  order, the  detenu  can  still  enforce  a
supposed natural  right of  personal liberty  in a  court of
law.
</p><p id="p_1032">     I may  also refer	to one	other argument	advanced  on
behalf of  the detenus that in any event the right not to be
deprived of personal liberty except by authority of law is a
statutory  right   which  can	be  enforced   despite	 the
Presidential order  suspending enforcement  of the  right of
personal liberty  guaranteed under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2253">Article 21.</a>	 I agree and
there can  be no  doubt about it that if the positive law of
the State  decrees that	 no person  shall be deprived of his
personal  liberty   except  according	to   the   procedure
prescribed by  law, the enforcement of such  statutory right
would not  be barred  by the  Presidential order.  But 1  am
afraid, the  premise on	 which this  argument is  founded is
incorrect. There  is no	 legislation in	 which country which
confers the  right of  personal liberty	 by  providing	that
there shall  be no  deprivation of  it except  in accordance
with law.  On the contrary, section 18 of the Maintenance of
Internal Security Act, 1971 enacts that no person in respect
of whom	 an order  of detention	 is made  or purported to be
made under  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2254">section 3</a>  shall  have  any	 right	to  personal
liberty by  virtue of natural law or common law. if any. The
Indian Panel  Code in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2255">section 342</a> undoubtedly makes it penal
to wrongfully confine any person and the offence of wrongful
confinement postulates	that no one shall be deprived of his
personal liberty  except by  authority of  law. But  it	 can
hardly be said on that acount that <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_2256">section 342</a> of the Indian
Penal Code  confers a  right of personal liberty. The utmost
that can  be  said  is	that  this  section  proceeds  on  a
recognition of the right of personal
     (1) [1967] 2 S. C. R. 762.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_279">460</span>
<p id="p_1033">liberty enacted	 in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2257">Article  21</a> and  makes it  an offence to
wrongfully confine a person in breach of the right conferred
by that constitutional provision.
</p><p id="p_1034">     Then I  must refer	 to  one  other	 contention  of	 the
detenus and that is that the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2258">Article 226</a> can be
invoked not  only for  the purpose  of	enforcement  of	 the
fundamental rights,  but also "for any other purpose". These
words greatly enlarge the jurisdiction of the High Court and
the High Court can issue a writ of habeas corpus if it finds
that the  detention of	a  person  is  illegal.	 It  is	 not
necessary for this purpose that the court should be moved by
the detenu.  It is  sufficient if  it is moved by any person
affected by  the order of detention. When it is so moved and
it examines  the legality of the order of detention, it does
not enforce the right of personal liberty of the detenu, but
it merely  keeps the  executive within the bounds of law and
enforces the  principle of  legality. The  remedy of  habeas
corpus is  a remedy  in public	law and	 hence it  cannot be
excluded by  suspension of  enforcement of  the right  of an
individual. This  contention of	 the detenus does appear, at
first sight,  to be quite attractive, but I am afraid, it is
not  well  founded.  It	 fails	to  take  into	account	 the
substance of  the matter.  When an  applicant moves the High
Court for  a  writ  of	habeas	corpus,	 he  challenges	 the
legality of  the order of detention on the ground that it is
not in	accordance with	 law. That challenge proceeds on the
basis that  the executive  cannot deprive  a person  of	 his
personal liberty  except by authority of law and that is why
the order  of detention is bad. But once it is held that the
obligation of  the executive  not to deprive a person of his
personal liberty  except in  accordance with  law is  to  be
found only  in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2259">Article	21</a> and no where else, it must follow
necessarily  that,   in	 challenging  the  legality  of	 the
detention, what	 the  applicant	 claims	 is  that  there  is
infraction by the executive of the right of persona] liberty
conferred under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2260">Article 21</a> and that immediately attracts the
applicability of  the Presidential  order. If we look at the
substance of  the matter and analyse what is it exactly that
the High  Court is invited to do, it will be clear that what
the applicant  wants the  High Court  to do  is	 to  examine
whether the executive has carried out the obligation imposed
upon it	 by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2261">Article  21</a> not  to	 deprive  a  person  of	 his
persona]  liberty   except  according	to   the   procedure
prescribed by  law and	if it  finds that  the executive has
failed to  comply with	this obligation, then to strike down
the order  of detention.  That	is  precisely  what  is	 not
permitted to  be done  by the  Presidential  order,  for  it
plainly amounts	 to enforcement	 of the	 right	of  personal
liberty conferred  by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2262">Article	21.</a>  The  words	 "any  other
purpose"  cannot   be  availed	 of  for   the	purpose	  of
circumventing the constitutional inhibition flowing from the
Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_1035">     It is  necessary to  point out that <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2263">Art. 359</a> clause (1)
and the	 Presidential order  issued under it do not have the
effect of  making unlawful  actions of the executive lawful.
There can  be no doubt that the executive is bound to act in
accordance with	 law and cannot that the command of law. The
executive cannot  also act  to the  detriment  of  a  person
without authority  of law  or except in accordance with law.
If the	executive takes any action which is not supported by
law or is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_280">461</span>
contrary  to  law,  its	 action	 would	be  unlawful..	This
unlawful characteristic	 of the action is not obliterated by
the Presidential  order issued	under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2264">Art.  359</a> clause	(1).
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2265">Article 359</a>,  clause (1)  and the  Presidential Order issued
under it  do not give any power to the executive to alter or
suspend or  flout the  law nor	do they enlarge the power of
the executive  so as  to permit	 it to	go  beyond  what  is
sanctioned by  law They merely suspend the right of a person
to move any court for redress against the unlawful action of
the executive,	if his	claim involves enforcement of any of
the fundamental	 rights specified in the Presidential order.
This is	 a position  akin in  some respects  to that  in the
United States  when the	 privilege of  the  writ  of  habeas
corpus is suspended under Art. l, Placitium 9, clause (2) of
the United States Constitution and in Great Britain when the
Habeas Corpus  Suspension Act  is passed. It must inevitably
follow from  this position  that as  soon as  the  emergency
comes to  an end  and the  Presidential order  ceases lo  be
operative, the	unlawful action	 of  the  executive  becomes
actionable and	the citizen  is entitled  to challenge it by
moving a court of law.
</p><p id="p_1036">     It will  be clear from what is stated above that whilst
a Presidential order issued under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2266">Article 359</a>, clause (1) is
in operation,  the rule	 of law	 is not	 obliterated and  it
continues to  operate in  all its  vigour. The	executive is
bound to  observe and  obey the	 law and it cannot ignore or
disregard it.  If the executive commits a breach of the law,
its action would be unlawful, but merely the remedy would be
temporarily barred  where it  involves enforcement of any of
the fundamental	 rights specified in the Presidential order.
This would  be obvious	if we  consider what  would  be	 the
position under	the criminal law. If the executive detains a
person contrary to law or shoots him dead without justifying
circumstances, it  would clearly  be an	 offence of wrongful
confinement in	one case and murder in the other, punishable
under the  relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2267">	of the	Indian	Penal  Code</a>,
unless the  case  falls	 within	 the  protective  mantle  of
<a href="/doc/186146/" id="a_2268">section 76</a>  or 79 and the officer who is responsible for the
offence would  be liable  to be	 prosecuted, if	 there is no
procedural bar	built by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2269">  the  Code</a>  of	 Criminal  Procedure
against the initiation of such prosecution. The Presidential
order suspending the enforcement of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2270">Article 21</a> would not bar
such a	prosecution and	 the remedy  under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2271"> the	Indian Penal
Code</a> would  be very  much available. The offence of wrongful
confinement or	murder is an offence against the society and
any one can set the criminal law in motion for punishment of
the offender. When a person takes proceedings under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2272"> the Code</a>
of Criminal  Procedure in  connection with  the	 offence  of
wrongful confinement or murder or launches a prosecution for
such  offence,	he  cannot  be	said  to  be  enforcing	 the
fundamental right  of the  detenu or  the murdered man under
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2273">Article	 21</a>   so  as   to  attract  the	 inhibition  of	 the
Presidential order.
</p><p id="p_1037">     So also,  if a  positive legal  right is conferred on a
person by legislation and he seeks to enforce it in a court,
it would  not be  within the  inhibition of  a	Presidential
order issued  under <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2274">Article 359</a>, clause(1). Take for example
the class  of cases  of detention  where no  declaration has
been made  under sub-sections  (2) and	(3) of	<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2275">section 16A</a>.
This category  would cover  cases where	 orders of detention
have been passed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_281">462</span>
prior to June 25, 1975, because in such cases no declaration
under subsections  (2) or (3) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2276">section 16A</a> is contemplated
and it	would also  cover the rather exceptional cases where
orders of  detention have  been made  after 25th  June, 1975
without a  declaration under  sub-section (2) or sub-section
(3) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2277">section 16A</a>. <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2278">Sections 8</a> to <a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_2279">12</a> would continue to apply
in such cases and consequently the detaining authority would
be under  an obligation	 to refer  the case of the detenu to
the Advisory  Board and	 if the	 Advisory Board reports that
there  is  in  its  opinion  no	 sufficient  cause  for	 the
detention of the detenu, the State Government would be bound
to revoke  the detention order and release the detenu. 'That
is the plain requirement of sub-section (2) of section. Now?
suppose that  in such  a case  the State Government fails to
revoke the  detention order and release the detenu in breach
of its	statutory or  obligation under	sub-section  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_2280">section 12</a>.  Can  the  detenu  not  enforce  this  statutory
obligation by  filing a	 petition for  writ of mandamus, The
answer must  obviously be:  he can.  When he  files  such  a
petition for  a writ  of mandamus, he would be enforcing his
statutory right	 under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_2281">section 12</a> and the
enforcement of such statutory right would not be barred by a
Presidential order  specifying <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2282">Article 21.</a> T he Presidential
order would have no operation where a detenu is relying upon
a provision of law to enforce a legal right conferred on him
and is	not complaining of absence of legal authority in the
matter of deprivation of his personal liberty.
</p><p id="p_1038">     I may  also refer	by way	of another  illustration  to
<a href="/doc/571025/" id="a_2283">section 57</a>  of the  Code of  Criminal Procedure	 Code, 1973.
This section provides that no police officer shall retain in
custody a  person arrested  without  warrant  for  a  longer
period	than   under  all   the	 circumstances	of  case  is
reasonable, and	 such period  shall not, in the absence of a
special order  of a  magistrate under <a href="/doc/593844/" id="a_2284">section 167</a>, exceed 24
hours exclusive	 of the	 time necessary for the journey from
the place  of arrest  to the  magistrate's court.  There  is
clearly a legal injunction enacted by this section requiring
a police officer not to detain an arrested person in custody
for a  period longer  than  24	hours  without	obtaining  a
special order  of a  magistrate and  to release	 him on	 the
expiration of  such period  of 24  hours, if in the meantime
such special  order is not obtained. If, in a given case, an
arrested person is detained in custody by the police officer
for a period longer than 24 hours without obtaining an order
of a  magistrate, can he not apply to the magistrate that he
should be  directed to	be released  by the  police  officer
under <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_2285">section  57</a> ? Would such an application be barred by a
Presidential order  specifying <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2286">Art.  21?</a> I  do not think so.
When the arrested person makes such an application, he seeks
to enforce  a statutory	 obligation imposed  on	 the  police
officer and  a statutory  right created	 in  his  favour  by
<a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_2287">section 57</a>  and that  would not	 be barred,  because what is
suspended by  a Presidential order specifying <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2288">Art. 21</a> is the
right to  move the  court for enforcement of the fundamental
right conferred	 by that  Article and  not the right to move
the court  for enforcement  of the  statutory  right  to  be
released granted under <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_2289">section 57</a>.
</p><p id="p_1039">     I may  take still	another example	 to  illustrate	 the
point I	 am making.  Take a case where an order of detention
has been  made without a declaration under subsection (2) or
sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2290">section 16A</a>).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_282">463</span>
<p id="p_1040"><a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2291">Sections 8</a>  to <a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_2292">12</a>  would admittedly apply in such a case and
under<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2293"> s.  8</a>, A	the detaining  authority would	be bound  to
communicate to	the detenu the grounds on which the order of
detention has  been made  and to  afford  him  the  earliest
opportunity of	making a  representation to  the appropriate
government. If,	 in a  given case,  the detaining  authority
declines to  furnish the  grounds of detention to the detenu
or to  afford him an opportunity of making a representation,
in violation  of the  statutory right conferred on him under
s. 8,  can be  detenu not  enforce this	 statutory right  by
filing a  petition  for	 a  writ  of  mandamus	against	 the
detaining authority  ? Would  it be  any answer	 to such  an
application that  the enforcement  of the  fundamental right
conferred by  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_2294">Art. 22</a>,	clause (5) has been suspended by the
Presidential order? The answer is plainly: no. There are two
rights which  the detenu  has in this connection: one is the
fundamental right  conferred by	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_2295">Art. 22</a>, clause (5) and the
other is the statutory right conferred by art 22. Though the
contention of  both these  rights is  the  same,  they	have
distinct  and	independent  existence	and  merely  because
enforcement of	one is	suspended, it does not mean that the
other also  cannot be  enforced. The  'theory of reflection'
which found  favour with  the Kerala  High Court  in <a href="/doc/1087462/" id="a_2296">Fathima
Beebi v. M. K. Ravindranathan</a>(l) is clearly erroneous. I the
right conferred	 under	s.  8  were  ;1	 reflection  of	 the
fundamental right conferred by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_2297">Article 22</a>, clause (S) as the
Kerala High  Court would have us believe, the removal of the
fundamental right under <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_2298">Article 22</a>, clause (S), which is the
object reflected,  must necessarily result in the effacement
of the right under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2299">section 8</a> which is said to constitute the
reflection. But	 even if  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_2300">Article 22</a> clause (S) were deleted
from the  Constitution, <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2301">section	 8</a> would still remain on the
statute	 book	until  repealed	  by  the  legislature.	 The
Presidential order  would not, therefore, bar enforcement of
the right conferred by <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2302">section 8</a>.
</p><p id="p_1041">To my  mind, it	 is  clear  that  if  a	 petition  or  other
proceeding in  court seeks to enforce a positive legal right
conferred by some legislation, it would not be barred by the
Presidential order.  I may  also  point	 out  that,  in	 the
present case,  if I  had  taken	 the  view  that  there	 is.
independently and  apart from  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2303">Article 21</a>,  a  distinct	 and
separate right not to be deprived of personal liberty except
according to  law, I  would have held, without the slightest
hesitation,   that   the   Presidential	  order	  suspending
enforcement of the fundamental right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2304">Article 21</a>
does not  have the  effect of suspending enforcement or this
distinct and  separate legal right. But since I have come to
the conclusion, for reasons already discussed, that there is
no such	 distinct and  separate right  of  personal  liberty
apart from  and existing  side by  side with  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2305">Article 21</a>, it
must be held that when a detenu claims that his detention is
not under  the Act  or in  accordance with  it, he  seeks to
enforce the  fundamental right	conferred by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2306">Article 21</a> and
that is	 barred by  the Presidential  order. Of course, this
does not  mean that whenever a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus	comes	before	the   Court,  it  must	be  rejected
straightaway without  even looking  at the averments made in
it. The	 Court would have to consider whether the bar of the
Presidential Order  is attracted  and for  that purpose, the
Court would  have to  see whether  the order of detention is
one made by an authority empowered to pass
     (I) (1975) Cr. I. L. J. 1164.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_283">464</span>
<p id="p_1042">     such an order under the Act; if it is not, it would not
be State  action and  the petition  would  not	be  one	 for
enforcement of	the right  conferred by	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2307">Article 21.</a> On this
view in	 regard to  the interpretation of the constitutional
provision, it  is unnecesasry  to go  into the	question  of
construction and validity of <a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_2308">section 18</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_1043">     It was  strongly urged upon us that if we take the view
that the  Presidential order  bars the	right of a person to
move a	court even  when his  detention is otherwise than in
accordance with	 law,  there  would  be	 no  remedy  against
illegal detention.  That would	encourage the  executive  to
disregard the  law and	exercise arbitrary powers of arrest.
The result  would be-so	 ran the  argument-that the  citizen
would be  at the  mercy of the executive: every one would be
living in  a state of constant apprehension that he might at
any time be arrested and detained: personal liberty would be
at an  end and	our cherished  values destroyed.  Should  we
accept a construction with such fearful consequences was the
question posed	before us. An impassioned appeal was made to
us to save personal liberty against illegal encroachments 'l
by the executive. We were exhorted to listen to the voice of
judicial conscience  as if judicial conscience were a blithe
spirit like  Shelley's Skylark free to sing and soar without
any compulsions.  I do	not think  I can  allow myself to be
deflected by  such considerations  from arriving  at what  I
consider   to	be   the   correct   construction   of	 the
constitutional provision. The apprehensions and fears voiced
on behalf of the detenus may not altogether be ruled out. It
impossible  that   when	 past	powers	are  vested  in	 the
executive, the	exercise of  which is  immune from  judicial
scrutiny, they may sometimes be abuse d and innocent persons
may be	consigned to temporary detention. But merely because
power may  sometimes be	 abused, it is no ground for denying
the existence  of the  power. All  power  is  likely  to  be
abused.	 That  is  inseparable	from  the  nature  of  human
institutions. The  wisdom of  man has  not yet	been able to
conceive of a government with power sufficient to answer its
legitimate end	and at	the same time incapable of mischief.
In the	last analysis a great deal must depend on the wisdom
and honesty,,  integrity' and  character of  those  who	 are
incharge of  administration and the existence of enlightened
and alert  public opinion.  It was  Lord Wright	 who said in
Liversidge v. Siglov Anderson (supra) that "the safeguard of
British liberty	 is in	the good  sense of the people and in
the system  of	representative	and  responsible  government
which has been evolved."
</p><p id="p_1044">     It is  true that,	if, in	a  situation  of  emergency,
judicial scrutiny  into legality  of detention is held to be
barred	by  a  Presidential  order  specifying	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2309">Article	 21</a>,
illegalities might conceivably be committed by the executive
in  exercise   of  the	 power	of  detention  and  unlawful
detentions might  be made  against which  there would  be no
possibility of	redress. The  danger may not be dismissed as
utterly imaginary,  but even  so, the fact remains that when
there is crisis-situation arising out of an emergency, it is
necessary to  best the Government with extra-ordinary powers
in order  to enable it to overcome such crisis-situation and
restore normal conditions. Even Harold Laski conceded in his
article on "Civil Liberties in Great Britain in Wartime that
"the  necessity-   of  concentrating   immense	power  in  a
Government waging total war is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_284">465</span>
beyond discussion"  and	 what  he  said	 there	regarding  a
Government A waging total war must apply equally in relation
to a  Government engaged  in meeting  internal subversion or
disturbance, for  the two  stand on the same footing, so far
as our	Constitution is concerned. Now, when vast powers are
conferred on  the executive  and judicial  scrutiny into the
legality of  exercise of  such powers is excluded" it is not
unlikely  that	 illegalities  might  be  committed  by	 the
executive in  its efforts to deal with the crisis situation.
Dicey, in  his "Introduction  to the  study of	Law  of	 the
Constitution" frankly  admits that  it	is  "almost  certain
that, when  the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act makes it
possible for  the Government  to keep suspected persons in a
prison for  a length of time without bringing them to trial,
a smaller  or  greater	number	of  unlawful  acts  will  be
committed, if  not be the members of Ministry themselves, it
any rate  by their  agents." But  howsoever unfortunate this
situation might	 be, that cannot be helped. The Constitution
permits judicial  scrutiny to  be  barred  during  times  of
emergency, because it holds that when a crisis arises in the
life of	 the nation,  the  rights  of  individuals  must  be
postponed to  considerations of	 State and  national  safety
must override any other considerations. I may add that there
is nothing  very  unusual  in  this  situation	because?  as
already pointed	 out above,, such a situation is contemplate
even in	 countries like	 the United  States of	America	 and
Great Britain  which are  regarded as bastions of democracy.
But at	the same time it must be remembered by the executive
that, because  judicial	 scrutiny  for	the  time  being  is
excluded, its responsibility in the exercise of the power of
detention is  all the  greater. The  executive is  under  an
added obligation to take care to see that it acts within the
four corner  of the law and its actions are beyond reproach.
It must	 guard against misuse or abuse of power, for, though
such misuse  or abuse  may yield  short-term gains,  it is a
lesson of  history which  should  never	 be  forgotten	that
ultimately means have a habit of swallowing up ends.
</p><p id="p_1045">     Before I  leave this question, I may point out that, in
taking the  view 1  have, T  am not  unaware  of  the  prime
importance of  the rule	 of law	 which, since  the  dawn  of
political  history,   I	 both  in  India  of  Brahadaranyaka
Uunishad  and  Greece  of  Aristotle,  has  tamed  arbitrary
exercise of  power by  the government and constitutes one of
the basic tenets of constitutionalism. I am not unmindful of
the famous  words of  Lord Atkin  in his powerful dissent in
Liversidge v.  Anderson(supra) that  "amid the clash of arms
and much  more so  in a	 situation of emergency arising from
threat of internal subversion-"laws are not silent. They may
be changed,  but they  speak the same language in war and in
peace". I  am also  conscious-and if  I may once again quote
the words  of that  great libertarian  Judge "Judges  are no
respector of  persons and  stand between the subject and any
attempted encroachments	 on his	 liberty by  the  executive,
alert to  see that any coercive action is justified in law".
But at	the same  time it  cant be  overlooked that,  in the
ultimate analysis,  the protection  of persona]	 liberty and
the supremacy  of law  which sustains it must be governed by
the constitution  itself. The  Constitution is the paramount
and supreme  law of  the land  and if it says that even if a
person is  detained otherwise  than in	accordance with	 the
law, he	 shall not  be entitled	 to  enforce  his  right  of
personal liberty, whilst a Presidential order under
  3 2-833SCI/76
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_285">466</span>
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_2310">Article 359</a>,  clause (l) specifying <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2311">Article 21</a> is in force I
have to give effect to it. Sitting as l do, as a Judge under
the constitution,  I cannot  ignore the	 plain and  emphatic
concerned of  the Constitution	or what I may consider to be
necessary to  meet the	end of	justice. It is said that law
has the	 feminine capacity to tempt each devotee to find his
own image  in her bosom. No One escapes entirely. Some yield
badly, some  with sophistication.  Only a  few more  or less
effectively resist.  I	have  always  leaned  in  favour  of
upholding personal liberty, for, I believe, it is one of the
most cherished	values of mankind. Without it life would not
be worth living. It is one of the pillars of free democratic
society. Men have readily laid down their lives at is altar,
in order  to secure it, protect it and preserve it. But I do
not think  it would  be right  for me  W allow	my  love  of
personal liberty  to cloud  my vision  or to  persuade me to
place on  the  relevant	 provision  of	the  constitution  a
construction which  its language  cannot reasonably  bear. I
cannot assume  to myself  the role  of	Plato's	 Philosopher
king's in  order to  render what  I consider  ideal  justice
between	 the   citizen	and   the  State.   After  all"	 the
Constitution is the law of all laws and there alone judicial
conscience must	 find its  ultimate support  ,and its  final
resting	 place.	 It  is	 in  this  spirit  of  humility	 and
obedience  to	the  Constitution  and	driven	by  judicial
compulsion, that  I have  come to  the conclusion  that	 the
Presidential   order	dated	27th	June,	1975	bars
maintainability of  a writ  petition for habeas corpus there
an order of detention is challenged on the ground that it is
mala fide or not under the Act or not in compliance with it.
</p><p id="p_1046">     On the  view I have taken in regard to the answer to be
given to  the first  question, it  would be  unnecessary  to
consider the  second question, but since the second question
has been  debated fully	 and elaborate arguments have been l
advanced before	 us touching not only the interpretation but
also the  validity of  sub-section (9) (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2312">section 16A</a>, I
think it will be desirable if I pronounce my opinion on this
question as well. But before I proceed to do sot, I may make
it clear  once again  that though this question is framed in
general terms and so framed it invites the Court to consider
the area  of judicial  security in  a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus,	it is  not really  necessary to	 embark on a
consideration of  this issue,  since it	 was conceded by the
learned Attorney  General, and	in my  opinion rightly, that
the area  of judicial scrutiny remains the same as laid down
in  the	 decision  of  this  Court,  subject  only  to	such
diminution or  curtailment as  may be  made  by	 sub-section
(9)(a) of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2313">section 16A</a>.	 The  learned  Additional  Solicitor
General , who argued this question on behalf of the Union of
India, took  us through	 various decisions of English courts
on the	issue as  to what  is the nature of the jurisdiction
which the  Courts on  the issue	 as to what is the nature of
the jurisdiction which the Court exercises in a petition for
a writ	of habeas  corpus, and	what is	 the manner in which
such jurisdiction must be exercised. it is not necessary for
the purpose because the practice in our country in regard to
the exercise  of this  jurisdiction , as it has evolved over
the years  as a	 result of the decisions of this Court, is a
little different from that prevailing in England. This court
has never  insisted on	strict rules  of pleading  in  cases
involving the  liberty of a person nor placed undue emphasis
on the question as to on whom the burden of proof lies. Even
a postcard written by a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_286">467</span>
detenu from  jail has been sufficient to activise this Court
into examining	the legality  of detention.  This Court	 has
consistently shown  great anxiety  for personal	 liberty and
refused to throw out a petition merely on the ground that it
does not  disclose a prima facie case invalidating The order
of detention.  Whenever a  petition for	 a  writ  of  habeas
corpus	has  come  up  before  this  Court,  it	 has  almost
invariably  issued   a	rule   calling	upon  the  detaining
authority to  justify the  detention.  This  Court  has	 any
occasions point	 out that  when a  rule	 is  issued,  it  is
incumbent on  the detaining  authority to  satisfy the Court
that the  detention  of	 the  petitioner  is  legal  and  in
conformity with	 the mandatory	provisions of  the Act. Vide
Naranjan Singh	v. State  of Madhya pradesh,(1) Saikh hanif,
<a href="/doc/1861036/" id="a_2314">Gudma Majhi  &amp; Kamal  Saha v.  State of	 West Bengal</a> (2) and
<a href="/doc/1760305/" id="a_2315">Dulal Roy  v. The  District Magistrate, Burdwan ors</a>.(3) . It
has also  been insisted by this court that, in answer to the
Rule, the  detaining authority	must place  all the relevant
facts before  the Court	 which would show that the detention
is in  accordance with	the detention  is in  accordance the
provisions of  the Act.	 It would be no argument on the part
of the	detaining authority to say that particular ground is
not taken  in the petition . vide <a href="/doc/1302010/" id="a_2316">Nizamuddin v. The State of
West Bengal</a>  .(4) Once the Rule is issued, it is the bounden
duty of the Court to satisfy itself that  all the safeguards
provided by  law have  been  scruplously  observed  and	 the
citizen is  not deprived  of his  personal liberty otherwise
than in	 accordance with  law. Vide  Mohd. Alam	 v. State of
West Bengal  (5) and  Khudiram Das v. state of West Bengal &amp;
Ors.(6) This  practice marks  a slight	departure from	that
obtaining in  England but  it has been adopted by this court
in view of the peculiar socio-economic conditions prevailing
in the	country. Where	large masses  of  people  are  poor,
illiterate and ignorant and access to the courts is not easy
on account  of lack  of financial resources it would be most
unreasonable to	 insist that  the petitioner  should set out
clearly and  specifically the grounds on which he challenges
the order  of detention	 and make  our a prima facie case in
support of  those grounds  before a rule can be issued on he
petition  and	when  the  Rule	 is  issued,  the  detaining
authority should  not be  liable to  do any  thing more than
just meet  the specific	 grounds of challenge put forward by
the petitioner	in the	petition. Of  course, I must make it
clear that where an order of detention is challenged as mala
fide, a	 clear and  specific averment  to that	effect would
have to	 be made  in the petition and in the absence of such
averment, the  court would  not entertain  the plea  of mala
fide. The  petitioner would  have to  make out a prima facie
case of	 mala fide  before the	detaining authority  can  be
called upon  to meet it. Whether a prima facie case has been
made out  or not  would depend	on the	particular facts and
circumstances of  each case,  but the  test would be whether
the prima  facie case  made out is of such a nature that the
Court feels that it requires  investigation. The Court would
then investigate  and decide   the  question of mala fide on
the basis  of the  material which may be placed before it by
both parties.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_287">468</span>
<p id="p_1047">     What is the area of judicial scrutiny in a petition for
a writ	of habeas corpus has been laid down by this Court is
numerous decisions.  It is  not necessary  to refer  to	 all
these decisions, since there is one recent decision, namely,
<a href="/doc/679149/" id="a_2317">Khudiram Das  v. State	of West	 Bengal</a>	 (supra)  where	 the
entire law  on the  subject has	 been reviewed by a Bench of
four judges!  of  this	Court.	There,	the  effect  of	 the
previous decisions  has been considered and the law has been
summarised at  pages 843 to 845 of the Report in a judgement
delivered by  me on  behalf of	the Court.  I have carefully
listened to  the most elaborate arguments advanced before us
in  this   case	 and  even  after  giving  my  most  serious
consideration to  them, I still adhere to all that I said in
Khudiram Das's	case (supra). I maintain that the subjective
satisfaction of	 the detaining	authority is  liable  to  be
subjected to  judicial scrutiny on the grounds enumerated by
me in  Khudiram Das's  case  (supra)  and  the	decision  in
Khudiram Das's	case(supra) lays down the correct law on the
subject. The  only question  is: how  far and to what extent
sub-section (9)	 (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2318">section 16A</a> has encroached upon this
area of judicial scrutiny and whether it is a valid piece of
legislation.
</p><p id="p_1048">     Now the first question that arises for consideration is
as to  what is	the correct  interpretation of	<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2319">section 16A</a>,
sub-section (9) (a). That sub-section reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_267">	  "(9) Notwithstanding	anything  contained  in	 any
     other law or any rule having the force of law-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_268">	       (a)  the	  grounds  on  which  all  order  of
     detention is made or purported to be made under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2320">section
     3</a> against	any person  in respect of whom a declaration
     is made  under sub-section	 (2) or	 sub-section (3) and
     any in  formation or materials on which such grounds or
     a declaration under sub-section (2) or a declaration or
     confirmation  under   sub-section	(3)   or  the	non-
     revocation under  sub-section (4)	of a declaration arc
     based, shall  be treated  as confidential	and shall be
     deemed to	refer to  matters of State and to be against
     the public	 inter est to disclose and save as otherwise
     provided in  this	Act,  no  on  shall  communicate  or
     disclose any  such ground,	 information or	 material or
     any document  containing such  ground,  information  or
     material;"
</blockquote><p id="p_1049">the argument  urged on	behalf of  the detenus was that sub-
section (9)  (a) of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2321">section 16A</a>  should be  read  down	 and
construed so  as not  to exclude the power of the High Court
in the	exercise of  its jurisdiction	under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2322">Article 226</a> to
call for the grounds, information and materials on which the
order of  detention is	made and  the declaration under sub-
section (2)  is based  with a  view to	satisfying itself as
regards the legality of the detention. It was pointed out on
behalf of  the detenus	that, unlike  <a href="/doc/1030207/" id="a_2323">section 54</a>  of  Indian
Income-tax Act,	 l 922	and section  14	 of  the  Preventive
Detention Act, 1950, sub-section (9) (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2324">section 16A</a> does
not include any reference to a court and it is clear that it
is not	directed against the Court. Reliance was also placed
on behalf  of the  detenus on the following statement of the
law in	Wigmore on  Evidence (3rd  ed.) vol.  8 at page 801,
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2325">Article 2379:  "</a>Any statute  declaring in general terms that
official records are confidential should
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_288">469</span>
be liberally  construed to  have an  implied  exception	 for
disclosure when	 A needed in court of justice, and reference
was also made to the decision of the English Court in Lee v.
Burrell(1) in support of the proposition that in a statutory
provision, like	 sub-section (9)  (a) of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2326">section  16A</a>,	 the
Court must  read an implied exception in favour of the Court
and particularly  the High  Court exercising  constitutional
Function under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2327">Article 226.</a>  It was also stressed on behalf
of the	detenus that  if a  wider construction	is placed on
sub-section (9)	 (a) of section l 6A taking within its sweep
the High  Court exercising  jurisdiction under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2328">Article 226</a>,
that sub-section would be rendered void as offending <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2329">Article
226</a> and	 hence the  narrower construction  must be preferred
which excludes	the High  Court from the purview of the sub-
section. This  contention, attractive  though  it  may	seem
because it  has the  merit of  saving judicial scrutiny from
being rendered ineffectual and illusory, is not justified by
the plain language of sub-section (9) (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2330">section 16A</a> and
hence, despite	these weighty considerations which have been
pointed out  on behalf	of the detenus, I find myself unable
to accept it.
</p><p id="p_1050">      It  is true  that sub-section  (9) (a)  of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2331">section 16A</a>
does not specifically refer to any court. It does not say in
so many	 terms, as  did <a href="/doc/524221/" id="a_2332">section	 54</a> of the Indian lncome-tax
Act, 1922,  that no  court  shall  require  any	 officer  to
produce before	it the grounds, information and materials on
which the  order of  detention is  made or  the	 declaration
under sub-section  (2) or sub-section (3) is based, nor does
it contain  any provision, like section 14 of the Preventive
Detention Act,	1950 that no court shall allow any statement
to be  made or	any evidence  to be  given of  such grounds,
information and materials. But there is inherent evidence in
the sub-section	 itself to  show  that	it  is	intended  to
prevent	 disclosure   of  such	 grounds,  information	 and
materials  before   a  court.  It  says	 that  the  grounds,
information and materials on which the order of detention is
made or	 the declaration under subsection (2) or sub-section
(3) is	based "shall be treated as confidential and shall be
deemed to refer to matters of State and to be against public
interest to  disclose". There  is clearly  an echo  here  of
<a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_2333">section 123</a>  of the  Indian Evidence  Act. That	 section  is
intended to  prevent disclosure	 in a  court of "unpublished
official records  relating to  and  affairs  of	 State"	 and
likewise, sub-section  (9) (a)	of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2334">section  16A</a> must also be
held  to  be  designed	to  achieve  the  same	end,  namely
prevent, inter alia, disclosure in a court. The words "shall
be treated  as confidential"  and "  shall be  deemed to  be
against	 the   public  interest	  to  disclose"	  are	very
significant. If	 they are  to have  any meaning at all, they
must be construed as prohibiting disclosure even to a Court.
How can	 the grounds,  information and materials referred to
in this	 sub-section remain  'confidential if  they  can  be
required to  be produced  before a  court? How	can they  be
permitted to  be disclosed  to a  court when the legislature
says in	 so many  terms that  it would be against the public

<p id="p_1053">out of	the emergency.	Vide observations  in the  speech of
Lord Wright  at page 266 in Liversidge's case (supra) . Sub-
section (9)  (a) of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2335">section 16A</a>  cannot, therefore, be read
down as	 to imply  an exception in favour of disclosure to a

</p><p id="p_1054">     But then it was contended on behalf of the detenus that
if, on	a proper  construction of  its language, sub-section
(9) (a)	 of sectio 16A precludes the High Court ill exercise
of its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2336">Article 226</a>, from calling  for the
production of  the grounds,  ill formation  and materials on
which the  order of  detention is  made or  the	 declaration
under sub-section  (2) or sub-section (3) is based, it would
impede the  exercise of its constitutional power by the High
Court and  make i-t virtually ineffective and hence it would
be void	 as offending  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2337">Article 226.</a> This contention requires
serious	 consideration.	  Prima	 facie	 it  appears  to  be
formidable, but	 for  reasons  which.  I  shall	 immediately
proceed to state, I do not think it is well founded.
</p><p id="p_1055">     There  can	  be  no   doubt  that	 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2338">Article  226</a>  is  a
constitutional pro  vision and it empowers the High Court to
issue a	 writ  of  habeas  corpus  for	enforcement  of	 the
fundamental right  conferred by	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2339">Article 21</a> and also for any
other purpose. The High Court has, therefore, constitutional
power to  examine the  legality of  detention and  for	that
purpose, to  inquire and  determine whether the detention is
in accordance  with the	 provisions of	law. Now,  obviously
this being  a constitutional  power, it cannot be taken away
or abridged  by a  legislative enactment.  If there  is	 any
legislative  provision	 which	obstructs   of	retards	 the
exercise of  this constitutional  power, it  would be  void.
There arc  several decisions  of this  Court which recognise
and lay	 down this proposition. It was said by this Court in
one of	its early  decisions in	 <a href="/doc/1450722/" id="a_2340">Hari Vishnu  Kamath v. Syed
Ahemad Ishaque &amp; ors</a>.(1) that the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2341">Article

also n	<a href="/doc/937486/" id="a_2342">Durga Shankar  Mehta  v.  Thakur  Raghuraj</a>  singh  &amp;

</p><p id="p_1061">     Now, it is settled law that when a petition for writ of
habeas corpus  filed and a Rule is issued, it is the bounden
duty of	 the Court to satisfy itself that all the safeguards
provided by  law have  been scrupulously  observed  and	 the
liberty of the detenu has not been taken away otherwise than
in accordance  with law,  Vide Khudiram Das v. State of West
Bengal (supra).	 The Court  may	 also  for  the	 purpose  of
satisfying itself as regards the legality of detention, call
for the	 record of  the case  relating to  the detention and
look into  it. That  is what  the Court did in Biren Dutta &amp;
ors v.	Chief Com  missioner of	 Tripura &amp; Anr.(l) There, an
interim order  was made	 by this  Court "directing  that the
Chief  Secretary   to  the   Tripura  Administration   shall
forthwith transmit  to	this  Court  the  original  file  in
respect of  the detenus concerned" since the Court wanted to
satisfy itself	that the  Minister or  the Secretary  or the
Administrator had  reviewed the	 cases of  the	detenus	 and
arrived	 at  a	decision  that	their  detention  should  be
continued. So  also in	<a href="/doc/713534/" id="a_2356">M. M.  Damnoo v. J &amp; K State</a>(2) this
Court required	the State  Government to  produce  the	file
confining the  grounds of  detention so that the Court could
satisfy itself	That "the  grounds on  which the  detenu has
been detained  have relevance to the security of the State".
It would,  therefore, be seen that if there is a legislative
provision  which   prohibits  disclosure   of  the  grounds,
information and materials on which the order of detention is
based and prevents the Court from calling for the production
of  such   grounds,  information  and  materials,  it  would
obstruct and retard the exercise of the constitutional power
of the	High Court  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2357">Article  226</a> and  would be void as
offending that Article.
</p><p id="p_1062">     This was  the basis  on which  section 14	of  the	 The
Preventive detention Act, 1950 was struck down by this court
in A  K Gopalan's  case (supra). That section prohibited the
disclosure of  the grounds  of detention communicated to the
person detained	 and the  representation made by him against
the order  of detention	 and barred  the court from allowing
such  disclosure  to  be  made	except	for  purposes  of  a
prosecution for	 such disclosure. It was held by this Court-
in fact	 by all the judges who participated in the decision-
that this  section was	void as	 it contravene(l  inter alia

</p><p id="p_1066">Patanjali Sastri,  J.,also observed  to the  same effect  at
page 217 of the Report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_269">	  "If the  grounds are	too vague  to enable  him to
     take any such representation, or if they are altogether
     irrelevant to  the object of his detention, or are such
     as to  show that his detention is not bona fide, he has
     the further  right of moving this Court and this remedy
     is also  guaranteed to  his  under	 <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2361">article  32.</a>  These
     rights and	 remedies, the petitioner submits, cannot be
     effectively exercised,  if he  is prevented  on pain of
     prosecution, from	disclosing the grounds to the Court.
     There is  great force  in this contention- The argument
     (of  the	Attorney  General)  overlooks  that  it	 was
     recognised in  the decision  referred to  above that it
     would be  open to	the Court  to examine the grounds of
     detention in order to see whether they were relevant to
     the object	 which the legislature had in view, such as,
     for instance,  the prevention  of acts  prejudicial  to
     public safety and tranquillity, or were such as to show
     that the detention was not bona fide. An examination of
     the grounds  for these  purposes is  made impossible by
     <a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_2362">section 14</a>,  and the  protection  afforded	 by  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_2363">article
     22(5)</a> and	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2364">article 32</a>  is thereby rendered nugatory. It
     follows that  <a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_2365">section 14</a>  contravents the provisions of
     <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_2366">article 22 (S)</a> and <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2367">article 32</a> in so far is it prohibits
     the person	 detained from	disclosing to  the Court the
     grounds of	 his detention	communicated to	 him by	 the
     detaining authority or . the representation made by him
     against the  order of detention, and prevents the Court
     from examining  them for  the purpose aforesaid. and to
     that extent  it must be held under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_2368">article 13 (2)</a> to be
     void." (emphasis supplied).
</blockquote><p id="p_1067">And so	did the	 other learned Judges. It is clear from what
they  said  that  inasmuch  as	<a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_2369">section	 14</a>  prohibited	 the
disclosure of  the grounds  of detention  and prevented	 the
Court from looking at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_292">473</span>
     Them for  the purpose of deciding whether the detention
is legal, it A was violative of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2370">Article 32</a> which conferred a
fundamental right  on  a  detenu  to  move  this  Court	 for
impugning the legality of his detention.
</p><p id="p_1068">     The same view was taken by a Constitution Bench of this
Court in M. M. Damnoo v. J. &amp; K. State (supra). In fact, the
observations of Kania, C. J. in A. K. Gopalan's case (supra)
which I	 have reproduced above, were quoted with approval in
this decision.	The petitioner	in this	 case challenged the
legality of his detention by the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir on
several grounds.  One of the grounds was that the proviso to
<a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_2371">section 8</a>  of the  Jammu &amp;  Kashmir Preventive Detention Act
was  void   as	it   conflicted	 with  section	103  of	 the
Constitution of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. <a href="/doc/192696/" id="a_2372">Section 103</a> was in the same
term as <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2373">Article 226</a> and it conferred power on the High Court
of Jammu  &amp; Kashmir  to issue  after alia  a writ  of habeas
corpus Section	8 of  the Preventive  Detention Act required
the detaining  authority to  communicate to  the detenu	 the
grounds on  which the  order of	 detention was made, but the
proviso to  that section  dispensed with  the requirement in
case of	 "any person  detained with a view to preventing him
from acting  in any  manner pre-judicial  to the security of
the State if the authority making the order-directs that the
person detained may be informed that it would be against the
public interest	 to communicate	 to him the grounds on which
his detention has been made". The argument of the petitioner
was  that  the	proviso	 to  section  8	 of  the  Preventive
Detention  Act	was  violative	of  <a href="/doc/192696/" id="a_2374">section  103</a>,  since  it
debarred the  High Court and this Court from calling for the
grounds of  detention and  thus made it virtually impossible
for the High Court and this Court to examine the legality of
the detention.	This Court agreed that there would have been
some force  in the contention of the petitioner, if the High
Court and  this Court  were prevented  from calling upon the
State Government to produce the grounds of detention, but it
pointed out  that the  proviso to  <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2375">section 8</a>  was not  ultra
vires "because	the proviso  and the Act do not bar the High
Court and  this Court  from looking into the validity of the
detention". This  Court, after referring to the observations
made by	 Kania, C.J.  in A.  K. Gopalan's  case	 (supra)  in
regard to  section 14  of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950
said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_270">	  "But fortunately  there is no similar provision in
     this Act:	and it leaves the High Court and the Supreme
     Court free to exercise the jurisdiction by calling upon
     the State in appropriate cases to produce before it the
     grounds of	 detention and	other material	in order  to
     satisfy itself  that the  detenu was  being detained in
     accordance with  law. If  it were not so, we would have
     difficulty in sustaining the proviso."
</blockquote><p id="p_1069">It will,  therefore, be seen that prima facie this Court was
of the	view that  if the  proviso to <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2376">section 8</a> had debarred
the High  Court and this Court from requiring the grounds of
detention to  be produced  before them,	 it would  have been
difficult to sustain that proviso.
</p><p id="p_1070">     The  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General,  however,
sought to  distinguish' these  two decisions  and  contended
that sub-section (9) (a)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_293">474</span>
of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2377">section  16A</a> merely	enacts a  rule of  evidence  and  it
cannot,	 therefore,  be	 said  to  obstruct  or	 retard	 the
exercise of the constitutional power of the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2378">Article 226</a>  so as to be in conflict with that Article. Now,
there can be no doubt, although at one time in the course of
his arguments  Mr. Shanti Bhushan contended to the contrary,
that a	rule of	 evidence  can	always	be  enacted  by	 the
legislature for	 the purpose  of regulating  the proceedings
before the  High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2379">Article 226.</a> A rule of evidence
merely determines  what shall  be regarded  as relevant	 and
admissible material for the purpose of enabling the Court to
come to	 a decision  in the exercise of its jurisdiction and
it  does   not	in  any	 way  detract  from  or	 affect	 the
jurisdiction  of   the	Court	and  it	  cannot,   in	 the
circumstances, he  violative of	 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2380">Article 226.</a>  But in  order
that it	 should not  fall foul	of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2381">Article 226</a>, it must be a
genuine rule of evidence. If in the guise of enacting a rule
of  evidence,	the  legislature  in  effect  and  substance
disables  and	impedes	 the  High  Court  from	 effectively
exercising its	constitutional power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2382">Article 226</a>, such
an enactment  would be	void. It will be colourable exercise
of legislative power. The legislature cannot be permitted to
violate a  constitutional provision by employing an indirect
method If  a  legislative  provision,  though  in  form	 and
outward appearance  a rule  of evidence, is in substance and
reality something  different, obstructing  or  impeding	 the
exercise of  the .  jurisdiction of  the  High	Court  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2383">Article 226</a>,  the form in which the legislative provision is
clothed	 would	not  save  it  from  condemnation.  Let	 us,
therefore, examine  whether sub-section	 (9) (a)  of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2384">section
16A</a> enacts  a genuine rule of evidence or it is a colourable
piece of  legislation in  the garb of a rule of evidence. If
it is  the former it would be valid; but if it is latter, it
would be  an indirect and covert infringement of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2385">Article 226</a>
and hence void.
</p><p id="p_1071">     Now, it  is well settled that in order to determine the
true character	of a  legislative provision,  we  must	have
regard to  the substance  of the provision and not its form.
We must	 examine the  effect of	 the provision	and  not  be
misled by  the method  and manner adopted or the phraseology
employed. Sub-section  (9) (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2386">section 16A</a> is in form and
outward appearance  a rule  of evidence	 which says that the
grounds. information  and materials  on which  the order  of
detention is  made or  the declaration under sub-section (2)
or sub-section (3) is based shall be treated as confidential
and shall  be deemed  to refer	to matter  of State  and  be
against the  public interest  to disclose.  But in substance
and effect,  is it a genuine rule of evidence ? The argument
on behalf  of the  detenus was that it is only a legislative
device	adopted	 by  the  legislature  for  the	 purpose  of
excluding the  grounds, information  and materials  from the
scrutiny of  the  Court	 and  thereby  making  it  virtually
impossible for	High Court  to examine	the legality  of the
detention and  grant relief  to the  detenu. If	 the veil is
removed, contended the detenus, the position is no different
from that  obtaining in	 A. K.	Gopalan's case (supra) where
section 14  of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was struck
down as constituting a direct assault on <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2387">Article 226.</a> It was
pointed out  that, in  every case of detention, the Grounds,
information and	 materials would  not necessarily  refer to,
matters of  State and  be against  the	public	interest  to
disclose. Since, even order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_294">475</span>
of detention  purported to  be	made  under  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2388">section  3</a>	 are
brought within	the purview of sub-section (9)(a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2389">section
16A</a>, the grounds, information and materials in cases of such
detention  may	be  wholly  unrelated  to  the	objects	 and
purposes set  out in <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_2390">section 3</a> and in that event, they would
mostly have  nothing to	 do with matters of State and it may
not be	possible to  say that  their disclosure would injure
public interest.  But even so, sub-section (9)(a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2391">section
16A</a> surrounds	such grounds, information and materials with
the veil of secrecy and, the use the words of Mahajan, J. in
A. K. gopalan's case (supra), places "an iron curtain around
them". This  sub-section, according  to detenus, compels the
Court to  shut its  eyes to  reality and  presume by a legal
fiction that  in every	case, whatever	be the actuality and
many cases  the	 actuality  may	 be  otherwise-the  grounds,
information and	 materials  shall  be  deemed  to  refer  to
matters of  State and  shall be against that public interest
to disclose.  This contention  of the detenus is undoubtedly
very plausible	and   it caused	 anxiety to  me t  on deeper
consideration, I think it cannot be sustained.
</p><p id="p_1072">     It is  significant to  note that  sub-section (9)(a) of
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2392">section 16A</a>  is a  provision enacted  to meet  the emergency
declared under	the Proclamations  dated 3rd  December, 1971
and 25th  June, 1975. Vide subjection (1) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2393">section 16A</a>. It
comes into  operation only  when there	a  declaration	made
under sub-section  (2) or sub-section (3) that the detention
of the	person concerned  is necessary for dealing effective
with  the   emergency.	The   condition	 precedent   to	 the
applicability of  sub-section is  that	there  should  be  a
declaration under  sub-section (2)  or	sub-section  (3)  in
respect of  the person	detained. It  may also be noted that
though the  words or  purported to  be made were added after
the words "an order of detention is made" in the sub-section
by the	Maintenance of	Internal Security  (Amendment)	Act,
1976, no such or similar words were added in relation to the
declaration in	under sub-section  (2) or  sub-section	(3).
Sub-section (9)	 (a) of	 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2394">section 16A</a>,  therefore, assumes  a
valid declaration  under subsection  (2) or  sub-section (3)
and it	is only	 when such  a declaration  i been made, that
sub-section (9)	 (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2395">section 16A</a> applies or n other words
it is only in cases where a person is detained in order deal
effectively with  the emergency	 that the  disclosure of the
grounds ,  information and  materials is  prohibited by sub-
section (9) (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2396">section 16A</a>.
</p><p id="p_1073">I have already pointed out how emergency can create a crisis
situation  imperilling	 the  existence	  of  constitutional
democracy and jeopardizing the functioning of the social and
political machine.  It	 is, therefore, reasonable to assume
that where a person is detained is order to deal effectively
with the  emergency, the  grounds, information and materials
on which  the order  of detention is made or the declaration
under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) is based would. and
large, belong  to a  class of documents referring to matters
of State  which it  would  be  against	public	interest  to
disclose. What	was observed  by two  of the  Law  Lords  in
Liversidge's case  (supra) would  be applicable	 in  such  a
case. Viscount	Maugham said at page 221 of the Report. "-it
is obvious that in many cases he will be acting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_295">476</span>
on information	of the	most confidential  character,  which
could  not   be	 communicated  to  the	person	detained  or
disclosed in  court without the greatest risk of prejudicing
the future  efforts of	the Secretary  of State	 in this and
like matters  for the  defence of the realm-It is sufficient
to say	that there  must be a large number of cases in which
the information on which the Secretary of State is likely to
act will  be of a very confidential nature," and Lord Wright
also observed  to the same effect at page 266 of the Report:
"In these  cases full legal evidence or proof is impossible,
even if	 the Secretary	does   not claim  that disclosure is
against the  public interest, a claim which must necessarily
be made in practically every case, and a claim which a judge
necessarily has	 to admit."  In view  of the  fact that	 the
detention is  made in  order to	 deal effectively  with	 the
emergency, the	grounds, information  and materials would in
most cases be confidential and if a claim of` privilege were
made under  <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_2397">section 123</a> of the Indian Evidence act, it would
almost	invariably   be	 held  justified.  The	Legislature,
therefore, taking  into account	 the privileged character of
the grounds,  information and materials in the generality of
cases, enacted	sub-section (9)	 (a) of	 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2398">section 16A</a>  laying
down a	rule that  the grounds,	 information  and  materials
shall be  deemed to refer to matters of State which it would
be injurious  to public	 interest to  disclose,	 instead  of
leaving it  to the  discretion of the detaining authority to
make a	claim of  privilege in	each individual case and the
court to  decide it. The rule enacted in sub-section (9) (a)
of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2399">section  16A</a> bears  close analogy to a rule of conclusive
presumption and in the circumstances, it must be regarded as
a genuine  rule of evidence. I may make it clear that if the
grounds, information  and materials  were not, by and large,
of such a character
 as  to fall  within the  class	 of  documents	relating  to
matters of  State which	 it would  be  injurious  to  public
interest to  disclose, I  would have  found it impossible to
sustain this  statutory	 provision  as	a  genuine  rule  of
evidence. If  the grounds, information and materials have no
relation to  matters of	 State or they cannot possibly be of
such a	character that	their disclosure would injure public
interest, tha  Legislature cannot,  by	merely	employing  a
legal fiction,	deem them to refer to matters of State which
it would  be against public interest to disclose and thereby
exclude them  from the	judicial ken.  That would  not be  a
genuine	 rule	of  evidence:	it  would  be  a  colourable
legislative device  -a fraudulent  exercise of	power. There
can  be	 no  blanket  ban  on  disclosure  of  the  grounds,
information and	 materials to  the High Court or this Court,
irrespective of	 their true  character. That  was the reason
why section  14 of  the Preventive  Detention Act,  1950 was
struck down  by this  Court in	A. R. Gopalan's case (supra)
and this  Court said  in M. M. Damnoo's case (supra) that if
the proviso  to <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_2400">section	 8</a> had	debarred the  High Court and
this Court  from calling  for the  grounds of  detention and
looking into  them, it	would have been difficult to sustain
that proviso.  But here, on account of the declaration under
sub-section (2)	 or sub-section (3), which, as I said above,
must  be  a  valid  declaration	 in  order  to	attract	 the
applicability of  sub-section (9)  (a) of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2401">section 16A</a>,	 the
grounds, information and materials in almost all cases would
be of  a confidential  character falling within the class of
documents privileged  under <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_2402">section  123</a> and  hence the rule
enacted	 in   the  sub-section	genuinely  partakes  of	 the
character
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_296">477</span>
of a  rule of  evidence. It  may be  pointed out that if the
declaration A  under sub-section  (2) or  sub-section (3) is
invalid sub-section  (9) (a)  of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2403">section  16A</a>  will  not  be
attracted and  the grounds,  information  and  materials  on
which the order of detention is made would not be privileged
under that  sub-section. I  am, therefore,  of the view that
sub-section (9)	 (a) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2404">section 16A</a> enacts a genuine rule of
evidence  an   it  does	 not  detract  from  or	 affect	 the
jurisdiction of	 the High  Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2405">Article 226</a> and hence
it cannot be successfully assailed as invalid.
</p><p id="p_1074">     I accordingly  answer the first question by saying that
the  Presidential   under   dated   June   27,	 1975	bars
maintainability of  a petition	for a  writ of habeas corpus
where an order of detention is challenged on the ground that
it is  vitiated by Mala fides, legal or factual, or is based
on extraneous  considerations or  is not under the Act or is
not in	compliance with it. So far as the second question is
concerned, I  do not  think there is any warrant for reading
down sub-section  (9) (a)  of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2406">section  16A</a> so as to imply an
exception in  favour of disclosure to the Court, and, on the
interpretation placed  by me  on that provision, I hold that
it does not constitute an encroachment on the constitutional
jurisdiction of	 the High  Court under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2407">Article 226</a>  and  is
accordingly not	 void. In  the circumstances,  I  allow	 the
appeals and  set aside	the judgments  of  the	High  Courts
impugned in the appeals.
