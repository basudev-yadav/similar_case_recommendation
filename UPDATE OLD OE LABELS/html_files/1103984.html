HEADNOTE:
The  Rajasthan	State Legislature passed Act 18 of  1959  to
levy tax Oil passengers and goods carried in motor vehicles.
For  the  purpose  of the tax roads were  divided  into	 two
categories  i.e. those which were asphalted etc. arid  those
which were not.	 In respect of goods Carried on the,  former
category of roads the State Government was authorised by <a href="/doc/1545035/" id="a_3"> s.
3</a> of 'he Act to levy tax at a maximum of 1/8th of the  value
of the fares and freights in respect of goods carried on the
second	category  of roads the maximum was  1/12th.   By,  a
notification  under  the Act the maximum rates	were  levied
with effect from May 1, 1959.  The said<a href="/doc/1545035/" id="a_4"> s. 3</a> was amended  by
the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_5">Finance Act</a>s of 1961 and 1962 to raise the maximum rates
leviable  under that section and the relevant  notifications
actually levied the same.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_6">The Act</a>s of 1961 and 1962 however
suffered  from	the infirmity that  that the assent  of	 the
President  had	not  been obtained in  respect	of  them  as
required  by  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_7">Art.  255</a> of the Constitution.   To  cure	 the
defect	Ordinance No. 4 of 1964 was issued.   The  Ordinance
was  replaced  on September 9, 1964 by Act 22  of  1964	 for
which  the  assent  of	the  President	was  duly  obtained.
<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_8">Section 2</a> of the Act of 1964 retrospectively re-enacted	 the
amendments to<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_9"> s. 3</a> of the principal Act made law the Acts of
1961  and  1962.   <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_10">Section 4</a> of the Act	 validated  all	 the
collections  and  levies  under the earlier  Acts  and	also
purported  to  cure the infirmity in the  said	earlier	 Act
arising from noncompliance with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_11">Art. 255.</a>  The petition	 who
was asked to pay tax under the Ordinance of 1964  challenged
the  validity of the said Ordinance -,is well as the Act  of
1964 in petitions under Art 32 of the Constitution of India.
It   was  contended on behalf of the petitioners that<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_12"> ss.  2</a>
and <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_13">4</a> of the imputed Act purported   to validate the earlier
invalid <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_14">Finance Act</a> of 1961   1964.   It was urged that	 the
failure of the legislature to comply with the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_15">Art.  255</a> rendered 'he said Acts void ab initio and as	such
they  Could not be validated by subsequent legislation.	  It
was  further urged that the said earlier Acts had been	held
invalid	 by the Rajasthan -High Court in the case  of  Vijai
Singh  and it would be incompetent to the State	 Legislature
to  validate  the said Acts in spite of the  decision  of  a
court to competent jurisdiction
HELD(i)	 It was factually not correct to say that the  Acts
of 1961 and    1962  had been struck down as void ab  initio
by  a  court of competent jurisdiction.	 The High  Court  in
Vijai  Singh's	case  had  on  the  office  hand  though  it
unnecessary  to	 pronounce its considered  opinion  on	that
aspect	of  the	 matter.   Act 22 of  19641  was  passed  on
September   9,	1964   while  the  judgment  of	  the	High
Court was delivered in Novem-
891
be,  1964  and so at the time when the Act  was	 passed	 the
earlier	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_16">Finance Act</a>s had Dot been struck down at all.	[899

(ii) <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_17">An	 Act</a> which suffers from the infirmity that  it	does
riot  comply  with  the	 requirements of  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_18">Art.	255</a>  can  be
validated  by  subsequent legislation.	<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_19">Article	 255</a>  itself
provides  that no Act of the Legislature 01 a State  and  no
provision  in any such Act shall be invalid by	reason	only
that  some recommendation or previous sanction	required  by
the  Constitution  was not given, if assent to the  Act	 was
given  by the President later.	If an Act is passed  without
obtaining  the previous assent of the President it does	 not
become	void but remains unenforceable till such  assent  is
obtained.  The said infirmity is cured by subsequent  assent
and  the law becomes enforceable.  The legislature can	also
in a suitable case adopt the course. of passing a subsequent
law  reintroducing the provisions of the earlier  law  which
had  not received the assent of the President and  obtaining
his  assent  thereto  is  prescribed  by  the  Constitution.
Legally	 there is no bar to the legislature adopting  either
of the courses mentioned above. [899 F-H; 900 A-D]
(iii)	  <a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_20">Section  2</a>  of the Act of 1964 does  not  in	fact
purport to validate the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_21">Finance Act</a>s of 1961 and 1962.	What
it  does is to amend retrospectively<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_22"> s. 3</a> of  the  principal
Act  by	 inserting  a  proviso to sub-s.  (1)  of  the	said
section.  On  its  plain  reading<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_23"> s. 2</a>	has  the  effect  of
inserting the said proviso to<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_24"> s. 3(1)</a> of the principal	Act;
and  since the amendment so made is,in	term  retrospective,
when a tax is levied for the periods covered by clauses	 (a)
and  (b)  of the proviso thus introduces in<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_25"> s. 3(1)</a>  of	 the
principal  Act,	 the  Court must proceed to  deal  with	 the
matter	on the basis that these clauses had been  introduced
in the principal at Art right up from the commencement. [900
E-G]
The  power  to legislate includes the  power  to  legislate.
prospectively as well as retrospectively and in that behalf,
tax legislation is no different from any  offer legislation.
The  power  to	tax  can be  competently  exercised  by	 the
legislature  either  prospectively or  retrospectively;	 and
that  is precisely what<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_26"> s. 2</a> has done in the  present  case.
Therefore  there was no substance in the argument that<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_27"> s.  2</a>
of the Act was invalid [1900]
(iv) <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_28">The Act</a> of 1964 and all its provisions had received the
assent of the President and so prima facie the assent of the
President  to  the Act would help the Act  to  validate	 the
provisions of The earlier Acts which were not enforceable by
reason	of the fact that they had not secured his assent  as
required by <a href="/doc/12910/" id="a_29">Art. 225.</a>  But the assent of the President could
not serve to make<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_30"> s. 4</a> valid. 1902 C-D]
What<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_31"> s. 4</a> in truth and in substance says is that the failure
to  comply  with  the  requirements of	<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_32">Art.  255</a>  does	 not
invalidate  the	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_33">Finance  Act</a>s	in  question  and  will	 not
invalidate  any	 action taken or to be	taken,	under  their
respective   relevant  provisions.   In	 other	 words	 the
legislature  seems to say by<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_34"> s. 4</a> that even though <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_35">Art.	 255</a>
may not have been complied with by the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_36">Finance Act</a>s,
it is competent to <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_37"> s. 4</a> whereby it will prescribe that	 the
failure	 to comply with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_38">Art. 255</a> does not really matter	 and
the assent of the President to the Act amounts to this	that
the President also agrees that the Legislature is  empowered
to say that the infirmity resulting from the  non-compliance
with  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_39">Art. 255</a> does not matter.	 This approach	is  entirely
misconceived. [902 D-F]
The  legislature no doubt can validate an earlier Act  which
-"s  invalid  by  reason of <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_40">Art. 255</a> and  such	an  Act	 may
receive 'he assent of the
892
President   which   will  make	the  Act   effective.	 The
legislature  cannot, however, itself declare by a  statutory
provision  that the failure to comply with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_41">Art. 255</a>  can  be
cured  by  its	own enactment, even if	the  said  enactment
received  the assent of the President.	Even the  assent  of
the  President	cannot	alter  the  constitutional  position
tinder <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_42">Art. 255.</a>  The assent of the President cannot by	 any
legislative  provision be deemed 'to have been given  to  an
earlier	 Act  at a time when it was not so given.   In	this
context	 there	is  no scope  for  a  retrospective  deeming
provision  in  regard to the assent of the  President.	 The
infirmity  in  question can be cured only by  obtaining	 the
assent of the President and not by any legislative flat.  In
enacting <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_43"> s.  4</a> the State Legislature clearly  exceeded	 its
jurisdiction. [903 A-D, F-G]

(v)  It	 is  idle to contend that merely  because  a  taxing
statute	   purports   to   operate    retrospectively	 the
retrospective operation per se involves contravention of the
fundamental right of the citizen guaranteed under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_44">Art. 19(1)
(f)</a> or (g).  In the present case having regard to the legis-
lative background of the provision prescribed by<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_45"> s. 2</a>  there
could  be  little  doubt  that	there  was  no	element	  of
unreasonableness involved in the retrospective operation  of
cl. (b) of the, proviso added by the said section to<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_46"> s. 2(1)</a>
of the principal Act. [905 D-F]
(vi) <a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_47">Section  2</a> of the impugned Act had laid down the  rates
of tax only up to the period ending March 26, 1962.  It	 was
silent	about  the period after that date.   The  petitioner
therefore could not be taxed for the period after that	date
on the strength of cls. (a) and (b) of the proviso to<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_48"> s.  2</a>.
If <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_49"> s. 4</a> had been valid then the tax at the  enhanced  rates
prescribed  by the Act of 1962 would also have	been  valid;
but  r.ince <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_50"> s. 4</a> was invalid the tax could be	validly	 and
legitimately  le-tied  for the period after March  26,	1962
only at the rates prescribed in 1959. [906 D-F]

</p><p id="p_3">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Gajendragadkar C.J. The petitioner, Jawaharinal, carries  on
business of plying his motor buses on four routes under	 the
Stage  Carriage	 Permits granted to him under  the  relevant
provisions  of	the  <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_52">Motor Vehicles Act</a>,  1939.	  The  three
respondents to his petition respectively are : The State  of
Rajasthan,  the	 Deputy Commissioner,  Excise  and  Taxation
(Appeals), Jaipur, and the Taxation Officer, (The  Rajasthan
Motor Vehicles) Sikar, State of Rajasthan.  It appears	that
respondent No. 3 passed several :assessment orders  imposing
different amounts of tax against his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">			    893</span>
five  vehicles	which  were running on the  four  routes  in
question.   The	 periods for which these  assessment  orders
were  passed differed from vehicle to vehicle; but,  on	 the
whole,	they covered the period between the 1st April,	1962
and  the  30th	September, 1964.  The total  amount  of	 tax
imposed	 in  respect  of these vehicles	 by  the  assessment
orders	in  question is Rs. 19,062-93P.	 These	orders	have
been passed under section 2 of the Rajasthan Passengers	 and
Goods Taxation (Validation) Ordinance, 1964 (Ordinance No. 4
of  1964).  This Ordinance was made and promulgated  by	 the
Governor of Rajasthan on May 15, 1964.
</p><p id="p_4">Aggrieved  by  these orders, the  petitioner  filed  appeals
before	respondent  No. 2, but respondent No. 2	 refused  to
entertain  the	said appeals unless the petitioner  paid  in
advance the tax imposed by the orders under appeal.   Whilst
these  appeals	were pending before respondent	No.  2,	 the
petitioner moved for stay in respect of the recovery of	 the
tax  assessed, but the said application was rejected on	 the
ground that there was no provision in law to. entertain	 any
such  application.  That is why the petitioner submitted  an
application  before  the  Commissioner,	 Commercial   Taxes,
Rajasthan  on  the 3rd February, 1962 and  prayed  that	 his
buses  should not be attached and sold in execution  of	 the
orders	of  assessment,	 against  which	 he  had   preferred
appeals, pending the hearing and final disposal of the	said
appeals.  The Commissioner rejected this application on	 the
8th  February,	1962.  Respondent No. 3	 then  proceeded  to
attach	one  of the buses of the petitioner, viz.,  Bus	 No.
RJP-854 and took possession of it.  The petitioner thereupon
paid  the  amount of the taxes as assessed by  the  impugned
orders, but the payment was made under protest.. The present
petition  has been filed by the petitioner under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_53">Art. 32</a>  of
the Constitution challenging the validity of the  assessment
orders	in question.  The main ground on which the  validity
of  the	 said orders is challenged, is	that  the  Ordinance
under  which  the  impugned  orders  were  passed  and	 the
Rajasthan  Passgengers	and Goods  Taxation  (Amendment	 and
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_54">Validation)  Act</a> 1964 (No. 22 of 1964)	(hereinafter  called
the Act) which repealed and replaced the said Ordinance, are
constitutionally  invalid.  The petitioner prays  that	this
Court should hold that the Act is invalid, and should, by an
appropriate  writ, quash the impugned orders  of  assessment
passed against him.  The petitioner also claims that pending
the  final disposal of his petition, the respondents,  their
servants,  and agents should be, restrained  from  realising
the tax as directed by the impugned orders and from  seizing
the  other  buses  of  the petitioner  for  the	 purpose  of
recovering the said tax.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">894</span>
<p id="p_5">In order to appreciate the contention of the petitioner that
the  Act  is  invalid,	it  is	necessary  to  mention	 the
legislative  background	 of  the Act.	The  Le-islature  of
respondent No. 1 passed an Act in 1959 (No. 18 of 1959 known
as  the	 Rajasthan Passengers and Goods Taxation  Act,	1959
(hereinafter called the principal Act').  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_55">This Act</a>  received
the assent of the President on April 2, 1959; was  published
in  the Rajasthan Gazette on April 30, 1959, and  came	into
force  on  May 1, 1959.	 The validity of this Act  has	been
upheld by this Court in <a href="/doc/1628739/" id="a_56">M/s Sainik Motors, Jodhpur &amp; Ors. v.
The State of Rajasthan</a>(1).  <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_57">Section 3</a> of the, principal	 Act
authorised the State Government to levy, charge and  collect
tax  on all fares and freights in respect of all  passengers
carried	 and goods transported by motor vehicles  in  Rajas-
than.	The said section further provided that the  rate  of
the  tax  shall	 not exceed 1/8th of the value	of  fare  or
freight	  in  the  case	 of  cemented,	tarred,	  asphalted,
metalled, gravel and kankar roads, and shall not exceed 1/12
of such value in other cases as may be notified by the State
Government from time to time.
</p><p id="p_6"><a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_58">Section 21</a> of the principal Act authorised the Government of
Rajasthan  to frame rules consistent with the said  Act	 for
securing  the payment of tax and generally for the  purposes
of  carrying into effect its provisions.   Accordingly,	 the
Government  of	Rajasthan framed suitable rules	 which	came
into force on the 21st May, 1959.  Thereupon, a notification
was issued by respondent No. 1 on the 30th April, 1959 under
s.  3  of the said Act and ;It came into force,	 on  May  1,
1959;  it  directed the manner in which, and  the  rates  at
which, the tax shall be charged and recovered.	These  rates
were the same as had been prescribed by<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_59"> s. 3</a> of the same Act
as  maximum permissible rates.	This notification  was	made
effective  on and from the 1st May, 1959.  There is no	dis-
pute   that  the  principal  Act  is  valid  and  that	 the
notification issued under it is also valid.
In  1961,  the Rajasthan Finance Act (No. 14  of  1961)	 was
passed.	  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_60">Section 8</a> of this Act purported to amend<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_61"> s.  3</a>  of
the  principal	Act.   As a result of  this  amendment,	 the
maximum	 rate  at  which the State  Government	could  levy,
charge	and collect tax on fares and freights was  increased
from  1/8th to 15 per cent in the first category  of  cases;
and  in the second category of cases it was  increased	from
1/12th	to 10 per cent.	 In pursuance of the  provisions  of
this <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_62">Finance Act</a>, respondent No. 1 issued a notification  on
the  9th  March,  1961	levying	 tax  at  the  said  maximum
permissible rates.  Neither the bill in respect of this	 Act

</p><p id="p_8">In  1962,  the Rajasthan Finance Act (No. 11  of  1962)	 was

purported to amend<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_69"> s. 11</a> of the principal Act; but with this

It appears that the constitutional validity of the, material
provisions of the principal Act and rules and  notifications
issued	under it as well as the constitutional	validity  of
the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_70">Finance Act</a>s 1961 and 1962 and the notifications  issued
respectively  thereunder was challenged by a number  of	 bus
operators  by  writ  petitions	filed  by  them	 before	 the
Rajasthan  High	 Court under <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_71">Art. 26</a>  of  the  Constitution.
During	the pendency of these writ petitions, the  Rajasthan
Ordinance  No. 4 of 1964 was promulgated.  Later,  the	said
Ordinance was repealed and replaced by the Act with which we
are  concerned	in the present proceedings.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_72">This  Act</a>	came
into  force on the 9th September, 1964, having received	 the
assent of the President on the 8th September, 1964.
The  writ  petitions filed by the other bus  operators	were
decided	 by the said High Court on the 30th  November,	1964
vide Vijai Singh and another v. Deputy Commissioner,  Excise
&amp;  Taxation (Appeals), Ajmer and Kotah Divisions,  Jaipur  &amp;
other(1).   In	substance, the High Court has held  in	that
case that the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_73">Finance Act</a>s of 1961 and 1962 suffered
from  the  infirmity  that  they did  not  comply  with	 the
requirements of <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_74">Art. 255</a> of the Constitution.  It,  however,
did not think it necessary to finally determine the question
as  to	whether by reason of the said  infirmity,  the	said
earlier	 Acts were void or not, because in its opinion,	 the
Act of 1964 "is not merely an amending and a curative Act in
that limited sense, but it is really an Act which  virtually
re-enacts the provisions of the earlier Acts which  suffered
from  a constitutional infirmity" (P. 300).  The High  Court
examined the contentions raised by the petitioners that

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">896</span>
<p id="p_10">the provisions of the Act were invalid, and has rejected the
petitioners' case that the said provisions suffered from any
constitutional	infirmity.   In the  result,  the  petitions
filed before it challenging the validity of the Act  failed.
It  appears  that the petitioners had  also  challenged	 the
validity of the recovery of penalty for non-payment of	tax,
and  the High Court held, following its	 earlier  decisions,
that  the levy of any penalty in the cases before ,At  would
be  illegal and, therefore, must be struck down.   In  other
words,	except for the limited relief granted in respect  of
the  levying  of  the penalty,	the  substantial  contention
raised	by the petitioners challenging the validity  of	 the
Act  has  been	rejected by the High  Court.   Against	this
judgment, the High Court has -ranted certificates of fitness
for leave to appeal to this Court and the record in the said
appeals is being printed in the High Court.  In that  sense,
the  said  appeals  can be said to be  pending	before	this
Court.
</p><p id="p_11">The  learned Advocate-General who has appeared for the	res-
pondents  in the present writ proceedings, requested  us  to
postpone  the hearing of this writ petition and take  it  up
along  with the appeals to which we have just referred.	  We
did not, however, accede to this request, because we thought
that  it would not be right to postpone the hearing  of	 the
present	 writ petition for an indefinitely long period,	 and
so,  we	 allowed the learned Advocate General to  argue	 the
matter	fully and refer us to the judgment of the  Rajasthan
High  Court which is under appeal in the said  appeals.	  We
made it clear to the learned Advocate-General that our deci-
sion  in the present writ petition would cover the  decision
of  the	 said appeals in so far as it would  relate  to	 the
validity  of  the provisions of the Act which  are  impugned
before	us  by the present petitioner and not to  that	part
which  covered	the question of penalty.   Accordingly,	 the
learned Advocate-General has elaborately addressed us on the
relevant  points  and  has taken  us  through  the  relevant
portions of the judgment of the Rajasthan High Court in	 the
case of Vijai Singh(1).
</p><p id="p_12">The respondents filed their written statement in the present
proceedings and they urged that the petitioners challenge to
the  validity of the relevant provisions of the	 Act  should
not   be   sustained.  According  to  them,   the   Act	  is
constitutionally valid and the impugned orders of assessment
are fully justified by the said provisions.  That is how the
main  question which falls to be considered in	the  present
writ petition is whether the relevant provisions of the	 Act
are valid or not.

Mr. Tiwari for the petitioner contends that<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_86"> ss. 2</a> and <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_87">4</a> pur-
port  to validate the earlier invalid <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_88">Finance Act</a>s  of	1961
and 1962.  He argues that the failure of the Legislature  to
comply	with the provisions of <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_89">Art. 255</a> of the	Constitution
renders the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">			    899</span>
said  Acts  void  ab  initio and as  such,  they  cannot  be
validated by subsequent legislation.  Mr. tiwari also  urges
that  the ,aid earlier Acts have been held to be invalid  by
the  Rajasthan High Court in the case of Vijai Singh(1)	 and
it would be incompetent to the State Legislature to validate
the  said  Acts	 in  spite of the decision  of	a  court  of
competent jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_26">We are not impressed by this argument.	In the first place,
it is not clear that the Rajasthan High Court has held	that
the, said earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_90">Finance Act</a>s are void ab initio; in  fact,
as we have already pointed out, the said High Court  thought
it  unnecessary to pronounce its considered opinion on	that
aspect	of the matter, because it held that the Act of	1964
with which it was primarily dealing in the said	 proceedings
not  merely amended or cured the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_91">Finance  Act</a>s,	 but
re-enacted  the	 provisions of the said Acts,  and  so,	 the
provisions  of the said Acts became operative by  their	 own
force.	Therefore, factually, it is not correct to say	that
the  said  earlier  Acts have been struck down	as  void  ab
initio by any court of competent jurisdiction.	Besides,  in
assessing the validity of this argument, it is necessary  to
remember  that the Act was passed on September 8,  1964	 and
the  judgment of the Rajasthan High Court was pronounced  on
November 30, 1964; and so, it is clear that at the time when
the  Act  was passed the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_92">Finance Act</a>s had  not	been
struck down at all.
</p><p id="p_27">The  next  question  to consider is  whether  an  Act  which
suffers from the infirmity that it does not comply with	 the
requirements  of  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_93">Art. 255</a>, can be validated  by  subsequent
legislation.   There  are  two	answers	 to  this  question.
<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_94">Article	 255</a>  provides,	 inter	alia, that  no	Act  of	 the
Legislature  of	 a State and no provision in any  such	Act,
shall be invalid by reason only that some recommendation  or
previous  sanction  required by this  Constitution  was	 not
given,	if  assent  to the Act was given  by  The  President
later.	 The position with regard to the laws to which	<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_95">Art.
255</a> applies, therefore, is that if the assent in question is
given  even after the Act is passed, it serves to  cure	 the
infirmity  arising from the initial non-compliance with	 its
provisions.   In  other words, if an Act is  passed  without
obtaining the previous assent of the President, it does	 not
become void by reason of the said infirmity; it may be	said
to  be unenforceable until the assent is secured.   Assuming
that  such a law is otherwise valid, its validity cannot  be
challenged  only  on  the  ground that	the  assent  of	 the
President was not obtained earlier as required by the  other
relevant provisions of the Constitution.  The said infirmity
is cured by the
(1) (1965) I.L.R. 15 Raj. 285.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">900</span>
<p id="p_28">subsequent  assent and the law becomes -enforceable.  It  is
unnecessary  for the purpose of the present  proceedings  to
consider  when	such  a	 law  becomes  enforceable,  whether
subsequent  assent makes it enforceable from the  date	when
the  said  law purported to come into force, or	 whether  it
becomes enforceable from the date of its subsequent  assent.
Besides, it is plain that the Legislature may, in a suitable
case,  adopt  the  course of passing a	subsequent  law	 re-
introducing the provisions of the earlier law which had	 not
received  the  assent of the President,	 and  obtaining	 his
assent thereto as prescribed by the Constitution.  We see no
substance in the argument that an Act which has not complied
with  the  provisions of <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_96">Art. 255</a>, cannot  be  validated  by
subsequent  legislation	 even  where  such  subsequent	 Act
complies  with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_97">Art. 255</a> and obtains the requisite assent  of
the  President as prescribed by the  Constitution.   Whether
the infirmity in the Act which has failed to comply with the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_98">Art. 255</a>, should be cured by  obtaining	 the
subsequent   assent  of	 the  President	 or  by	 passing   a
subsequent Act re-enacting the provisions of the earlier law
and  securing the assent of the President to such Act, is  a
matter which the Legislature can decide in the circumstances
of  a  given  case.   Legally,	there  is  no  bar  to	 the
legislature  adopting  either  of  the	said  two   courses.
Therefore,  the preliminary objection raised by	 Mr.  Tiwari
against the validity of the Act fails.
</p><p id="p_29">That takes us to the construction of <a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_99">section 2</a> and <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_100">4</a> of	 the
Act.  It would be noticed that<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_101"> s. 2</a> in fact does not purport
to validate the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_102">Finance Act</a>s of 1961 and 1962.	What
it  does ;Is to amend retrospectively<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_103"> S. 3</a> of the  principal
Act  by	 inserting  a  proviso to sub-s.  (1)  of  the	said
section.   On  its  plain reading,<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_104"> s. 2</a> has  the  effect  of
inserting the said proviso to<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_105"> s. 3(1)</a> of the principal	Act;
and since the amendment so made is, in terms, retrospective,
when a tax is levied for the periods covered by clauses	 (a)
&amp;  (b)	of  the proviso thus introduced in<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_106"> s.  3(1)</a>  of	 the
principal  Act,	 the  Court must proceed to  deal  with	 the
matter	on the basis that these clauses had been  introduced
in  the	 principal Act right up from the  commencement.	  We
have already noticed that the principal Act has been held to
be  valid  by this court; and so, we see no  basis  for	 the
argument that in amending<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_107"> s. 3(1)</a> of the principal Act,<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_108"> S. 2</a>
of the Act has contravened any Constitutional prohibition.
It  is well-recognised that the power to legislate  includes
the   power   to   Legislate  prospectively   as   well	  as
retrospectively,  and in that behalf, tax legislation is  no
different  from any other legislation.	If  the	 Legislature
decides to levy a tax, it may levy such tax
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">901</span>
either	 prospectively	 or  even   retrospectively.	When
retrospective legislation is passed imposing a tax, it	may,
in  conceivable cases, become necessary to consider  whether
such retrospective taxation is reasonable or not.  But apart
from this theoretical aspect of the matter, the power to tax
can  be	 competently  exercised by  the	 legislature  either
prospectively or retrospectively; and that is precisely what
s.  2 has done in the present case.  Therefore, there is  no
substance in the argument that<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_109"> s. 2</a> of the Act is invalid.
As  the	 said<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_110"> S. 2</a> has been drafted, it appears	 clear	that
clause	(a)  of the priviso added by it to<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_111"> s. 3</a> (1)  of	 the
principal  Act, covers the period between last of May,	1959
and  the 8th of March, 1961, whereas clause (b)	 covers	 the
period between the 9th March, 1961 and the 25th March, 1962.
The  first  period  had in fact been already  covered  by  a
notification validly issued on April 30, 1959 under<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_112"> s. 3</a>  of
principal  Act; and so, it is not easy to understand why  it
was  thought necessary to refer to this period by  the	said
retrospective	amendment.   The  second  period  had	been
attempted  to be covered by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_113">Finance Act</a> 14 of 1961  and	 the
notification  issued  thereunder.   In	order  to  make	 the
provisions   of	  the-said   notification   effective,	 the
Legislature  has  adopted  the legitimate  expedient  it  of
making the said provisions a part of the amendment which has
been  introduced to<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_114"> s. 3</a> (1) of the principal Act;  and	 so,
the  rates prescribed by clause (b) can be  validly  imposed
during the said retrospective amendment.  The second  period
had  been  the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_115">Finance Act</a> 11 of 1962 and  the	notification
issued	under it has not been included in the  retrospective
amendment  introduced  by<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_116"> s. 2</a>; this period  ranges  between
26th  March, 1962 and the 9th September, 1964; and  so,	 the
rates  prescribed  by  the notification	 issued	 under	the,
relevant  provisions  of the said <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_117">Finance Act</a>  are  not	 re-
enacted	 by the amendment made by<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_118"> s. 2</a>. In other words,	 s.2
does  not purport to re-enact, by  retrospective  amendment,
the  rates prescribed by the notification issued  under	 the
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_119">Finance	 Act</a> 11 of 1962.  We are inclined to take  the	view
that  the  draftsmen of the Act have referred to  the  first
period unnecessarily in the said proviso and have failed  to
refer	to  the	 third	period,	 through  oversight.	This
infirmity  tends  to show that the drafting of :2  has	been
casual	and somewhat careless.	As we will  presently  point
out,  the  consequence	would  be  that	 the  higher   rates
prescribed  for the period between 26th March, 1962 and	 the
9th September. 1964 by the notification issued under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_120">Finance
Act</a>  11 of 1962, are not saved by the general provisions  of
s. 4 of the Act.  It is to the said provisions that we	must
now turn.
</p><p id="p_30"><a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_121">Section	 4</a> consists of three parts.  In its first  part,  it
provides that the several sections of the three <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_122">Finance Act</a>s
enumerated by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">902</span>
it, shall not be deem-Id to be invalid, or ever to have been
invalid, during the period there specified, merely by reason
of  the fact that <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_123">Art. 255</a> of the Constitution had not	been
complied  with.	 Part 2 of the said section  provides  inter
alia that the tax levied, paid or payable during the  period
as  amended  by	 the said specified Acts,  shall  be  deemed
always	to  have been validly levied, paid or  payable;	 and
part  3 prescribes that the aforesaid enactments  shall	 be,
and be deemed always to have been, validly enacted, notwith-
standing  the aforesaid defects.  The question which  arises
for our decision is whether this section is valid.
ln  dealing with this question, we must, of course  bear  in
mind  the  fact	 that the Act and all  its  provisions	have
received the assent of the President and so, prima a  facie,
the assent of the President to the Act would help the Act to
validate the  provisions of the earlier Acts which were	 not
enforceable by reason of the fact that they had not  secured
his  assent as required by <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_124">Art. 255.</a>  But can the assent  of
the  President to the Act serve the purpose of making <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_125"> s.  4</a>
valid ? What<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_126"> s. 4</a> in truth and in substance says is that the
failure to comply with the requirements of <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_127">Art. 255</a> will not
invalidate  the	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_128">Finance  Act</a>s	in  question  and  will	 not
invalidate  any	 action taken, or to be taken,	under  their
respective   relevant  provisions.   In	 other	words,	 the
Legislature  seems to say by<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_129"> s. 4</a> that even though <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_130">Art.	 255</a>
may not have been complied with by the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_131">Finance Act</a>s,
it is competent to pass<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_132"> s. 4</a> whereby it will prescribe	that
the failure to comply with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_133">Art. 255</a> does not really  matter,
and  the assent of the President to the Act amounts to	this
that  the  President also agreed, that	the  Legislature  is
empowered to say that the infirmity resulting from the	non-
compliance with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_134">Art. 255</a> doe,; not matter.  In our  opinion,
the  Legislature is incompetent to declare that the  failure
to  comply  with  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_135">Art. 255</a> is of no  consequence  and,	with
respect,  the  assent of the President to  such	 declaration
also  does not serve the purpose which subsequent assent  by
the President can serve under <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_136">Art. 255.</a>
</p><p id="p_31">The  learned  Advocate-General	has  strenuously   contended
before us that we should look at the substance of the matter
and not decide the validity of<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_137"> s. 4</a> merely because the words
used  in it may not be happy or appropriate.  We agree	that
questions of this character must be judged on considerations
of  substance and not merely of form, and we have  tried  to
read <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_138"> s.  4</a> as favourably as we can while  appreciating	 the
argument of the learned Advocate General; but the words used
in  all the three parts of<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_139"> s. 4</a> are clear  and	unambiguous;
they  indicate	that  the Legislature thought  that  it	 was
competent to it to cure, by its own legislative process, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">903</span>
infirmity  resulting from the non-compliance with  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_140">Art.	 255</a>
When it passed the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_141">Finance Act</a>s in question, and  it
was  probably  advised that such a  legislative	 declaration
would'be  valid	 and  effective, provided  it  received	 the
assent	of  the	 President.  In our  opinion,  the  approach
adopted	 by  the  Legislature  in  this	 case  is   entirely
misconceived.	The Legislature, no doubt, can	validate  an
earlier	 Act  which is invalid by reason  of  non-compllance
with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_142">Art. 255</a> and such an Act may receive the assent of	 the
President   which   will  make	the  Act   effective.	 The
Legislature  cannot,  however, itself declare  by  statutory
provision  that the failure to comply with <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_143">Art. 255</a>  can  be
cured  by  its	own enactment, even if	the  said  enactment
received  the assent of the President.	In our opinion	even
</p><p id="p_32">-the   assent  of  the	President  cannot  alter  the	true
constitutional	position under <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_144">Art. 255.</a>  The assent of	 the
President  cannot, by any legislative process, be deemed  to
have been given to an earlier Act at a time when in fact  it
was  not so given. in this context there is no scope  for  a
retrospective  deeming provision in regard to the assent  of
the  President.	 It is somewhat unfortunate that the  casual
drafting of<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_145"> s. 2</a> leaves the period covered by Act It of 1912
and  the notification issued thereunder as unenforceable  as
before,	 and the omnibus and general provisions of<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_146"> s. 4</a>	 are
of no help in regard to the said period.
</p><p id="p_33">The  learned  Advocate-General strongly relied on  the	last
part  of <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_147"> S.  4</a>.  This	part  provides	that  the  aforesaid
enactments  shall  be, and be deemed always  to	 have  been,
validly enacted, notwithstanding the aforesaid defects.	 The
clause "notwithstanding the aforesaid defects"	emphatically
points	to  the fact that the Legislature  thought  that  it
could  legislate retrospectively, and by such  retrospective
legislation, it could itself cure the infirmity in question.
What has been overlooked by the Legislature is the fact that
the infirmity in question can be cured only by obtaining the
assent of the President and not by any legislative fiat.  We
have  given our anxious consideration to the problem  raised
by  the wording of<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_148"> s. 4</a> and we have come to  the  conclusion
that  it would not be possible to uphold its  validity.	  On
many  occasions,  this	Court  has  tried  to  look  at	 the
substance of the matter and determine the issue in spite  of
the fact that the words or expressions used in the  relevant
provisions  are	 either slovenly inappropriate	or  unhappy.
But in the present case, however benevolently or  favourably
we look at the provisions of<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_149"> s. 4</a>, we see no escape from the
conclusion  that in enacting it, the Legislature appears  to
have  clearly  assumed	that  it  can  by  itself  cure	 the
infirmity  resulting from the non-compliance with  <a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_150">Art.	 255</a>
and  all that it has to do in such a case is to	 obtain	 the
a,-,sent of the President to its own view about its power to
cure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">904</span>
such  an infirmity.  We are satisfied that it  is  necessary
that the true position in regard to the scope and effect  of
<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_151">Art. 255</a> must be ,clearly brought out in order to avoid	 any
misapprehension in future.
</p><p id="p_34">In  support  of his argument that the form  adopted  by	 the
Legislature  in	 enacting <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_152"> s. 4</a> is  not	 inappropriate,	 the
learned	 Advocate General has referred us to a	decision  of
this  Court  in <a href="/doc/1291316/" id="a_153">M.P.V. Sundararamier &amp; Co. v. The  State  of
Andhra	Pradesh	 and Another</a>(1).  It is true  that  in	that
case,<a href="/doc/1573122/" id="a_154"> s. 2</a> of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956 (No. 7
of 1956), which is a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_155">Central Act</a>, used phraseology which  is
similar	 to the phraseology adopted by<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_156"> s. 4</a> of the Act;	 but
it would be fallacious to compare the said provision with<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_157"> s.
4</a>,  because the ban which<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_158"> s. 2</a> of the said Act	intended  to
lift  could  validly be Iifted by a  Parliamentary  statute.
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_159">Art.  286(2)</a> of the Constitution which was, in force at	 the
relevant  time had provided, inter alia, that except  in  so
far  as Padiament may by law otherwise provide, no law of  a
State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on
the  sale or purchase of goods where such sale	or  purchase
takes place in the course of inter-State trade or  commerce.
What<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_160"> s. 2</a> of the said Act did was to make a law as expressly
authorised by <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_161">Art. 286(2);</a> and naturally in exercise of	 the
power conferred on it by the said provision, it enacted	 the
provisions  of	s.  2 and made them  retrospective.   It  is
significant  that  the	power  to lift	the  ban  which	 was
exercised   retrospectively   by   Parliament,	 vested	  in
Parliament  and	 not  in  any  outside	authority  like	 the
President;  and	 so, Parliament was perfectly  competent  to
validate  the  several	<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_162">State Act</a>s which  were	held  to  be
invalid,  by adopting the legislative expedient of making  a
law  as	 authorised  by <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_163">Art. 286(2)</a> and	 providing  for	 its
retrospective operations The position with regard to<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_164"> s. 4</a> is
logically  and fundamentally different; the infirmity  which
rendered  the earlier <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_165">Finance Act</a>s unenforceable, could'  be
cured  not by the Legislature itself acting on its own,	 but
by  the	 assent	 of  the President; and in  so	far  as	 the
Legislature  by enacting<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_166"> s. 4</a> purports to prescribe  by	 its
own fiat that the infirmity in question should be deemed  to
have  been  cured, it has clearly exceeded  its	 legislative
jurisdiction.  Therefore, we do not think that the  decision
of this Court in Sundararamier &amp; Co.'s case(1) can be of any
help  to  the  learned Advocate-General in  support  of	 his
argument that s.4 has been validly enacted.
There	is  one	 more  point  which  still  remains  to	  be
considered.   Mr.  Tiwari  urged  that	 the   retrospective
operation of the amend-
</p><p id="p_35">(1)  [1958] S.C.R. 1422.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">905</span>
<p id="p_36">ment  made by<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_167"> s. 2</a> of the Act in<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_168"> s. 3</a> (1) of  the  principal
Act,  should be held to be unconstitutional inasmuch as	 the
retrospective  operation of the provision prescribed by	 cl.
</p><p id="p_37">(b) of the proviso added by<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_169"> s. 2</a> suffers from the  infirmity
that  it  imposes enhanced tax	duty  retrospectively.	 His
argument is, where a taxing statute purports to impose a tax
retrospectively,  it  necessarily  involves  an	 element  of
unreasonableness and that virtually amounts to contravention
of  the citizens' fundamental rights guaranteed	 under	<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_170">Art.
19(1)(f)</a> or (g) of the Constitution.  For the purpose of the
present	 writ petition, we will assume that  notwithstanding
the proclamation of emergency issued by the President  under
<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_171">Art.  352</a>, the constitutional bar created by <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_172">Art.  358</a>	does
not  operate  against the petitioner inasmuch as  he  relies
upon the contravention of his fundamental right prior to the
date, of the proclamation.  It is on that assumption that we
wish  to deal with the contention raised by Mr. Tiwari.	  In
our  opinion,  the said contention is plainly  unsound.	  We
have already stated that the power to make laws involves the
power  to  make	 them effective	 prospectively	as  well  as
retrospectively, and tax laws are no exception to this rule.
So, it would be idle to contend that merely because a taxing
statute	   purports   to   operate   retrospectively,	 the
retrospective operation per se involves contravention of the
fundamental right of the citizen taxed under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_173">Art. 19(1)	 (f)</a>
or  (1). It is true that Cases may conceivably	occur  where
the  Court may have to consider the question as	 to  whether
excessive  retrospective  operation prescribed by  a  taxing
statute	 amounts  to  the  contravention  of  the  citizens'
fundamental right; and in dealing with such a question,	 the
Court  may  have to take into account all the  relevant	 and
surrounding  facts  and	 circumstances in  relation  to	 the
taxation.   In	the  present  case,  having  regard  to	 the
legislative background of the provision prescribed by<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_174"> s.  2</a>,
there  can  be	little doubt that there	 is  no	 element  of
unreasonableness involved in the retrospective operation cl.
</p><p id="p_38">(b)  of the proviso added by the said section to<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_175"> s. 3(1)</a>  of
the principal Act.
</p><p id="p_39">The  result is that<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_176"> s. 2</a> of the Act is valid and the tax  in
question  can  be  recovered from  the	petitioner  for	 the
periods	 covered  by clauses (a) and (b) of the	 proviso  as
therein prescribed.  In this connection, it will be recalled
that  the provision prescribed by cl. (a) of the proviso  is
really	superfluous,  because the same lax could  have	been
validly	  recovered   at  the  prescribed  rates   under   e
notification  issued  on April 30, 1959 under<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_177"> s.  3</a>  of	 the
principal  Act.	  But as we have already  pointed  out,	 the
period	between	 arch 26, 1962 to September 9, 1964  is	 not
covered by the provisions inserted by<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_178"> s. 2</a> in<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_179"> s. 3(1)</a> of the
principal Act; and so,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">906</span>
the  provisions	 of <a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_180"> s.	 2</a>  are	 of  no	 assistance  to	 the
respondents in imposing a tax against the petitioner at	 the
enhanced  rates initially prescribed by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_181"> s. 9</a> of the  Finance
Act  11	 of 1962.  If we bad held that<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_182"> s. 4</a> of the  Act	 was
valid, then the impositoin of the tax at the enhanced  rates
prescribed by ,he said<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_183"> s. 9</a> would also have been valid;	 but
;in  view  of the fact that we have come to  the  conclusion
that <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_184"> s. 4</a> is invalid, it follows that the tax which can  be
legitimately and validly imposed against the petitioner	 for
the said period must be levied under the notificaion  issued
on  April  30,	1959 under<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_185"> s. 3</a> of the	principal  Act.	  No
doubt,	Mr.  Tiwari attempted to argue that in view  of	 the
fact  that  the said<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_186"> s. 3</a> had been amended by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_187"> s.  9</a>  of	 the
Finance	 Act 11 of 1962, the notification issued  under	 the
original  <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_188">section  3</a>  of  the principal	 Act  ceases  to  be
operative.  This contention is clearly misconceived.  If the
said <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_189">Finance Act</a> is unenforceable and the notification issu-
ed  thereunder is of no effect, then<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_190"> S. 3</a> of  the  principal
Act  would remain unamended for the period in  question	 and
the  notification  initially issued under it  would  remain.
operative.
</p><p id="p_40">As  a  consequence of this conclusion, it follows  that	 the
petitioner  is	entitled  to claim  that  the  tax  assessed
against	 him  in  respect of his  vehicles  for	 the  period
between	 26th March, 1962and the 9th September, 1964 at	 the
enhanced  rates is invalid, and that the taxing	 authorities
concerned will have to levy the tax at the rates  prescribed
by the notification issued on the 30th April, 1959 under <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_191"> s.
3</a>  of the principal Act as it originally stood.	 It is	true
that  this  result sounds very anomalous,  because  for	 the
period immedeately preceding the period in question, the tax
is  validly recoverable at the enhanced rates,	whereas	 for
the  period in question, it has to be recovered at  a  lower
Tate; but, for this anomaly, the defective drafting of<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_192"> S.  2</a>
and<a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_193"> s. 4</a> of the Act is entirely responsible.
 Before	 we part with this petition, we would like to  refer
briefly to two decisions of this Court to which	 --reference
was made during the course of the argument, before us.	 'in
<a href="/doc/1216757/" id="a_194">Rai  Ramkrishna	 &amp;  Others v. The  State  of  Bihar</a>(1),	 the
validity  of  the  Bihar Taxation on  Passengers  and  Goods
