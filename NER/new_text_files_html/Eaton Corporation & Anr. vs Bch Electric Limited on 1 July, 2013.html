Marks Act, 1999 as well as passing off.

HAMMER", "CH Control" and "CH (label)" enjoys                 wide reputation,
recognition and popularity in the Indian and world market for high quality

 Faridabad-121 006, Haryana is also engaged in the business of manufacture
and sale of electric goods falling in Class 9.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.   The defendant (the expression whereof shall include its predecessor-
in-interest and title) was set up in the year 1965 as a result of the joint
venture between the plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title, Cutler-
Hammer Inc. and some Indian partners in the name of CUTLER-HAMMER
INDIA LIMITED. The name of defendant Company was later changed to
Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Ltd. In the year 1995, it was renamed as Bhartia
Industries Limited. With effect from 25th October, 2007, the name was
again changed to BCH Electric Limited, the present defendant herein.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.   From the year of its incorporation, defendant entered into various
agreements with plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title, Cutler-Hammer
Inc. to flourish Cutler-Hammer Inc.‟s business in India. These agreement
included „Sales Agreement‟ and „License and Technical Service Agreement‟
dated 3rd June, 1974 whereby defendant has accepted the ownership of the
Cutler-Hammer Inc. over the trademarks/trade names and further agreed to
not to do anything which will impair Cutler-Hammer Inc.‟s ownership
over these trademarks/trade names.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.   In the year 1979, Cutler-Hammer Inc. entered into trading name
agreement with Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited (now defendant) whereby
defendant was granted the right to use the words CUTLER-HAMMER as
part of the corporate title by Cutler-Hammer Inc.      The said agreement
allowed defendant to use the words "Cutler-Hammer" as part of their
corporate title in a limited way/manner and in connection with goods
manufactured under the license from Cutler-Hammer Inc. The agreement
specifically mentions that Cutler-Hammer Inc. is the owner of the words

<p id="p_20">19.       Defendant was allowed to use the trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER"
under No.164435 in conjunction with the word Bhartia. Whereas the other
two trademarks were allowed to be used along with the legend "Made in
India by Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited, a wholly Indian owned Licensee

<p id="p_22">       The duration of the abovementioned agreement was for seven years
which had expired in the year 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_23">21.   The plaintiffs have set up their case against the defendant by making
various allegations that the defendant is deliberately, fraudulently and with
malafide intentions of trading upon the reputation and goodwill attached to
plaintiff‟s trademark CUTLER-HAMMER, CH Control &amp; CH (label), is
using it without obtaining any consent, permission or valid license.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      The dishonest and malafide intentions of defendant are apparent from
the fact that despite being aware of the reputation of plaintiff‟s trademark
"CH (label)" worldwide including India and proprietorship of plaintiff No.1
over the trademark "CH Control" under No.205632 in Class 9 since 3rd
November, 1975 in accordance with the provisions of Trade and
<a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_5">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958 and having admitted rights of plaintiff no.1 in
the Registered User Agreement, defendant applied for registration of the
identical/deceptively similar trademark under No.582999 in Class 9 in the
year 1992 and obtained registration thereof by playing fraud on the registry
and making false claim of proprietorship and user thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_25">22.   It is alleged in the plaint that the defendant taking advantage of this
situation filed an application under No.582999 for registration of the
trademark "CH Control" through the same service provider. The defendant
has obtained the registration of the said mark wrongfully and in bad faith by
committing fraud over the Registry.
</p>
<p id="p_26">23.   It is also alleged against the defendant that by committing fraud,
defendant applied for registration of the identical/deceptively similar
trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER (Device)" under No.1189782 in Class 9 in
the year 2003. The plaintiff No.1 filed notice of opposition opposing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 8 of 72</span>
 registration of the impugned mark subject matter of Application No.1189782
on/or around 23rd June 2004 with the Registrar of Trade Marks at New
Delhi.     The said opposition proceedings initiated by the plaintiffs are
pending.
</p>
<p id="p_27">24.      In the year 2007, defendant made another attempt to register identical
and/or deceptively similar trademark "BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER
(Label)" under application No.1562940 in Class 9 and the same is pending
as objected by the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_28">25.      It is submitted that defendant was aware of the reputation and
proprietorship of plaintiff No.1 over trademarks "CUTLER-HAMMER",
"CH Control" and "CH" in respect of the goods of its manufacture and sale
prior to its incorporation and has adopted and used the identical and/or
deceptively similar trademarks with dishonest and malafide intentions to
trade upon the reputation and goodwill of plaintiffs and to earn profits in an
illegal manner. By committing such acts, defendant has not only infringed
plaintiff‟s proprietary rights vested in their registered trademark "CUTLER-
HAMMER" and other abovementioned trademarks but also committed acts
of passing off their inferior quality goods and business as and for the
quality products and business of plaintiff. The defendant has no plausible
reason to choose identical/deceptively similar marks CUTLER-HAMMER,
BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CH (logo) and/or CH Control as a trade
mark for their products.
</p>
<p id="p_29">26.      The defendant‟s products are bound to be falsely associated being part
of range of products of the plaintiff. The use of identical and/or deceptively
similar trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER,
CH (logo) and/or CH Control on the part of the defendant is unlawful and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 9 of 72</span>
 constitutes violation of the plaintiff‟s rights as are protected under the
provision of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_6">Section 29</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and under the
common law.
</p>
<p id="p_30">27.     On 19th December, 2011, plaintiffs published a caution notice
announcing their statutory rights over the trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER"
in Class 9 since the year 1954.           In response to the caution notice, the
defendant through their counsel sent a reply to the caution notice via email
and registered post on 22nd December, 2011. By way of the said reply,
defendant claimed proprietary rights in the trademark BHARTIA CUTLER-
HAMMER and CH Control. By way of the said reply; plaintiff came to
know that defendant has also applied for registration of trademark
"BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER" under No.1562940 in Class 9. It was
revealed by the plaintiffs from the website of Registrar of Trademarks about
the filing of application for registrations of the same very trademarks which
were earlier used by the defendant under permissive use of the trademarks
belonging to the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_31">28.     The plaintiffs, thereafter, have filed the suit for permanent injunction
restraining infringement of trademarks, passing of, unfair competition and
renditions of accounts and damages against the defendant. Along with suit,
the plaintiffs also filed an application being I.A. No.1204/2012 under
Order XXXIX, Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC for grant of interim injunction against the
defendant from using the trade marks CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in any
manner by the defendant by passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs.
The abovementioned suit was filed in the month of January, 2012. The
defendant filed its written statement and reply in the month of February,
2012.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                            Page 10 of 72</span>
<p id="p_32"> 29.   The defendant also filed suit against the plaintiffs being CS(OS)
No.575/2012 in the month of March, 2012 along with interim application
being I.A. No.4318/2012 seeking injunction against the plaintiffs for
issuance of groundless threats to the dealers of the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_33">30.   Both sides have made their submissions in their respective interim
applications. As the facts in both matters are common, therefore, by this
common order, the pending two interim applications are being decided by
the single order.
</p>
<p id="p_34">31.   Various defences have been raised by the defendant in its written
statement and reply to the interim application filed by the plaintiffs.
Mr.Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of defendant
has made his submission that no case of infringement of trademarks has
been made out by the plaintiffs against his client as plaintiff No.1 has not
acquired any rights in the mark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435
which was in the name of Cutler-Hammer, Inc. The said registration is not
valid. The defendant‟s application for rectification/removal/cancellation of
the mark is pending with the Trade Marks Registry. The trade mark
CUTLER-HAMMER is not being used by plaintiffs in India; abandoned by
plaintiffs and, therefore, no goodwill/reputation vests in the said marks in
favour of plaintiffs. The trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER is associated in
India with defendant and its products/business.
</p>

<p id="p_35">      The trade mark              (CH being the abbreviation of CUTLER-
HAMMER) is registered under No.582999 in Class 9 in the name of
defendant since the year 1992.        Therefore, the plaintiffs have failed to
establish even prima facie case of infringement of trademarks.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                            Page 11 of 72</span>
<p id="p_36"> 32.   The second submission of Mr.Sethi is that the plaintiffs have also
failed to make out any case of passing off as the plaintiffs are not using the


marks CUTLER-HAMMER,                      ,     ,     ,          and/or variants
thereof in relation to their business/products in India. No products of
plaintiffs bearing any of the aforesaid trademarks are available for sale in
India. The aforesaid marks have been abandoned by plaintiffs. In fact, no
products bearing the said marks have been produced/filed in the Court.
There is no goodwill/reputation vested in favour of plaintiffs in the said
marks.
</p>

<pre id="pre_2">      The    marks        ,   BHARTIA         CUTLER-HAMMER,         CUTLER-


HAMMER,                       are exclusively associated with defendant. The
</pre><p id="p_37">said products and are distinctive of its products/business by virtue of
continuous and extensive use for several decades. There is no evidence of
confusion and deception placed by the plaintiffs on record. There is no
likelihood of confusion/deception as plaintiffs‟ products bearing the said
marks are not available in India. Therefore, no damage would be caused to
plaintiffs on account of use of the said marks by defendant. On the contrary,
defendant will suffer irreparable loss, damage and injury, if plaintiffs
commence use of the said marks in India. Rather the plaintiffs have
abandoned their trademarks in India who themselves have allowed removal
of their following trade marks in India and other countries as admitted by the
plaintiffs in their rejoinder due to non-payment of their renewal fee and have
not taken any steps for restoration. The details are as under:

      be referred as "CH" logo, and logo of CUTLER-HAMMER as
      "CUTLER-HAMMER")

</p><p id="p_39">33.   Despite having incorporated a subsidiary in India i.e. plaintiff No.2 as
far back as in the year 1996, plaintiff No.1 has not used the said marks in
respect of its products/business and neither raised any objection against
defendant‟s activities in India. Plaintiffs‟ products available in India do not
depict/bear the trade marks „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ or „CH‟ or variants
thereof. Products purchased by defendant on 22nd, December, 2011 which
does not show use of the said marks. The invoice raised in respect of the
said products also does- not show use of the marks. Plaintiffs have filed few
purchase orders of 2009, 2010 and 2011 however, the same do not show any
actual sale of the products in India under the mark CUTLER-HAMMER.
Further, plaintiffs have relied on a catalogue of 2001 pertaining to Canada to
correlate the product codes. No document has been placed on record by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 13 of 72</span>
 plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in question post 1986, thereby
confirming that plaintiff No.1 lost interest/rights in the marks CUTLER-
HAMMER, CH post 1986 and have commenced use only recently so as to
ride on the goodwill and reputation vesting in the defendant‟s marks.
</p>
<p id="p_40">34.   The sales figures provided by plaintiffs for the years 2008-2011 in
respect of their products are vague, misleading, unsubstantiated and scanty
inasmuch as the same are neither indicative of sales in India nor discloses
use of these trademarks. The sales figures of Rs.35 lac, which at any rate are
vague, unsubstainated and denied, provided by plaintiffs towards sale of
products in the year 2008 bearing the marks in question are no match to the
sales generated by defendant in the year 2008 i.e. `1,94,82,68,813/-.
</p>
<p id="p_41">35.   No document including promotional materials/advertisements has
been placed on record by the plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in
question post 1986. The Caution Notice published by the plaintiffs on
19th December, 2011 in the daily, „The Times of India‟ was confined to the
trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER and there was no whisper of the marks CH
and/or variants thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_42">36.   Nothing on record to show that the Registered User Agreement dated
19th February, 1979 was recorded with the Trade Marks Registry as per
<a href="/doc/641855/" id="a_7">Section 48</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_8">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958, thus, it does not
lie in the mouth of the plaintiffs to say that „use‟ would accrue to the
plaintiffs for the period 1979-1986.
</p>
<p id="p_43">37.   It is also argued by Mr.Sethi that the present action of the plaintiffs
suffers from long delay, laches, acquiesces and waiver on the part of
plaintiffs. Therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled for the discretionary relief of
injunction.

<p id="p_44">         It is admitted by the defendants that after the expiry of the
Registered User Agreement in 1986, defendant continued to use, inter alia,
the trademarks BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH
with the full knowledge, consent and encouragement of Plaintiff No.1 by
way of addressing letters by the plaintiffs themselves and various meetings
and discussions between the parties at least for the last 25 years.
</p>
<p id="p_45">38.     Certain following illustrative instances have been given by the
defendant in order to show the knowledge of the plaintiffs about the
continuous user of trademarks in question:
</p>
<p id="p_46">i)      Plaintiffs have admitted to the fact that the letters exchanged between
Plaintiff No.1 and Defendant reflected Defendant‟s use of the trade marks
BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letter
head.
</p>
<p id="p_47">ii)     Plaintiff No.1 had entered into Sales Agreements on 13th July, 1988
and 4th September, 1990 with defendant‟s affiliate viz. Bhartia International
Private Limited (which later merged into defendant); License and Technical
Service Agreements dated 10th April, 1990 and 11th December, 1992 with
defendant and Export Agreement dated March 16, 1994 between plaintiff
No.1 and defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_48">iii)    Plaintiff No.1 and Defendant exchanged various correspondences and
visited each other‟s offices/factories in India and the USA in connection
with business as well as to explore new business opportunities. The letters
addressed by defendant clearly reflected use of the trade marks BHARTIA
CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letterhead. The
product brochure forwarded to plaintiff No.1 also bore the trademarks/
names BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH of the defendant. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 15 of 72</span>
 representatives of plaintiffs who visited the office/factory of defendant could
not have missed defendant‟s use of the said marks.
</p>
<p id="p_49">39.    Plaintiffs' Indirect Knowledge

</p><p id="p_50">i)     When the plaintiff No.1 had filed fresh application seeking
registration of the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ under No.642706 on 11th
October, 1994, the Examination Report issued by the Trade Marks Registry
on 22nd October, 1999 cited defendant‟s prior mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟
under No.582999 against plaintiffs‟ application. There was opposition from
the plaintiffs‟ side.
</p><p id="p_51">ii)    Mr.Jamshed Khurram, Director - Sales &amp; Marketing PD, South Asia
of plaintiff No.2 and Mr.Ajay Jain, President of plaintiff No.1‟s affiliate
company Moeller HPL India Private Limited were employees of the
defendant during 2004-2005 and 2001-2005 as Business Manager (OEM)
and General Manager (Sales and Marketing) respectively.
</p><p id="p_52">iii)   Plaintiff No.2 was incorporated on 1st March, 1996 and has an office
at Delhi. Defendant also has an office at Delhi. The Directors and other
senior employees of Plaintiff No.2 have been in constant touch with
Defendant and have visited its offices.
</p><p id="p_53">iv)    Being in the same line of business, Plaintiff No.2 is deemed to have
been aware of Defendant‟s business/products bearing the marks, BHARTIA
CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER- HAMMER and CH. Defendant has been
continuously and extensively using the marks, BHARTIA CUTLER-
HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in respect of its products/business
for nearly half a century and products bearing the said marks are available
in every nook and corner of the country. Therefore, the plaintiffs/their




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 16 of 72</span>
 predecessor had waived their rights, if at all, in the trade marks CUTLER-
HAMMER, CH and variants thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_54">         It is not open now for the plaintiffs to exit from India and then return
after lapse of a few decades and seek to restrain the defendant, an Indian
company, which has, in the meantime, established a goodwill/reputation in
its favour. Upon realizing the magnitude of defendant‟s business and its
reputation in the market vis-à-vis plaintiffs‟ failure to gain market share in
India, they are now attempting to usurp defendant‟s business/trade marks in
India.
</p>
<p id="p_55">40.      Mr.Sethi argued that law assists those who are vigilant about their
rights and not those who sleep over their rights - Vigilantibus Non
Dormientibus Acquitas Subveniunt'. Plaintiffs are, therefore, estopped, both
in law and equity from asserting rights over the statutory and proprietary
rights of Defendant in the marks, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER,
CUTLER-HAMMER and CH.
</p>
<p id="p_56">41.      It is also challenged by the defendant that the plaintiff No.1 has
acquired the company Cutler-Hammer, Inc. in the year 1978, as it is the
admitted position that the plaintiffs have made the application on 28th
November, 1979 on Form TM-24 for recordal of change in ownership in the
Trade Marks Registry, Kolkata. Pursuant to the said request and order
thereon dated January 23, 1980, Plaintiff No.1 was registered as subsequent
proprietor of the mark CUTLER-HAMMER by virtue of Certificate of
merger. Plaintiffs have not filed any documents to show that the said
registration and/or any other marks were part of the merger.
</p>
<p id="p_57">         On 31st May, 2010, plaintiff No.1 also filed a request on Form TM- 33
(for recordal of change of name) with the Registry indicating that Cutler-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                            Page 17 of 72</span>
<p id="p_58"> Hammer, Inc. is the subsequent proprietor of the said mark and that „Cutler-
Hammer, Inc.‟ has, by virtue of Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of
Incorporation dated 20th August, 2003, changed its name to „Eaton
Electrical, Inc.‟ After raising objection by the defendant on 28th April, 2012,
plaintiffs vide letter dated 2nd May, 2012 filed a request with the Trade
Marks Registry, Mumbai withdrawing the said request. In the said letter,
plaintiffs for the first time disclosed that there are two, Cutler-Hammer Inc.

      In view of above, the plaintiffs herein have no locus to seek an
injunction against the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_59">42.   It is also alleged by the defendant that the balance of convenience
exists in favour of defendant, as the defendant is a leading manufacturer and
distributor of premium low voltage electrical and electronics products in
India. The defendant presently employs approximately 1800 personnel and
150 engineers including a strong R&amp;D department. It has over 30 sales
offices with numerous „Resident Engineer‟ locations strategically spread all
over India and over 500 dealers and thousands of sub-dealer network to
better serve its customers. The defendant‟s products are exported to over 25
countries, either directly, or through authorized distributors in jurisdictions
such as Europe, Far East, Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia. In fact,
on account of extensive and continuous use of the trade marks by the
defendant in respect of its products/business for over 25 years, a prima facie
case exists in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiffs.

</blockquote><p id="p_61">43.   The defendant in its case is seeking, inter alia, an injunction against
plaintiffs from extending threats to its affiliates, customers, distributors,
dealers, agents etc., as plaintiffs are wrongly claiming rights in the marks
„CUTLER-HAMMER‟ and CH and issuing threats to defendant‟s dealers,
distributors and agents thereby hampering its business and creating
confusion in the minds of the discerning members and also by issuing
publication of the Caution Notice for the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟. On
6th January, 2012, plaintiff No.1, through its lawyers, addressed a „cease and
desist‟ letter to defendant calling upon it to refrain from using the marks
CUTLER-HAMMER and „CH‟ (label) and/or any deceptive variation/s
thereof and termed its products as „counterfeit‟.
</p><p id="p_62">44.   The defendant is the proprietor of the trade mark „CUTLER-
HAMMER‟ registered in Class 9, registration of which dates back to 14th
October, 1992. Plaintiffs‟ use of the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ which is
identical/deceptively similar to defendant‟s registered trade mark „CUTLER-
HAMMER‟ in relation to identical goods/products is tantamount to
infringement of defendant‟s statutory rights vesting in its registered and
reputed trade mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟. Goodwill and reputation
subsisting    in   defendant‟s     trademarks/logos,   CUTLER-HAMMER,
BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH any use of the said marks and/or
deceptive variations thereof would mislead and deceive the public/
consumers into believing that plaintiffs‟ business/products originate from

 defendant. Thus, plaintiffs are guilty of passing off as plaintiffs are
intentionally and blatantly violating defendant‟s rights in the aforesaid
trademarks and a case of misappropriation leading to deception amongst the
members of trade and public is clearly made out against plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_63">      The balance of convenience exists in favour of defendant, as due to
long, continuous and extensive use of the marks/logos, BHARTIA
CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in India for the last
several decades, the same are well-known and deserve protection. On the
other hand, the plaintiffs have recently commenced use of „CUTLER-
HAMMER‟ who had earlier abandoned the marks „CUTLER-HAMMER‟
and CH and variants thereof in India as well as internationally, thus they
have no authority/justification to assert rights over the same. Use of the
aforesaid mark by plaintiffs is with the sole intention of riding upon
defendant‟s fame and goodwill garnered over the years.
</p><p id="p_64">45.   An irreparable harm and injury is being suffered by defendant by
virtue of (i) publication of Caution Notice by plaintiff No.1 claiming
exclusivity over the mark CUTLER-HAMMER; (ii) issuance of threats to
Plaintiff/its dealers/distributors; and (iii) plaintiffs‟ recent commencement of
use of the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ which is identical/deceptively
similar to defendant‟s registered and well-known trademarks, BHARTIA
CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH. Plaintiffs being in the
same trade and business as defendant, it will cause irreversible damage to
the goodwill, fair name, reputation and integrity of defendant, its businesses
and the much renowned and well-known trademarks/logos BHARTIA
CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH.
</p><p id="p_65">46.   In case, pleadings of both the parties are read, it is not disputed by the
defendant that trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER and the device CH are well

 known trademarks, there would be confusion and deception if both the
parties are allowed to use the same trademarks. The defendant has also not
disputed the facts that two sets of trademarks are same and are being used by
both parties in relation to same product. The defendant has also not denied
that the defendant entered into an agreement „Registered User Agreement‟
bearing the said trademarks and the defendant has filed the applications for
registrations of the same very trademarks which were earlier being used as a
permissive-use under the licence agreements. The plaintiffs‟ oppositions to
the various applications for registration filed by the defendant are pending.
The main case of the defendant is that after breaking relation between the
parties, the defendant has been using the same very trademarks for the last
25 years within the knowledge of the plaintiffs. The defendant has acquired
unique and independent goodwill and reputation of trademarks in India and
abroad. The plaintiffs on the other hand abandoned their trademarks as
some of trademarks are not renewed. The plaintiffs have not been using the
trademarks in India and other parts of the world. The defendant is the
registered proprietor of trade mark logo of CH in Class 9 as on 14 th October,
1992. The plaintiffs are unnecessary harassing the defendant by extending
their threats by various ways. Therefore, the plaintiffs are not only entitled
for injunction prayed for rather they should be restrained from extending
their threat as prayed in the application for injunction filed by the defendant.
</p><p id="p_66">47.   In order to decide these two applications, the following issues are to
be considered by the Court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">             i)   Whether the defendant is infringing the registered
             mark CUTLER-HAMMER.

<p id="p_67">48.   Some relevant dates and events are necessary to mention here in order
to deal with the submissions of the parties. As per the case of the plaintiff

The details are given as below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">      (i)       The trade mark "CUTLER-HAMMER" was first adopted by
                Cutler-Hammer, Inc. in the year 1893. Cutler-Hammer, Inc.
                (Predecessor of plaintiff no.1) first shipped its goods under

non-payment of renewal fee due for period 1989 - 1996.

reveal that the plaintiff No.1 is the subsequent registered proprietor of the
trademark cutler-hammer bearing No.164435 in Class 09. The said
trademark was initially registered in the name of CUTLER-HAMMER, INC.
In the year 1979, CUTLER-HAMMER, INC. merged with and into Plaintiff
no.1. Therefore, pursuant to request on form TM-24 dated 28th November,
1979 by erstwhile agents Remfry &amp; Son (now Remfry &amp; Sagar) and order
thereon dated 23rd January, 1980, Eaton Corporation (Plaintiff No.1) became
the subsequent registered proprietor as from 30th March, 1979 by virtue of
Certificate of Merger.
</p><p id="p_96">59.     Defendant‟s objections that the plaintiff No.1 has not acquired any
rights in the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435 is without
any substance on account of following reasons:

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">      i. Defendant has not only admitted the fact that trademark CUTLER-
        HAMMER belongs to plaintiff no.1 that is Eaton Corporation but has
        also published the fact that their products are manufactured in

        customers in India. The same is available on record at page 448 filed

counsel for defendant to now challenge the said order of the Registrar which
was passed on the basis of request made through them and on their
declaration made in form TM-24 dated 28th November, 1979, as law does
not permit a person to both approbate and reprobate. This principle is based
on the doctrine of election which postulates that no party can accept and
reject the same instrument and that "a person cannot say at one time that a
transaction is valid and thereby obtain some advantage, to which he could
only be entitled on the footing that it is valid, and then turn round and say it
is void for the purpose of securing some other advantage". Case Law: <a href="/doc/1660026/" id="a_9">R.N.

       C. Plaintiffs have been using the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER in
         India since the year 1919. The use of trademarks by plaintiffs prior
         to the year 1978 is not disputed by the defendant. Defendant in

<p id="p_117">62.      It is not denied by the defendant about the execution of Registered
User Agreement dated 19th February, 1979 and its pleadings. The record
also reveals that an application in the prescribed manner was filed in the
Trademark Registry. However, there is no evidence on record to show
whether the said application for registration of Registered User Agreement
was accepted or not.

<p id="p_118">         It is argued by Mr.Sudhir Chandra that since the plaintiff No.1
company had a base in USA, therefore, defendant (which is an Indian
Company) was to complete all the legal formalities of registration of
Registered User Agreement at the Trade Marks Office through the
trademark agent Remfry &amp; Sons (now Remfry &amp; Sagar). Entire
documentation (Form TM-28, TM-48 and Affidavit to that effect) required
to register the Registered User Agreement dated 19th February, 1979 was
duly completed by plaintiff no.1 as well as defendant.

<p id="p_119">         Both, Cutler-Hammer, Inc. and defendant authorized Remfry &amp; Sons
(now Remfry &amp; Sagar) to act as an agent for entering Bhartia Cutler-
Hammer Limited as a Registered User. Further, the filing and registration of
the Registered User Agreement was left to defendant. As M/s. Ramfry and
Sagar is now appearing as attorney on behalf of the defendant they may be
in better position to inform the Court about its outcome.        However, at
present, it is immaterial if the application for user agreement is not accepted
or not as the defendant has admitted the factum of user agreement between

defendant dishonestly adopted the impugned mark CUTLER HAMMER and
applied for registration thereof in the year 1992 under No.582999. The same
is registered by committing fraud on the Registry and making false claim of
proprietorship and user thereof. The rectification for removal of impugned
trademark from the Register is filed by plaintiff No.1 on 20th July, 2012 and
the same is admitted by Intellectual Property Appellate Board and numbered
as ORA/269/2012/TM.DEL. Defendant had no plausible explanation/
justification to adopt the marks, CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA
CUTLER-HAMMER and CH and/or variants thereof. Even after obtaining
registration of the mark "CH (logo)" with the word CONTROL, the
defendant was using the mark CH without using the word CONTROL below
the logo as appeared from registration obtained by the defendant who has

also applied for registration of trademark         in various Classes which
is similar to plaintiffs‟ trademark CH.

registration of the impugned mark subject matter of Application No.1189782

Delhi. The said opposition proceedings are pending.

<p id="p_176">      In the year 2007, defendant made another severe attempt to register
identical and/or deceptively similar trademark(s) BHARTIA CUTLER-
HAMMER, CUTLER HAMMER and CH and silently filed 21 applications
in various Classes with an intention to obtain proprietary rights over the said
impugned marks which are identical/ deceptively similar to plaintiff‟s
trademarks in disguise. The said applications are pending for registration.

application for registration of trademark CUTLER HAMMER is in relation

defendant is part of the plaintiffs. Similarly, in the License And Technical
Service Agreement as per 7.7 of the Agreement, it was agreed that the
licensee shall not apply or obtain registration of any trademarks and shall not
challenge the validity or contest the right of the proprietor and in the user
agreement between 1979-1986 in Clause 7 the defendant recognized the
right the trademarks of the owner and the defendant shall not acquire and

</p>
<p id="p_178">68.   However, the defendant despite of abovementioned stipulations which
are of the binding clauses has acted absolutely opposite to the agreements
intentionally and deliberately as appeared from its acts and deeds. The
details of wrongful act of the defendant are given as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">      (i)   The defendant has claimed the proprietorship right in the
            Trademarks Registry and placed evidence in order to obtain the
            registration during the period when the defendant was licensee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">      (ii) The defendant has made every effort to impair the trademarks of
            the plaintiffs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">      (iii) The defendant is claiming by giving its indication that the
            defendant is still part of the plaintiffs which is untrue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">      (iv) The defendant applied for registration and obtained registration
            of logo „CH‟ knowingly, intentionally and fraudulently which is
            contrary to clause 7.7 of the Licence and Technical Service
            Agreement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">      (v) The defendant has challenged the registration of the plaintiffs
            contrary to the agreements despite of recognizing the ownership
            rights of the plaintiffs. They have claimed their independent
            rights by acquiring user which is in use to the plaintiff.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">      (vi) The defendant is claiming independent user in order to become
            proprietor of the same very trademarks.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_179">69.   A mere justification is not enough that as the plaintiffs have not used
the trademarks in India, the defendant is entitled to use the same trademarks

 who can also claim proprietary rights independently as there is delay on the
part of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_180">70.    It is necessary here to discuss the similar aspect which has been dealt
with by the Division Bench of this Court and the Supreme Court who have
rejected the similar submissions of the defendant in same situation. The
judgments are as follow:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">       (i)    In the case of Velcro Industries v. Velcro India Ltd. 1993 (1)
              Arb. LR 465, a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High
              Court (S.N. Variava, J.) rejected a contention made on behalf of
              the defendants therein that they are entitled to continue use of
              Velcro as a part of their corporate name because they have
              independently developed a reputation in India. It was noted that
              the defendants in that case were merely acting as licensees and
              even if the agreement between the parties did not provide that
              on termination of the license, the defendants would cease to use
              Velcro as a part of their trade name, that would make no
              difference, since the trademark Velcro is a registered trademark
              of the plaintiff and to allow the defendants to use it as a part of
              their corporate name is to permit them to give an impression to
              the public that they are still connected with or have a license
              from the plaintiffs.

 manufacturing, selling, advertising or in any way using the trade mark
"Whirlpool" of their product. It was held that the passing off an action was
maintainable in law even against the registered owner of the trademark. It
was held that the name of "Whirlpool" was associated for long with the
Whirlpool Corporation and that its trans-border reputation extended to India.
It was held that the mark "Whirlpool" gave an indication of the origin of the
goods as emanating from or relating to the Whirlpool Corporation. It was
held that an injunction was a relief in equity and was based on equitable
principles. It was held that the equity required that an injunction be granted
in favour of the Whirlpool Corporation. It was held that the refusal of an
injunction could cause irreparable injury to the reputation of the Whirlpool
Corporation, whereas grant of an injunction would cause no significant
injury to the appellants who could sell their washing machines merely by
removing a small label bearing the name "Whirlpool".

held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">             "9. We are in full agreement with what has been laid
             down by this Court. Whilst considering the possibility of
             likelihood of deception or confusion, in present times and
             particularly in the field of medicines, the Courts must
             also keep in mind the fact that nowadays the field of
             medicine is of an international character. The Court has
             to keep in mind the possibility that with the passage of
             time, some conflict may occur between the use of the
             mark by the Applicant in India and the user by the
             overseas company. The Court must ensure that public
             interest is in no way imperiled. Doctors particularly
             eminent doctors, medical practitioners and persons or
             Companies connected with medical field keep abreast of
             latest developments in medicine and preparations

              worldwide. Medical literature is freely available in this
             country. Doctors, medical practitioners and persons
             connected with the medical field regularly attend medical
             conferences, symposiums, lectures etc. It must also be
             remembered that nowadays goods are widely advertised
             in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other media
             which is available in the country. This results in a
             product acquiring a worldwide reputation. Thus, if a
             mark in respect of a drug is associated with the
             Respondents worldwide it would lead to an anomalous
             situation if an identical mark in respect of a similar drug
             is allowed to be sold in India. However one note of
             caution must be expressed. Multinational corporations,
             who have no intention of coming to India or introducing
             their product in India should not be allowed to throttle an
             Indian Company by not permitting it to sell a product in
             India, if the Indian Company has genuinely adopted the
             mark and developed the product and is first in the market.
             Thus the ultimate test should be who is first in the
             market.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">             10. In the present case, the marks are the same. They are
             in respect of pharmaceutical products. The mere fact that
             the Respondents have not been using the mark in India
             would be irrelevant if they were first in the world market.
             The Division Bench had relied upon material which
             prima-facie shows that the Respondents product was
             advertised before the Appellants entered the field. On the
             basis of that material the Division Bench has concluded
             that the Respondents were first to adopt the mark. If that
             be so then no fault can be found with the conclusion
             drawn by the Division Bench."

             of passing off. The learned Single Judge held that the
             Appellants had trans-border reputation and goodwill in
             the name in India. It was held that use of this name by the
             Respondents is likely to cause confusion and deception
             and that the Appellants would suffer damages if the
             interim relief was not granted.

             has set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and
             vacated the interim injunction. The main ground on
             which the interim injunction has been vacated is that the
             right of the Appellants (herein) under Clause 8.3 of the
             Agreement dated 21.12.1984 was not enforceable. The
             Division Bench held that the Agreement had not been

             judgment of the learned Single Judge. The application,
             which had been made by the 1st Respondent to the
             Government of India, itself shows that the Appellants had
             a very huge turnover, that they are regularly supplying
             equipment to parties in India. As per this letter they had
             reputation in India. At the interim stage this admission of
             the 1st Respondent had to be taken note of. The 2nd

              Respondent-company could thus use the name "baker"
             only if there was permission, or an Agreement, by which
             the Appellants permitted them to use the name „Baker‟.
             In the absence of any such Agreement or permission the
             2nd Respondent would be guilty of passing off its goods
             as those of the Appellants and an injunction would have
             to follow on basis of well settled principles governing
             grant of injunction. It has to be remembered that the
             goods are identical The Technical Know-how Agreement
             does not contain any clause which permits user of the
             name "Baker", nor does the Technical Know-how
             Agreement contain any provision for grant of a 40%
             shareholding in the 2nd Respondent-company. These
             provisions are contained only in the Agreement dated 21 st
             December, 1984. The fact that the 2nd Respondent-
             company could be incorporated with the name "Baker"
             as part of its corporate name and the fact that 40%
             shareholding was given to the Appellants in the 2 nd
             Respondent Company prima facie shows that the
             Agreement dated 21st December, 1984 was acted upon
             and accepted even by the 2nd Respondent. The minutes
             of the Board Meeting held on 3rd September, 1993 also
             prima facie shows that even on this date the Respondents
             accepted this Agreement to be binding.

             Agreement was not put before the Government of India,
             the Agreement was illegal and unenforceable. This
             argument has found favour with the Division Bench.
             Prima fade, it appears to us that this is a self defeating
             argument If the Agreement was not to be acted upon,
             then there is no right in the 2nd Respondent company to
             use the name „Baker‟. In spite of questions from this
             Court no other permission or licence to use the name
             "Baker" could be shown to us. If the Agreement is
             unenforceable then the entire Agreement is
             unenforceable. In that case the 2nd Respondent has got
             no right to use the name "Baker". On the reasoning that

was held by this Court that in order to prove a prima facie case for grant of
interim injunction it was not necessary for the plaintiff in a passing off
action to prove that it was carrying on business in India. For the grant of
interim injunction it was enough that the plaintiff had a reputation in India.
In that case the principle laid down in Budweiser's case (1984) FSR 413,
namely, that unless there was a business activity in the place where passing
off was alleged to have taken place, action for passing off could not be
maintained, was departed from. It was also recognised that there was a
strong trend to prevent deception of the public, whether it was deliberate or
innocent. This principle is more relevant to India because there is a greater
need to catch up with the more advanced countries in the matter of
business enterprises including manufacture of products and services. This

this Court on the question of trans-border reputation. In Kamal Trading
Co. Vs. Gillette UK Ltd., Middle Sex, England, (1988) 1 P L R 135, the
principle laid down by the Budweiser's case was not accepted by a
Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court
expressing its view held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">             "It is necessary to note that the goodwill is not limited to
             a particular country because in the present days, the trade
             is spread all over the world and the goods are transported
             from one country to another very rapidly and on
             extensive scale. The goodwill acquired by the
             manufacturer is not necessarily limited to the country
             where the goods are freely available because the goods
             though not available are widely advertised in
             newspapers, periodicals, magazines and in other medias.
             The result is that though the goods are not available in
             the country, the goods and the mark under which they are
             sold acquires wide reputation. Take for example, the
             televisions, and Video Cassette Recorder manufactured
             by National, Sony or other well known Japanese
             concerns. These televisions and V.C.Rs. are not imported
             in India and sold in open market because of trade
             restrictions, but is it possible even to suggest that the
             word „National‟ or „Sony‟ has not acquired reputation in
             this country. In our judgment, the goodwill or reputation
             of goods or marks does not depend upon its availability
             in a particular country."

limitations.

Agreement with defendant was executed on 11th December, 1992 and had a

infringing act.

<p id="p_196">73.   It is the case of the plaintiffs that on 19 th December, 2011 the
defendant‟s goods under the impugned marks BHARTIA CUTLER-

of acquiescence to operate. The acquiescence cannot be inferred merely by
reason of the fact that the plaintiff has not taken any action against the
infringement of its rights. Even if the defendant has been using both the
trademarks from the period when the relation between the parties are broken.
Is it possible that the defendant would and could take any benefit out of it
knowing the said trademarks are belonging to the plaintiffs? Can the
defendant in the facts of the present case is entitled to take the defence of
estoppel, acquiesces, delay, latches and abandonment of the same trade
marks by the plaintiff?

             user of the trade mark, the Court took the view that the
             plea of estoppel would apply in that case.

             contended that it was well settled that if the defendant
             acts fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating
             the plaintiff's rights, the essential elements of estoppel
             are lacking and in such a case the protection of the
             plaintiff's rights by injunctive relief never is properly
             denied. The doctrine of estoppel could only be invoked to
             promote fair dealings. In any event the defense of
             acquiescence is not available to the defendant/appellant
             in the instant case for it is well settled that the
             acquiescence must be such as to lead to the inference of a
             license sufficient to create a new right in the defendant.

                    a course of conduct inconsistent with the claim for
                    exclusive rights in a trade mark, trade name etc. It
                    implies positive acts; not merely silence or
                    inaction such as is involved in laches. In Harcourt

mark. (<a href="/doc/1676726/" id="a_21">See Whirlpool Company &amp; Anr. v. N.R. Dongre &amp; Ors</a>., 1995 (32)

<p id="p_204">      However, it may be mentioned that a Division Bench of Calcutta
High Court in <a href="/doc/1829338/" id="a_22">J. N. Nicols (Vimto) Limited v. Rose &amp; Thistle &amp; Anr</a>., AIR
1994 Calcutta 43 took the view that where an application for removal of
registered trade mark was filed for non-user of the same for a long period,
the defense of import ban as special circumstance for the said non-user
cannot be granted when other similar product was manufactured and freely
sold during that period in spite of the import restriction. Hence the onus has
not been discharged by the registered proprietor of trade mark for excusing
him from non-user during the prescribed period, preceding the application
for removal of registered mark. The existence of special circumstance must
affect the trade as a whole and the onus of establishing that the case comes
within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1262070/" id="a_23">Section 46(3)</a> lies on the registered proprietor of the
trade mark. It may be shown that the non-user was due to special
circumstance of the trade only and not by reason of some other cause which



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                         Page 63 of 72</span>
 would have otherwise been inoperative even in the absence of the special
circumstances. If the non-user was, in fact, by reason of some other factors
apart from the special circumstances, question of a defense under
<a href="/doc/1262070/" id="a_24">Section 46(3)</a> being made available to the proprietor of the mark does not
and cannot arise. A specific case shall have to be made and proved with
necessary documentary evidence that the non-user was the direct effect of
the existence of the special circumstances. The special circumstances cannot
be taken note of as a defense if the non-user is by reason of a voluntary act.
This view taken by Calcutta High Court might have helped the proceedings
under <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_25">Section 46</a> of the Act. But here in this case due to special kind of
relationship between the respondents No.1 and 2 and between respondent
No.2 and the appellant in the trade and there being no intention to abandon
or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the registration
of the trade mark related, the appellant even for that purpose is not entitled
to claim removal from register of the trade mark the device and word
"Synthes" on the ground of alleged non-user. In the present case, the
question of abandonment has to be judged in the peculiar set of facts. Here
the plaintiff/respondent No.1 is one who is not indulging in any trading
activities not only in India but also outside India. The plaintiff/respondent
No.2 does not have any registration as registered user of the trade marks in
India. It is not the case here where the trade mark has not been got renewed
by plaintiff/respondent No.1. It is different thing to look at the situation from
the point of view of trafficking in trade marks. But in the face of renewal of
the trade mark and allowing the plaintiff/respondent No.2 to use the same
exclusively and further tacitly allowing the appellant to use it, it is difficult
rather not possible to say that the trade mark in this case has been
abandoned."

                    a course of conduct inconsistent with the claim for
                    exclusive rights in a trade mark, trade name etc. It
                    implies positive acts; not merely silence or

                    distinguish mere negligence and acquiescence."
                    Therefore, acquiescence is one facet of delay. If
                    the plaintiff stood by knowingly and let the
                    defendants build up an important trade until it had
                    become necessary to crush it, then the plaintiffs

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_86">               "31. Even though there may be some doubt as to
               whether laces or acquiescence can deny the relief of a
               permanent injunction, judicial opinion has been
               consistent in holding that if the defendant acts
               fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating the
               plaintiff s rights then in that case, even if there is an
               inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking
               action against the defendant, the relief of injunction is not
               denied. The defense of laces or inordinate delay is a
               defense in equity. Inequity both the parties mud's come to
               the Court with clean hands. An equitable defense can be
               put up by a party who has acted fairly and honestly. A
               person who is guilty of violating the law or infringing or
               usurping somebody else's right cannot clarify the
               continued misuse of the usurped right. It was observed by
               Romer, J. in the matter of an application brought be J. R.
               Parkington and Co. Ld., (1946) 63 RPC 171 at page 181
               that "in my judgment, the circumstances which attend the
               adoption of a trade mark in the first instance are of
               considerable importance when one comes to consider
               whether the use of that mark has or has not been a honest
               user. If the user in its inception was tainted it would be
               difficult in most cases to purify it subsequently". It was
               further noted by the learned Judge in that case that he


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">CS(OS) No.156/2012 &amp; CS(OS) No.575/2012                             Page 67 of 72</span>
              could not regard the discreditable origin of the user as
             cleansed by the subsequent history. In other words, the
             equitable relief will be afforded only to that party who is
             not guilty of a fraud and whose conduct shows that, there
             had been, on his part, an honest concurrent user of the
             mark in question. If a party, for no apparent or a valid
             reason, adopts, with or without modifications, a mark
             belonging to another, whether registered or not, it will be
             difficult for that party to avoid an order of injunction
             because the Court may rightly assume that such adoption
             of the mark by the party was noting honest one. The
             Court would be justified in concluding that the defendant,
             in such an action, wanted to cash in on the plaintiffs
             name and reputation and that was the sole, primary or the
             real motive of the defendant adopting such a mark. Even
             if, in such a case, there may be an inordinate delay on the
             part of the plaintiff in bringing a suit for injunction, the
             application of the plaintiff for an interim injunction
             cannot be dismissed on the ground that the defendant has
             been using the mark for a number of years. Dealing with
             this aspect Harry D. Nims in his "The Law of Unfair
             Competition and Trade Marks", Fourth Edition, Volume
             Two at page 1282 noted as follows:

                    that he is violating plaintiffs rights, essential
                    elements of estoppels are lacking and in such a
                    case the protection of plaintiffs rights by injunctive
                    relief never is properly denied. "The doctrine of

<p id="p_211">84.   None of the cases referred by the defendant is applicable to the facts

refer even a single case in which the injunction has been refused by any
Court with similar circumstances. The facts in cases referred are materially
different and do not help the case of the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_212">85.   Rather, in case the law with regard to the rightful owner of the
trademark and the act of ex-licensee is examined, it emerges that either
during the licensing period of agreement or after expiry, it is implicit and
clear that the ex-licensee is not entitled to claim the ownership of a
trademark nor he is permitted by law to file an application for registration of
the trademark in his name nor is entitled to file the petition for rectification
of the same very trademarks in which ex-licensee was using the trademarks
as a permissive user, otherwise it would amount to fraud and
misrepresentation.    The ex-licensee under no circumstances can declare
himself as owner of the trademark to claim the concurrent user because as
per scheme of the Act, the benefit of concurrent user can be derived by a

 party whose user is honest and boanfide. In the present case, both things are
missing. In other words, he cannot be allowed to make a hole in the plate in
which he was eating; such wrongful user would be considered as stolen
property which cannot become rightful property in any amount of user.
