HEADNOTE:
     The appellants  who were carrying on business
in  tobacco   had  in	their  licenced	 warehouse
considerable quantity  of tobacco  on February 28,
1951. On the same day a Bill was introduced in the
House  of  the	People	containing  the	 financial
proposals of  the  Government  of  India  for  the
fiscal year  beginning April  1, 1951. Clause 7 of
the Bill  made provision  for the amendment of the
Central Excises	 and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_2">Salt  Act</a>, 1944,  by  way	of
alteration   of	   duties,    inter    alia,	on
unmanufactured tobacco	by imposing an excise duty
of 8  annas per	 1b. Under  the provisions  of the
<a href="/doc/853050/" id="a_3">Provisional Collection	of Taxes  Act</a>,	1931,  the
duty could become leviable as from the date of the
introduction of	 the Bill  and it  was so made. In
accordance therewith  the appellants  paid  excise
duty on	 tobacco in  their possession at the rates
mentioned  in  the  Bill  and  obtained	 clearance
certificates. On  April 28,  1951,  the	 Bill  was
passed and became <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_4">Finance Act</a>, 1951, but as passed
changes were effected as regards the duty proposed
in the Bill. Under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_5"> s. 7(1)</a> of the Finance Act, the
duty on unmanufactured tobacco was increased to 14
annas per  lb. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_6">Section 7</a> (2) thereof provided that
"the amendments	 made in  the Central  Excises and
<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_7">Salt Act</a>,  1944, shall be deemed to have effect on
and after  March 1,  1951 and  accordingly........
recoveries shall  be made of all duties which have
not been  collected  but  which	 would	have  been
collected  if  the  amendment  had  so	come  into
force." In  pursuance of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_8"> s. 7(2)</a> a demand was made
upon the  appellants on June 22, 1951, for payment
of the excess of the
2
excise duty  payable on tobacco cleared out of the
warehouse from	March 1,  1951, to April 28, 1951.
The appellants	challenged  the	 legality  of  the
demand on the grounds, inter alia, that (1) excise
duty was  a tax	 on goods  which must exist at the
time when the tax was levied and it must have been
intended and  expected by  the legislature that it
would be  passed on  to the  consumer, and  as the
retrospective operation of the duties deprived the
tax of	these qualities	 they did  not fall within
the term "duties of excise" in Entry 84, List I of
the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India,
and, therefore,	<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_9"> s. 7(2)</a> of the Finance Act, 1951,
in  so	 far  as   it  imposed	 an  excise   duty
retrospective before the date of its enactment was
beyond the  legislative competence  of	Parliament
and  (2)   the	impugned   levy	 contravened  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_10">Art.
19(1)(f</a>),  because  a  retrospective  levy  of	an
excise duty deprived the tax payer of the right of
passing it  on and  recovering it  from his buyer,
and that this constituted a restraint on the right
to hold property, which was not saved by cl.(5) of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_11">Art. 19.</a>
^
     HELD: (1)	Parliament acting  within its  own
legislative field  had the  powers of  a sovereign
legislature and	 could make a law prospectively as
well retrospectively and the duties leviable under
the  Central   Excises	and  <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_12">Salt  Act</a>,	 1944,	as
provided by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_13"> s. 7(2)</a>  of the  Finance  Act,  1951,
notwithstanding	    their      imposition     with
retrospective effect  and even	if it be that they
were incapable	of being passed on to a buyer from
the taxpayer,  were "duties  of excise" within the
meaning	 of  Entry  84,	 List  I  of  the  Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India.
     (2) The levy of the tax retrospectively under
s. 7(2)	 of the	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_14">Finance Act</a>,  1951, was valid and
did  not   contravene	<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_15">Art.   19(1)(f)</a>	  of   the
Constitution.
     Per Kapur,	 J.-(1) Entry  84 in  List I deals
with taxes  on	goods  manufactured  or	 produced,
while Entry  60 in List II deals with the carrying
on of  trade i.e.,  an activity	 in the	 nature of
buying and  selling, and  the Central  Excises and
<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_16">Salt Act</a>,  1944, in its pith and substance relates
to duty	 on goods manufactured or produced and has
no relationship with Entry 60.
     (2)  Reasonableness   of  tax   laws  is  not
justiciable and	 therefore they cannot fall within
cl.(5) of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_17">Art. 19.</a>  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_18">Art. 19(1)(f)</a>  and the cl.(5)
are part of one scheme and the former is incapable
of operating  where the	 latter is inoperative. If
considerations of <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_19">Art. 19(5)</a> are foreign to taxing
laws <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_20">Art.  19(1)(f)</a> can	 have  no  application	to
them.

140   of    1954   are	 tobacco   merchants   and
manufacturers	of   biris.   They   own   private
warehouses licensed  under r.  140 of  the  Excise
Rules, 1944  at Gondia	and other places in Madhya
Pradesh.
</p><p id="p_9">     On the  28th of  February, 1951  a	 Bill  was
introduced in  the House of the People, being Bill
13 of  1951 containing	the financial proposals of
the  Government	 of  India  for	 the  fiscal  year
beginning the  1st of April, 1951. Clause 7 of the
Bill made provision for the amendment of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">4</span>
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_22">Central Excise	Act</a> (Act  1 of	1944)  by  way	of
alteration of  duties on "tobacco manufactured and
unmanufactured." In  particular, it  provided that
"unmanufactured tobacco	 other than flue-cured and
ordinarily used otherwise than for the manufacture
of cigarettes"	(which included	  tobacco intended
for manufacture	 into biris)  should be charged to
an excise  duty of  8 annas  per lb.  and it  also
imposed a new duty of excise on biris varying from
6 to  9 annas per lb. depending upon the weight of
tobacco contained in the biris.
</p><p id="p_10">     <a href="/doc/1361816/" id="a_23">Section 3</a>	of the	Provisional Collection	of
Taxes Act, 1931 (Act XVI of 1931) enacted "Where a

inserted in  the bill  a declaration  that it  was
expedient  in	the  public   interest	that   any
provision of  the bill relating to such imposition
or increase shall have immediate effect under this
Act". A declaration under this section was made in
respect of  the provision  for imposing the duties
on  tobacco  under  cl.	 7  of	the  bill  already
adverted to.  The effect of such a declaration was
stated in s. 4 of Act XVI of 1931 in the following
terms:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "4. (1)  A declared provision shall have
     the force of law immediately on the expiry of

	  Bill containing it was introduced."
     In compliance  with this  law the	appellants
     paid the  excise duty  at the  rates  imposed
     under  cl.	  7  of	  the  bill  and  obtained
     clearance	certificates   in  regard  to  the
     tobacco moved  out from their warehouses from
     and after	March 1, 1951. Bill 13 of 1951 was

     1951 (Act XXIII of 1951 on April 28, 1951 but

<p id="p_12">     In pursuance  of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_30"> s.  7</a> (2)	 a demand was made
upon the  appellants on	 June  22,  1951  for  the
payment of  the duty payable by them, after giving
credit for  the refund	of the	duty paid on biris
which had  been deleted by the Act. The appellants
contested  the	 legality  of  this  demand  by	 a
petition under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Art. 226</a>  which they  filed in the
High Court at Nagpur urging that the retrospective
operation given	 to<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_32"> s.	7(1)</a> by	 sub-s.(2) thereof
was illegal,  ultra vires  and	 unconstitutional,
and besides  that the  provision in  r. 10  of the
Excise Rules  which contained  the  machinery  for
enforcing the  demand was not adequate to meet the
situation arising  out of  the change  in the  law
from the  provisions of	 the bill  to those of the
Act. The learned Judges of the High Court repelled
all  the  contentions  disputing  the  legislative
competence  and	  the  constitutionality   of  the
legislation contained  in<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_33"> s.  7(2)</a> of  the Finance
Act of	1951, but they upheld the objection to the
adequacy of  the procedure  for recovery  based on
the limited  scope of  r. 10  of the Excise Rules.
Thereafter   the    Central   Government,   by	 a
notification dated  December 8	1951, amended  the
Central Excise	Rules, 1944  by the  addition of a
new r.	104 providing machinery specially designed
f r  the enforcement  of a  demand  like  the  one
arising in  the circumstances of the present case.
On December  12, 1951 a further and a fresh demand
was made  for the  payment of the duty in terms of
s. 7(2)(b)  of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_34">Finance Act</a> quoted earlier, and
the appellants thereupon once again moved the High
Court of  Nagpur under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Art. 226</a>  challenging  the
validity of the demand on the very same grounds as
before. This petition was heard by a Full Bench of
the Court  and	every  contention  raised  by  the
appellants including that based on the adequacy of
the new	 r. 10A	 to cover  the	present	 case  was
rejected. The learned Judges granted a certificate
under <a href="/doc/783690/" id="a_36">Art.  132</a>	 of  the  Constitution	which  was
enabled the appellants to file this appeal. Before
proceeding further  it is  only necessary to state
that there  is no  material difference between the
facts of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">7</span>
cases covered by Civil Appeals 141, 142 as well as
the points  raised in  the Writ Petitions and that
this judgment  will cover and dispose of the other
appeals and  the petitions. We might also, at this
stage  mention	 that  other   parties	who   were
similarly situated  as	the  appellants	 in  Civil
Appeals 140  to 142  of 1954  and  who	had  filed
petitions under	 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_37">Art. 226</a>  of the  Constitution in
the High  Court of Madras which arc pending there,
raising the  same points as the appellant's before
us, have intervened in these appeals and they have
also been heard. Learned Counsel appearing for the
interveners adopted the arguments urged in support
of the appeal.
</p><p id="p_13">     Mr. Pathak,  learned Counsel who appeared for
the appellants urged three point in support of the
appeals(1) <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_38">Section  7</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_39">Finance Act</a>, 1951
in  so	 far  as   it  imposed	 an  excise   duty
retrospectively before	the date  of its enactment
(April	28,   1951)  was  beyond  the  legislative
competence of  Parliament. The	contention on this
head  was  briefly  this:  The	impugned  tax  was
imposed by Parliament in purported exercise of the
power to levy "a duty of excise on tobacco" within
Legislative Entry 84 of Union list which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  "Duties of  excise on	 tobacco and other
     goods  manufactured   or  produced	 in  India
     except
     An "excise"  was basically	 an indirect  tax,
i.e., a	 tax or	 duty not  intended by	the taxing
authority to  be borne by the person on whom it is
imposed and  from whom	it  is	collected  but	is
intended to  be passed	on to  those who purchased
the goods  on which  the duty  was collected;  but
when such  a tax  was imposed  with  retrospective
effect it  could not  be passed on, so such a levy
deprived the  tax of  its essential characteristic
of being  indirect. It	therefore ceased  to be	 a
"duty of excise" and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">8</span>
became a personal tax of a category quite distinct
from "excise"  and so  was beyond  the legislative
power of Parliament under that Entry. (2) That the
impugned levy  was  unconstitutional  in  that	it
contravened the	 fundamental right  guaranteed	to
the citizens  of India to hold property under Art.
</blockquote><p id="p_14">19(1)(f),   the	  point	  urged	  being	  that	 a
retrospective levy  of an  "excise duty"  deprived
the tax-payer  of the  right of	 passing it on and
recovering  it	 from	his   buyer,   that   this
constituted a  restraint on  "the  right  to  hold
property" (the	amount of  the tax-levy) conferred
by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_40">Art.	 19(1)(f)</a> and  was not	saved by  cl. 5 of
that Article  as being	a reasonable restraint and
should,	 therefore,  be	 struck	 down  under  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_41">Art.
13(2).</a> (3)  That the terms of r. 10A of the Excise
Rules 1944 were insufficient to cover the cases of
the appellants	and that in consequence the demand
made on	 them and  the attempt to recover the sums
by resort  to the coercive process provided for by
s. 11  of the  central <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_42">Excise  Act</a> was illegal and
without statutory authority.
</p><p id="p_15">     We shall now proceed to consider these points
in that order. (1) Want of legislative competence:
To appreciate the submission of learned Counsel it
is necessary to set out the steps in the reasoning
by which  he sought,  to establish that a "duty of
excise" when  imposed  with  retrospective  effect
ceased to  be a	 "duty of excise" as used in Entry
84 of  the Union  List. The  submission of learned
Counsel was  this: The	term "duty  of excise"	on
goods was  universally recognized as a tax on home
produced goods	and as	a typical  instance of	an
indirect tax.  It was  a tax  on the  activity	of
production or  manufacture  of	goods  within  the
country and  that it  was levied  on or	 collected
from tho  producer or  manufacturer or	from those
who held  such	goods.	It  was,  further,  not	 a
personal tax  but its essential and characteristic
nature, which distinguished it from other types of
taxes was  that it  was levied	on goods.  It had,
therefore, in order that it might
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">9</span>
truly be  "duty of  excise", to satisfy two tests:
</p><p id="p_16">(a) It	had to	be an indirect tax, i.e. levied in
such a	manner that  the person	 from whom the tax
was collected  was in a, position to pass it on to
those who  acquired the goods from him or at least
the taxing  authority expected	him to pass it on,
and laid  no impediment	 on his	 ability to do it.
</p><p id="p_17">(b) Being  a tax  on goods,  it was  levied on the
producer or  manufacturer or  person in possession
of the goods at the time when the person taxed was
the owner  or had  possession and control over the
goods. Where  neither of  these essential elements
or attributes  was present,  and in  the  present,
case,  according   to  learned	 Counsel   neither
condition was  satisfied, the  tax-levy would  not
fall under the category of "duty of excise."
</p><p id="p_18">     The same argument was Presented in a slightly
different from	by saying  that though Parliament,
generally speaking,  had the power to legislate in
respect of  everyone of	 the subjects  included in
the   relevant	  legislative	entries	   whether
prospectively,	 or    retrospectively	 including
legislation with  regard to taxation, still if the
retrospective  levy   of  a   taxes,  altered  its
essential nature  and identity,	 then the power to
legislate  retrospectively   would  be	 open	to
Parliament only	 if the	 tax in	 its altered from-
i.e., a	 tax direct  and personal-would be open to
Parliament to  impose. In  the case  of a "duty of
excise" as  the tax  in the  present case  was, if
imposed	 retrospectively,   deprived  it   of  its
essential characteristic  of being in indirect tax
and a tax on goods, and so the power of Parliament
to  enact  such	 retrospective	legislation  would
depend upon  whether Parliament could impose a tax
on a  person merely because he happened to produce
goods at  an antecedent date, or, happened to have
had in	his control goods of indigenous production
at a  prior date and if this could not be done, it
would follow  that Parliament  could not  impose a
"duty of excise" with retrospective effect.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">10</span>
<p id="p_19">     In support	 of his	 submission regarding  the
nature of  an excise  duty and	that meaning  that
ought to  be attributed	 to the	 expression as	it
occurs in  Entry 84  of the union List, Mr. Pathak
placed before us judgments of the Privy Council in
appeals from  Canada and  some	decisions  of  the
American Supreme  Court and of the Australian High
Court.
</p><p id="p_20">     First as  to the  decisions relating  to  the
Canadian  constitution	 though	 learned   Counsel
referred  us   to   several   decisions	  on   the
interpretation of  the word "excise" in connection
with the  distinction between  direct and indirect
taxes in  most of  the British	North America Act,
1867, we do not think it necessary to refer to all
of them.
</p><p id="p_21">     The general  line of  approach of	the  Privy
Council	 decisions  referred  by  learned  Counsel
could be  gathered from	 the observations  of Lord
Cave in	 City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate. The
impugned  tax	legislation  was  a  business  tax
imposed by  the Province of Nova Scotia to be paid
by  every   occupier  of  real	property  for  the
purposes  of   any  trade,  profession,	 or  other
calling carried	 on for	 the purpose  of gain, the
assessment being according to the capital value of
the premises.  This was	 challenged inter  alia on
the  ground  that  it  was  an	indirect  tax  and
therefore not within the legislative competence of
the Provincial Legislature. Lord Cave said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "Thus, taxes	on property or income were
     everywhere treated	 as direct taxes; and John
     Stuart Mill  himself, following  Adam  Smith,
     Ricardo and  James Mill,  said that  a tax on
     rents falls wholly on the landlord and cannot
     be transferred to any one else............ On
     the other	hand, duties of customs and excise
     were  regarded   by  every	  one  as  typical
     instances	 of    indirect	  taxation.   When
     therefore the  Act	 of  Union  allocated  the
     power  of	 direct	 taxation  for	Provincial
     purposes to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">11</span>
     the Province,  it must  surely have  intended
     that the  taxation, for  those  purposes,	of
     property and income should belong exclusively
     to	 the  Provincial  legislatures,	 and  that
     without  regard  to  any  theory  as  to  the
     ultimate incidence	 of such taxation. To hold
     otherwise	would	be  to	suppose	 that  the
     framers of	 the Act  intended to  impose on a
     Provincial	  legislature	 the	task	of
     speculating  as   to  the	probable  ultimate
     incidence of  each particular  tax	 which	it
     might desire to impose, at the risk of having
     such  tax	held  invalid  if  the	conclusion
     reached  should  afterwards  be  held  to	be
     wrong........... The  imposition of  taxes on
     property and  income, of  death duties and of
     municipal and  local rates	 is, according	to
     the common	 understanding of the term, direct
     taxation, just  as the  exaction of a customs
     or	 excise	 duty  on  commodities............
     would  ordinarily	be  regarded  as  indirect
     taxation; and  although new forms of taxation
     may  from	time  to  time	be  added  to  one
     category or  the  other  in  accordance  with
     Mill's formula as a ground for transferring a
     tax universally  recognised as  belonging	to
     one class to a different class of taxation."
</blockquote><p id="p_22">Similar passages in relation to a "duty of excise"
being an  indirect tax occur in other judgments of
the Judicial  Committee to  which learned  Counsel
drew our  attention. Of these, it is sufficient to
refer to  one  more-Attorney-General  for  British
Columbia v.  Kingcome Navigation  Company, Limited
which raised  the question  as to  whether  a  tax
which was  imposed upon every consumer of fuel-oil
according to  the quantity  which he  had consumed
imposed by the Fuel-Oil Tax Act of 1930 of British
Columbia was  a direct tax under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_43"> s. 92</a>, head 2, of
the  British   North  America	Act,  1867.  After
extracting the	following  passage  from  Bank	of
Toronto v. Lambe:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">12</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "A direct  tax is  one which is demanded
     from the  very persons  who it is intended or
     desired should  pay it.  Indirect	taxes  are
     those which  are demanded	from one person in
     the expectation  and intention  that he shall
     indemnify himself	at the expense of another;
     such are the excise or customs.
</blockquote><p id="p_23">Lord Moulton  who delivered  the judgment  of  the
Board referred to the passage from the judgment of
Lord Cave  in City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate
just now quoted and went on to add:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "The ultimate	 incidence of  the tax	in
     the sense	of the	political economist, is to
     be disregarded,  but where the tax is imposed
     in	 respect  of  a	 transaction,  the  taxing
     authority is  indifferent as  to which of the
     parties to	 the transaction  ultimately bears
     the burden	 ........... Similarly,	 where the
     tax is  imposed in	 respect of  some  dealing
     with commodities,	such as	 their	import	or
     sale, or  production for sale, the tax is not
     a peculiar	 contribution upon  the one of the
     parties to	 the  trading  in  the	particular
     commodity who  is selected	 as the tax payer.
     This is  brought out  in the second paragraph
     of Mill's	definition, and	 is  true  of  the
     typical custom  and excise duties referred to
     by Lord  Cave." The tax was therefore held to
     be valid.</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">     We consider that not much assistance could be
derived	  from	  these	   decisions	for    the
interpretation of the scope or content of the term
"duties of  excise" in Entry 84 of the Union List.
The line of division in Canada between those taxes
which a	 Province could	 impose and those which it
could not  was, whether it was direct or indirect.
In Canada,  taxing powers  are divided between the
Dominion and  the Provinces  on the  basis of  the
incidence of the tax, the Dominion power extending
to "any	 mode or  system of  taxation" (vide<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_44"> s. 91</a>
(3) British North America Act, 1867) while that of
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">13</span>
Provinces is restricted to "direct taxation within
the Province  in order	to the	raising of revenue
for provincial	purposes"  (<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_45">Section  92(2)</a>  ibid).
When therefore	the validity of any Provincial tax
legislation is challenged in Canada the enquiry is
as regards the normal incidence of the tax whether
it is "direct" or "indirect." As these expressions
had a  settled meaning	in  economic  theory,  the
Courts had  necessarily to  find out  whether  the
particular tax imposed by the Province fell within
the class  of "indirect"  taxes or  not. In such a
situation   naturally	 the   classification	by
economists of taxes as those which are "direct" as
distinct from those which are "indirect" assumed a
vital role in deciding whether the tax impugned is
or is  not within Provincial power. As pointed out
by Gwyer,  C.J. in the <a href="/doc/882976/" id="a_46">Province of Madras v. Boddu
Paidanna</a>:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  "The Canadian	 cases which were cited do
     not seem  to  afford  any	assistance,  since
     analogous	problems   in  Canada  are  always
     concerned	with   questions  of   direct  and
     indirect taxation; and if a Provincial tax is
     held to be an indirect tax, it is unnecessary
     for the  Court to consider whether it may not
     also be  a duty  of excise:  see, for example
     Att.-Gen.	for   British  Columbia	  v.   The
     Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (1927 A.C. 934),
     where a tax on every person purchasing within
     the Province  fuel oil  for  the  first  time
     after  its	 manufacture  in,  or  importation
     into, the	Province was held to be invalid as
     an indirect  tax, and the question whether it
     might not	also be	 bad as an excise duty was
     left unanswered. In contrast to the case just
     cited we  may refer  to Att. Gen. for British
     Columbia v.  Kingcome  Navigation	Co.  (1934
     A.C. 45) in which a fuel oil tax imposed by a
     Province upon  every  consumer  of	 fuel  oil
     according to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">14</span>
     the quantity  which he  had consumed was held
     to be  valid as  a direct tax, because it was
     demanded from  the very  persons who  it  was
     intended or desired should pay it."
</blockquote><p id="p_25">Similarly,  Lord   Simonds  observed  in  Governor
General in Council v. Province of Madras:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	  "little assistance is to be derived from
     the   consideration    of	  other	   federal
     constitutions   and    of	 their	  judicial
     interpretation. Here  there is no question of
     direct and	 indirect  taxation,  nor  of  the
     definition of specific and residuary powers."
</blockquote><p id="p_26">Under  the   Indian  Constitution  the	scheme	of
division of  the taxing	 powers between	 the Union
and the	 States is  not	 based	on  any	 criterion
dependent on the incidence of the tax. Sir Maurice
Gwyer in In re the Central Provinces and <a href="/doc/560085/" id="a_47">Berar Act</a>
XIV of	1938 speaking  of  the	word  "excise"	as
occurring  in	the  legislative   lists  in   the
Government of  India Act  (and	for  this  purpose
there is no variation in the lists in Schedule VII
of the Constitution) said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  "Its primary	and fundamental meaning in
     English is that of a tax on articles produced
     or manufactured  in the  taxing  country  and
     intended for home consumption. I am satisfied
     that this is also its primary and fundamental
     meaning in	 India; and  no one  has suggested
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">     that it has any other meaning in Entry No. 45</span>
     (corresponding  to	 Entry	84  in	the  Union
     List).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	  It was  then contended  on behalf of the
     Government of  India that an excise duty is a
     duty which	 may be imposed upon home produced
     goods  at	 any  state   from  production	to
     consumption; and  that therefore  the federal
     legislative power extended to imposing excise
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">15</span>
     duties at	any stage.  This is to confuse two
     things, the  nature of  excise duties and the
     extent of	the federal  legislative power	to
     impose them  ......... There can be no reason
     in theory	why an	excise duty  should not be
     imposed  even   on	 the  retail  sale  of	an
     article,  if  the	taxing	Act  so	 provides.
     Subject always  to the legislative competence
     of the  taxing authority,	a  duty	 on  home-
     produced goods  will obviously  be imposed at
     the stage	which the authority find to be the
     most  convenient	and  the  most	lucrative,
     wherever it  may be;  but that is a matter of
     the machinery  of collection,  and	 does  not
     affect the	 essential nature  of the tax. The
     ultimate  incidence  of  an  excise  duty,	 a
     typical indirect  tax, must  always be on the
     consumer, who pays as he consumes or expends;
     and it  continues to  be an excise duty, that
     is,  a   duty  on	 home-produced	or   home-
     manufactured goods,  no matter  at what stage
     it is collected."
</blockquote><p id="p_27">As Lord	 Simonds said  in the  decision, to  which
reference has already been made after referring to
the decision  of the  Federal Court  in	 the  C.P.
Petrol case:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	  "Consistently with  this decision  their
     Lordships are  of	opinion	 that  a  duty	of
     excise  primarily	 a  duty   levied   on	 a
     manufacturer or  producer in  respect of  the
     commodity manufactured  or produced.  It is a
     tax on  goods not on sales or the proceeds of
     sale of goods,"
</blockquote><p id="p_28">and then speaking about taxes on sale of goods the
learned Lord continued:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	  "The two  taxes, the	one  levied  on	 a
     manufacturer in  respect of  his  goods,  the
     other on  a vender	 in respect  of his sales,
     may, as  is there	pointed out,  in one sense
     overlap. But  in law there is no overlapping.
     The taxes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">16</span>
     are separate and distinct imposts. If in fact
     they overlap,  that may be because the taxing
     authority, imposing  a duty  of excise, finds
     it convenient  to impose  that  duty  at  the
     moment when the exciseable article leaves the
     factory or workshop for the first time on the
     occasion of  its sale.  But  that	method	of
     collecting	 the   tax  is	 an  accident	of
     administration; it	 is not	 of the essence of
     the duty of excise, which is attracted by the
     manufacture itself."</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">     In view  of  this	clear  exposition  of  the
content of the term "duty of excise" in the Indian
setting we think, no assistance can be derived for
the  meaning   ascribed	 and  the  characteristics
attributed to  it in  the decision  construing the
relative taxing	 powers of  the Dominion  and  the
Provinces under	 the  British  North  America  Act
1867.
</p><p id="p_30">     Before dealing  with the  Australian decision
to which  Mr. Pathak  drew our attention, we could
conveniently dispose  of the  American cases which
were referred to by the learned counsel bearing on
the meaning  of the  word "excise". We might point
out that  the American decisions do not assist the
appellant   in	 the   least   since   under   the
Constitution  of  the  United  States  practically
every tax other than a capitation, a poll tax or a
tax on	land is	 termed an  "excise duty" and even
income-tax was	held to	 be an	'excise' until the
decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
in Pollock  v. Farmers	Loan &amp; Trust Co. It has to
be borne  in mind  that the  American Constitution
provides that  direct taxes have to be apportioned
among the  States according  to	 their	respective
populations (<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_48">Art.  1</a>,<a href="/doc/546849/" id="a_49"> s.  2</a>, and <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_50">Art. 1</a>,<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_51"> s. 9</a>, cl.
</p><p id="p_31">4). Hence  the attempt	in the	United States  has
been  to   bring  taxes	 which	according  to  the
classification of economists would be direct taxes
within the  category of	 excise or  indirect taxes
which need not follow the rule as to apportionment
among the States. It follows,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">17</span>
therefore, that	 neither the  American	decisions,
nor  the  understanding	 by  the  Courts  of  that
country as  to what  a duty of excise connotes can
be of any utility for deciding the content of that
entry in the Indian Constitution. The relevance of
the American decisions is, therefore, even remoter
than the  decisions from  Canada which were relied
on by the learned Counsel.
</p><p id="p_32">     Mr.  Pathak   referred  us	 to  some  of  the
decisions in Australia and in particular to Parton
v.  Milk   Board  (Victoria)  in  support  of  his
submission that	 the characteristic  of	 being	an
indirect tax and therefore the capability of being
passed on  was an  essential ingredient	 and  pre-
requisite of an excise duty. In this connection it
is necessary  to point	out that  the decisions in
Canada which  were relied on by Mr. Pathak as aids
for understanding  the import  of  the	expression
"duty of excise" in Entry 84, have been treated by
the Australian	Courts as not helpful to determine
the  meaning   of  "excise"   in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_52"> s.   90</a>  of  the
commonwealth of	 Australia Act.	 As  explained	by
Wynes:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	  "In Canada, the distribution of taxation
     is	 based	 upon  the   direct  and  indirect
     character thereof, the Provincial power being
     limited  to   direct  taxation   within   the
     Province. Hence  Canadian cases  such as  the
     Bank of  Toronto v.  Lambe are of very little
     use in settling the question whether or not a
     tax is a duty of customs or excise within the
     meaning of the Australian Constitution.
</blockquote><p id="p_33">It may	be pointed  out that  under the Australian
Constitution taxes  levied on  commercial dealings
in goods  produced, such  as taxes  on sales, have
been held  to fall within the category of excises.
Several of  the decisions  of the  Australian High
Court  rendered	  before  Parton   v.  Milk  Board
(Victoria dealing with what constituted an excise
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">18</span>
under s.  90 of the Commonwealth of Australian Act
were cited to the Federal Court in the <a href="/doc/882976/" id="a_53">Province of
Madras v.  Boddu Paidanna</a>  and the  learned  Chief
Justice,  after	  referring  to	 them  in  detail,
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	  "We find  it impossible  to say that the
     expression	 'duties   of  excise'	 even	in
     Australia is  limited to  duties  imposed	in
     connection with the production of a commodity
     alone. We	should be  disposed to	say on the
     contrary that  in Australia  all taxes on the
     sale of  commodities are, or may be regarded,
     as, duties	 of excise............	Under  the
     Australian	 Constitution	power  to   impose
     duties of	excise is,  as we  have said,  the
     exclusive	 right	  of   the    Commonwealth
     Parliament;  the	residuary   taxing   power
     remains  in   the	States.	  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_54">In  the   Indian
     Constitution Act</a>  the  whole  of  the  taxing
     power in  this particular sphere is expressly
     apportioned  between   the	 Centre	  and  the
     Provinces, to  the	 one  being  assigned  the
     power to  impose duties  of  excise,  to  the
     other taxes on the sale of goods."</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">     The decision  in the  Milk Board case follows
in general  the same  lines  as	 did  the  earlier
decisions which	 have been  detailed and discussed
by Sir	Maurice Gwyer C. J. in Paidanna's case. In
these circumstances  we do  not consider it useful
or   necessary	 to   discuss	these	decisions.
Undoubtedly, there are passages in these judgments
in the	Australian Courts  which refer to the fact
that an	 excise duty is an instance of an indirect
tax. As	 regards the general proposition, however,
there is  little controversy,  but these decisions
did not	 lay down  that if  by reason  of the  tax
being levied  retrospectively the  duty cannot	be
passed on it ceased to be a duty of excise. On the
other hand,  there is  express and  high authority
for the	 position that	a duty	of excise could be
validly levied with retrospective effect under the
Australian Constitution. The question for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">19</span>
consideration before the privy Council in Colonial
Sugar Refining	Company Ltd.  v. Irving related to
the constitutional  validity of	 the <a href="/doc/1469183/" id="a_55">Excise Tariff
Act</a>, 1902,  passed by the Commonwealth Parliament.
One of	the objections raised to the levy was that
on the	terms of the enactment which was passed on
the 26th of July, 1902, the imposition of the duty
could be  as and  from October 8, 1901, the day on
which the  Minister had moved a resolution to that
effect in  the committee  of Ways  &amp; Means  of the
House of  Representatives. The	respondent  before
the Board  who were manufacturers of refined sugar
in Brisbane  in the State of Queensland questioned
the legality  of the  tax which	 had been demanded
and paid  by them in respect of the sugar produced
by them	 between October  8, 1901,  and	 July  26,
1902. Lord  Davey delivering  the judgment  of the
Board observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  "It is  a little difficult to understand
     the first	point taken by the appellants. The
     Parliament	 had  undoubted	 power	to  impose
     taxation under  the express words of<a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_56"> s. 51</a> of
     the Constitution,	and it is not now disputed
     that the Parliament could, if it thought fit,
     make the  Act retrospective  and  impose  the
     duties from  the date of the resolution. That
     practice  is  (it	is  believed)  universally
     followed  in  the	imperial  Parliament,  and
     (their Lordships  were told) is common in the
     Colonial  Legislatures   in  Acts	 of   this
     description, and  for obvious  reasons it	is
     convenient and  almost necessary.	There  was
     nothing, therefore,  in  either  the  subject
     matter of	the Act, or in the mode of dealing
     with it,  which was  beyond the  power of the
     Parliament."</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">     In our opinion, the above aptly describes and
covers the  point raised  by the appellants in the
appeals now before us.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">20</span>
<p id="p_36">     There is  no doubt	 that excise  duties  have
been referred  to by  the economists  and  in  the
judgments of  the Privy	 Council as well as in the
Australian  decisions	as  an	 instance  of	an
"indirect tax",	 but in	 construing the expression
"duty of  excise" as  it occurs in Entry 84 we are
not concerned  so much	with whether  the  tax	is
"direct" or  "indirect" as upon the transaction or
activity on  which it  is imposed. In this context
one  has  to  bear  in	mind  the  fact	 that  the
challenge to  the legislative  competence  of  the
tax-levy is  not directed  to the  imposition as a
whole but to a very limited and restricted part of
it.  This   challenge  is   confined  (a)  to  the
operation of  the tax  between the period March 1,
1951, and  April 28,  1951, and (b) even in regard
to this	 limited period,  it is	 restricted to the
imposition of the additional duty of six annas per
lb. which  was levied,	beyond the eight annas per
lb. collected from the appellants by virtue of the
Finance	 Bill	under  the   provisions	  of   the
<a href="/doc/853050/" id="a_57">Provisional Collection	of  Taxes  Act</a>,	 1931.	It
would seem  to	be  rather  a  strange	result	to
achieve	 that  the  tax	 imposed  satisfies  every
requirement of a "duty of excise" in so far as the
tax operates from and after April 28, 1951, but is
not a  "duty of	 excise" for  the duration  of two
months before that date.
</p><p id="p_37">     Learned Counsel  conceded, as he had to, that
even on	 the decision relied upon by him, the fact
that owing  to the operation of economic forces it
was not	 possible for  the taxpayer to pass on the
burden of the tax, did not alter the nature of the
imposition and	detract from  its being a "duty of
excise". For  instance, the  state of  the  market
might be  such that  the  duty	imposed	 upon  and
collected from	the producer or manufacturer might
not be	capable of  being passed on to buyers from
him. Learned  Counsel urged  that this	would  not
matter, as  one had to have regard to "the general
tendency of the tax" and "the expectation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">21</span>
of the taxing authority" and to the possibility of
its being  passed on  and not  to the facts of any
particular case	 which impeded	the  operation	of
natural economic forces.
</p><p id="p_38">     The impediment  to the  duty being	 passed on
might  be  due	not  merely  to	 private  bargains
between	  the	parties	  or   abnormal	  economic
situations such	 as the	 market	 for  a	 commodity
being a	 buyers' market.  Such impediments  may be
brought about by the operation of other laws which
Parliament might  enact,  such	for  instance,	as
control over  prices. If  in such a situation were
the price  which the  producer	might  charge  his
buyer is  fixed by  the	 statute,  say	under  the
Essential Supplies  Act, and a "duty of excise" is
later imposed on the manufacturer, it could not be
said that  the duty  imposed would  not answer the
description of	an "excise  duty". Learned Counsel
had really  no answer  to the situation created by
such a	control of  economy except  to say that it
would be  an abnormal economic situation. It could
hardly be  open to argument that a tax levied on a
manufacturer could  be stated not to be a "duty of
excise", merely because by reason of the operation
of other  laws the  tax payer was not permitted to
pass on	 the tax-levy. The retrospective levy of a
tax  would   be	 one   further	instance  of  such
inability to  pass on,	which doses  not alter the
real nature or true character of the duty.
</p><p id="p_39">     It might  further be  pointed  out	 that  the
submission of the learned Counsel that a tax which
according to economic theory is an indirect tax or
a tax on goods becomes a direct and a personal tax
and a  tax of  a different  nature or  category if
imposed	 retrospectively   because  it	 was  then
incapable of  being passed  on, does not correctly
represent the  law as  laid down by this Court. In
common with duties of customs and excise, a tax on
the sale of goods is another instance of a typical
indirect tax

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  "The ultimate	 incidence of  the tax	in
     the sense	of political  economist is  to	be
     disregarded and  referred to a tax imposed in
     respect of	 some dealings in commodities such
     as their  import or  sale or  production  for
     sale as  instances of indirect taxes, the tax
     not being a peculiar contribution upon one of
     the parties  to the trading in the particular
     commodity selected as the tax-payer."
</blockquote><p id="p_40">The question  of the validity of the imposition of
a sales	 tax with retrospective effect came up for
consideration before this Court in the <a href="/doc/1629177/" id="a_58">Tata Iron &amp;
Steel Co.  Ltd. v. The State of Bihar</a>. An argument
similar to  the one  now presented  before us  was
submitted to  this Court in challenge of that levy
which was summarized by Das, C.J., in these terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "The retrospective levy by reason of the
     amendment of <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_59"> s. 4(1)</a> (of the Bihar Sales tax
     Act  which	  was	impugned)   destroys   its
     character as  a sales  tax	 and  makes  it	 a
     direct  tax  on  the  dealer  instead  of	an
     indirect  tax   to	 be   passed  on   to  the
     consumer."
</blockquote><p id="p_41">Dealing with  this point the learned Chief Justice
said :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  "The argument	 is that  sales-tax is	an
     indirect tax  on the  consumer. The  idea	is
     that the  seller  will  pass  it  on  to  his
     purchaser and  collect it	from them. If that
     is the  nature of	the sales-tax  then, urges
     the learned  Attorney-General, it	cannot	be
     imposed  retrospectively	after	the   sale
     transaction has been concluded by the passing
     of title from the seller to the buyer, for it
     cannot, at that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">23</span>
     stage,    be     passed	 on	to     the
     purchaser............... Once  that time goes
     past,  the	  seller  loses	  the  chance	of
     realising it  from the  purchaser and  if	it
     cannot be	realised from  the  purchaser,	it
     cannot be	called sales-tax.  In our judgment
     this argument is not sound. From the point of
     view of  the economist  and  as  an  economic
     theory, sales-tax	may be	an indirect tax on
     the consumers,  but legally  in need  not	be
     so......... This also makes it clear that the
     sales-tax	need  not  be  passed  on  to  the
     purchasers and  this fact	does not alter the
     real nature  of the tax which, by the express
     provisions of  the	 law,  is  cast	 upon  the
     seller .......... If that be the true view of
     sales-tax then  the Bihar	Legislature acting
     within its	 own  legislative  field  had  the
     powers of	a sovereign  legislature and could
     make  the	 law  prospectively   as  well	as
     retrospectively. We  do not  think that there
     is any substance in this contention."
</blockquote><p id="p_42">In our	judgment this  passage covers the argument
regarding a  duty of  excise getting its essential
nature altered	and ceasing to be a duty of excise
if  imposed   retrospectively.	 The   submission,
therefore, lacks any force and is rejected.
</p><p id="p_43">     It is  also necessary to refer to one further
matter : Even assuming that the learned Counsel is
right in  his submission,  that to  be a  duty	of
excise within  Entry 84	 of  the  Union	 List  the
taxing authority  should have  expected the tax to
be passed  on, we consider that learned Counsel is
not right  in submitting  that	condition  is  not
satisfied in  the case	of the	levy now impugned.
The provisions	of the	impugned enactment have to
be read	 in the	 light of <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_60"> s. 64A</a>  of the  Sale of
Goods Act which enacts:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	  "In the  event of any duty of customs or
     excise on	any goods being imposed, increased
     decreased or remitted after the making of any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">24</span>
     contract for  the sale  of such goods without
     stipulation as  to the  payment of duty where
     duty was  not chargeable  at the  time of the
     making of	the contract,  or for  the sale of
     such   goods   duty-paid	where	duty   was
     chargeable at that time:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	       (a) if  such imposition or increase
	  so  takes   effect  that   the  duty	or
	  increased duty,  as the  case-may be	or
	  any part  thereof, is	 paid, the  seller
	  may add so much to the contract price as
	  will be equivalent to the amount paid in
	  respect of  such  duty  or  increase	of
	  duty, and  he shall  be entitled  to	be
	  paid and  to sue  for and  recover  such
	  addition, and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	       (b) if  such decrease  or remission
	  so takes  effect that the decreased duty
	  only or  no duty, as the case may be, is
	  paid, the  buyer may deduct so much from
	  the contract price as will be equivalent
	  to the decrease of duty or remitted duty
	  and he shall not be liable to pay, or be
	  sued	for   or  in   respect	of,   such
	  deduction."
</blockquote><p id="p_44">This provision	originally formed  s.  10  of  the
Tariff Act  VIII  of  1894  and	 was  subsequently
enacted as <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_61"> s. 10</a> in the Indian Tariff Act of 1934
(cl  Act   XXXII  of  1934).  The  object  of  the
statutory provision  is that  where contracts  for
the sale  of goods  are entered into and the price
payable	 therefor   determined	on  the	 basis	of
existing rates	of duty-either	of  excise  or	of
customs-neither	 party	 shall	be  prejudiced	or
advantaged by  reason of  the increase or decrease
of the duty. The question as to the scope of<a href="/doc/254925/" id="a_62"> s. 10</a>
of  the	  Tariff  Act	of  1894   came	  up   for
consideration before  a Bench  of the  Madras High
Court whose  decision is  reported in Narayanan v,
Kadir Sahib  (1). The suit out of which the second
appeal before the High
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">25</span>
Court arose  was by a buyer of salt for the refund
of salt-excise	duty which  had been reduced after
the date  of the contract. The transaction of sale
between the plaintiff and the defendant took place
on March  5, 1922,  and the  price payable  by the
plaintiff was based on the rate of duty prevailing
on that date. Subsequent thereto the Government of
India reduced the duty on salt from Rs. 5/- to Rs.
2/8/- per  bag and  this was to have effect from a
date prior  to March  5, 1922.	The defendant-firm
(the sellers)  had obtained  from  the	Government
refund of the duty on the salt sold by them to the
plaintiff. It  was to  recover this amount of duty
that the  suit was filed by the buyer. The learned
Judges held  that on  the terms	 of s,	10 of  the
<a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_63">Tariff Act</a>  of 1894 (indentical with<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_64"> s. 64A</a> of the
Sale of	 Goods Act) the fact that the contract was
no longer  executory but  that delivery	 had  been
made and  the  price  paid,  was  no  bar  to  the
plaintiff succeeding in his suit.
</p><p id="p_45">     It will  be seen that<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_65"> s. 64A</a> is in two parts:
the first  cl. (a)  dealing with  the case  of	an
increase in  duty and conferring on the seller the
right to  recover the amount of the increased duty
from the buyer, and the second limb (cl. b) making
provision  regarding  the  correlated  case  of	 a
reduction in the duty with corresponding rights to
the buyer  to obtain  the benefit  of a reduction.
Whatever argument  might be  raised baned upon the
language of  the second limb of the section, it is
not open  to doubt that in the case of an increase
in duty,  the seller  would be entitled to recover
the duty from the buyer provided: (a) there was no
contract to the contrary by which he had precluded
himself from  claiming such  enhanced duty, i. e.,
the  contract  having  negatived  or  limited  the
seller's right	to prefer  such a claim, or was at
least silent  as regards what was to happen in the
event of  the duty being increased, (b) the change
in the rate of duty was effected after the date of
the contract. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">26</span>
these circumstances,  it appears  to us that there
might  not   be	 even  a  factual  basis  for  the
complaint of  learned Counsel  for the	appellants
that in	 the case  of a	 retrospective increase in
duty, the  duty ceases	to be  a duty of excise by
becoming a  "direct" tax  because it was incapable
of being  passed on. The answer of learned Counsel
to this point regarding the operation of<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_66"> s. 64A</a> of
the Sale  of Goods  Act was  merely that the Court
could  not  take  account  of  the  provisions	of
another statute for dealing with the validity of a
provision of  the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_67">Finance Act</a> 1911. The submission
has no	force at all because<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_68"> s. 64A</a> of the Sale of
Goods Act  refers in  express terms  to "duties of
excise" and  has therefore, to be read as part and
parcel of  every legislation  imposing a  duty	of
excise. In  view of  our conclusion, however, that
the duty  in the present case, notwithstanding its
imposition with	 retrospective effect, and even if
it be  that it was incapable of being passed on to
a buyer	 from the  tax-payer, was a duty of excise
within Entry  84 as  properly understood it is not
necessary to rest it upon this narrower ground.
</p><p id="p_46">     In our  view, a  duty of excise is a tax-levy
on home	 produced goods	 of a  specified class	or
description, the  duty being  calculated according
to quantity  or value  of the  goods and  which is
levied because	of the	mere  fact  of	the  goods
having been produced or manufactured and unrelated
to and not dependent on any commercial transaction
in them.  The duty  in the  present case satisfies
this test  and therefore it is unnecessary to seek
other grounds  for sustaining  the validity of the
tax.
</p><p id="p_47">     One further  aspect of  the matter	 on  which
some emphasis  was laid	 by Mr.	 Pathak was that a
duty of	 excise was  in its essence a tax on goods
and not	 a personal  tax a levied on the tax payer
such as	 an income-tax.	 He urged that being a tax
levied on goods notwithstanding that it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">27</span>
collected from	the producer  or manufacturer,	it
followed   that	  the	essential   attribute	or
characteristic of  that duty was that the producer
or manufacturer	 must own  or have  possession and
control over  the goods at the moment of the levy.
If  this   element  of	ownership,  possession	or
control	 over  the  goods  by  the  tax-payer  was
lacking, learned  Counsel urged the duty would not
be a  duty on  the goods but a personal tax levied
on the tax-payer.
</p><p id="p_48">     This is  really another  aspect of	 the  same
argument that a duty of excise is in its nature an
indirect tax  but learned  Counsel submitted  that
viewed from  this angle	 it would be seen that the
duty imposed  by the  impugned enactment was shown
to be not a duty of excise. The grounds upon which
the submission	of learned  Counsel that a duty of
excise levied retrospectively was converted into a
direct tax and therefore not a duty of excise have
been repelled  by us  which ought  to  suffice	to
repel the  contention in  this form also. Besides,
it may	also be	 pointed out  that even	 in strict
theory there  is no  basis for	the submission now
under  consideration.  The  duty  imposed  by  the
impugned Act  being retrospective,  it operates as
from a	previous date  and admittedly  on the date
when by force of the enactment the duty was levied
the tax-payer  was the	owner or was in possession
and control  of the  goods. To deny this, would in
effect deny  the legal	effect of  the	tax  being
imposed retrospectively	 and fictionally deemed to
be in force on an earlier date.
</p><p id="p_49">     In dealing	 with  the  arguments  of  learned
Counsel on  the scope  and content  of Entry 84 of
the  Constitution   and	 of  the  meaning  of  the
expression "duty  of excise" in that entry we have
also covered  the special argument questioning the
right of  Parliament to	 impose retrospectively	 a
duty of	 excise. It  was conceded, that Parliament
has power  to enact laws with retrospective effect
and as it was not suggested that laws
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">28</span>
dealing with  taxation are  any exception  to that
rule  the  only	 ground	 upon  which  the  learned
Counsel could  rest this submission was that being
an indirect tax, capability of being passed on was
an essential  characteristic or	 requirement of	 a
duty  of   excise,  and	 so  its  imposition  with
retrospective effect deprived it of that essential
character and  therefore rendered  it a	 duty of a
different  nature   and	  for	that   reasons	 a
retrospective imposition of an excise duty was not
permissible. It	 would be seen that this is really
the same argument which we have dealt with earlier
presented in another form. For the reasons already
stated, we  find no  substance in  this form	of
argument either	 and  we  have	no  hesitation	in
rejecting it.  It need	only be mentioned that the
passage in  judgment of Lord Davey in the Colonial
Sugar Refining	Company Ltd.  v.  Irving,  already
extracted, is  sufficient precedent,  if authority
were needed, to reject this argument.
</p><p id="p_50">     The second	 point raised  by learned  Counsel
was that  the impugned	s. 7(2)	 of  the  Act  was
unconstitutional  in   that  it	  contravened  the
fundamental rights guaranteed under Arts. 19(1)(f)
and 31(1)  and (2)  of the  Constitution.  It  was
urged that  even if  the  impugned  provision  was
within the legislative competence of Parliament as
being covered  by Entry	 84 of the Union List, the
retrospective levy  of an excise duty violated the
freedom guaranteed  by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_69">Art. 19 (1)(f)-</a>the right to
hold property-and  was not  saved  by  <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_70">Art.  19(5)</a>
since the same was not "a reasonable restraint" on
the rights  of the appellant. If Counsel was right
so far, his next submission was that the threat to
deprive the  appellant of  the amount  of the  tax
levy was  a deprivation	 without authority of law-
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_71">Art.  31(1)</a>   and   was	  further   a	compulsory
acquisition of	that property without compensation
(<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_72">Art.  31(2))</a>	which  was   not  saved	  by  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_73">Art.
31(5)(b)(i)</a> because the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">29</span>
law contemplated  by that  sub-article was a valid
law for	 the imposition	 of a  tax which satisfied
the requirements  both of  legislative	competence
and of	the rights  guaranteed by  Part III of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_51">     The submission  of Mr. Pathak on this part of
the case  was briefly  as  follows.  A	law  which
imposes a  tax	and  provides  for  its	 levy  and
collection is  as much a law, as a law under other
non-taxation entries  of the legislative list. All
laws including laws imposing taxes are within Part
III of	the Constitution  being	 laws  under  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_74">Art.
13(2)</a> thereof  and unless  any particular  Article
was inapplicable to such laws by reason of obvious
irrelevance every  Article in the Part would apply
to them and without such a law satisfying the test
of reasonableness  or constitutionality	 laid down
in the	various Articles guaranteeing the several.
Fundamental rights  the statute	 in question could
not be pronounced valid and enforceable.
</p><p id="p_52">     We shall  be referring to the manner in which
Mr.  Pathak  sought  to	 urge  that  the  impugned
provision offended  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_75">Art.  19(1)	 (f</a>),  but  before
doing so, it is necessary to notice the submission
which Mr. Sanyal invited us to accept.
</p><p id="p_53">     He raised	a broad	 contention  that  no  law
imposing a  tax could be impugned on the ground of
violation of  Part  III	 of  the  Constitution	in
general and  in particular  of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_76">Art.  19(1) (f)</a>	or
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_77">Art. 31.</a>  His submission  was that the validity of
tax laws were governed solely by <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_78">Art. 265</a> and that
such laws  were not  governed by  Part III  of the
Constitution  and   specially  because	the  money
sought to  be taken  by the State as tax by virtue
of a  fiscal enactment	was not	 "property" within
<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_79">Art. 19(1)  (f)</a> and  that the expression "laws for
the purpose  of imposing a tax" used in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_80">Art. 31(5)</a>
</p><p id="p_54">(b) (i)	 saved all laws from the operation of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_81">Art.
31</a>  whether   such  laws   be  within  legislative
competence or not, as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">30</span>
also whether  or not  such laws	 were repugnant to
Part III of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_55">     Before adverting  to the  decisions on  which
reliance was  placed for  this position two things
might he  pointed out:	(1) that  <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_82">Art. 265</a>  merely
enacts that  all taxation-the imposition, levy and
collection shall  be by	 law;  and  (2)	 that  the
Article beyond	excluding purely  executive action
does not  by itself  lay down  any  criterion  for
determining the	 validity of such a law to justify
any contention that the criteria laid down exclude
others to  be found  elsewhere in the Constitution
for laws  in general.  If by  reason of	 <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_83">Art.  265</a>
every tax  has to  be imposed  by "law"	 it  would
appear to  follow that it could only be imposed by
a law which is valid by conformity to the criteria
laid  down   in	 the   relevant	 Articles  of  the
Constitution. These are that the law should be (1)
within	 the   legislative   competence	  of   the
legislature  being   covered  by  the  legislative
entries in  Schedule VII  of the Constitution; (2)
the law should not be prohibited by any particular
provision of the Constitution such as for example,
Arts. 276(2),  286 etc.,  and (3)  the law  or the
relevant portion  thereof should  not  be  invalid
under <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_84">Art.  13</a> for  repugnancy to  those  freedoms
which  are   guaranteed	 by   Part  III	  of   the
Constitution which  are relevant  to  the  subject
matter of the law. The reference therefore to <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_85">Art.
265</a>  does  not	lead  necessarily  to  the  result
envisaged by Mr. Sanyal.
</p><p id="p_56">     The entire	 argument of  Mr. Sanyal  on  this
part of	 the case  was rested  on the observations
contained in two decisions of this Court, <a href="/doc/233559/" id="a_86">Ramjilal
v. Income-tax Officer</a>, <a href="/doc/108021/" id="a_87">Mohindargarh and Laxmanappa
Hanumantappa Jamkhandi,	 v. The Union of India</a>. We
do not	understand these  decisions as laying down
any such broad proposition. We are further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">31</span>
satisfied that	the learned  Judges could not have
meant that if a law imposing a tax was outside the
legislative competence of the legislature enacting
it, as	the argument before us appeared to suggest
it could  be a	law under  which a person could be
deprived of  his  property  under  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_88">Art.	 31(I)</a>	or
regarding which a person could not move this Court
for relief under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_89">Art. 32.</a> Such a proposition would
be contrary  to a  long catena	of cases  of  this
Court of  which	 it  is	 sufficient  to	 refer	to
<a href="/doc/154519/" id="a_90">Mohammad  Yasin	  v.  The   Town  Area	Committee</a>,
Jalalabad, State  of Bombay  v. The  United Motors
(India) Ltd.,  The Bengal Immunity Company Limited
v. <a href="/doc/33396/" id="a_91">The	State of  Bihar and  Ch. Tika Ramji v. The
State of  Uttar Pradesh</a>.  In all  these cases  the
legislation imposing  the tax or the fee which had
been held  not to have been within the legislative
competence of  the authority  imposing the  tax or
the fee	 was struck  down on the ground that those
laws violated  the freedom  guaranteed by Part III
of the	Constitution. Learned  Counsel	laid  some
stress on  the fact that in these cases the tax or
fee was held to be unconstitutional as imposing an
unreasonable restraint	on the right to carry on a
trade or  business guaranteed by <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_92">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> and
not as	an  infringement  of  the  right  to  hold
"property" under  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_93">Art. 19(I)(f).</a>  In  our  opinion
nothing turns  on this,	 for it is the deprivation
of the	freedom "to  hold property"  that  is  the
direct result  of the tax and the restraint on the
business  by  reason  of  the  collection  of  the
illegal tax  or the procedures prescribed for such
collection is  only  an	 indirect  and	incidental
effect thereof.
</p><p id="p_57">     Nor do we find it possible to accept even the
more limited  proposition  that	 whatever  be  the
position  in   regard  to   tax	 laws  which  lack
legislative competence,	 once a tax law is covered
by an  entry in	 the Legislative List and does not
contravene direct prohibitions like those in Arts.
276 (2) or 286
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">32</span>
etc., such  a law  is immune  from the limitations
imposed by Part III of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_58">     Mr. Sanyal	 is right  in his  submission that
the levying  of	 taxes	though	it  might  involve
taking	private	 property  for	a  public  use	is
entirely distinct from the power of eminent domain
which is  covered by  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_94">Art. 31(1)(2)</a>  and that  the
saving in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_95">Art. 31(5)(b) (i)</a> of such laws is really
by way	of abundant  caution. It  has been  stated
that where  "property  is  taken  under	 a  taxing
power, the  persons so	taxed may  be said  to	be
compensated for	 their contribution by the general
benefits which they receive from the existence and
operation of  Government. But  this is	not to say
that  the   burden  of	 a   tax   that	  may	be
constitutionally laid  upon an individual needs to
be justified  by a  showing that  he, individually
will receive  benefit from  the expenditure of the
proceeds of the tax, and much less that the degree
of that	 burden may  be measured  by the amount of
benefit that  the tax payer is excepted to receive
(1)". It  would, therefore,  be obvious that a tax
law need not satisfy the tests of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_96">Art. 31(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_59">     But it  does  not	follow	that  every  other
Article of  Part III  is inapplicable  to tax law.
Leaving aside  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_97">Art. 31(2)</a> that the provisions of a
tax law	 within legislative  competence	 could	be
impugned as  offending <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_98">Art.  14</a> is  exemplified by
such decisions of this Court as <a href="/doc/1623923/" id="a_99">Suraj Mal Motha v.
Sri A.	V. Visvanatha  Sastri</a> and  <a href="/doc/1179473/" id="a_100">Shree Meenakshi

unconstitutional   as	 violating   the   freedom
guaranteed by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_102">Art. 14.</a> It also goes without saying
that  if   the	 imposition   of   the	 tax   was
discriminatory as  contrary to	<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_103">Art. 15</a>,  the levy
would be invalid.
</p><p id="p_60">     It might  very well  be  that  a  distinction
might have to be drawn between the legality of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">33</span>
quantum of a tax levied which might not be open to
challenge under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_104">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> and the incidence of
the tax or the procedure prescribed therein either
for the	 assessment or	the collection which might
be open for being tested with reference to all the
freedoms  including   that   contained	 in   <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_105">Art.
19(1)(f).</a> In  fact in  Moopil  nair  v.	 State	of
Kerala (1) already referred to, certain provisions
of the Act therein challenged which prescribed the
procedure for the levy of the tax were struck down
on the ground of being obnoxious to <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_106">Art. 19(1)(f).</a>
Having regard  to  the	very  limited  controversy
before us  we do  not  consider	 it  necessary	to
embark on any further or more detailed examination
of this	 question, except  to say  that we  cannot
accept the  argument  of  the  learned	Additional
Solicitor General  that by  reason of <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_107">Art. 265</a> tax
laws are outside Part III of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_61">     In support	 of  the  submission  that  a  tax
levied	  with	   retrospective    effect     was
unconstitutional   as	 being	 an   unreasonable
restriction on	this right  to hold property (<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_108">Art.
19(1)(f)).</a> Mr.	Pathak relied  on the decisions in
Nichols v.  Coolidge (2).  The tax in question was
an estate duty on property passing on death and in
the items  to be  included for computing the value
of  the	  estates  was	included  not  merely  all
property of  which the deceased died possessed, on
the date  of his  death but also that which he had
transferred by	gifts within a period of two years
fore  his   death.  This   inclusion  of  property
transferred to	third persons not in contemplation
of death  but by  the grantor  in the ordinary and
natural course	of the	transaction of his affairs
so that	 the donees  might  enjoy  the	properties
absolutely, was	 held to  be  unconstitutional	as
offending the  rule as	to "due process" contained
in fifth  amendment to	the constitution.  Justice
McReynolds delivering  the opinion  of	the  Court
said:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">34</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">	  "Under  the	theory	advanced  for  the
     United States,  the arbitrary,  whimsical and
     burdensome character of the challenged tax is
     plain  enough  .....Real  estate  transferred
     years ago,	 when of small value, may be worth
     an enormous sum at the death. If the deceased
     leaves no	estate there can be no tax; if, on
     the other	hand, he  leaves ten  dollars both
     that  and	the  real  estate  become  liable.
     Different estates	must bear disproportionate
     burdens determined	 by what  the deceased did
     one or  twenty years  before  he  died.  This
     Court   has   recognised	that   a   statute
     purporting to  tax may  be so  arbitrary  and
     capricious as  to amount  to confiscation and
     offend the	 fifth Amendment. We must conclude
     that<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_109"> s.  402(c)</a> of	 the  statute  here  under
     consideration, in	so far as it requires that
     there shall  be included  in the gross estate
     the  value	  of  property	transferred  by	 a
     deceased prior  to its passage merely because
     the conveyance was intended to take effect in
     possession	 or  enjoyment	at  or	after  his
     death, is	arbitrary, capricious  and amounts
     to confiscation."
</blockquote><p id="p_62">Learned Counsel	 also referred	us to  a few later
decisions of  the American  Supreme Court in which
retrospective taxation has been held arbitrary and
capricious and to amount to a violation of the due
process clause	contained in the 5th Amendment. In
regard to  these decisions,  two points have to be
noted: (1)  that the decisions of Supreme Court of
the United  States are	not uniform  and there are
undoubtedly decisions of the Court of a later date
which speak  the other way. In Third National Bank
v. White  (1) the  Supreme Court  upheld an estate
tax which  operated retrospectively. It is in view
of these  decisions that  Mr. Ballard states in an
article in  the Harvard	 Law Review (*), referring
to White's case (1)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">35</span>
	  "It  seems  accurate	to  say	 that  the
     decision marks  for  practical  purposes  the
     passing of	 'arbitrary retroactivity'  in the
     field of  the  estate  tax...........And  the
     present status  of Nichols v. Coolidge is not
     entirely  clear.........  Since  the  Nichols
     case can  be distinguished	 on its	 facts, it
     may    well     give    way.........In    any
     event.......it  would  seem  that	after  the
     White case	 no application	 of the estate tax
     can be  successfully resisted on the score of
     retroactivity."
</p><p id="p_63">For instance  in Welch	v. Henry (1) which related
to an  enactment imposing  income  tax	which  had
retrospective operation,  Justice Stone delivering
the Judgment  of the Court referring to Nichols v.
Coolidge (2) and other cases in which observations
broadly	 stating   that	 any   retrospective   tax
legislation was	 obnoxious to  the requirement	of
due process, stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	  "Even a  retroactive gift  tax has  been
     held valid	 where the donor was forewarned by
     the statute  books of the possibility of such
     a levy.  In each  case  it	 is  necessary	to
     consider  the  nature  of	the  tax  and  the
     circumstances in  which it	 is laid before it
     can be  said that its retroactive application
     is so  harsh and  oppressive as to transgress
     the constitutional limitation."
	  "Any	classification	 for  taxation	is
     permissible which	has reasonable relation to
     a	legitimate  end	 of  governmental  action.
     Taxation is but the means by which government
     distributes the  burdens of  its  cost  among
     those  who	  enjoy	 its   benefits.  And  the
     distribution of a tax burden by placing it in
     part on  a special	 class which  by reason of
     the taxing	 policy of  the State  has escaped
     all tax  during the  taxable period  is not a
     denial of equal protection.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">36</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">     Nor is  the tax  any more	a denial  of equal
     protection because retroactive..........A tax
     is not  necessarily unconstitutional  because
     retroactive. Milliken  v. United  States  and
     cases there  cited. Taxtation  is	neither	 a
     penalty  imposed	on  the	  taxpayer  not	 a
     liability he assumes by contract. It is but a
     way of  apportioning the  cast of	government
     among  those   who	 in   some   measure   are
     privileged to  enjoy its  benefits	 and  must
     bear its  burdens. Since  no  citizen  enjoys
     immunity from  that burden,  its  retroactive
     imposition does  not necessarily infringe due
     process, and  to challenge the present tax is
     not enough	 to point  out	that  the  taxable
     event, the	 receipt of  income, antedated the
     statute."</blockquote>
<p id="p_64">     In	 Untermyer   v.	 Anderson  (1)	which  was
concerned with	the validity  of a  tax	 on  gifts
which was  made to  operate from  a date before it
was enacted, Justice Holmes stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">	  "........I find  it  hard  to	 state	to
     myself articulately  the ground  for  denying
     the power	of Congress to lay the tax. We all
     know that we shall get a tax bill every year.
     I suppose	that the  taxing act may be passed
     in the middle as lawfully as at the beginning
     of the  year. A  tax may  be levied  for past
     privileges and  protection	 as  well  as  for
     those to come,"
</blockquote><p id="p_65">and Justice  Brandeis made  the added observations
which  have   been  repeatedly	 quoted	 in  later
decisions as well as in text books:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">	  "For more  than half	a century,  it has
     been settled  that a law of Congress imposing
     a	 tax	may   be    retroactive	  in   its
     operation...... Each  of the  fifteen  income
     tax acts adopted from time to time during the
     last sixty-seven  years has been retroactive,
     in that it applied
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">37</span>
     to income earned, prior to the passage of the
     act, during  the  calendar	 year........  The
     need  of	the  government	 for  revenue  has
     hitherto	 been	 deemed	   a	sufficient
     justification  for	  making  a   tax  measure
     retroactive whenever  the	imposition  seemed
     consonant with  justice  and  the	conditions
     were not  such as	would  ordinarily  involve
     hardship. On this broad ground rest the cases
     in	 which	 a  special  assessment	 has  been
     upheld......  Liability   for   taxes   under
     retroactive legislation  has been 'one of the
     notorious incidents  of social  life'........
     Recently this  Court recognized  broadly that
     'a tax  may be  imposed in	 respect  of  past
     benefit'."</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">     It would  thus be	seen that  even under  the
constitution of	 the United  States of America the
unconstitutionality  of	 a  retrospective  tax	is
rested on what has been termed "the vague contours
of the	5th Amendment."	 Whereas under	the Indian
Constitution that  grounds on  which infraction of
the rights  a property	is to be tested not by the
flexible rule  of "due	process" but  on the  more
precise criteria  set  out  in	<a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_110">Art.  19(5</a>),  mere
retrospectivity	 in  the  imposition  of  the  tax
cannot per  se render  the Law unconstitutional on
the ground  of its  infringing the  right to  hold
property under	<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_111">Art.  19(1)(f)</a>	or  depriving  the
person of property under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_112">Art. 31(1).</a> If on the one
hand, the  tax enactment  in question  were beyond
legislative competence	of the	Union or  a  State
necessarily different  considerations arise.  Such
unauthorised imposition would undoubtedly not be a
reasonable  restriction	  on  the  right  to  hold
property beside being an unreasonable restraint on
the  carrying  on  of  business,  if  the  tax	in
question is  one which	is laid	 on  a	person	in
respect of his business activity.
</p><p id="p_67">     Mr. Pathak	 also presented	 his  argument	on
this  head   in	 a  slightly  different	 form.	He
submitted   that   the	 Constitution-makers   had
contemplated  that  a  duty  of	 excise	 would	be
imposed only when the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">38</span>
manufacturer or the producer was in possession and
control	 of   the  goods  at  the  moment  of  the
imposition, and	 therefore would  be in a position
to  pass   it  on  and	obtain	payment	 from  the
purchaser of  the duty	paid by	 him to State. The
imposition of  the  levy  retrospectively  however
deprive him  of this  benefit of  passing  on  the
burden	which	he  would   normally  have.   This
restriction or	impairment of his right to pass on
the  duty,   he	 urged	rendered  the  restriction
imposed on  him in  the shape of the obligation to
pay  the   duty	 unreasonable.	 Learned   Counsel
admitted that as the imposition would yield to the
Exchequer   more   money,   the	  restriction	on
appellants' right  to hold  property could  not be
denied to  be in  the  'interest  of  the  general
public" within	<a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_113">Art. 19(5)</a>  but his submission was
that it	 lacked the  character of "reasonableness"
because it  deprived him  of the  right to pass on
the tax to others. It was further admitted that it
was only  if learned  Counsel  was  right  in  his
submission regarding the infraction of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_114">Art. 19 (1)</a>
</p><p id="p_68">(f) that  any question of the violation of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_115">Art. 31
(1)</a> could  arise. It  would be seen that it is the
same argument  as was  presented to  challenge the
legislative competence	of Parliament to enact the
legislation. Only  the	nomenclature  employed	is
different and adapted to suit the need of bringing
it into	 the fold  of an impairment of fundamental
rights under  Part III	of  the	 Constitution.	As
Evatt, J.  observed in	Broken Hill  South Limited
(Public Officer)  v. The  Commissioner of Taxation
(New South Wales) (1) "It is not proper to deny to
the legislature	 the  right  of	 solving  taxation
problems  unfettered   by  legal  categories."	If
notwithstanding that  according to economic theory
or doctrines  propounded by  economists a  duty of
excise does  not cease	to be such, merely because
it is  imposed at  a time  or in circumstances (as
pointed out  earlier in	 conjunction with a system
of price control) in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">39</span>
which it  cannot be passed on one fails to see any
substance in  the argument  that the imposition of
such a	tax is	an unreasonable restriction on the
exercise  of   the  fundamental	  rights  to  hold
property guaranteed by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_116">Art. 19 (1) (f).</a>
</p><p id="p_69">     The last  of the points urged was that r. 10A
was not	 apt to	 cover the  recovery of	 the  duty
which was  a subject  of demand dated December 12,
1951.  The   learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court
rejected this  submission  and,	 in  our  opinion,
correctly. Rule 10 under which the first demand of
June 22, 1951, was made ran:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">	  "10. Recovery of duties or charges short
     levied or	erroneously refunded.-When  duties
     or charges	 have  been  short-levied  through
     inadvertence,     error,	  collusion	or
     misconstruction on the part of an officer, or
     through mis-statement  as	to  the	 quantity,
     description or  value of  such goods  on  the
     part of  the owner,  or when any such duty or
     charge, after  having been	 levied, has  been
     owing to any such cause, erroneously refunded
     the  person   chargeable  with  the  duty	or
     charge, so	 short-levied,	or  to	whom  such
     refund has	 been erroneously  made shall  pay
     the deficiency  or repay  the amount  paid to
     him in excess, as the case may be, on written
     demand  by	 the  proper  officer  being  made
     within three  months from	the date  on which
     the duty  or charge  was paid  or adjusted in
     the owners	 account-current, if  any, or from
     the date of making the refund."
</blockquote><p id="p_70">The contention	which was  then urged was that the
short-levy which  led to the demand was not caused
through inadvertence,  error etc.,  which are  set
out in this rule and that consequently there was a
defect in  the operative  machinery for collection
of the	refund.	 This  objection  of  the  present
appellants was upheld by the Full Bench of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">40</span>
Nagpur High  Court and	it was as a result of this
decision that  rule 10	A was  framed.	This  rule
reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">	  10A. Residuary  powers for  recovery	of
     sums due  to Government.-Where these rules do
     not  make	any  specific  provision  for  the
     collection of  any duty, or of any deficiency
     in duty  if the  duty has for any reason been
     short-levied, or of any other sum of any kind
     payable to	 the Central  Government under the
     Act or  these Rules,  such duty deficiency in
     duty or  sum shall,  on a written demand made
     by the proper officer, be paid to such person
     and at  such time	and place,  as the  proper
     officer may specify."
</blockquote><p id="p_71">The words  "deficiency in duty if the duty has for
any reason  been short-levied" are in our opinion,
wide enough to include cases of deficiency arising
like those  in the  circumstances of  the  present
case, viz.,  where 8  annas out of the 14 annas of
the duty  has been collected in the first instance
but 6  annas remains to be collected. We consider,
therefore, that	 there	is  no	substance  in  the
objection that	r. 10A is not wide enough to cover
the recovery of the duty from the appellants.
</p><p id="p_72">     The result is that these appeals fail and are
dismissed with costs. There will, however, be only
one hearing  fee  for  all  the	 cases.	 The  writ
petitions also fail and are dismissed, without any
order as to cost.
</p><p id="p_73">     KAPUR J.-	The appellants	are manufacturers,
warehousemen and  merchants of	tobacco	 and  they
have  private	licensed  warehouses   which   are
governed by  r. 140  of the  Rules made	 under the
Central	 Excise	 &amp;  <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_117">Salt  Act</a>  (Act  1	of  1944),
hereinafter termed the "Act."
</p><p id="p_74">     According	to   their  allegations	  in   the
petition under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_118">Art. 226</a>  of the Constitution, the
appellants had	a considerable quantity of tobacco
in their licensed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">41</span>
warehouses on  February 28,  1951. On the same day
the  Central  Bill  (Bill  No.	13  of	1951)  was
introduced in  the House of the People, one of the
clauses of which related to the duty of excise for
the  financial	 year  beginning  April	 1,  1951.
According to the Bill, on unmanufactured tobacco a
duty of	 8 As.	per Ib.	 and 6 to 9 As. (per 1000)
Biris was to be imposed. This Bill was amended and
by this	 amendment the	duty on tobacco other than
Biri tobacco  was fixed	 at 6  As. per Ib. On Biri
tobacco 14  As. per Ib. and no duty was imposed on
manufactured Biris.  As a  result of the operation
of<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_119"> ss.	3</a> &amp;  <a href="/doc/1233565/" id="a_120">4</a> of  the provisional  Collection	of
Taxes act  (Act	 XVI  of  1931)	 the  duty  became
leviable as  from the  date of the introduction of
the Bill.  The	petitioner  have  stated  that	in
accordance with	 the provisions	 of the	 Bill that
was   introduced, they paid excise duty on tobacco
in their  possession at the rates mentioned in the
Bill  and   obtained  clearance	  certificates	in
accordance with	 the Rules under the Act. On April
28, 1951,  the Finance	Bill was passed and became
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_121">Finance Act</a>,  1951 (Act XXIII of 1951). By<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_122"> s. 7</a> of
that Act  the first schedule to the Central Excise
and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_123">Salt  Act</a> was  amended in accordance with what
has been stated above. By<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_124"> s. 7</a>. (2) of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_125">Finance
Act</a>. 1951, it was provided that the amendment made
in the	first schedule	to the Act shall be deemed
to have	 effect on and from the first day of March
1951. A	 demand was  subsequently  made	 from  the
appellants in  respect of  excess duty	payable on
tobacco cleared out of the store houses from March
1, 1951, to April 28, 1951.
</p><p id="p_75">     Thereupon the  appellants	filed  a  petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_126">Art.  226</a> of  the Constitution  in the  High
Court at  Nagpur. The  grounds of the attack as to
the constitutionality  of  the	tax  were  decided
against the  appellants but the petition succeeded
on the ground that there was no machinery
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">42</span>
provided under	the Act	 for recovery  of the tax.
This judgment  is reported as Chhotabhai Jethabhai
Patel &amp; Co. v. The Union of India (1). On December
8, 1951,  the Central Government by a notification
amended the  Central Excise Rules by adding r. 10A
which provided	machinery for  the  collection	of
tax. The rule was :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	  "10-A. Residuary  powers for recovery of
     sums due  to Government.-Where these rules do
     not  make	any  specific  provision  for  the
     collection of  any duty  or of any deficiency
     in duty  if the  duty has for any reason been
     short levied, or of any other sum of any kind
     payable to	 the Central  Government under the
     Act or  these Rules, such duty, deficiency in
     duty or sum shall on a written demand made by
     the proper officer be paid to such person and
     at such  time and place as the proper officer
     may specify."
</blockquote><p id="p_76">After the introduction of this rule a fresh demand
was made  on December 12, 1951, for excess duty on
the tobacco  cleared. The appellants again filed a
petition in  the High  Court of	 Nagpur which  was
decided against them and against that judgment the
appellants  have   come	 to   this  court   on	 a
certificate under  <a href="/doc/783690/" id="a_127">Art. 132</a>  of the  Constitution.
The question  submitted to this Court is as to the
validity of  the said  tax on  the ground  of  its
repugnancy to the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_77">     Counsel for  the appellants  has  raised  two
questions against  the legality	 of the taxes; (1)
The  Parliament	  had	no   power   to	  make	 a
retrospective legislation while making a law under
item 84	 of List  I so as to affect goods that had
been cleared  from the warehouses after payment of
proper duties  at the rates prevailing on the date
that  the   goods   were   cleared   because   (a)
Parliament's power  to make  retrospective laws is
subject to constitutional limitations, namely, the
language
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">43</span>
of item	 84 of	List I;	 (b)  duty  of	excise	as
defined in  the Constitution  and its  nature  and
character is  such that it is not capable of being
exercised after	 the goods  on which it is imposed
are no	longer in  possession of  the warehousemen
and after  they have  passed into the common stock
of the	country; (2) legislation of this character
imposes an  unreasonable restriction under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_128">Art. 19
(1) (f);</a>  and <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_129">(3)</a>  r. 10-A  does not  apply to the
facts of  the case  and	 does  not  authorise  the
collection of the duty imposed.
</p><p id="p_78">     The first	point relates  to the  legislative
competency  of	Parliament.  Item  84  of  List	 I
provides: Item 84 "Duties of excise on tobacco and
other goods  manufactured or produced in India..."
In the	corresponding item under the Government of
India Act,  1935, the  same language  was used	so
that the  nature of  the duties	 remains the  same
both  under   the  Constitution	  and  under   the
Government of India Act, 1935 <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_130">Section 3</a> of the Act
empowers the  levying of  duties specified  in the
First Scheduled.  The  relevant	 portion  of  that
section is as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	  <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_131">Section 3(1)</a>	"There shall be levied and
     collected in such manner as may be prescribed
     duties of excise on all excisable goods other
     than salt	which are produced or manufactured
     in India  and a duty on salt manufactured in,
     or imported  by land  into, any part of India
     as, and  at the  rates set forth in the First
     Schedule."
</blockquote><p id="p_79">By<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_132"> s.  7</a> (2)  of the  Act retrospective effect was
given to  the duties  imposed by  the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_133">Finance  Act</a>

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">44</span>
<p id="p_81">The effect  of this  deeming provision is that the
new rates  of duties  must be  taken to	 have been
imposed and  become operative  as if  they were in
the bill  as and  when the  bill was introduced in
Parliament:  <a href="/doc/201013/" id="a_135">Venkatachalam   v.	 Bombay	 Dyeing	 &amp;
Manufacturing Co. Ltd</a>.(1).
</p><p id="p_82">     The contention  raised is as to the nature of
the duty of Excise. It was argued that Excise Duty
is a  tax on  goods which  must exist  at the time
when the  tax is  levied and  it  must	have  been
intended and  expected by  the legislature that it
will  be   passed  on	to  the	 consumer  and	as
retrospective operation of such duties has not got
these qualities	 when the  goods are  no longer in
possession of  the person  sought to be taxed they
do not	fall within  the term "duty of excise" and
therefore  they	  are	beyond	 the   legislative
competence   of	  Parliament.	To   support   his
contention, counsel  for the  appellants relied on
Bank of	 Toronto v.  Lambe (2)	where the question
for decision  was  as  to  whether  certain  taxes
imposed on  commercial	corporations  carrying	on
business were  direct taxes  or indirect  taxes of
the Provinces or the Dominion. Lord Hobhouse at p.
582 relying  upon the  definitions given  by  John
Stuart Mill said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	  "Taxes are  either direct or indirect. A
     direct tax	 is one which is demanded from the
     very persons  who it  is intended	or desired
     should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which
     are  demanded   from  one	 person	  in   the
     expectation  and	intention  that	 he  shall
     indemnify himself	at the expense of another;
     such are the excise or customs."</blockquote>
<p id="p_83">     The same  distinction was brought out in some
other Canadian cases decided by the Privy Council;
City of	 Halifax v.  Estate of J. P. Fairbanks (3)
which related  to the  nature  of  "Business  Tax"
which was  held to  be	a  direct  tax;	 Attorney-
General
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">45</span>
for British  Columbia v.  Mc Donald  Murphy Lumber
Company Ltd.  (1); &amp;  Attorney-General for British
Columbia v.  Kingcome Navigation  Comapny  Limited
(2) Attorney-General  for  Manitoba  v.	 Attorney-
General for  Canada (3)	 and Brewers  &amp;	 Malster's
Association of	Onatario v.  The  Attorney-General
for Ontario (4)
     Reference was next made to an Australian case
Parton v.  Milk Board  (Victoria)  (5)	where  two
necessary qualities  of the  duty of  Excise  were
stated to be that it must be levied on goods which
are in	existence and  the taxpayer should be able
to pass it on to the consumer.
</p><p id="p_84">     But as was pointed out by Gwyer, C.J., in the
<a href="/doc/882976/" id="a_136">Province of Madras v. Boddu Paidanna</a> (6):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">     "The Canadian  cases which	 were cited do not
     seem to afford any assistance since analogous
     problems in  Canada are always concerned with
     direct and indirect taxation...."
</blockquote><p id="p_85">Dealing	 with	the  same  distinction	the  Privy
Council said  in Governor-General  in  Council	v.
Province of Madras (7):-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">	  "Little assistance is to be derived from
     the   consideration    of	  other	   federal
     constitutions   and    of	 their	  judicial
     interpretations. Hence  there is  no question
     of	 direct	  and  indirect	 taxation..."  The
     Indian Constitution  is unlike  any that have
     been called  to their  Lordships'	notice	in
     that it  contains	what  purports	to  be	an
     exhaustive	 enunciation   and   division	of
     legislative powers	 between the  Federal  and
     Provincial Legislatures."</blockquote>
<p id="p_86">     The Excise duty in England came to be imposed
as a  scheme of	 revenue and  taxing device by Pym
and approved  by the Long Parliament. It consisted
of charges on wine and tobacco and some
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">46</span>
other  articles	  were	added	later.	The  basic
principle of  duties of	 Excise was that they were
taxes  on   the	 production   and  manufacture	of
articles which	could not  be  taxed  through  the
customs	 house.	 The  revenue  derived	from  that
source is called excise revenue proper. In England
it was	later on  extended to comprise other taxes
but the fundamental conception of the term is that
it is  a tax  on articles produced or manufactured
in the country. It was in this sense that the word
"duty  of  excise"  was	 understood  in	 Australia
(Peterswalad v. Bartley (1).
</p><p id="p_87">     The importance  of legislative  practice of a
country was  pointed out by the Privy Council in a
Canadian case  Croft v.	 Dunphy (2)  where it  was
held that  when a  power is conferred to legislate
on  a	particular  topic   it	is   important	in
determining the	 scope of the power to have regard
to what	 is ordinarily	treated as embraced within
that topic in the legislative practice in England,
U.S.A. and the Dominions and of India, the Federal
Court considered  the nature  of duty of Excise in
Re The	Central Provinces  &amp; Berar  Sales of Motor
Sprit &amp;	 Lubricants Taxation  Act (In re A Special
Reference under s. 213 of Government of India Act,
1935)  (3),   generally	 known	 as  the  "Central
Provinces" case.  In that  case	 the  Act  of  the
Provincial legislature	levying a  tax	on  retail
sale of	 motor spirit was held to fall within item
48  in	 List  II  of  the  7th	 <a href="/doc/1280060/" id="a_137">Schedule  of  the
Constitution Act</a>  and not  a duty of Excise within
the  meaning  of  entry	 45  of	 List  I  of  that
Schedule. The nature of the duty was considered by
the Court.  Gwyer, C.  J., after  referring to the
distionary meaning of the word "excise" said at p.
41:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">	  "But its primary and fundamental meaning
     in English is still that of a tax on articles
     produced  or   manufactured  in   the  taxing
     country and  intended for home consumption. I
     am satisfied  that is  also its  primary  and
     fundamental meaning in India; and no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">47</span>
     one has  suggested	 that  it  has	any  other
     meaning in entry No. 45."
</blockquote><p id="p_88">At p. 47 the learned Chief Justice said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">	  "The	expression   "duties  of  excise",
     taken by  itself conveys  no suggestion  with
     regard  to	  them	time  or  place	 of  their
     collection. Only  the context  in	which  the
     expression is  used can  tell us  whether any
     reference to the time or manner of collection
     is to  be implied. It is not denied that laws
     are to be found which impose duties of excise
     at	 stages	  subsequent  to   manufacture	or
     production; but so far as I am aware, in none
     of the  cases  in	which  any  question  with
     regard to	such  a	 law  has  arisen  was	it
     necessary to  consider  the  existence  of	 a
     competing legislative  power such	as appears
     in entry No. 48."
</blockquote><p id="p_89">But Mr.	 Pathak relied	on the observations of the
learned Chief Justice at p. 50 where he said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">	  "Thus the  Central Legislature will have
     the  power	 to  impose  duties  on	 excisable
     articles  before  they  become  part  of  the
     general stock of the Province, that is to say
     at the  stage of  manufacture or  production,
     and the  Provincial Legislature  an exclusive
     power to impose a tax on sales thereafter."
</blockquote><p id="p_90">But these  observations only  mean this	 that when
there is  a competition	 between the duty, imposed
at the	stage of  manufacture of  production and a
tax imposed on sales thereafter, the sphere of the
Central and the Provincial Legislatures comes into
operation but,	as the previous passages, show, it
does not  in any  manner vary  the meaning  of the
word  "excise"	 nor  does  it	accept	a  further
qualification which  is sought	to be  included in
that phrase  as a  necessary quality  of that  tax
that unless  it is  capable of	being passed on to
the consumer  or the  person taxed  can indemnify,
himself, it is not a duty of excise. At p. 47, the
learned Chief Justice
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">48</span>
observed that in the expression "duties of excise"
no suggestion  as to  time or  place of collection
was implied.  Sulaiman, J.,  pointed out  at p. 73
that  in   the	Indian	Constitution  it  was  not
necessary  to	go  into   the	fine  niceties	of
distinction between  direct and	 indirect taxation
because in the <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_138">Indian Act</a> no such division existed
and that  ultimate incidence  of  tax  was  not	 a
crucial test  under the Indian Constitution. Again
at p. 77, Sulaiman, J., said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">	  "The	essence	  of  a	  tax	on   goods
     manufactured or produced is that the right to
     levy  it	accrues	  by   virtue	of   their
     manufacture or  production. It  is immaterial
     whether  the   goods  are	actually  sold	or
     consumed  by  the	owner  or  even	 destroyed
     before they can be used. If a duty is imposed
     on the  goods manufactured	 or produced  when
     they issue from the manufactory then the duty
     becomes leviable independently of the purpose
     for which	they leave  it and irrespective of
     what happens to them later."
</blockquote><p id="p_91">In a  subsequent case  The Province  of Madras	v.
Messrs. Boddu  Paidnna &amp;  Sons(1)  Gwyer,  C.  J.,
again went  into the question of the nature of the
duty of	 excise under  the expression  "duties	of
excise" and said at p. 101:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">	  "There is  in theory	nothing to prevent
     the Central  Legislature from imposing a duty
     of excise	on a commodity as soon as it comes
     into existence,  no matter what happens to it
     afterwards, whether  it  be  sold,	 consumed,
     destroyed or  given away.	A taxing authority
     will  not	ordinarily  impose  such  a  duty,
     because   it    is	  much	 more	convenient
     administratively to  collect the  duty (as in
     the case  of most	of the Indian Excise Acts)
     when the commodity leaves the factory for the
     first time, and also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">49</span>
     because  the   duty  is  intended	to  be	an
     indirect  duty   which  the  manufacturer	or
     producer  is  to  pass  on	 to  the  ultimate
     consumer,	which  he  could  not  do  if  the
     commodity had,  for example been destroyed in
     the  factory   itself.  It	 is  the  fact	of
     manufacture which	attracts  the  duty,  even
     though it	may be collected later; and we may
     draw attention  to the  <a href="/doc/1917867/" id="a_139">Sugar Excise  Act</a>	in
     which it  is specially provided that the duty
     is payable not only in respect of sugar which
     is	 issued	 from  the  factory  but  also	in
     respect of sugar which is consumed within the
     factory."
</blockquote><p id="p_92">The Privy Council described the nature of the duty
of  Excise   in	 Governor-General  in  Council	v.
Province  of   Madras  (1)  as	a  duty	 which	is
primarily levied  on a manufacturer or producer in
respect of the commodity manufactured or produced.
At p.  103 Lord	 Simonds referred to In re Central
Provinces &amp;  Berear case (2) and to Baddu Paidanna
case (3) and said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">	  "The two  taxes, the	one  levied  on	 a
     manufacturer in  respect of  his  goods,  the
     other on  a vendor	 in respect  of his sales,
     may as  is there  pointed out  in	one  sense
     overlap. But in law there is no overlapping.-
     The taxes	are separate and distinct imposts.
     If in  fact they overlap, that may be because
     the taxing	 authority,  imposing  a  duty	of
     excise finds  it convenient  to  impose  that
     duty at the moment when the excisable article
     leaves the	 factory or workshop for the first
     time on  the occasion  of its  sale. But that
     method of	collecting the	tax is an accident
     of administration;	 it is	not of the essence
     of the  duty of excise, which is attracted by
     the manufacture  itself. That  this is  so is
     clearly exemplified  in those  excepted cases
     in which  the  Provincial,	 not  the  Federal
     legislature has  power to	impose a  duty	of
     excise."</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">50</span>
<p id="p_93">     Thus according to the Indian cases decided on
the nature  of duties of excise ultimate incidence
is not	of any importance or relevance. In dealing
with excise  duty (1)  there is	 no mention  of	 a
direct or  indirect taxes;  the Indian Legislature
has avoided this incidence to be characteristic of
the tax;  (2) taxable  event is the manufacture or
production of goods; it is immaterial what happens
to  them   afterwards  whether	 they  are   sold,
consumed, destroyed or given away; (3) it is not a
necessary incidence  that the manufacturer must be
able to	 pass it  on to	 the consumer or indemnify
himself; (4)  the general  tendency of	its  being
passed on may be there but it may be prohibited by
the circumstances, economic or otherwise. The fact
that the manufacturer has no chance to get the tax
from the buyer does not affect the legality of the
tax; it	 was so	 held in  the case of sales tax in
<a href="/doc/1629177/" id="a_140">The Tata  Iron &amp;  Steel Co.  Ltd. v.  The State of
Bihar</a> (1)  where the nature of the excise duty was
discussed. At  page 1369 the observations of Gwyer
C. J.  in Boddu Paidanna case (2) and of the Privy
Council in Governor-General in Council v. Province
of Madras (3) were quoted with approval. It may be
noted that  in the  Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. case (1)
the tax was a retrospective tax and was imposed at
a time	when in the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_141">Sales Tax Act</a> no provision was
made  for   passing  on	  the  Sales  Tax  to  the
purchaser. <a href="/doc/565623/" id="a_142">In  the Union  of India  v. Madan Gopal
Kabra</a> (4)  it was  pointed out that Parliament was
not  precluded	 from  exercising   the	 power	of
imposing a  retrospective tax and therefore it was
competent to  make a  law imposing  a tax  on  the
income of  any year  prior to  the commencement of
the Constitution.  As was pointed out in that case
under Arts.  245 and  346 of the Constitution read
with the  relevant entry in List I of Schedule VII
Parliament is  empowered to  make laws with regard
to taxes  and  no  limitation  or  restriction	is
imposed in regard to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">51</span>
retrospective legislation.  See Sargood	 Bros.	v.
The  Commonwealth  (1)	where  retrospective  laws
about the  levying of Customs were held valid. See
also  Welch   v.  Henry	  (2)  On  the	ground	of
retrospectivity alone  therefore the  tax  is  not
unconstitutional.
</p><p id="p_94">     In view of what has been said above the cases
decided in  Canada or  Australia cannot	 have  any
application.
</p><p id="p_95">     It was  next contended  that a  retrospective
tax purporting	to be  a duty  on goods	 when  the
goods had  been disposed  of would  be a  tax  not
under item  84, List I of the Seventh Schedule but
one under  item	 60  of	 List  II,  i.e.,  tax	on
profession,  trade,   calling  and  employment-the
submission  being  that	 the  word  "trade"  would
include manufacture. This contention was sought to
be supported by the observations of Lords Davey in
Commissioner of Taxation v. Kirk (3):-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	  "The word  `trade'  no  doubt	 primarily
     means traffic  by way  of sale or exchange or
     commercial dealing,  but may  have	 a  larger
     meaning so as to include manufactures."
</blockquote><p id="p_96">In  National   Association  of	 Local	Government
Officers v. Bolton Corporation (4) Lord Wrights in
interpreting the  word "trade"	in s.  11  of  the
Industrial Courts Act, 1919, said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">	  "Sect. 11  of the Act of 1919 shows that
     `trade' used  as including `industry' because
     it refers	to a trade dispute in the industry
     of agriculture."
</blockquote><p id="p_97">But this  letter case  has no  application because
there the word "trade" was interpreted in relation
to a section of a particular Act and trade in that
context has  quite a different meaning. In Skinner
v. Jack	 Breach Limited (5), Lord Hewart, C. J. in
interpreting the  word "trade" in Trade Boards Act
held that  the word "trade" indicates a process of
buying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">52</span>
and selling  but it  was by no means an exhaustive
definition.  It	 might	also  mean  a  calling	or
industry or class of skilled labour.
</p><p id="p_98">     The duty of Excise in item 84 should be given
the widest  construction unless for some reason it
is cut	down either  by the  terms  of	that  item
itself or  by other Parts of the Constitution. The
legislative history  of the  duty of  Excise shows
the nature of the tax. The word "trade" in item 60
of List	 II has reference to the carrying on of an
activity in  the nature	 of buying and selling and
may in	a different  context mean  a calling or an
industry. Therefore reading the two items together
it is  obvious that  item 84  deals with  taxes on
goods manufactured  or produced	 and item 60 deals
with the carrying on of trade i.e., an activity in
the nature  of buying  and selling  and the Act in
its pith  and substance	 relates to  duty on goods
manufactured or	 produced and  has no relationship
with item 60 of List II.
</p><p id="p_99">     Even assuming that the nature and tendency of
the duty  of Excise is, as contended by Mr. Pathak
that it	 can be	 passed on  to the  consumer, even
than the  complaint of	the appellants	that  they
have been deprived of that opportunity is not well
founded, because  of<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_143"> s. 64-A</a> of the Indian Sale of
Goods Act  (3 of  1930), which	was<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_144"> s.	10</a> in  the
Indian Tariff  Act, 1934.  It was originally taken
from the  British Tariff Act, 1901, 1 Edw. VII Ch.
</p><p id="p_100">7. <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_145">Section  64A</a> of the Indian Sale of Goods Act is
as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">	  S. 64-A.  "In the  event of  any duty of
     customs or excise on any goods being imposed,
     increased, decreased  or remitted	after  the
     making of	any contract  for the sale of such
     goods without  stipulation as  to the payment
     of duty  where duty was not chargeable at the
     time of  the making  of the  contract, or for
     the sale  of such	goods duty-paid where duty
     was chargeable at that time,-
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">53</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">	  (a) if  such imposition  or increase	so
     takes effect that the duty or increased duty,
     as the  case may  be, or any part thereof, is
     paid, the	seller may  add	 so  much  to  the
     contract price  as will  be equivalent to the
     amount  paid  in  respect	of  such  duty	or
     increase of duty, and he shall be entitled to
     be paid  and to  sue  for	and  recover  such
     addition; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">	  (b) if  such decrease	 or  remission	so
     takes effect  that the decreased duty only or
     no duty,  as the  case may	 be, is	 paid, the
     buyer may	deduct so  much from  the contract
     price as  will be	equivalent to the decrease
     of duty or remitted duty, and he shall not be
     liable to	pay, or	 be sued for or in respect
     of, such deduction."</blockquote>
<p id="p_101">     This section provides for the recovery by the
seller of  the amount of increase in duty from the
purchaser  where   the	 increase   takes   effect
subsequent to  the contract  and for  the right of
the purchaser  to recover from the seller the duty
in cases  where there  is a  similar decrease  and
this right  exists both	 before	 the  delivery	is
given, taken  and price	 received or  paid as  the
case  may   be	:   Narayanan  Chettiar	 v.  Kidar
Sahib(1). Counsel  for the appellants attempted to
counter this submission by relying upon a judgment
of the	Privy Council in Prbhudas v. Ganidada (2).
In that	 case the  Government duty  had	 not  been
reduced	 but   the  Buyer   claimed  that  it  had
constructively been  decreased because	the tariff
valuation had  been reduced  and so constructively
it must	 be reckoned  that there was a decrease in
the duty  on the  goods sold.  This contention was
negatived by  the Privy	 Council and  it was  held
that a	change of  duty means a change in the rate
of duty,  and not  a change  of tariff value. Thus
assuming that  the contention of the appellants is
correct as  to the  nature of  the excise  duty it
cannot be  said	 that  in  the	present	 case  the
appellants were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">54</span>
deprived of  the  opportunity  of  recovering  the
additional duty	 from the  purchaser and therefore
the duty  lost its  character of being excise duty
and was	 transformed into  a different	tax.  This
argument of  the appellants  is therefore  without
substance and must be overruled.
</p><p id="p_102">     The  constitutionality   of   the	 tax   and
retrospective  imposition   of	enhanced  duty	on
tobacco was  further challenged	 on the	 ground of
violation  of	the  fundamental   rights  of  the
appellants under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_146">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> of the Constitution
which it  was submitted is not saved by cl. (5) of
that  article  because	it  is	not  a	reasonable
restriction in the interest of the general public.
The grounds  of attack may be stated in this way :
(1) that the nature of an excise duty is such that
normally it  is passed	on to the purchaser by the
manufacturer or	 the  producer	and  it	 has  that
tendency and quality; (2) as the impugned duty was
enhanced at a time when the appellants had cleared
their goods after paying the then prevailing duty,
it was not possible for them to realize the excise
duty from any purchaser and (3) at the time of the
clearance of the goods the appellants had paid all
the taxes  under the then existing law and the new
liability rendered  them liable	 to pay an illegal
exaction or  in	 the  alternative  to  suffer  the
consequences of non-payment which are of a drastic
nature. On  this basis	it was	submitted that the
imposition was	an unreasonable restriction on the
fundamental rights  of the  appellants	guaranteed
under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_147">Art. 19(1) (f).</a>
</p><p id="p_103">     At this stage an examination of the extent of
the State's  power of  taxation will  be  helpful.
This power is one of the three governmental powers
of the State; the other two being police power and
power of eminent domain.
</p><p id="p_104">     The power	of taxation  is the legal capacity
of government  to impose  charges upon	persons or
their property to raise revenue for governmental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">55</span>
purposes. A  tax is  neither a	penalty imposed on
the taxpayer  nor a  liability which he assumes by
contract. It is but a way of apportioning the cost
of government  among those who in some measure are
privileged to enjoy its benefits and must bear its
burdens.   Welch    v.	 Henry	  (1),	 but   the
constitutionality of  a tax does not depend upon a
showing of  benefits ; protection and taxation are
not correlative terms. Willis Constitutional, Law,
p. 224	: Tax is levied against the person and not
against property.  Property only serves as a basis
for  computing	 the  measure	of  each  person's
liability. Weaver on Constitutional Law, p. 513 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">	  "The	power	of  taxation   is  one	so
     unlimited	in   force  and	 so  searching	in
     extent, that  the courts  scarcely venture to

     exercises it.  It reaches	to every  trade or
     occupation to  every object of industry, use,
     or enjoyment; to every species of possession;
     and it imposes a burden which, in the case of
     failure to	 discharge it,	may be followed by
     seizure and sale or confiscation of property.
     No attribute of sovereignty is more pervading
     and  at  no  point	 does  the  power  of  the
     government	  affect   more	  constantly   and
     intimately all  the relations  of	life  than
     through the exactions made under it."</blockquote>
<p id="p_105">     (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, Vol. 2,
8th Ed.p. 987.)
Chief  Justice	 Marshall  said	 in  M'Culloch	v.
Maryland (2) :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">	  "The power  of  taxing  the  people  and
     their property is essential to the very
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">56</span>
     existence	 of   government,   and	  may	be
     legitimately  exercised  on  the  objects	to
     which it  is applicable  to the utmost extent
     to which  the government  may choose to carry
     it. The  only security  against the  abuse of
     this power	 is found  in the structure of the
     government itself."  (See Willough	 by on the
     Constitution of  the United States, Vol. 2 at
     p. 666).
</blockquote><p id="p_106">As the	exigencies of  the  government	cannot	be
limited,  no  limits  can  be  prescribed  to  the
exercise  of   the  right   of	 taxation.   Every
individual must	 bear a	 portion of  public burden
and that portion is determined by the legislature.
According to  the American Supreme Court the power
of taxation is very wide and uncontrolled.
In M'Culloch v. Maryland(1) Chief Justice Marshall
said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">	  "....................it is unfit for the
     judicial department to inquire what degree of
     taxation is  the  legitimate  use,	 and  what
     degree may amount to the abuse of the power."
     See also  Graves v.  Schmidlapp(2) (per Chief
     Justice Stone).
</blockquote><p id="p_107">In Pacific  Insurance Co.  v. Soule(3)	the  Court
said:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">	  "Congress may	 prescribe the	basis  fix
     the rate,	and require payment as it may deem
     proper within  the limits of the constitution
     it is  supreme in	its action.  No	 power	of
     supervision or control is lodged in either of
     the other departments of the government."
</blockquote><p id="p_108">Again in Veazie Bank v. Fenno (4), it was said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">	  "It is  insisted........that the  tax in
     this case is excessive and so excessive as to
     indicate  a   purpose  on	the  part  of  the
     congress to  destroy  the	franchise  of  the
     bank,   and    is,	  therefore   beyond   the
     constitutional power of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">57</span>
     congress..............The	first	answer	to
     this is that the judicial cannot prescribe to
     the legislative  department of the Government
     limitations  upon	 the   exercise	  of   its
     acknowledged powers.  The power to tax may be
     exercised oppressively  upon persons, but the
     responsibility of	the legislature	 is not to
     the Courts	 but to	 the people  by	 whom  its
     members are elected."
</blockquote><p id="p_109">In Patton v. Brady(1), the Court observed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">	  "It is  no part  of the  function  of	 a
     Court to  enquire into  the reasonableness of
     the exercise  of the power of taxation either
     as respects  the amount  or the  property	on
     which it is imposed."
</blockquote><p id="p_110">In Welch v. Henry(2), at p. 94 it was observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">	  "The equitable distribution of the costs
     of government through the medium of an income
     tax is  a delicate and difficult task. In its
     performance   experience	 has   shown   the
     importance of  reasonable opportunity for the
     legislative body,	in  the	 revision  of  tax
     laws,  to	 distribute  increased	 costs	of
     government among  its tax payers in the light
     of	 present   need	 for   revenue	and   with
     knowledge of  the sources	and amounts of the
     various classes  of taxable income during the
     taxable period  preceding	revision.  Without
     that   opportunity	  accommodation	  of   the
     legislative  purposes  to	the  need  may	be
     seriously obstructed if not defeated."
</blockquote><p id="p_111">Thus according	to American  view (1) the power to
tax is	an attribute of sovereignty; (2) tax is an
rateable contribution  of  each	 individual  in	 a
State towards  the  amount  of	revenue	 which	is
essential for  the existence  and operation  of	 a
public governing  body; (3) it being essential for
the very  existence of	an organised State, it may
be exercised  on objects  to the  utmost extent to
which the  legislature may  choose to carry it and
(4) the needs of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">58</span>
the revenue  are only known to the legislature and
the court  cannot enquire  into the  necessity	of
imposing  a  tax  or  the  objects  on	which  the
imposition should  be made  or the  extent of  the
imposition. In	the  very  nature  of  things  the
courts are unable to go into the propriety, extent
or economics  of a  particular tax  or the  policy
underlying it,	which must depend upon a multitude
of circumstances,  which can  only be known to the
government or the legislature.
</p><p id="p_112">     As the  appellants	 have  relied  on  certain
American  decisions   where  certain  taxing  laws
operating  retrospectively   were  tested  on  the
touchstone of  "due  process  of  law"	clause	it
becomes necessary  to examine  the extent  of that
doctrine.   "The    taxing   power    of   Federal
Government,"  says  Prof.  Willis  (Constitutional
Law,  p.  378),	 "is  limited  by  the	procedural
requirements of the due process clause. Notice and
hearing,  though  not  a  judicial  tribunal,  are
required where	the tax	 is based  on the value of
the property. Jurisdiction, also, is a requirement
for all	 forms of taxation, though the rules as to
jurisdiction vary  with the  kind of  tax levied."
According  to	Willoughby,  Constitution  of  the
United States,	Vol. III, p. 1875, the due process
of law obliges the exercise of the taxing power to
conform to the following rules :-
</p><p id="p_113">     1.	  That the  tax	 shall	be  for	 a  public
purpose.
</p><p id="p_114">     2.	  That it  shall  operate  uniformly  upon
	  those subject to it.
</p><p id="p_115">     3.	  That either  the person  or the property
	  taxed shall  be within  the jurisdiction
	  of the government levying the tax.
</p><p id="p_116">     4.	  That in the assessment and collection of
	  the  tax   certain  guarantees   against
	  injustice to	individuals, especially in
	  the case  of specific	 as  distinguished
	  from ad  valorem taxes, by way of notice
	  and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">59</span>
	  opportunity  for   a	hearing	 shall	be
     provided.
</p><p id="p_117">These principles  of taxation  are not peculiar to
America but  are accepted  in all  countries which
have  parliamentary  democracies  and  govern  the
Indian taxation system also.
</p><p id="p_118">     In some  American decisions  retroactive  tax
laws were held to be inconsistent with due process
: Nichols v. Coolidge(1); Helvering v. Helwholz(2)
Blodgett v.  Holden (3). But the decision in those
cases rested  on the ground that the tax could not
reasonably be  anticipated by  the taxpayer at the
time of	 the voluntary act which the statute later
made the  taxable event	 e.g.,	the  gift  by  the
descendent of  the whole or a part of his interest
in property. As was explained in Welch v. Henry(4)
at p. 93 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">	  "Since, in  each  of	these  cases,  the
     donor might freely have chosen to give or not
     to give  the taxation,  after the	choice was
     made of  a gift  which  he	 might	will  have
     refrained from  making had he anticipated the
     tax, was  thought	to  be	so  arbitrary  and
     oppressive as  to be a denial of due process.
     But there	are other  forms of taxation whose
     retroactive, imposition  cannot be said to be
     similarly offensive,  because their incidence
     is not  on the voluntary act of the taxpayer.
     And even a retroactive gift tax has been held
     valid where  the donor  was forewarned by the
     statute books  of the  possibility of  such a
     levy, Milliken  v. United	States, 75  L. Ed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">     809.............."</blockquote>
<p id="p_119">     In that  case the	retroactive operation of a
tax on	dividends was  upheld and the objection on
the ground  of inconvenience in being called upon,
after the  customary time  for levy and payment of
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">60</span>
tax had	 passed, to  bear a governmental burden of
which he  had no  warning and  which  he  did  not
anticipate  was	 held  to  be  unsustainable.  The
contention that the retroactive application of the
<a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_148">Revenue Act</a>s  is  a  denial  of	 the  due  process
guaranteed  by	 the  Constitution  has	 not  been
accepted in  America as	 an invariable rule. Welsh
v. Henry(1) and the other cases there cited.
</p><p id="p_120">     The  doctrine  of	due  process  of  law  has
received various  interpretations in America which
have not  always been consistent. Sometimes it has
favoured personal  liberty  and	 sometimes  social
control sometimes  personal liberty as a matter of
substance. Sometimes  it  has  protected  personal
liberty by  extending due  process to  matters	of
substance and  sometimes it  has protected  social
control by broadening the scope of police power or
the power  of taxation	or the	power  of  eminent
domain.	 Willis'   Constitutional  Law,	  p.  659.
Brandeis J.,  in Untermyer  v. Anderson(2) dealing
with the  presumption  of  validity  of	 a  taxing
statute observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">	  "The presumption  should be particularly
     strong where  as here the objection to an act
     arises not	 from  a  specific  limitation	or
     prohibition on  congressional power  but only
     out  of   the  `vague  contours  of  the  5th
     Amendment	prohibiting   the  depriving   any
     person of	liberty or  property  without  due
     process of	 law'. Holmes  J.,  in	Adkins	v.
     Children's Hospital, 76 L. Ed. 785, 800."
</blockquote><p id="p_121">It  was	  because  of  the  varying  meanings  and
concepts  which	  have	from  time  to	time  been
attached to  "due process of law" that the framers
of the Indian Constitution did not adopt it in the
Constitution; on the other hand they tried to give
more defined boundaries to the area of fundamental
rights in  Arts. 19  and 31 which deal with rights
of property
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">61</span>
and in	Arts. 19,  20, 21  and 22  which relate to
protection of  personal	 liberty  and  this  Court
rejected it in A. K. Gopalan's case (1) and in the
<a href="/doc/973363/" id="a_149">State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose</a> (2).
</p><p id="p_122">     The constitutionality  of the  duty of excise

therefore falls within the definition of law under
<a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_152">Art. 13(3)(a</a>),	and if	it contravenes	any of the

<p id="p_124">     As has  already been said the power to tax is
the legal  capacity of the State to raise from all
those subject to its authority a certain amount of
revenue essential  so the  existence and operation
of government.	A tax  is  not	a  penalty  but	 a
contribution of	 monies for  governmental purposes
by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">62</span>
persons who  may  be  residents	 or  non-residents
citizens or  non citizens, living persons or legal
personae who are privileged to enjoy its benefits,
but those  are	not  co-relative.  It  implies	an
equality of  burden and	 regular  distribution	of
expenses of government among the persons taxed. It
is levied by authority of law equitably, uniformly
or in echelons on all persons subject to it.
</p><p id="p_125">     The appellants  alleged that  they	 had  sold
their goods  during the	 period when  the  Finance
Bill was  before  Parliament.  Variations  in  the
rates of  duties  are  not  unexpected,	 it  being
within the  power of  Parliament  to  do  so  both
prospectively  and   retrospectively.  It  is  not
suggested that	such  variations  are  unknown	in
legislative practice  or that the legislators were
not entitled  to amend a money bill as introduced.
If the appellants' contention is sustained then it
will mean  the deprivation  of Parliament  of  its
right  to  choose  the	objects	 of  taxation  and
therefore Parliament  will only	 vary the rates of
duties proposed	 by the	 Executive or  the time of
their effectiveness  at the  peril of  their being
declared invalid  although they	 may be within its
legislative competence	and may	 in its opinion be
necessary for  the carrying out of its policies or
subserve the proper governance of the country.
</p><p id="p_126">     In	 the   Indian  Constitution  there  is	an
exhaustive   enunciation   and	 distribution	of
legislative  powers,   including  powers   as	to
taxation,  between   the  State	 Legislatures  and
Parliament. Subjects  of taxation  are distributed
in the	three Legislative  Lists and  areas of the
respective  fields   of	  Parliament   and   State
Legislatures as to taxes are defined. In Parts XII
and XIII  limitations on legislative competence of
the  various   legislatures  as	 to  taxation  are
indicated  and	 emphasis   is	 placed	  on   the
preservation of the economic unity of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">63</span>
India. <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_156">Article	265</a> is in Chapter XII and provides
:-
</p><p id="p_127">     "No tax  shall be	levied or collected except
by  authority	of  law,"  which  means	 that  all
taxation has  to be  under  a  law  enacted  by	 a
legislature of	competent jurisdiction and subject
to constitutional  limitations. This Court in 1950
rejected the applicability of the doctrine of "due
process of law" to Indian constitutional problems:
A. K. Gopalan's case (1); The state of <a href="/doc/973363/" id="a_157">West Bengal
v. Subodh  Gopal Bose</a>  (2). In	the latter case it
was  also   held  that	 the  Indian  Constitution
recognises no  fundamental right  to immunity from
taxation   and	 that	is   why   presumably	no
constitutional protection  is provided against the
exercise of  that  power.  Per	Patanjali  Sastri,
C.J., p.  614. Das,  J. (as he then was), held the
power of taxation to be distinct from police power
(i.e. regulatory power of the State) and the power
of Eminent  Domain (i.e. the power of the State of
compulsory acquisition	of property). Dealing with
protection against  taxation  he  said	in  Subodh
Gopal's case (2) at p. 652 :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">	  "Our	 Constitution	makers	 evidently
     considered the protection against deprivation
     of property in exercise of police power or of
     the power	of eminent domain by the executive
     to	 be   of  greater   importance	than   the
     protection against	 deprivation  of  property
     brought about by the exercise of the power of
     taxation by  the executive,  for they found a
     place for	the first  mentioned protection in
     <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_158">Art. 31  (1)</a> and  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_159">(2)</a> set	out  in	 Part  III
     dealing with  fundamental rights  while  they
     placed  the   last	 mentioned  protection	in
     <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_160">article 265</a>  to be	 found in Part XII dealing
     with finance  etc. So  with regard to all the
     three  sovereign	powers	we  have  complete
     protection against the executive organ of the
     State."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">64</span>
<p id="p_128">Again at p. 653 he observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">	  "Apart from  this, what  I ask  is,  our

     whatever. By exercising its power of taxation
     by law  the State	may deprive us, citizen or
     non-citizen of  almost sixteen  annas in  the

</blockquote><p id="p_129"><a href="/doc/233559/" id="a_161">In Ramjilal  v. Income Tax Officer</a> (1) Das, J. (as
he then was), observed at pp. 136-137 :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">	  "Reference  has   next  to  be  made	to
     <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_162">article 265</a> which is in Part, XII, Chapter 1,
     dealing with 'Finance'. That article provides
     that no  tax shall	 be  levied  or	 collected
     except by	authority of  law.  There  was	no
     similar  provision	  in   the   corresponding
     chapter of the Government of India Act, 1935.
     If collection of taxes amounts to deprivation
     of property  within the  meaning  of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_163">article
     31(1</a>), then  there was  no point  in making a
     separate provision	 again as has been made in
     <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_164">article  265.</a>  It,	 therefore,  follows  that
     clause (1)	 of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_165">article 31</a> must be regarded as
     concerned	with   deprivation   of	  property
     otherwise	 than	by   the   imposition	or
     collection of  tax, for otherwise <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_166">article 265</a>
     becomes  wholly   redundant.  In  the  United
     States of	America the  power of  taxation is
     regarded as  distinct from	 the  exercise	of
     police   power   or   eminent   domain.   Our
     Constitution  evidently   has  also   treated
     taxation	as    distinct	 from	compulsory
     acquisition  of   property	  and	has   made
     independent   provision   giving	protection
     against taxation  save by	authority of  law.
     When Dr.  Tek Chand was asked if that was not
     the correct  position, he did not advance any
     cogent or	convincing answer  to  refute  the
     conclusion put  to him.  In our  opinion, the
     protection against imposition
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">65</span>
     and collection  of taxes save by authority of
     law directly  comes from  <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_167">article 265</a>, and is
     not secured  by clause  (1)  of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_168">article  31.</a>
     <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_169">Article 265</a>  not being  in Chapter III of the

</p><p id="p_135">     In Panna  Lal Binjraj  v. The  Union of India
(7), the assault was not against the imposition or
the vires  of the  tax but against the vires of<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_193"> s.
5(7A)</a> of  the Indian Income-tax Act which empowers
the Commissioner  of Income-tax	 to  transfer  any
case from  one Income-tax  Officer subordinate	to
him to	another and  empowers the Central Board of
Revenue to  transfer any  case from one Income-tax
officer to  another. This  attack was based on the
contravention of  Arts. 14  and 19(1)(g).  It  was
held that the discretion vested in the authorities
empowered   to	  make	 the   transfer	  is   not
discriminatory and  there was no interference with
the right  of the citizen to carry on his trade or
calling. In collector of <a href="/doc/286667/" id="a_194">Malabar v. Erimal Ebrahim
Hajee</a> (8)  the	attack	against	 the  recovery	of
income-tax under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_195"> s. 46</a>	 (2) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_196">Income-tax Act</a>
was based  on Arts. 14, 19 and 22. There again the
question for  decision was  not the  imposition of
the tax but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">67</span>
the mode  of recovery  and at Page 976 this ground
of attack  was rejected	 and reference	was  there
made to	 the <a href="/doc/1970738/" id="a_197">State  of Punjab  v. Ajaib Singh</a> (1);
<a href="/doc/635142/" id="a_198">Purshottam Govindji  Halai v.  Shree B.	 M. Desai,
Additional Collector  of Bombay</a>	 (2). Another case
relied upon by the appellant's counsel was <a href="/doc/1212156/" id="a_199">Western
India Theatres v. The Cantonment Board, Poona</a>, (3)
in which the tax was imposed on cinema houses with
larger seating	capacity and the attack was on the
ground of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_200">Art. 14</a> but that was repelled.
The  appellant's  counsel  also	 referred  to  the
<a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_201">Bengal Immunity	 Co. Ltd.  v. State  of Bihar</a>  (4)
where the vires of the sales tax imposed on inter-
State transactions was attacked. The High Court in
the case had held that the petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_202">Art. 226</a>
was misconceived  overlooking the  fact	 that  the
contention raised  was that  in so  far as the tax
purported to  act on  non-residents in	respect of
inter-State  sales  it	was  ultra  vires  of  the
Constitution. At. p. 619, Das, C. J., observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_68">	  "It is  also true  that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_203">article 31</a> which
     protects  citizens	  and  non-citizens  alike
     cannot  be	  availed  of  as  it  deals  with
     deprivation of property otherwise than by way
     of levying	 or collecting	taxes as  held	by
     this Court in <a href="/doc/233559/" id="a_204">Ramjilal v. Income-tax Officer,
     Mohindergarh</a> [1951]  S. C.	 R. 127, and that,
     therefore the  Act	 does  not  constitute	an
     infringement  of  the  fundamental	 right	to
     property under  that article. It is, however,
     clear from	 <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_205">article 265</a>  that no  tax can	be
     levied or	collected except  by authority	of
     law which must mean a good and valid law. The
     contention of  the appellant  company is that
     the  Act  which  authorises  the  assessment,
     levying and collection of sales tax on inter-
     State trade  contravenes and  constitutes	an
     infringement of  <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_206">Art. 286</a>	and is, therefore,
     ultra  vires,  void  and  unenforceable.  If,
     therefore, this contention be well founded,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">68</span>
     the  remedy   by  was  of	a  writ	 must,	on
     principle and  authority, be available to the
     party aggrieved.</blockquote>
<p id="p_136">     The next  case relied upon by counsel for the
appellants was	<a href="/doc/634002/" id="a_207">Kailash Nath v. State of U. P</a>. (1)
which was  a case  under the  U. P. Sales Tax Act,
the plea  of the  petitioners was  that the  goods
sought to  be taxed had been exported overseas and
therefore not  liable to  sales tax.  It was  held
that  if   a  tax  is  levied  without	due  legal
authority on any trade or business then it is open
to the	citizen to  approach this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_208">Art.
32</a>, since  his right to carry on trade is violated
or infringed by the imposition of the tax and <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_209">Art.
19 (1)(g)  "</a>comes  into	 play".	 There	again  the
taxation law  itself was  not  challenged  on  the
ground of violation of any fundamental right which
has reference  to property,  but the imposition of
the tax was assailed on the ground that it was not
imposeable on  the  transactions  which	 had  been
entered into.
</p><p id="p_137">     In	 support   of  the  proposition	 that  the
taxation laws  are assailable under the provisions
of  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_210">Art.   19(1)</a>  <a href="/doc/204111/" id="a_211">State	 of  Travancore-Cochin	v.
Shanmuga Vilas	Cashew Nut  Factory</a> (2) was relied
upon. That  was not  a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_212">Art. 32</a> or a
matter under  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_213">Art. 19(1)(f)</a>  but  one  under  <a href="/doc/1232505/" id="a_214">Art.

transaction  was  in  the  course  of  inter-State
trade. <a href="/doc/1385734/" id="a_215">Himatlal	 Harilal Mehta	v.  The	 State	of
Madhya	Pradesh</a>	 (3)  was  also	 a  similar  case.
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_216">Article	 19(1)(g)</a>   was	 applied  because  of  the
unconstitutionality  of	  the	tax   under   <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_217">Art.
286(1)(a).</a> <a href="/doc/506242/" id="a_218">M/s.	 Ram Narain  Sons  Ltd.	 v.  Asst</a>.
Commissioner of	 Sales Tax  (4) was  also  a  case
under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_219">Art.  286</a> of  the Constitution and was not a
matter	 falling   under   <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_220">Art.	  19(1)</a>	  of   the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_138">     In all these cases relied upon by counsel for
the appellants	the basis  of attack  was (1) that
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">69</span>
tax was	 not within  the legislative competence of
the legislature imposing the tax and therefore the
tax  was   being  illegally   recovered	 from  the
assessee or  (2) an  objection was  taken  to  the
differential mode of imposition and collection and
use of	a more	stringent procedure  i.e., illegal
discrimination between	persons similarly situated
e.g.,  under  Taxation	on  <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_221">Income  (Investigation
Commission) Act</a>.  The imposion	of an  illegal tax
not  within  the  legislative  competence  of  the
legislature, a	colourable  piece  of  legislature
imposing a  tax which  is not  a  tax  but  is	an
imposition of  a confiscatory  nature, a breach of
principles  of	natural	 justice  or  imposing	an
unimposeable  tax   have  all	been  held  to	be
violative of  the right	 to carry  on trade  under
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_222">Art.  19(1)(g).</a>	  But  they  do	 not  support  the
proposition that the tax if otherwise valid can be
declared unconstitutional  and can  be subject	to
judicial review	 on the	 ground of being excessive
or  being  retrospective  in  operation	 or  being
imposed on  one article rather than another. These
cases do  not support  the proposition	which  has
been contended for by the appellants that the very
imposition of  the tax	is a  contravention of the
right of the assessee to acquire, hold (or own) or
dispose	 of   property	or   on	 the   ground	of
contravention of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_223">Art. 31.</a>
</p><p id="p_139">     <a href="/doc/41574/" id="a_224">In the  State of  Bombay v. Bhanji Munji</a> (1),
it was	also held that <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_225">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> read with cl.
(5) postulates the existence of the property which
can be	enjoyed	 and  over  which  rights  can	be
exercised   because   otherwise	  the	reasonable
restriction  contemplated   by	cl.(5)	cannot	be
brought into  play. That was the uniform view held
in this Court till the majority judgment in Moopil
Nair's case(2)	which relied on the second Kochuni
case i.e.,  Kavalappara Kottarathil  Kochunni etc.
etc. v.	 The State  of Madras  (3). But the latter
was not	 a taxation case. It was held in that case
(Kochuni case) that all laws within
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">70</span>
<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_226">Art. 13</a> are subject to Part III and that for a law
to be valid it must satisfy two tests (1) of being
enacted	 by   a	 legislature   having  legislative
competence and (2) it should not contravene any of
the fundamental rights.
</p><p id="p_140">     The above	opinion is  not in accord with the
opinion of this court in A. K. Gopalan's case (1);
<a href="/doc/959860/" id="a_227">Ram Singh  v. State  of Delhi</a> (2); <a href="/doc/41574/" id="a_228">State of Bombay
v. Bhanji  Munji</a> (3);  The Daily  Express case (4)
and The Hamdard Dawakhana case (5).
</p><p id="p_141">     The question  of the  applicability  of  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_229">Art.
19(1)(f)</a> of the Constitution to taxing matters was
considered in  <a href="/doc/1660833/" id="a_230">K. T.  Moopil Nair  v. The State of
Kerala</a> (6).  That was  a case  in which a tax at a
flat rate  was levied on forest lands in the State
of Kerala and this Court by majority held that the
tax so	imposed was unconstitutional on the ground
of infringement	 of Arts.  14  and  19(1)(f).  The
reasons given by the learned Chief Justice were:
</p><p id="p_142">     (a) In  the procedure  to be  adopted for the
levying of  the tax,  there was no provision for a
notice to be given to the assessee;
</p><p id="p_143">     (b) There	was no procedure for rectification
of   mistakes	 committed   by	   the	 assessing
authorities;
</p><p id="p_144">     (c) There	is no  procedure for obtaining the
opinion of a superior Civil Court on a question of
law as is generally found in all taxing stautes
</p><p id="p_145">     (d) No  duty  was	cast  upon  the	 assessing
authority to act judicially; and
</p><p id="p_146">     (e) There	was no right of appeal provided to
the assessee.
</p><p id="p_147">The  provisions	 of  the  Act  were  held  in  the
majority  judgment  to	be  confiscatory.  It  was
observed by the learned Chief Justice at p. 559:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">	  "That the  provisions aforesaid  of  the
     impugned Act are in their effect confiscatory
     is clear on their face. Taking the extreme
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">71</span>
     case, the	facts of  which we  have stated in
     the early	part of	 this judgment,	 it can be
     illustrated that  the provisions  of the Act,
     without proposing	to acquire  the	 privately
     owned forests  in the  State of  Kerala after
     satisfying the  conditions laid  down in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_231">Art.
     31</a> of  the Constitution,  have the	 effect of
     eliminating the  private owners  through  the
     machinery of the Act."
</blockquote><p id="p_148">Thus the impugned statute in that case was held to
be  violative	of  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_232">Art.   19(1)(f)</a>  because   its
procedural part	 made no  provision for	 giving	 a
hearing to the assessees or for appeal nor was the
Assessing Authority required to act judicially and
the imposition	though called  a tax was in effect
confiscatory and  therefore a  colourable piece of
legislation. Sarkar,  J., in his minority judgment
remarked that  reasonableness of  the rate was not
assailed but  what was assailed was the imposition
of a  flat rate	 per acre without any reference to
productivity.
</p><p id="p_149">     Undoubtedly Moopil	 Nair's case  (1) did hold
that a	law under  <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_233">Art. 265</a>  was also a law within
<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_234">Art. 13</a>	 and if	 it contravened	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_235">Art. 14</a>,  it  was
liable to  be struck  down and	that such law must
also pass  the test  of the limitations prescribed
in Part III of the Constitution but it did not lay
down that  all	Articles  in  Part  III	 would	be
applicable to  taxation laws  nor  did	it  decide
contrary to  Ramjilal's case  (2) that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_236">Art. 31 (1)</a>
would apply  to taxation  law which  is	 otherwise
invalid. But  it  is  difficult	 to  hold  that	 a
regulatory Article like <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_237">Art. 19(1)</a> was intended to
limit the  powers of  the  Legislature	to  impose
taxes and  thus to discharge its duty in regard to
country's financial needs and policies.
</p><p id="p_150">     The  contention   of  infringement	  of   the
appellants' right  under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_238">Art. 19(1) (f)</a> is unsound
and must be rejected and the reasons are these:-
</p><p id="p_151">     Firstly: Clause  (5) of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_239">Art. 19</a>  allows  the
enacting  of   laws   which   impose   "reasonable
restrictions"
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">72</span>
<p id="p_152">in the interests of the general public. The use of
the term  "reasonable restrictions"  is indicative
of regulation  of the right to the personal rights
mentioned in  sub-cl. (f)  of the first clause. It
must have  relation to	the existence of the thing
to be  regulated. There	 can be	 no regulation	of
things not in existence. Therefore where an Act is
deprivatory as	the imposition	of  a  tax  is	it
cannot fall  within <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_240">Art.  (19)(1)</a>  but	under  the
specific <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_241">Art.  31</a>, which relates to deprivation of
property. Imam, J., in <a href="/doc/286667/" id="a_242">The Collector of Malabar v.
E. Ebrahim Hajee</a> (1) said at p. 976:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_70">	  "If  the   property  itself	is   taken
     lawfully under  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_243">Art. 31</a>, the right to hold or
     dispose of	 it  perishes  with  it	 and  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_244">Art.
     19(1)(f)</a> cannot be invoked."
</blockquote><p id="p_153">That was  a  case  where  the  Income-tax  Officer
issued a  certificate  under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_245"> s.  46</a>  (2)  of  the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_246">Income-tax Act</a>	and  the  Collector  proceeded	to
recover under <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_247"> s. 48</a>  of Madras	 Revenue  Recovery
Act.
</p><p id="p_154">     Secondly: All  taxation, as shown by its very
nature and  object, is	in  the	 interest  of  the
general public	because it  is a  contribution for
governmental expenditure  from all  persons who in
some measure are entitled to its benefit.
</p><p id="p_155">     Thirdly: There  is no  means or  measure  for
determining the reasonableness of the restrictions
which is  an objective determination. The needs of
the revenue  cannot be	known to  the  courts  and
cannot be  determined by  them, and the sources of
revenue are  entirely within  the knowledge of the
legislature and	 it is	for that department of the
State  to   determine  how   the  burden  will	be
distributed and	 why, because  that department	is
the policy  making body	 and is	 familiar with the
economics and the resources of the country and its
needs. It is for that department in its discretion
to select
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">73</span>
anything for  taxation or  to exclude it. Cooley's
Constitutional	Limitations,   Vol.  II,   p.  986
(note).
</p><p id="p_156">     Fourthly: The power to tax is an attribute of
sovereignty and	 it is	an accepted principle that
the exercise  of that  power  is  not  subject	to
judicial   control   because   no   Constitutional
Government can	exist without  the power  to raise
money for  its needs and the only security against
abuse is  in the structure of the Government. That
power carries  with it the power to determine when
and   how    the   tax	 shall	 be   levied.	S.
</p><p id="p_157"><a href="/doc/1379700/" id="a_248">Ananthakrishnan	 v.   The  State  of  Madras</a>  (1),
M'Culloch v.  The State	 of Maryland (2). There is
no indication  that the	 Indian	 Constitution  has
rejected or  modified the  American concept of the
sovereignty of the State in regard to the power of
taxation.
</p><p id="p_158">     Fifthly: <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_249">Article 19 (1)</a> declares the right of
a citizen  and cl. (5) prescribes its limits. If a
taxation statute  is within  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_250">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> it must
be  capable   of  being	 upheld	 as  a	reasonable
restriction on the holding of property etc. On the
submission of  the appellants  all taxes  will	be
restrictions. If  they are restrictions then their
reasonableness will  be justiciable depending upon
the appreciation of established facts. How are the
courts to  judge ?  All	 the  necessary	 data  for
determining reasonableness  can never  be before a
court which  in	 the  very  nature  of	things	is
available only	to the	legislature. Can the court
say  that   a  particular   tax	 is  excessive	or
unreasonable or can the court say which particular
source should be taxed and which particular income
group should  bear the	burden of taxation or what
the policy  of the State as to taxation should be.
It would seem therefore that the reasonableness of
tax laws  is not  justiciable and  therefore  they
cannot fall within clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_251">Art. 19.</a> <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_252">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">74</span>
19(1)(f)</a> and  cl. 5 are part of one scheme and the
former is  incapable of operating where the latter
is inoperative.	 If considerations  of <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_253">Art.  19(5)</a>
are foreign  to taxing laws <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_254">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> can have
no application to them.
</p><p id="p_159">     Sixthly: Applicability  of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_255">Art.  19(1)(f)</a>	to
taxation  laws	will  mean  that  laws	which  are
otherwise valid	 will be  inapplicable to citizens
but will  be applicable	 to non-citizens.  At  any
rate such  law will operate differentially between
one set	 of taxpayers  and another  i.e.,  between
citizens and  non-citizens. This  will violate the
very principles	 of due process relied upon by the
appellants.
</p><p id="p_160">     Seventhly: In  American due process which has
a  variable   concept  has  not	 been  applied	to
retrospective operation	 of tax laws except to tax
on voluntary  gifts of	property and that also was
doubted in Welch v. Henry (1).
</p><p id="p_161">     Eighthly: Retroactive  duty of excise will be
a valid imposition in the case of persons who have
not sold  their tobacco	 between the period of the
introduction of	 the bill and the enactment of the
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_256">Finance Act</a>  but will  be invalid  in the  case of
persons placed as the appellants.
</p><p id="p_162">     Ninthly: The  acceptance of  the  appellants'
argument would	mean that  they	 can  recover  any
excess duty  paid, excess  because  of	subsequent
decrease, but  would not  be  liable  to  pay  any
similar increase  in duty  in spite  of<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_257"> s. 64-A</a> of
the  Indian   Sale  of	 Goods	Act   under  which
variations in the rates of duties become operative
on contracts of sale and purchase.
</p><p id="p_163">     Tenthly: It  has been  held that  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_258">Art. 31</a>	is
inapplicable   to    deprivation   by	 taxation.
Ramjilal's case	 (2); <a href="/doc/108021/" id="a_259">Lakshmanppa  Hanumantappa v.

</p><p id="p_164">     Eleventhly: To  put it  in the  words of  the
American Supreme Court in Odgen v. Saunders(1)
     "It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom
the  integrity	 and   the   patriotism	  of   the
legislative  body,  by	which  law  is	passed	to
presume in  favour  of	its  validity,	until  its
violation of the Constitution is proved beyond all
reasonable doubt".
</p><p id="p_165">     Twelfthly: The  challenge to  the legality of
the  tax   in  dispute	 is  not   based  and	is
unsustainable on the ground of specific limitation
or prohibition on Parliamentary power but has been
raised on  the ground  of the  infringement of	an
article containing  the principles  of the State's
power  of   control.  The   cases   dealing   with
legislative incapacity	are  inapplicable  to  the
latter ground  of assault.  Cases such as <a href="/doc/154519/" id="a_263">Mohammad
Yasin v.  The Town Area Committee, Jalalabad</a>(2) (a
case of	 a licence  fee which  is not  a tax), <a href="/doc/424874/" id="a_264">The
State of  Bombay v.  United Motors India Ltd</a>.(3)(a
case of inter-State trade) and Bengal Immunity Co.
case (4)  (which was  also a  case of  inter-State
trade and  some of  the provision  of the impugned
Act there were held to be unreasonable restriction
on the	right to  carry on  trade)  and	 Ch.  Tika
Ramji's	 case	(5)  (a	  case	dealing	 with  the
imposition of  the restriction	on  the	 right	to
purchase except through a particular society) were
not cases  in which  the imposition  of a  tax was
challenged on  the ground  of infringement of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_265">Art.
19(1)(f).</a>
</p><p id="p_166">     I, therefore, agree that appeals be dismissed
with costs. One hearing fee.
