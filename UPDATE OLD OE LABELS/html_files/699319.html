HEADNOTE:
    The appellant is a Municipal Councillor of the  Cuddapah
Municipal  Council.  He	 was elected to the  Council  as  an
independent candidate. According to him, he enjoys populari-
ty  in his area and had previously held important  positions
in the District. He states that the local leadership of	 the
ruling	Telugu	Desam Party having failed to  woo  him	into
their fold, he was pressurised through the Excise and Police
authorities  foisting false cases upon him. Scenting a	move
to  detain  him under the provisions of the  Andhra  Pradesh
Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,  Dacoits,
Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and	Land
Grabbers  Act, 1986, the appellant filed a writ petition  on
6.6.1988  in  the High Court, averring inter alia  that	 the
successive  actions  initiated against him were	 a  part  of
political  vendetta. A learned Single Judge on 8.8.1988	 was
pleased	 to direct interim the respondents not to  take	 the
appellant into preventive custody for a period of 15 days on
the  basis  of	the cases already  registered.	However,  on
10.6.1988 the appellant was served the detention order dated
3.6.1988  as  well as the grounds of detention, and  he	 was
taken into custody, but was released after four days.
    The	 appellant  filed on 25.6.1988 in his  pending	writ
petition a miscellaneous petition, as an additional  affida-
vit.  He assailed therein the order of detention on  various
grounds. A Division Bench of the High Court, on reference by
the  learned Single Judge, held that the prayer in the	writ
petition  had  become infructuous, and that  there  were  no
extraordinary  or special reasons to depart from the  normal
rule, namely, that in such a case the appellant should first
surrender and move for a writ of habeas corpus. The Division
Bench accordingly, dismissed the writ petition.
Before	this Court it was inter alia contended on behalf  of
the
106
appellant  that the High Court erred in holding	 that  there
were  no extraordinary circumstances or special	 reasons  to
depart	from  the  normal rule, thereby	 refusing  to  grant
relief	to the appellant against infringement of his  funda-
mental right to liberty; that the detention order having not
been  approved	by the State Government	 as  required  under
Section	 3(3) of the Prevention of Dangerous Activities	 Act
and  the appellant's case having not been placed before	 the
Advisory  Board	 as required under section 10  thereof,	 the
detention  order ceased to be in force and hence was  liable
to be quashed.
    On	behalf of the respondent, it was contended that	 the
detention order having been passed before the writ  petition
was  filed, the High Court was right in dismissing the	writ
petition  following the court's practice and procedure,	 and
that  there  were  no extraordinary or	special	 reasons  to
depart	from the normal rule inasmuch as granting relief  at
such  a	 stage	would defeat the very purpose  of  the	Act.
Counsel,  however, could not deny that the  detention  order
was not approved by the State Government and that the appel-
lant's case was not placed before the Advisory Board.
    Allowing the appeal and quashing the order of detention,
this Court,
    HELD: (1) The position of a person who is actually under
illegal	 detention and of a person who is in imminent  jeop-
ardy of illegal detention are not far dissimilar. Refusal to
interfere in such a case may amount to denial of the  funda-
mental right itself. [114A].

tra, [1981] 1 Cr. L.J. 767, referred to.
    (2)	 There could be no reason why in an exceptional	 and
rare  case, detention order already made, and either  served
or yet to be served, and the person is still free, could not
be legally brought under challenge. [114F]

    (3) For enforcement of one's right to life and  personal
liberty resort to <a href="/doc/452476/" id="a_5">Article 226(1)</a> has been provided for.	 The
word  'enforcement' has also been used in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_6">Article 32</a> of	 the
Constitution  which provides the remedy for  enforcement  of
rights	conferred by Part III of the Constitution. The	word
'enforcement'  has  not been defined  by  the  Constitution.
[115B]
    (4)	 'Enforce'  means to compel obedience  to  laws;  to
compel	performance, obedience by physical or  moral  force.
[115C]
    (5)	 Conferring the right to life and liberty imposes  a
corresponding duty on the rest of the society, including the
State, to observe that right, that is to say, not to act  or
to  do anything which would amount to infringement  of	that
right, except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by
law. [115F]
    (6)	 Resort to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> after the right	to  personal
liberty is already violated is different from the pre-viola-
tion protection. Post-violation resort to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> is for
remedy	against violation and for restoration of the  right,
while  pre-violation protection is by compelling  observance
of  the obligation or compulsion under law not	to  infringe
the right by all those who are so obligated or compelled. To
surrender  and apply for a writ of habeas corpus is a  post-
violation  remedy for restoration of the right which is	 not
the  same  as  restraining potential violators	in  case  of
threatened violation of the right. [116B-C]
    (7) Law surely cannot take action for internal  thoughts
but  can  act only after overt acts. If overt  acts  towards
violation  have already been done and the same has  come  to
the  knowledge of the person threatened with  the  violation
and he approaches the court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Art. 226</a> giving sufficient
particulars of proximate actions as would imminently lead to
violation  of  right, should not the court call	 upon  those
alleged	 to have taken these steps to appear and show  cause
why they should not be restrained from violating that right?
[116 C-D]
    (8) The difference of the two situations have  different
legal  significance. If a threatened invasion of a right  is
removed	 by restraining the potential violator	from  taking
any steps towards violation, the rights remain protected and
the  compulsion	 against its violation is enforced.  If	 the
right has already been violated, what is left is the  remedy
against	 such  violation and for restoration of	 the  right.
[116F-G]
(9)  In the instant case, the appellant's fundamental  right
to
108
liberty	 is the reflex of a legal obligation of the rest  of
the society, including the State, and it is the	 appellant's
legal  power  bestowed upon him to bring about	by  a  legal
action the enforcement of the fulfilment of that  obligation
existing  towards him. Denial of legal action would,  there-
fore,  amount to denial of his right of enforcement  of	 his
right  to  liberty. A petition for a writ of  habeas  corpus
would not be a substitute for this enforcement. [120D-E]
    K.K.  Kochunni v. The State of Madras and  Ors.,  [1959]
Supp.  2 SCR 316; Special Reference No. 1 of 1964, [1965]  1
SCR  413;  <a href="/doc/1599374/" id="a_10">M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a>, [1987]	 1  SCC	 395
referred to.
    (10)  As  the  detention order was	already	 passed	 and
served and the detenu was already taken into custody  during
the  pendency of the writ petition, these subsequent  events
having	being brought to the notice of the court by a  Misc.
application  in the form of additional affidavit,  the	same
ought to have been dealt with by the High Court..[113A-B]
    (11)  The detention order had not been approved  by	 the
State  Government within 12 days of its being made,  as	 en-
joined	under  subsection (3) of section 3 of the  Act.	 The
result is that the order could not remain in force more than
12 days after making thereof and as such must be treated  as
to  have ceased to be in force and non-existent	 thereafter.
[122A]
    (12) Even though the detenu was released, if the  deten-
tion order was in force, his case was required to be  placed
before the Advisory Board. This being a mandatory  provision
and having not been complied with, the detention order	even
if otherwise in force, cannot be said to have been in  force
after three weeks. [122H; 123A]

<p id="p_4">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
K.N. SAIKIA, J. Special leave granted.
</p><p id="p_5">    This  appeal is from the Judgment and Order of the	High
Court  of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad dated 4.7.1988  passed
in Writ Petition No. 86 10 of 1988.
</p><p id="p_6">    The	 appellant states that he enjoys popularity  in	 his
area and that he previously held several important positions
in the Cuddapah District of Andhra Pradesh, such as organis-
ing  Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee	 for
several years, a Municipal Councillor from 1982 to 1986	 and
a Vice-Chairman of Cuddapah Municipal Council. According  to
him  in	 December 1985 he was elected as a Chairman  of	 the
Cuddapah  Municipal  Council for its residuary term  and  in
March  1987  he was elected to the Municipal Council  as  an
independent  candidate defeating the Telugu Desam  and	Con-
gress (I) candidates by a large margin. It is his case	that
the  local  leadership	of the ruling  Telugu  Desam  Party.
having failed to woo him into their fold he was	 pressurised
through	 the  Excise and Police authorities  foisting  false
cases  upon him. On 13.11.1987, the police  having  summoned
him  to the Police Station for taking his photograph as	 was
done in case of criminals, he moved the Andhra Pradesh	High
Court by Writ Petition No. 79038 of 1987 and the High  Court
was pleased to issue directions as prayed for, by its  order
dated  17.12.1987.  Thereafter the  excise  authorities	 are
stated	to have registered some cases against the  appellant
who applied for and was granted bail on 10.5.1988  rejecting
the Excise authorities' prayer for custody. Scenting a	move
to  detain the appellant under the provisions of the  Andhra
Pradesh	 Prevention of Dangerous Activities of	Bootleggers,
Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic  Offenders
and Land Grabbers Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as 'the
Act', the appellant filed Writ Petition No. 8610 of 1988  on
6.6.1988  in the Andhra Pradesh High Court  averting,  inter
alia, that the successive actions initiated against him were
a  part	 of political vendetta. A learned  Single  Judge  on
8.6.1988  was pleased to direct interim the respondents	 not
to  take the appellant into preventive custody for a  period
of  15 days on basis the cases already registered.  However,
on 10.6.1988 the appellant was served the detention order in
S.No. 7/1988 dated 3.6.1988 as well as the grounds of deten-
tion;  and he was taken into custody and detained in  Secun-
derabad	 jail, but was released after four days. The  deten-
tion  order stated that with a view to preventing  him	from
acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of  public
order, it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">110</span>
necessary  to make an order directing that "he shall be	 de-
tained." The grounds of detention as served upon the  appel-
lant  contained altogether 13 grounds ranging a period	from
23.11.1974 to 7.5.1988.
</p><p id="p_7">    The appellant filed on 25.6.1988 in his writ petition  a
miscellaneous  petition being W.P.M.P.S.R. No. 51830, as  an
additional  affidavit,	stating, inter alia, that  the	writ
petition  was  filed by him seeking a direction to  the	 re-
spondents  to  refrain from making an  order  detaining	 him
under  the provisions of the Act and the same  was  admitted
and  interim direction issued. But thereafter the  detention
order in S.No. 7 of 1988 dated 3.6.1988 was served on him on
10.6.1988 and, therefore, he submitted the additional  affi-
davit with reference to the impugned order of detention.  He
assailed  therein the grounds of detention as vague,  stale,
non-existent and, in any case, irrelevant bearing no reasons
for the decision that his detention was necessary to prevent
him  from acting in a manner prejudicial to the	 maintenance
of  public order. He also assailed the order on	 grounds  of
non application of mind by the respondent NO. 2 and  absence
of nexus between the grounds and maintenance of public order
and of non-disclosure of any rational basis for formation of
such  an  opinion.  He refuted and denied  each	 of  the  13
grounds	 and  prayed that the writ petition  be	 amended  by
substituting  the  prayer so as to issue a  writ,  order  or
direction and more particularly one in the nature of writ of
mandamus  declaring the order of the Collector and  District
Magistrate  respondent	No. 2 herein in S.R. No. 7  of	1988
dated 3.6.1988 made under Act 1 of 1986 as illegal and	void
and to pass such other orders as are necessary in the inter-
ests of justice. Admittedly no specific order was passed  on
this  miscellaneous  petition.	It appears  that  a  Counter
Affidavit  was filed in the writ petition on behalf  of	 the
respondents and the appellant filed a reply affidavit there-
to.
</p><p id="p_8">    A Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh  on
reference  by the learned Single judge heard the writ  peti-
tion  analogously with another writ petition and  observing,
inter  alia,  that as an order of detention  was  made	even
before the writ petition was filed, held that the prayer  in
the  writ  petition had become infructuous; and	 that  there
were no extraordinary or special reasons to depart from	 the
normal	rule,  namely,	that in such a	case  the  appellant
should first surrender and move for a writ of habeas corpus,
and accordingly dismissed the writ petition.
    Mr. M.C. Bhandare, the learned counsel for the appellant
submits, inter alia, that the High Court erred in dismissing
the appellant's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">111</span>
writ  petition	holding	 that there  were  no  extraordinary
circumstance,  or special reasons to depart from the  normal
rule that the appellant in such a case should first  surren-
der  and  then	move a petition for  habeas  corpus  thereby
refusing to grant relief to the appellant against  infringe-
ment  of  his  fundamental right to liberty;  and  that	 the
grounds of detention were vague, irrelevant, stale and	non-
existent having no relation to the stated purpose of  deten-
tion, and there was mala fide exercise of power and complete
non-application of mind on the part of the detaining author-
ity  for which the grounds of detention ought to  have	been
rejected  and the detention order set aside. Counsel  relies
on  a decision of the Bombay High Court reported in  1981(1)
Crl.  L.J. 767 and one of the Gujarat High Court  since	 re-
ported in AIR 1978 Gujarat 253. Counsel further submits that
the  detention order having not been approved by  the  State
Government as required under section 3(3) of the Act and the
appellant's case having not been placed before the  Advisory
Board  as  required  under section 10  the  detention  order
ceased to be in force and hence is liable to be quashed.
    Mr. M.S. Ganesh, the learned counsel for the respondents
submits	 that the detention order having been passed  before
the  writ  petition was filed, the High Court was  right  in
dismissing  the	 same  following the  court's  practice	 and
procedure;  and that there were no extraordinary or  special
reasons to depart from the normal rule inasmuch as  granting
relief at such a stage would defeat the very purpose of	 the
Act.  Counsel  however, could not deny	that  the  detention
order was not approved by the State Government and that	 the
appellant's case was not placed before the Advisory Board.
    The	 first question to be decided therefore, is  whether
the  High  Court was right in dismissing the  writ  petition
holding that the rule or practice of the High Court in	such
a case was to interfere only where there were  extraordinary
or  special reasons and otherwise to leave the appellant  to
first surrender and then move a petition for habeas corpus.
    From  a  perusal of the Judgment of the  High  Court  it
appears that it analysed the question of maintainability  of
the writ petition from two view points, namely, of the	High
Court's	 power, and the High Court's rule or  practice.	 The
High Court correctly analysed the power of the High Court to
interfere in such a case under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_11">Article 226</a> of the  Constitu-
tion  of India concluding that the High Court had  power  to
interfere.  While tracing the High Court's evolving rule  or
practice, the Bench took the view that it was but  appropri-
ate and proper that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">112</span>
court evolved and followed a practice and procedure where it
would  not ordinarily entertain a challenge to a  preventive
detention  unless the person concerned submitted himself  to
the  order and not to encourage persons against whom  orders
of preventive detention were made by the competent authority
under  a valid enactment to avoid the process of law and  at
the  same time seek the protection of law from	this  Court.
Relying on several decisions of its own, the Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "There  is no presumption that any  and  every
	      order  of	 detention is bad. The	normal	rule
	      shall  therefore	be "surrender to  the  order
	      first  and then approach this Court." Only  in
	      extraordinary cases, where it appears that the
	      State is exercising its power under a  preven-
	      tive detention statute for an oblique purpose,
	      or in an outrageous and/or vindictive  manner,
	      or  where the order of detention is  ex
	      facie  invalid, would this Court	depart	from
	      this rule. Now, what would be such  extraordi-
	      nary  case cannot and, indeed, should  not  be
	      defined or specified. It is better left to the
	      sound judgment and decision of this Court."
    The	 High Court on facts of the appellant's	 writ  peti-
</blockquote><p id="p_9">tion, observed that the allegations that the entire adminis-
trative	 machinery  was being misused by the local  MLA	 who
happened to be a Cabinet Minister to hound the appellant and
that the Collector and District Magistrate was being used as
a tool were not correct and, therefore, said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "Once we are of the opinion that there are  no
	      extraordinary  or	 special reasons  to  depart
	      from the normal rule, we will not look into or
	      examine  the relevance or correctness  of	 the
	      grounds  as  we would do in a writ  of  habeas
	      corpus."
</blockquote><p id="p_10">The writ petition was accordingly dismissed.
    Mr. Bhandare submits that when the appellant's fundamen-
tal right to liberty was threatened through the	 machination
of  a  detention  order, he approached the  High  Court	 for
protection  and when despite the interim order of  the	High
Court  his fundamental right was violated by detaining	him,
after serving the order of detention on vague, stale, irrel-
evant and non-existent grounds, though he was released after
four  days, he ought not to have been denied relief  on	 the
ground	of there having evolved a practice or  procedure  of
the Court not to interfere in such a case except where there
were extraordinary or special reasons
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">113</span>
and  to	 leave the appellant to surrender and  then  move  a
petition  for habeas corpus. We find force in  this  submis-
sion.  As the detention order was already passed and  served
and  the  detenu was already taken into custody	 during	 the
pendency  of  the  writ petition,  these  subsequent  events
having	been brought to the notice of the court by  a  Misc.
application in the form of an Additional Affidavit--the same
ought to have been dealt with by the High Court.
    <a href="/doc/448997/" id="a_12">In Jayantilal Bhagwandas Shah v. The State of  Maharash</a>-
tra,  [1981]  1 Crl. L.J. 767, the  challenge  was  directed
towards orders of detention passed under the Conservation of
Foreign Exchange and <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_13">Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act</a>,
1974,  but the intended detenus under those orders were	 not
in  detention. The State having raised a preliminary  objec-
tion  to the maintainability of the petition on	 the  ground
that  the habeas corpus jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Art. 226</a>  of	 the
Constitution was exercisable only to examine the legality of
a  detention  where there was a detention and  in  no  other
case,  a  Division Bench of the Bombay High Court  took	 the
view  that though the writ of habeas corpus might be  issued
only  when there was actual illegal detention, that was	 not
to  say	 that  an illegal order of detention  could  not  be
successfully challenged.
</p><p id="p_11">In para 11 of the report, the Court held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Art.  226</a> is couched in language wide  enough
	      to  protect a person against an illegal  inva-
	      sion of his fight to freedom by protecting him
	      while still free and by regaining his  freedom
	      for  him	if he has  already  been  wrongfully
	      detained.	 We  cannot countenance and  do	 not
	      accept the Advocate General's submission	that
	      the  High Courts are impotent to	give  relief
	      against the prospect of illegal detention	 and
	      must  first  require the	intended  detenu  to
	      surrender	 to  the illegal detention.  We	 are
	      satisfied	 that the High Courts may under	 the
	      provisions  of  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Art. 226</a>	issue  a  direction,
	      order  and  writ	in the	nature	of  mandamus
	      and/or certiorari quashing an illegal order of
	      detention and may by direction, order and writ
	      in the nature of prohibition enjoin the person
	      threatening the illegal detention from execut-
	      ing the threat."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">Accordingly the Court held that it would intervene to strike
down  an illegal order of detention. If the court  could  in
matters	 of personal liberty intervene on the strength of  a
mere post-card, they surely could intervene on the  strength
of a petition, though they may seek the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">114</span>
wrong  relief or be phrased in the wrong form. The  position
of a person who is actually under illegal detention and of a
person who is in imminent jeopardy of illegal detention	 are
not far dissimilar. We are inclined to agree with this	view
as  we	feel that refusal to interfere in such	a  case	 may
amount to denial of the fundamental right itself.
    A  Full  Bench of the Gujarat High Court  in  <a href="/doc/458449/" id="a_17">Vedprakash
Devkinandan Chiripal v. State of Gujarat</a>, since reported  in
AIR  1987  Gujarat 253 where the petitioner was said  to  be
detained under the provisions of Prevention of	Blackmarket-
ing and maintenance of <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_18">Supply of Essential Commodities	Act</a>,
1980 and the petitioner having absconded, a notification was
issued	in  the official gazette as provided  under  <a href="/doc/1438357/" id="a_19">section
7(1)(b)</a>	 of the said Act and the person moved  the  petition
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution of India praying a	writ
of  habeas  corpus or a writ of mandamus, the  question	 was
whether the petition would be maintainable before the detenu
had  been  served with order of detention and had  been	 de-
tained in custody, answered the question in the affirmative.
Relying on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_21">A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras</a>,
AIR  1950 SC 27 and Addl. <a href="/doc/165099707/" id="a_22">District Magistrate,	Jabalpur  v.
Shivakant Shukla</a>, AIR 1976 SC 1207, the Full Bench took	 the
view  "that before detention, if writ of mandamus  is  moved
for  challenging unauthorised detention order which  is	 al-
ready  passed  on  the ground that the order  is  a  nullity
because it is passed (a) by an incompetent person or (b)  it
is  a  mala fide order or (c) it is contrary  to  the  legal
procedure  prescribed for passing such order, or (d)  it  is
otherwise  a  nullity  for any other  reason,  for  example,
passed	against a wrong person, it cannot be said that	such
challenge would be per se not maintainable." We are inclined
to agree inasmuch as it would be a challenge to an  existing
order  of detention which is posing an imminent threat to  a
fundamental right of the named person guaranteed under	Art.

exceptional and rare case, detention order already made, and
either	served or yet to be served, and the person is  still
free could not be legally brought under challenge.
    <a href="/doc/452476/" id="a_23">Article  226(1)</a>  of the Constitution of  India  notwith-
standing  anything  in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_24">Article 32</a>, empowers the	 High  Court
throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises
jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including
in  appropriate cases, any Government within those  territo-
ries  directions,  orders or writs, including writs  in	 the
nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto
and  certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of	 any
of  the rights conferred by Part III and for any other	pur-
pose; and it also envisages
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">115</span>
making	of interim orders, whether by way of  injunction  or
stay or in any other manner in such a proceeding. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_25">Article 21</a>
giving protection of life and personal liberty provides that
no person shall be deprived of his life or personal  liberty
except	according to procedure established by law.  For	 en-
forcement of one's right to life and personal liberty resort
to  <a href="/doc/452476/" id="a_26">Article 226(1)</a> has thus been provided for. What  is	 the
ambit  of enforcement of the right? The	 word  'enforcement'
has  also been used in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_27">Article 32</a> of the Constitution  which
provides  the remedy for enforcement of fights conferred  by
Part III of the Constitution. The word 'enforcement' has not
been  defined  by  the Constitution.  According	 to  Collins
English Dictionary to enforce means to ensure observance  of
or obedience to a law, decision etc. Enforcement,  according
to  Webster's  Comprehensive Dictionary, means	the  act  of
enforcing, or the state of being enforced, compulsory execu-
tion; compulsion. Enforce means to compel obedience to laws;
to compel performance, obedience by physical or moral force.
If enforcement means to impose or compel obedience to law or
to  compel  observance of law, we have to see what  it	does
precisely  mean. The right to life and personal liberty	 has
been guaranteed as a fundamental right and for its  enforce-
ment one could resort to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226</a> of the Constitution for
issuance of appropriate writ,' order or direction. Precisely
at  what stage resort to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> has been  envisaged  in
the  Constitution? When a right is so guaranteed, it has  to
be understood in relation to its orbit and its infringement.
Conferring  the right to life and liberty imposes  a  corre-
sponding  duty	on the rest of the  society,  including	 the
State, to observe that fight, that is to say, not to act  or
do  anything  which  would amount to  infringement  of	that
right, except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by
law.  In  other	 words, conferring the fight  on  a  citizen
involves the compulsion on the rest of the society,  includ-
ing  the State, not to infringe that right. The question  is
at what stage the right can be enforced? Does a citizen have
to  wait  till the right is infringed? Is there	 no  way  of
enforcement  of the right before it is	actually  infringed?
Can the obligation or compulsion on the part of the State to
observe the fight be made effective only after the right  is
violated  or  in other words can there be enforcement  of  a
fight  to  life and personal liberty before it	is  actually
infringed?  What  remedy will be left to a person  when	 his
right to life is violated? When a right is yet to be violat-
ed,  but is threatened with violation can the  citizen	move
the court for protection of the right? The protection of the
right is to be distinguished from its restoration or  remedy
after  violation. When right to personal liberty is  guaran-
teed  and the rest of the society, including the  State,  is
compelled  or  obligated not to violate that right,  and  if
someone	 has  threatened to violate it or its  violation  is
imminent,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">116</span>
and the person whose right is so threatened or its violation
so  imminent  resorts to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a>  of  the  Constitution,
could  not  the	 court protect observance of  his  right  by
restraining  those  who threatened to violate it  until	 the
court examines the legality of the action? Resort to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article
226</a> after the right to personal liberty is already  violated
is different from the pre-violation protection.	 Post-viola-
tion  resort to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> is for remedy against  violation
and  for restoration of the right, while pre-violation	pro-
tection	 is  by compelling observance of the  obligation  or
compulsion under law not to infringe the right by all  those
who  are so obligated or compelled. To surrender  and  apply
for  a writ of habeas corpus is a post-violation remedy	 for
restoration of the right which is not the same as  restrain-
ing  potential violators in case of threatened violation  of
the right. The question may arise what precisely may  amount
to threat or imminence of violation. Law surely cannot	take
action	for internal thoughts but can act only	after  overt
acts. If overt acts towards violation have already been done
and the same has come to the knowledge of the person threat-
ened  with that violation and he approaches the court  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Art. 226</a> giving sufficient particulars of proximate  actions
as  would imminently lead to violation of right, should	 not
the court call upon those alleged to have taken those  steps
to  appear and show cause why they should not be  restrained
from  violating that right? Instead of doing so would it  be
the proper course to be adopted to tell the petitioner	that
the court cannot take any action towards preventive  justice
until  his  right is actually violated whereafter  alone  he
could  petition for a writ of habeas corpus? In the  instant
case  when  the writ petition was pending in court  and	 the
appellant's right to personal liberty happened to be violat-
ed  by	taking	him into custody  in  preventive  detention,
though	he was released after four days, but could be  taken
into  custody  again, would it be proper for  the  court  to
reject	the  earlier  writ petition and tell  him  that	 his
petition  has become infructuous and he had  no	 alternative
but  to	 surrender and then petition for a  writ  of  habeas
corpus?	 The  difference of the two situations, as  we	have
seen,  have difference legal significance. If  a  threatened
invasion of a right is removed by restraining the  potential
violator from taking any steps towards violation, the rights
remain protected and the compulsion against its violation is
enforced.  If the right has already been violated,  what  is
left  is the remedy against such violation and for  restora-
tion of the right.

Suppl. 2 SCR 316, where the grievance of the petitioner	 was
that  the  Madras Marumakkathayam (Removal of  Doubts)	Act,
1955 (Act 32 of 1955),
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">117</span>
provided  in <a href="/doc/1144098/" id="a_34">section 2</a> of the Act that	notwithstanding	 any

stated	in  the section shall be deemed to be and  shall  be
deemed	always	to  have been properties  belonging  to	 the
tarwad to which the provisions of the Madras Marumakkathayam
Act,  1932  shall apply, and thus, unlike  other  Acts	that
contemplated  some further action to be taken by  the  State
after the enactment had come into force, automatically	took
away  or abridged a person's fundamental right (as right  to
property then was) immediately it came into force, a Consti-
tution	Bench of this Court speaking through Das  C.J.	held
that there was no reason why the aggrieved person should not
immediately be entitled to seek the remedy under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_35">Art. 32</a>  of
the  Constitution.  The argument that an  application  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_36">Art. 32</a> could not be maintained until the State had taken or
threatened  to take any action under the impugned law  which
again, if remedy to be taken would infringe the petitioner's
fundamental rights, was negatived by this Court holding that
in  cases  arising under those	enactments  the	 proprietors
could  invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_37">Art.  32</a>
when  the  State  did or threatened to	do  the	 overt	act,
(emphasis supplied). It was observed that quite	 conceivably
an  enactment may immediately on its coming into force	take
away  or abridge the fundamental rights of a person  by	 its
very terms and without any further overt act being done. The
impugned  Act was said to be an instance of such  enactment.
In such a case, it was held, the infringement of the  funda-
mental	right  was complete eo instanti the passing  of	 the
enactment  and, therefore, there could be no reason why	 the
person	so prejudicially affected by the law should  not  be
entitled immediately to avail himself of the  constitutional
remedy under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_38">Art. 32.</a> It was also observed that to say	that
a person, whose fundamental right had been infringed by	 the
mere  operation of an enactment, was not entitled to  invoke
the  jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_39">Art. 32</a>, for  the	 en-
forcement  of  his fight would be to deny the benefit  of  a
salutary  constitutional remedy which was itself his  funda-
mental right. The same reasoning is applicable to the  facts
of  the	 instant case inasmuch as the  detention  order	 was
already	 passed	 and served and the  appellant	was  already
taken  into  custody and though released after	4  days	 the
Government  could at any time cancel his release under	sec-
tion 15 of the Act.

less  than disobedience; that validity binds, and  continues
to bind, by virtue of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">119</span>
the very disposition made by the rule."
</p><p id="p_18">    Analytical positivist concept of right has been  differ-
ently  analysed. Hohfeld writing on fundamental	 legal	con-
cepts as applied in judicial reasoning analysis four  ideas.
One  of	 those is that a right may be claim-right. P  has  a
right to do X, it means to indicate that Q or everyone	else
has a duty to let P do X. The existence of such a duty gives
P  some sort of claim against Q. Claim-rights may be  either
in personam or in rem. A claim-right in personam  co-relates
to  a duty of a person, while claim-rights in rem  co-relate
to  duties in principle incumbent on everyone. A  right	 en-
joyed  by one thus co-relates to a duty on the part of	oth-
ers.
</p><p id="p_19">    In	Hans  Kelsen's analysis it is usual  to	 oppose	 the
concept	 of right to the concept of obligation and  to	cede
priority  of  rank to the former as we speak of	 rights	 and
duties. The behaviour of one individual that corresponds  to
the  obligated behaviour of the other is usually  designated
as  a  content of a 'right'-as an object of a  'claim'	that
corresponds  to	 the obligation. "The behaviour of  the	 one
individual  that corresponds to the obligated  behaviour  of
the other, particularly the claiming of the obligated  beha-
viour,	is designated as exercising a right." In case of  an
obligation  to tolerate something, the behaviour of the	 one
corresponding to the obligation of the other is spoken of as
'enjoyment' of the right. According to Kelsen the 'right' or
a 'claim' of an individual, is merely the obligation of	 the
other individual or individuals. When we speak of a right as
a  legally  protected interest, in the words of	 Kelsen,  it
refers	to  a right as the "reflex of a	 legal	obligation".
Right is often understood as a will power conferred by	law.
A  'right' in the sense is present if the conditions of	 the
sanction  that	constitutes a legal  obligation	 includes  a
motion,	 normally of the individual in relation to whom	 the
obligation  exists; the motion is aimed at the execution  of
the  sanction  and has the form of a  legal  action  brought
before the law applying organ. Then this organ may apply the
general norm to effectuate the fight, which is the reflex of
the  legal obligation by executing the sanction.  The  right
which is the reflex of legal obligation is equipped with the
legal  power of the entitled individual to bring about by  a
legal  action  the  execution of a sanction  as	 a  reaction
against the non-fulfilment of the obligation whose reflex is
his right; or as it is sometimes called, the enforcement  of
the fulfilment of this obligation. To make use of this legal
power of motion is exercise of the right. In this sense each
right of an individual contains a claim to the behaviour  of
another	 individual-namely  to that behaviour to  which	 the
second	individual is obligated toward the first; the  beha-
viour that constitutes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">120</span>
the  content  of  the legal obligation	identical  with	 the
reflex right. If an individual, towards which another  indi-
vidual	is obligated to a certain behaviour, does  not	have
the legal power to bring about by a legal action the  execu-
tion of a sanction as a reaction against the  non-fulfilment
of the obligation, then the act by which he demands  fulfil-
ment of the obligation has no specific legal effect; the act
is legally irrelevant, except for not being legally  prohib-
ited.  Therefore, a 'claim' as legally effective act  exists
only  when a law exists, which means that an individual	 has
the legal power. The subject of a right may be not only	 one
individual  but	 two or several individuals,  including	 the
State.
</p><p id="p_20">    In the language of Kelsen the right of an individual  is
either a mere reflex right--the reflex of a legal obligation
existing towards this individual; or a private right in	 the
technical sense--the legal power bestowed upon an individual
to  bring about by legal action the enforcement of the	ful-
filment	 of an obligation existing toward him, that is,	 the
legal power. From the above analysis it is clear that in the
instant case the appellant's fundamental right to liberty is
the reflex of a legal obligation of the rest of the society,
including  the State, and it is the appellant's legal  power
bestowed  upon	him  to bring about by a  legal	 action	 the
enforcement  of the fulfilment of that	obligation  existing
towards	 him. Denial of the legal action  would,  therefore,
amount to denial of his right of enforcement of his right to
liberty. A petition for a writ of habeas corpus would not be
a substitute for this enforcement.
</p><p id="p_21">    We,	 therefore, proceed to consider the merits  of	this
case instead of remanding to the High Court to avoid further
delay.
</p><p id="p_22">    Mr.	 Bhandare's submission is that the  detention  order
having not been approved by the State Government under	sub-
section (3) of <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_48">section 3</a> it had ceased to be in force  after
12 days of its being made. We find force in this  submission
on the facts of the case. <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_49">Section 3</a> of the Act provides	 the
power  to  make detention orders.  Sub-section	(1)  thereof
empowers  the  State Government to make a  detention  order.
Sub-section (2) empowers the State Government to authorise a
District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police to  exercise
the  powers conferred by sub-section (1) during such  period
as may be specified in the order not exceeding three  months
at the first instance with power to extend such period	from
time to time by any period not exceeding three months at any
one  time.  Admittedly,	 the impugned  detention  order	 was
passed	by  the District Magistrate in	exercise  of  powers
under <a href="/doc/1144098/" id="a_50">section 2</a>. Sub-section (3) is to the following effect:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">121</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "When any order is made under this section  by

	      order has been made and such other particulars
	      as  in  his  opinion, have a  bearing  on	 the
	      matter,  and  no such order  shall  remain  in
	      force  for  more than twelve  days  after	 the
	      making  thereof, unless, in the  meantime,  it
	      has been approved by the Government."</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">    Examining the records we find that before the High Court
in  the	 Misc.	case W.P.M.P.S.R. 51830 in the	form  of  an
Additional Affidavit at para 11 it was urged:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      "Apart from the infirmities stated above which
	      vitiate  the order, statutory  requirement  of

	      scribed time has not been complied with."</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">    In	the  counter affidavit filed by	 the  Collector	 and
District  Magistrate in the High Court to the writ  petition
as  well as the W.P.M.P., there was no reply to para  11  of
the  W.P.M.P. and it was nowhere stated that  the  detention
order was approved by the State Government. In this Court in
the Special Leave Petition Ground No. V is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      "The  Hon'ble  High  Court has  erred  in	 not
	      noting the infirmity in the order of detention

	      tion made by the District Magistrate, Cuddapah
	      was not obtained within the period of 12	days
	      as enjoined under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_51">section 3</a>
	      of the Act. The order is therefore non est  in
	      law."</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">    In	the Counter Affidavit of the Collector and  District
Magistrate  there was not even a whisper in denial  of	this
fact.
</p><p id="p_26">    The	 learned counsel for the respondents at the  heating
could  not deny before us that the detention order  had	 not
been  approved	by  the Government within 12  days.  On	 his
request	 time was granted to produce materials. He  has	 now
filed  reply affidavit on behalf of the respondents  to	 the
rejoinder  affidavit filed by the appellant.  Scanning	this
affidavit also we do not find any statement that the  deten-
tion order was approved. Though the learned counsel  submits
that it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">122</span>
approved, in view of the above affidavits it cannot be acted
upon. We have, therefore, no other alternative than to	hold
that the detention order had not been approved by the  State
Government  within 12 days of its being made. The result  is
that  the order could not claim in force more than  12	days
after making thereof and as such must be treated as to	have
ceased to be in force and non-existent thereafter.
    Mr. Bhandare then submits that the case of the appellant
was not at all referred to the Advisory Board under  <a href="/doc/1943863/" id="a_52">section

ion,  no  sufficient cause for the detention of	 the  person
concerned,  the Government shall revoke the detention  order
and cause the person to be released forthwith. Thus  <a href="/doc/1943863/" id="a_59">section
10</a> makes it mandatory for the Government to place the ground
on which the order has been made and the representation,  if
any made by the person affected by the order and in the case
where the order has been made by an officer also the  report
by officer under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_60">section 3</a>. This  section
prescribes  a period of 3 weeks from the date  of  detention
irrespective of whether the person continues to be in deten-
tion or not. Therefore, even though the detenu was released,
if  the detention order was in force, his case was  required
to be placed before the Advisory Board. This being a  manda-
tory provision and having not been complied with the  deten-
tion order even if
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">123</span>
otherwise  it was in force, cannot be said to have  been  in
force  after three weeks. Under <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_61">Article 22</a> of the  Constitu-
tion  of India a person cannot be kept in  detention  beyond
three months without referring his case to an Advisory Board
under  the appropriate law. In either case  the	 appellant's
case  having  not  been referred to an	Advisory  Board	 the
detention  order  cannot be said to have remained  in  force
after the statutory period. It is, therefore, not  necessary
to  go	into  the validity or otherwise of  the	 grounds  of
detention.
</p><p id="p_28">    In the result we set aside the impugned Judgment of	 the
High Court and hold that the detention order ceased to be in
force after 12 days of making thereof and even if it was  in
force  it  ceased to be in force for failure  to  refer	 the
appellant's  case  to Advisory Board within  the  time	pre-
scribed	 by  law;  and accordingly we quash  the  same.	 The
appeal is accordingly allowed.
</p><p id="p_29">    After  the Judgment was finalised, another affidavit  on
behalf	of the respondents affirmed by one belonging to	 the
office	of the Advocate-on-Record has been circulated.	This
affidavit  is  not acceptable. Even if it  was	accepted  it
would not affect the ultimate legal position.
