HEADNOTE:
     The  Legislature  of Bombay passed an Act	entitled  the
 Bombay	 Sales	Tax  Act, 1952, which imposed  (by  s.	5)  a
 general  tax  on every dealer whose turnover in  respect  of
 sales	within	the  State of Bombay  during  the  prescribed
 period	 exceeded Rs. 30,000 and (by s. 10) a special tax  on
 every	dealer whose turnover in respect of sales of  special
 goods	made  within the State of Bombay exceeded  Rs.	5,000
 during	 the prescribed period.	 The term 'sale' was  defined
 [in s. 2 (14)] as meaning any transfer of property in	goods
 for   cash   or   deferred   payment	or   other   valuable
 consideration,	  and  an  Explanation	to  this   definition
 provided that the sale of any goods which have actually been
 delivered in the State of Bombay, as a direct result of such
 sale for the purpose of consumption in the said State	shall
 be  deemed, for the purposes of the Act to have taken	place
 in  the  said	State  irrespective of the  fact  to  at  the
 property in the goods has, by reason of such sale, passed in
 139
 1070
 another State.	 Rules 5 and 6 of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules,
 1952, which were brought into force on the same day on which
 ss.  5	 and 10 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act came  into	force
 provided  for	the  deduction	of  the	 following  sales  in
 calculating  the  taxable turnover, viz., sales  which	 take
 place (a) in the course of the import of the goods into,  or
 the export of the goods out of, the territory of India,  and
 (b)  in the course of inter-State trade or  commerce  (being
 the  two kinds of sales referred to cl. (1)(b) and  cl.  (2)
 respectively  of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_4">art. 286</a> of the Constitution).  Rule 5  (2)
 (1),  however,	 required, as a condition  of  the  aforesaid
 deductions, that the goods should be consigned by a railway,
 'shipping or aircraft company or country boat registered for
 carrying  cargo  or  public motor transport  service  or  by
 registered  post.  In an application under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">art. 226</a>  of  the
 Constitution challenging the validity of the Act and praying
 inter	alia for a writ against the State of Bombay  and  the
 Collector  of	Sales  Tax,  Bombay,  restraining  them	 from
 enforcing  the	 provisions  of the Act, the  High  Court  of
 Bombay held that the definition of 'sale' in the Act was  so
 wide as to include the three categories of sale exempted  by
 <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_6">art.  286</a> of the Constitution from the imposition of tax  by
 the States, and as the Act imposed a tax on all such  sales,
 it was wholly void.  On appeal
      Held,  per (Patanjali Sastri C. J.,  Mukherjea,  Ghulam
 Hasan	and Bhagwati JJ.-Bose T. dissenting)-that the  Bombay
 Sales	Tax Act (XXIV of 1952) was not ultra vires the	State
 Legislature  on  the ground that it contravened <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_7">art.  14</a>  or
 <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_8">art.  286</a> of the Constitution.	 But clause (1)	 of  sub-rule
 (2) of Rule 5 of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1952, was ultra
 vires	in  so far as it provided that in  order  that	sales
 mentioned  in clause (1) (b) and clause (2) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_9">art.  286</a>  of
 the Constitution may be exempt from tax, the goods shall  be
 consigned  only  through  a railway,  shipping	 or  aircraft
 company  or  country boat registered for carrying  cargo  or
 public motor transport service or by registered post.	These
 provisions  of Rule 5 (2) (1) were, however, severable	 from
 the other provisions of the Act and could be ignored.
 Per Bose T.-The Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, is wholly	ultra
 vires.
 Per  Patanjali Sastri C.J., Mukherjea and Ghulam  Hasan  JJ.
 -<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_10">Article  286	(1)  (a)</a> of the Constitution  read  with  the
 Explanation  thereto and construed in the light of art,  301
 and  <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_11">art. 304</a> prohibits the taxation of sales	or  purchases
 involving interState elements by all States except the State
 in  which  the	 goods	are  delivered	for  the  purpose  of
 consumption  therein.	The latter State is left free to  tax
 such  sales  or purchases and it derives this power  not  by
 virtue of the Explanation to <a href="/doc/1232505/" id="a_12">art. 286 (1)</a> but under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_13">art. 246
 (3)</a>  read  with  entry 54 of List II.	 The  view  that  the
 Explanation does not deprive the State in which the property
 in   the  goods  passed,  of  its  taxing  power  and	 that
 consequently  both  the State in which the property  in  the
 goods passes and the State
 1O71
 in  which the goods are delivered for consumption  have  the
 power to tax, is not correct.
    (ii)The  expression	 "for the purpose of  consumption  in
 that State"in the Explanation to el. (1) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_14">art. 286</a> must be
 understood as having reference not merely to the  individual
 importer  or  purchaser but  as  contemplating	 distribution
 eventually to consumers in general within the State. and all
 buyers	 within	 the  State of delivery	 from  out-of  -State
 sellers, except those buying for re-export out of the State,
 would be liable to be taxed. by the State.
    (iii)  Clause  (2) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_15">art. 286</a> does not affect the	power
 of  the  State	 in which delivery of goods is	made  to  tax
 inter-State sales or purchases of the kind mentioned in  the
 Explanation  to el. (1).  The effect of the  Explanation  is
 that  such  transactions are saved from the ban  imposed  by
 <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_16">art. 286 (2).</a>
    (iv)   The	fact that sales which take place (a)  in  the
 course	 of  the import of the goods into, or export  of  the
 goods	out of, the territory of India and (b) in the  course
 of inter-State trade or commerce, are not expressly exempted
 by  the Bombay Sales Tax Act could not render the Act	ultra
 vires inasmuch as the Rules framed under the Act and brought
 into force simultaneously must be -read as a part of the Act
 and  Rules 5 and 6 of these Rules exempt such sales.	<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_17">Delhi
 Laws Act</a>, In re ([1951] S.C.R. 747) referred to.
   (v)	   The	fact that the Bombay Sales Tax Act  does  not
 expressly  exclude  from  its	operation  the	 transactions
 mentioned  in	<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_18">art. 286 (1) (a)</a> of the	 Constitution,	viz.,
 sales	and purchases outside the State, does not render  the
 Act  ultra vires inasmuch as, on a true construction of  the
 Explanation  to  <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_19">art.	286 (1) (a)</a>  sales  or	purchases  in
 respect  of goods delivered for consumption  outside  Bombay
 are  not  taxable under the Act, even if the  goods  are  in
 Bombay and the sale is effected there.
    (vi)   The	provisions of the charging <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_20">sections 5</a> and  <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_21">10</a>
 of  the Act fixing Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 5,000 as	 the  minimum
 taxable   turnover   for  general  tax	  and	special	  tax
 respectively  are not discriminatory and void under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_22">art.  14</a>
 read with <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_23">art. 13</a> of the Constitution as such	classfication
 is perfectly reasonable and no discrimination is involved in
 it.
    (vii)  Taxing statutes imposing tax on subjects divisible
 in  their  nature  which do not  exclude  in  express	terms
 subjects  exempted by the Constitution, should not for	 that
 reason be declared wholly ultra vires and void, for, in such
 case  it  is  always feasible to separate  taxes  levied  on
 authorised  subjects from those levied on exempted  subjects
 and  to exclude the latter - in the assessment to  tax.   In
 such  cases the statute itself should be allowed  to  stand,
 the  taxing  authority being prevented	 by  injunction	 from
 imposing the tax on subjects exempted by the Constitution.

Bowman	v. Continental Co. (256 U.<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_24"> S. 642</a>; 65 L.  Ed.
 1130) relied on, <a href="/doc/208970/" id="a_25">Punjab Province v. Daulat Singh and Another</a>
 ([1942] F.C.R. 67) distinguished.
      (viii)A  sale "in the course of inter-State  trade"  in
 <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_26">art. 286 (2)</a> of the Constitution includes a sale by a trader
 in one State to a consumer in another State.  The expression
 is not confined to sales between two traders only.
     (ix)The expression "for such State or any part thereof"
 in <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_27">art. 246(3)</a> of the Constitution cannot be taken to import
 into  entry 54 of List II the restriction that the  sale  or
 purchase referred to must take place within the territory of
 that  State.	All that it means is that the  laws  which  a
 State is empowered to make must be for the purposes of	 that
 State.
      (x)It is always desirable when relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">art. 226</a> is
 sought on allegations of infringement of fundamental rights,
 that  the Court should satisfy itself that such  allegations
 are well founded before proceeding further with the matter.
       Bose J.-(1) <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_29">Article 286 (2)</a> cannot be construed in the
 light	of  <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_30">art.  304  (1)</a> as  the  two	 articles  deal	 with
 different matters.
     (ii)The  basic idea underlying <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_31">art. 286</a> is	 to  prohibit
 taxation in the case of inter-State trade and commerce until
 the  ban  under  el. (2) of the said article  is  lifted  by
 Parliament,  and always in the case of imports and  exports.
 When  the' ban is lifted, the Explanation to cl. (1) of  286
 comes	into play to determine the situs of the	 sale.	 This
 Explanation  does not govern el. (2) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_32">art. 286</a> and, as  it
 can  only apply to transactions which in truth and  in	 fact
 take place in the course of inter-State trade and  commerce,
 there is no need to call it in aid until the ban is removed.
      (iii)Explanation (2) to the definition of sale in<a href="/doc/1020147/" id="a_33"> s.  2</a>
 (14) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, which embodies	 word
 for  word the provisions of the Explanation to <a href="/doc/1232505/" id="a_34">art. 286  (1)</a>
 directly  offends  cl. (2) of the said article	 as  the  ban
 under el. (2) has not been lifted by the Parliament.
 (iv)Assuming that the Bombay Sales Tax Rules exclude
 all   sales  which  are  exempt  from	taxation  under	  the
 Constitution,	they cannot save the Act, for the  Rules  are
 made by a subordinate authority which is not the legislature
 and the validity of an Act of the legislature cannot be made
 to  depend on what a subordinate authority choses to  do  or
 not to do.
      (v)The good portion of the Act cannot be separated from
 the  bad in this case, even if the Explanation to<a href="/doc/1020147/" id="a_35"> s. 2</a>	 (14)
 is expunged and the whole Act is therefore ultra vires.
 Bhagwati J.-(1) Under the general law relating to  sale
 of goods, a sale must be regarded as having "taken  place"in
 the State in which the property in the goods sold has passed
 to the
 1073
 purchaser  and	 that State is entitled to tax	the  sale  or
 purchase  as  having  taken place  inside  the	 State.	  The
 Explanation  to  <a href="/doc/1232505/" id="a_36">art. 286 (1)</a> does not take away  the	right
 which	the State in which the property in the	goods  passed
 has to tax the sale or purchase but only deems such purchase
 or  sale,  by a legal fiction, to have taken  place  in  the
 State	in which the delivery of the goods has been made  for
 consumption  therein so as to enable the latter State	also,
 to  tax the sale or purchase in question.   The  Explanation
 only  lifts  the ban imposed by cl. (1) (a) on	 taxation  of
 sales	or purchases which take place outside the  State,  to
 the extent of the transactions mentioned in the  Explanation
 to enable the delivery State also to tax them.
      (ii) Delivery   of  the  goods  for  the	 purpose   of
 consumption  in  the delivery State means delivery  for  the
 purpose  of  use  by the-consumers,  and  does	 not  include
 delivery to a dealer purchasing the goods across the  border
 for  dealing with or disposing of the same in	the  ordinary
 course	 of  trade,  and  the Explanation  to  <a href="/doc/1232505/" id="a_37">art.  286  (1)</a>
 therefore only covers those cases where, as a direct  result
 of the sale or purchase, goods are delivered for consumption
 in the delivery State by the consumer and the delivery State
 can  tax only this limited class of transactions  under  the
 Explanation.
     (iii) The	general	 provision enacted in  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_38">art.  286  (2)</a>
 against  the imposition -of tax on the sale or	 purchase  of
 goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce  should
 give  way to the special provision which is enacted  in  the
 Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_39">art. 286 (1) (a)</a> enabling the delivery	State
 to  tax such sale or purchase in the limited class of	cases
 covered by the Explanation, the transactions covered by  the
 Explanation  being  thus  lifted  out	of  the	 category  of
 transactions in the course of inter-State trade or  commerce
 and  assimilated to transactions of sale or  purchase	which
 take  place  inside  the State and thus  invested  with  the
 character  of an intra-state sale or purchase so far as  the
 delivery State is concerned.

legislative  power by <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_50">article 286</a> of the  Constitution.	  It

obtain	a licence in some others as a condition of  carrying
on  their business, infringed the fundamental rights of	 the
respondents under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_53">article 19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_13">      In  the  affidavit  filed	 in  answer  the  appellants
traversed  the	allegations in the petition  and  contended,
inter  alia, that the Act was a complete code  and  provided
for special machinery for dealing with all questions arising
under  it,  including questions of  constitutionality,	and,
therefore,  the	 petition  was not  maintainable,  that	 the
present	 ease was not an appropriate one for the issue of  a
writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_54">article 226</a> as the validity of the imposition  of
a tax was questioned, that no assessment proceedings  having
been initiated against the respondents and no demand  notice
having been issued, the respondents had no cause of  action,
and that, properly construed, the Act and the Rules did	 not
contravene  <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_55">article  286</a>  or any  other	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution  and did not infringe any fundamental right  of
the respondents,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">1076</span>
The petition was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court
consisting  of Chagla C. J. and Dixit J. Chagla C.  J.,	 who
delivered  the judgment, Dixit J. concurring, overruled	 the
preliminary objection disdistinguishing the decisions  cited
in support thereof by pointing out that the principle that a
court  would not issue a prerogative writ when	an  adequate
alternative  remedy was available could not apply where,  as
here, a party came to the court with an allegation that	 his
fundamental  rights  had been infringed	 and  sought  relief
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_56">article 226.</a>  The learned Judges however thought,  in
view  of the conclusion they had come to on the question  of
competency of the State Legislature to pass the Act, it	 was
"not necessary to consider the challenge that has been	made
to  the	 Act  under articles 14 and  19"  and  expressed  no
opinion	 on  the alleged infringement  of  the	respondents'
fundamental rights.
</p><p id="p_14">     On	 the  merits,  the  learned  Judges  held  that	 the
definition  of "sale" in the Act was so wide as	 to  include
the  three categories of sale exempted by <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_57">article  286</a>	from
the  imposition	 of  sales tax by the States,  and,  as	 the
definition governed the charging <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_58">sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_59">10</a>, the	 Act
must  be  taken	 to impose the tax' on such  sales  also  in
contravention  of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_60">article 286.</a>	<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_61">The Act</a> must, therefore,  be
declared  wholly  void,	 it being impossible  to  sever	 any
specific  offending provision so as to save the rest of	 the
Act, as "the definition pervades the whole Act and the whole
scheme of the Act is bound up with the definition of  sale".
The  learned Judges rejected the argument that the  Act	 and
the Rules must be read together to see whether the State has
made  a law imposing a tax in contravention of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_62">article	286</a>,
remarking  that "if the Act itself is bad,, the rules,	made
under  it  cannot have any greater efficacy".  Nor  was	 the
Government, which was authorised to make rules for  carrying
out  the purpose of the Act, under an obligation to  exclude
the exempted sales.  The rules, too, did not exclude all the
three categories of exempted sales but only two of them, and
even such exclusion was hedged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">1077</span>
    In view of the importance of the issues involved, notice
of  the appeal was issued to the AdvocatesGeneral of  States
under  Order  XLI, Rule 1, and many of them  intervened	 and
appeared before us.  The Attorney-General of India, to	whom
notice	was also sent, intervened on behalf of the Union  of
India.	 We have thus had the assistance of a full  argument
dealing with all aspects of the case.
</p><p id="p_15">    The	 Advocate-General of Bombay, appearing on behalf  of
the appellants, took strong exception to the manner in which
the  learned Judges below disposed of the objection  to	 the
maintainability of the petition.  He complained that, having
entertained the petition on the ground that infringement  of
fundamental  rights was alleged, and that the  remedy  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_63">article 226</a> was, therefore, appropriate, the learned  Judges
issued a writ without finding that any fundamental right had
in  fact been infringed.  Learned counsel for the  State  of
West  Bengal  also represented that parties  in	 that  State
frequently  got	 petitions  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_64">article  226</a>	admitted  by
alleging violation of some fundamental right, and the  court
sometimes issued the writ asked for without insisting on the
allegation  being substantiated.  We are of opinion that  it
is always desirable, when relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_65">article 226</a> is sought
on  allegations of infringement of fundamental rights,	that
the  court should satisfy itself that such  allegations	 are
well founded before proceeding further with the matter.	  In
the  present  case,  however, the  appellants  can  have  no
grievance, as the respondents' allegation of infringement of
their  fundamental right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_66">article 19 (1) (g)</a> was  based
on  their contention that the Act was ultra vires the  State
Legislature,  and that contention having been  accepted,  by
the  Court  below, there would clearly	be  an	unauthorised
restriction  on	 the respondents' right to  carry  on  their
trade,	registration  and  licence being  required  only  to
facilitate collection of the tax imposed. As Mr. Seervai for
the  respondents rightly submitted, the fact that the  Court
below  left  the question undecided, though  the  point	 was
concluded by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">140</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">1078</span>
decision  of this Court in <a href="/doc/154519/" id="a_67">Mohammad Yasin v. The  Town	Area
Committee, Jalalbad</a> (1), which was  brought to the notice of
the learned Judges, was not the fault of the respondents and
gave no real cause for complaint.
</p><p id="p_16">   Before considering whether the appellant State has made a
law  imposing,	or authorising the imposition of, a  tax  on
sales  or purchases of goods in disregard of  constitutional
restrictions on its legislative power in that behalf, it  is
necessary  to  ascertain  the scope of such  power  and	 the
nature	and  extent of the restrictions placed	upon  it  by
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_68">article 286.</a>  The power is conferred by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_69">article 246 (3)</a> read
with  entry  54 of List 11 of the Seventh  Schedule  to	 the
Constitution.  The Legislature of any State has, under these
provisions, the exclusive power to make laws "for such State
or  any part thereof" with respect to "taxes on the sale  or
purchase  of goods other than newspapers".   The  expression
"for such State or any part thereof" cannot, in our view, be
taken to import into entry 54 the restriction that the	sale
or purchase referred to must take place within the territory
of  that State.	 All that it means is that the laws which  a
State is empowered to make must be for the purposes of	that
State.	 As pointed out by the Privy Council in the  Wallace
Brothers  case	(2) in dealing with the	 competency  of	 the
Indian	Legislature  to	 impose tax on	the  income  arising
abroad to a non-resident foreign company, the constitutional
validity  of the relevant statutory provisions did not	turn
on  the possession by the legislature  of  extra-territorial
powers	but  on the existence of  a  sufficient	 territorial
connection  between  the taxing State and what it  seeks  to
tax.  In the case of sales-tax it is not necessary that	 the
sale  or purchase should take place within  the	 territorial
limits of the State in the sense that all the ingredients of
a  sale	 like the agreement to sell, the passing  of  title,
delivery  of  the  goods, etc., should	have  a	 territorial
connection   with  the	State.	 Broadly   speaking,   local
activities  of buying or selling carried on in the State  in
relation  to  local  goods would be a  sufficient  basis  to
sustain the taxing power of the State, provided of  course,'
such
(1) [1952] S.C.R. 572.
</p><p id="p_17">(2) [1948] S.C.R. I
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">1079</span>
activities  ultimately	resulted  in  a	 concluded  sale  or
purchase to be taxed.
</p><p id="p_18">   In exercise of the legislative power conferred upon	them
in  substantially similar terms by the Government  of  India
Act,  1935,  the Provincial Legislatures  enacted  sales-tax
laws for their respective Provinces, acting on the principle
of territorial nexus referred to above; that is to say, they
picked	out  one or more of the ingredients  constituting  a
sale and made them the basis of their sales-tax legislation.
Assam  and  Bengal  made  among	 other	things	the   actual
existence  of the goods in the Province at the time  of	 the
contract of sale the test of taxability.  In Bihar the	pro-
duction or manufacture of the goods in the Province was made
an additional ground.  A net of the widest range perhaps was
laid  in Central Provinces and Bert where it was  sufficient
if  the goods were actually "found" in the Province  at	 any
time  after  the  contract of sale or  purchase	 in  respect
thereof was made.  Whether the territorial nexus put forward
as  the	 basis	of the taxing power in each  case  would  be
sustained  as  sufficient was a matter of doubt	 not  having
been  tested in a court of law.	 And such claims  to  taxing
power  led to multiple taxation of the same  transaction  by
different  Provinces  and cumulation of the  burden  falling
ultimately on the consuming public.  This situation posed to
the  Constitution  makers  the problem	of  restricting	 the
taxing	power  on sales or purchases  involving	 inter-State
elements,  and alleviating the tax burden on  the  consumer.
At the same time they were evidently anxious to maintain the
State  power of imposing non-discriminatory taxes  on  goods
imported  from	other States, while upholding  the  economic
unity  of India by providing for the freedom of	 inter-State
trade  and  commerce.	In their attempt  to  harmonise	 and
achieve	 these somewhat conflicting objectives they  enacted
articles 286, 301 an 304.  These articles read as follows:
</p><p id="p_19">     286. (1)  No law of a State shall impose, or  authorise
the  imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase  of  goods
where such sale or purchase takes place-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">1080</span>
<p id="p_20">(a)  outside the State ; or
</p><p id="p_21">(b)  in	 the  course of the import of the  goods  into,	 nor
export of the goods out of, the territory of India.
   Explanation.-For  the purposes of sub-clause (a), a	sale
or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State
in which the goods have actually been delivered as a  direct
result	of  such  sale	or  purchase  for  the	purpose	  of
consumption  in	 that State, notwithstanding the  fact	that
under the general law relating to sale of goods the property
in  the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase  passed
in another State.
</p><p id="p_22">    (2)	  Except  in  so  far  as  Parliament  may  by	 law
otherwise  provide,  no	 law of a  State  shall	 impose,  or
authorise  the imposition of, a tax on the sale or  purchase
of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in	 the
course of inter-State trade or commerce :
</p><p id="p_23">    Provided that the President may by order direct that any
tax  on	 the  sale  or purchase of  goods  which  was  being
lawfully  levied by the Government of any State	 immediately
before	 the  commencement  of	this   Constitution   shall,
notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is  contrary
to  the	 provisions of this clause, continue  to  be  levied
until the thirty-first day of March, 1951.
    (3)	  No  law  made by the Legislature of  a  State	 im-
posing, or authorising the imposition of, a tax on the	sale
or  purchase  of  any such goods as have  been	declared  by
Parliament  by	law  to be essential for  the  life  of	 the
community shall have effect unless it has been reserved	 for
the  consideration  of the President and  has  received	 his
assent.
</p><p id="p_24">    301,  Subject  to  the other provisions  of	 this  Part,
trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory  of
India shall be free.
</p><p id="p_25">     304. Notwithstanding anything in <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_70">article 301</a> or <a href="/doc/1327219/" id="a_71">article   303</a>,
the Legislature of a State may by law-
</p><p id="p_26">    (a)	  impose on goods imported from other States any tax
to which similar goods manufactured or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">1081</span>
produced  in that State are subject, so, however, as not  to
discriminate  between  goods  so imported  and	goods,&amp;,  so
manufactured or produced; and
</p><p id="p_27">    (b)	  impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom
of trade, commerce or intercourse with or within that  State
as may be required in the public interest:
</p><p id="p_28">   Provided  that no Bill or amendment for the	purposes  of
clause	(b) shall be introduced or moved in the	 Legislature
of a State without the previous sanction of the President.
   It  will be seen that the principle of freedom of  inter-
State  trade  and  commerce  declared  in  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_72">article  301</a>	  is
expressly  subordinated to the State power of  taxing  goods
imported from sister States, provided only no discrimination
is  made in favour of similar goods of local  origin.	Thus
the  States  in India have full power of  imposing  what  in
American  State	 legislation is -called the use	 tax,  gross
receipts  tax,	etc. not to speak of the  familiar  property
tax, subject only to the condition that such tax is  imposed
on  all goods of the same kind produced or  manufactured  in
the  taxing  State, although such  taxation  is	 undoubtedly
calculated  to	fetter inter-State trade and  commerce.	  In
other  words, the commercial unity of India is made to	give
way  before  the State-power of imposing "  any	 "  non-dis-
criminatory tax on goods imported from sister States.
    Having  thus  provided for the  freedom  of	 inter-State
trade  and commerce subject to the  important  qualification
mentioned  above,  the authors of the  Constitution  had  to
devise a formula of restrictions to be imposed on the State-
power  of  taxing sales or purchases  involving	 inter-State
elements  which	 would	avoid the  doubts  and	difficulties
arising	 out  of  the imposition of sales-tax  on  the	same
transaction  by	 several  Provincial  Legislatures  in	 the
country	 before the commencement of the Constitution.	This
they did by enacting clause (1) (a) with the Explanation and
clause	(2)  of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_73">article 286.</a>  Clause (1) (a)  prohibits	 the
taxation of all sales or purchases which take place  outside
the State,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">1082</span>
but  a localised sale is a troublesome concept, for, a	sale
is  a  composite transaction involving as  it  does  several
elements  such as agreement to sell, transfer of  ownership,
payment	 of the price, delivery of the goods and. so  forth,
which may take place at different places.  How, then, is  it
to be determined whether a particular sale or purchase	took
place within or outside the State ?  It is difficult to	 say
that  any  one of the ingredients mentioned  above  is	more
essential  to a sale or purchase than the others.  To  solve
the  difficulty	 an easily applicable test  for	 determining
what  is an outside sale had to be formulated, and  that  is
what,  in our opinion, the Explanation was intended  to	 do.
It  provides by means of a legal fiction that the  State  in
which the goods sold or purchased are actually delivered for
consumption  therein  is  the State in	which  the  sale  or
purchase   is  to  be  considered  to  have   taken   place,
notwithstanding the property in such goods passed in another
State.	Why an " outside " sale or purchase is explained  by
defining what is an inside sale, and why actual delivery and
consumption in the State are made the determining factors in
locating a sale or purchase will presently appear.  The test
of  sufficient	territorial  nexus was thus  replaced  by  a
simpler	 and  more  easily  workable  test:  Are  the  goods
actually  delivered in the taxing State, as a direct  result
of  a  sale  or purchase, for  the  purpose  of	 consumption
therein	 ?  Then, such sale or purchase shall be  deemed  to
have taken place in that State and outside all other States.
The  latter  States are prohibited from taxing the  sale  or
purchase; the former alone is left free to do so.   Multiple
taxation of the same transaction by different States is also
thus avoided.
</p><p id="p_29">     It	 is,  however, argued on behalf of Bombay  that	 the
Explanation  does not say that the State of delivery is	 the
only State in which the sale or purchase shall be deemed  to
have taken place.  If that was the intention, it would	have
been  easy to say so.  On the other hand,  the	non-obstante
clause	in the Explanation is said to indicate	that,  apart
from  cases  covered by the legal fiction,  the	 passing  of
property  in  the goods is to determine the place  of  sale.
Thus, both the State of delivery
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">	       1083</span>
and the State in which the property in the goods sold passes
are,  it  is claimed, empowered to tax.	 We  are  unable  to
accept this view.  It is really not necessary in the context
to use the word " only " in the way suggested, for, when the
Explanation says that a sale or purchase shall be deemed  to
have  taken place in a particular State, it follows that  it
shall  be deemed also to have taken place outside the  other
States.	  Nor can the non-obstante clause be  understood  as
implying that, under the general law relating to the sale of
goods,	the  passing  of the property in the  goods  is	 the
determining factor in locating a sale or purchase.   Neither
the  Sale  of Goods Act nor the common law relating  to	 the
sale of goods has anything to say as to what the situs of  a
sale  is,  though  certain rules have  been  laid  down	 for
ascertaining the intention of the contracting parties as  to
when  or under what conditions the property in the goods  is
to  pass to the buyer.	That question often raises  ticklish
problems for lawyers and courts, and to make the passing  of
title  the determining factor in the location of a  sale  or
purchase   would  be  to  replace  old	 uncertainties	 and
difficulties  connected with the nexus basis with new  ones.
Nor  would the hardship of multiple taxation be obviated  if
two  States were still free to impose tax on the same  tran-
saction.   In  our  opinion,  the  non-obstante	 clause	 was
inserted  in the Explanation simply with a view to  make  it
clear beyond all possible doubt that it was immaterial where
the  property in the goods passed, as it might otherwise  be
regarded as indicative of the place of sale.
   It  is also to be noted in this connection that,  on	 the
construction  suggested by the Advocate-General	 of  Bombay,
namely, that the Explanation was not intended to deprive the
State  in  which  the property in the goods  passed  of	 its
taxing power, but only to exclude the sales or purchases  of
the kind described in the Explanation from the operation  of
clause (1) (a) which prohibits taxation of outside sales  or
purchases,   the  Explanation  would  operate,	not  as	  an
explanation,  but  as  an exception or	a  proviso  to	that
clause.	 It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">1084</span>
may  be	 that  the  description of  a  provision  cannot  be
decisive  of its true meaning or interpretation	 which	must
depend	 on   the  words  used	therein,   but,	  when	 two
interpretations are sought to be put upon a provision,	that
which fits the description which the legislature has  chosen
to   apply   to	 it  is,  according  to	 sound	 canons	  of
construction,  to  be  adopted provided, of  course,  it  is
consistent with the language employed, in preference to	 the
one  which  attributes to the provision a  different  effect
from what it should have according to its description by the
legislature.
</p><p id="p_30">     It	 was  then  said that the formula  of  delivery	 for
consumption  within  a	State  could  only  cover  the	com-
paratively  few	 cases of sales or  purchases  taking  place
directly  between  the consumers in the delivery  State	 and
dealers in other States, and inter-State sales or  purchases
between	 dealers  in either State, which must be  larger  in
number	and volume, would still be outside the scope of	 the
Explanation, which could not, therefore, have been  intended
to  empower only one State, namely, the delivery  State,  to
tax all inter-State sales or purchases.	 We see no force  in
this objection.	 It is to be noted that the Explanation does
not  say  that the consumption should be  by  the  purchaser
himself.   Nor	do  the	 words "as  a  direct  result"	have
reference to consumption.  They qualify " actual delivery ".
The  expression	 " for the purpose of  consumption  in	that
State  "  must,	 in our opinion,  be  understood  as  having
reference not merely to the individual importer or purchaser
but as contemplating distribution eventually to consumers in
general within the State.  Thus all buyers within the  State
of  delivery from out-of-State sellers, except those  buying
for  re-export out of the State, would be within  the  scope
of-the	Explanation and liable to be taxed by the  State  on
their  inter-State  transactions.  It should  be  remembered
here that the Explanation deals only with interState  sales.
or   purchases	and  not  with	purely	local  or   domestic
transactions.  That these are subject to the taxing power of
the State has never been questioned.
</p><p id="p_31">   We are therefore of opinion that <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_74">article 286 (1) (a)</a> read
with the Explanation prohibits taxation of sales
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">1085</span>
or  purchases involving inter-State elements by	 all  States
except	the State in which the goods are delivered  for	 the
purpose of consumption therein in the wider sense  explained
above.	 The latter State is left free to tax such sales  or
purchases,  which  power  it derives not by  virtue  of	 the
Explanation but under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_75">article 246 (3)</a> read with entry 54  of
List II.
</p><p id="p_32">    We will now consider the effect of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_76">article 286(2)</a> on the
taxability  of	inter-State sales or purchases of  the	kind
envisaged by the Explanation to clause (1) (a).	 As both the
Explanation  and  clause  (2)  deal  only  with	 inter-State
transactions,  it  may appear at first blush  that  whatever
taxing power the Explanation may have reserved to the  state
of  delivery is nullified by clause (2), at any	 rate  until
Parliament chooses to lift the ban under the power  reserved
to  it	by the opening words of clause (2).  As one  way  of
avoiding  this	result I it was suggested by  the  Advocate-
Gneral of Bombay that the expression "inter-State trade	 and
commerce" in clause (2) may be construed as meaning dealings
between	 a trader in one State and a trader in	another,  so
that  the  clause  would  be applicable	 only  to  sales  or
purchases  in the course of dealings between  such  traders.
The ban under clause (2) could not in that view, affect	 the
taxability of a sale by a trader in one State to a  consumer
or  user in another.  We cannot agree with this	 restrictive
interpretation	of  the expression " inter-State  trade	 and
commerce".   The sale by a trader in one State to a user  in
another would be a sale "in the course of inter-State trade"
according to the natural meaning of those words, and we	 can
see  no	 reason	 for  importing	 the  restriction  that	 the
transaction  should be one between two traders	only.	This
is,  however,  not  to say that the  ban  under	 clause	 (2)
extends to the taxing power which the delivery State is left
free, under the Explanation, to exercise.  We are of opinion
that the operation of clause (2) stands excluded as a result
of  the	 legal fiction enacted in the explanation,  and	 the
State  in  which  the goods  are;'  actually  delivered	 for
consumption   can  impose  tax	on;  inter-State  sales	  or
purchases.  The effect of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">141</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">1086</span>
   Explanation in regard to inter-State dealings is, in	 our
view,  to invest what, in truth, is an inter-State  transac-
tion  with an intrastate character in relation to the  State
of  delivery,  and  clause  (2)	 can,  therefore,  have	  no
application.   It  is  true that the  legal  fiction  is  to
operate " for the purposes of sub-clause (a) of clause (1)",
but  that means merely that the Explanation is	designed  to
explain the meaning of the expression "outside the State" in
clause	(1) (a).  When once, however, it is determined	with
the  aid  of the fictional test that a	particular  sale  or
purchase  has  taken  place  within  the  taxing  State,  it
follows,  as  a corollary, that the  transaction  loses	 its
inter-State  character	and  falls outside  the	 purview  of
clause (2), not because the definition in the Explanation is
used for the purpose of clause (2), but because such sale or
purchase  becomes  in  the eye of the  law  a  purely  local
transaction.  It is said that even though all the  essential
ingredients  of a sale took place within one State  and	 the
sale was, in that sense, a purely intrastate transaction, it
might  involve	transport  of the goods	 across	 the  State-
boundary,  and that would be sufficient to bring  it  within
the scope of clause (2).  We find it difficult to appreciate
this argument.	As already stated, the Explanation envisages
sales  or  purchases  under  which  out-of-State  goods	 are
imported  into	the State.  That is  the  essential  element
which makes such a transaction inter-State in character, and
if  it	is  turned into an  intrastate	transaction  by	 the
operation of the legal fiction which blots out from view the
inter-State  element  , it is not logical to  say  that	 the
transaction, though now become local and domestic in the eye
of  the law, still retains its inter-State  character.	 The
statutory fiction completely masks the inter-State character
of  the	 sale or purchase which, as a collateral  result  of
such making, falls out;side the scope of clause (2).
It  is	said  that, on this view, clause  (2)  would  become
practically  redundant,	 as  clause (1) (a)  read  with	 the
explanation  as	 construed  by	us  would  itself   preclude
taxation  by other States of inter-State sales or  purchases
of the kind referred to in the explanation.  As
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">1087</span>
   We  have  already pointed out, the Explanation  does	 not
cover  cases of inter-State sales or purchases	under  which
the goods are imported into the State for reexport to  other
States	and possibly other categories of sales or  purchases
which	do   not  satisfy  all	the  requirements   of	 the
explanation.   Whether	such transactions  are	sufficiently
numerous for the Constitution to take note of is a matter of
opinion	 and it cannot have much bearing on the question  of
construction.
</p><p id="p_33">On  the	 other	hand  there are,  in  our  judgment,  cogent
considerations	which  tend  to support	 the  view  we	have
expressed  above that clause (2) was not intended to  affect
the power of the delivery State to tax inter-State sales  or
purchases  of the kind mentioned in the Explanation.  As  we
have  seen, in our Constitution the principle of freedom  of
inter-State  trade and commerce is made to give	 way  before
the  State-power  of imposing  non-discriminatory  taxes  on
goods  imported from other States.  Now, <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_77">article  286(2)</a>  is
but one phase of the protection accorded to interState trade
and commerce from the fettering power of State taxation.  As
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_78">article	 286</a>  deals with restrictions on the  power  of	 the
States	to impose tax on the sale or purchase of goods,	 the
Constitution makers evidently thought that it should contain
also a specific provision safeguarding sales or purchases of
an  inter-State	 character against the taxing power  of	 the
States.
</p><p id="p_34">It  is however, reasonable to suppose that  this  particular
form  of  protection  to  inter-State  trade  and   commerce
provided in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_79">article 286(2)</a> was not intended to have a  wider
operation  than	 what  is contemplated in  Part	 XIII  which
declares  the  general principle of freedom  of	 inter-State
commerce   and	 defines  the  measure	 of   constitutional
protection it should enjoy.  If such protection is  intended
to give way before the State-power of taxing goods  imported
from  sister States, subject only to the  condition  against
discrimination,	 it  is legitimate to suppose that  the	 ban
under  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_80">article	286(2)</a> should not operate so as	 to  nullify
that   power.	True,  <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_81">article	304  (a)</a>  deals	  with	 the
restrictions as to imposition of tax on goods, while article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">286</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">1088</span>
deals with the restrictions as to imposition of tax on sales
or  purchases  of goods.  But this distinc  tion  loses	 its
practical importance in the case of sales-tax imposed by the
delivery  State	 under	the  conditions	 mentioned  in	 the
Explanation,  for,  if	we look behind	the  labels  at	 the
substance  of  the matter, it becomes clear that  a  tax  on
sales  or purchases imposed by the State in which the  goods
are   delivered	 for  consumption,  in	the  sense   already
explained,    is,    in	   economic    effect	 practically
indistinguishable  from a tax on the consumption or  use  of
the  goods.   The words " in which the goods  have  actually
been  delivered " ensure that the goods have come  into	 the
State,	and the expression " for the purpose of	 consumption
in the State" shows that, though the tax is formally laid on
sales, its incidence is aimed at the consumers in the State.
Discussing the true nature of a duty of excise and a tax  on
the  sale  of  goods, Gwyer C. J. observed  in	the  Central
Provinces  and	Berar Sales Tax case (1) : "  It  is  common
ground	that  the  Court is entitled to	 look  at  the	real
substance  of the Act imposing it, at what it does  and	 not
merely	at  what  it says, in order to	ascertain  the	true
nature	of the tax.  Since writers on political economy	 are
agreed	that  taxes on the sale of  commodities	 are  simply
taxes  on  the	commodities themselves, it  is	possible  to
regard	a  tax	on  the retail sale  of	 motor	spirit	-and
lubricants  as	a  tax on  those  commodities".	  Therefore,
sales-tax, the incidence of which is really directed against
the consumer, is, in substance, a tax on the goods  imposed,
no  doubt, on the occasion of the sale as a  taxable  event.
It  will now be seen why the Explanation insists  on  actual
delivery of the goods in the State and their consumption  in
the  State,  and  why  an  "outside"  sale  or	purchase  is
explained  by defining what is an inside sale.	 The  object
clearly	 is  to assimilate the conditions, under  which	 the
delivery  State	 is left free to tax  inter-State  sales  or
purchases,  to	those under which a State  is  empowered  to
impose	tax  on	 goods imported into the  State	 from  other
States under <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_82">article 304 (a).</a>  If then, a non-discriminatory
use or consumption tax imposed under
(1)  [1939] F.C.R. 18, 42.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">1089</span>
<p id="p_35"><a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_83">article	 304</a>  on goods imported from other States  does	 not
infringe  the  freedom of inter-State commerce	declared  by
<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_84">article 301</a>, parity of reason and policy requires that a tax
on  sales  or purchases imposed by the State  in  which	 the
goods  are actually delivered for consumption in  the  State
should not be regarded as violative of the ban under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_85">article
286  (2</a>), and that is what the statutory fiction enacted  in
the Explanation was, in our judgment, designed to achieve by
divesting  the sale or purchase of the kind referred. to  in
the Explanation of its inter-State character in relation  to
the State of delivery.
</p><p id="p_36">There  is  another important  consideration  which  strongly
supports  the view we have indicated above,  namely  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_86">article
286  (2)</a>  does	not  affect the taxation  of  such  sale  or
purchase  by the State of delivery.  If both  the  exporting
State and the delivery State were entitled,  notwithstanding
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_87">article 286(2</a>), to tax the inter-State sale or purchase,  as
suggested  by the Advocate-General of Bombay, it would	mean
that  the  transaction is subjected to	double	taxation  as
compared  with a sale by a local dealer which pays only	 one
tax.   It  is precisely this type of  discriminatory  burden
which the principle of freedom of inter-State commerce seeks
to avoid, for, it places inter-State trade at a disadvantage
in  competition	 with local trade.  On the  other  hand,  if
neither State could tax such sale or purchase as is referred
to  in the explanation, until Parliament lifted the ban,  as
the  Advocate-General of Madras was inclined to	 think,	 the
result would be that consumers could get out-of-State  goods
more  cheaply  than  local goods, and  local  dealers  would
suffer	competitive  disadvantage as compared  with  outside
dealers.   Does	 the  principle of  freedom  of	 inter-State
commerce require that a State should foster such commerce to
the  detriment of domestic trade ? It is one thing to  avoid
impeding  inter-State  commerce by  imposing  discriminatory
burdens upon it which internal trade does not have to  bear,
but quite another to place local products and local business
at  a  disadvantage in competition with	 outside  goods	 and
dealers.  It would be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">1090</span>
a  curious  perversion	of  the	 principle  of	freedom	  of
inter-State  commerce  to  drive  local	 custom	 across	 the
border	to outside dealers, and that, in our opinion,  could
not have been contemplated.
</p><p id="p_37">The view which we have expressed above avoids either anomaly
and would place local trade and interstate trade on an equal
footing.   The	delivery  State would  tax  both  local	 and
out-of-State  goods equally without  discrimination  against
either and that, we think, is the only measure of protection
which <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_88">article 286</a> could reasonably be supposed to accord  to
interState  sales or purchases, when it is construed in	 the
light of articles 301 and 304.
</p><p id="p_38">The question next arises as to whether the, Act	 contravenes
all  or any of the restrictions imposed by <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_89">article 286.</a>	  It
is  the respondents' case that the sales and purchases	made
by them in Bombay, in the course of their business,  include
all  the three categories excluded from the scope of  State-
taxation by <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_90">article 286</a>, and the Act seeking to bring all of
them  within  its  scheme  of  taxation	 is  bad.   It	 is,
therefore,  necessary  to make a brief survey  of  the	main
provisions  of the Act and of the rules made thereunder,  in
order  to  see whether the respondents' complaint  is  well-
founded,  and, if so, whether the whole or any part  of	 the
Act is to be declared unconstitutional and void.
<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_91">The Act</a> provides for levy of two kinds of taxes, called	 the
"general  tax"	and the "special tax", by the  two  charging
<a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_92">sections  5</a>  and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_93">10</a> respectively.  "Dealer"  is	 defined  in
<a href="/doc/1020147/" id="a_94">section	 2</a>  (7) as a person who carries on the	business  of
selling goods in the State of Bombay whether for commission,
remuneration  or otherwise and includes a  State  Government
which  carries	on such business and any  society,  club  or
association  which sells goods to its members.	 The  Expla-
nation	(2) to this definition provides that the manager  or
agent  of a dealer who resides outside the State  of  Bombay
and carries on the business of selling goods in the State of
Bombay shall, in respect of such business, be deemed to be a
dealer	for  the purpose of the Act.  "Sale" is	 defined  by
<a href="/doc/1020147/" id="a_95">section 2</a> (14) with all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">1091</span>
its  grammatical  variations  and  cognate  expressions	  as
meaning	 any  transfer	of property in	goods  for  cash  or
deferred   payment  or	other  valuable	 consideration	 and
includes any supply by a society, a club, or an	 association
to   its  members  on  payment	of  price  or  of  fees	  or
subscriptions	 but   does   not   include   a	   mortgage,
hypothecation,	charge	or  pledge.   The  words  "buy"	 and
"purchase"  are to be construed accordingly.  There are	 two
Explanations  attached	to  this  definition  of  which	 the
second,	 which	is  obviously based on	the  Explanation  to
clause	(1) (a) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_96">article, 286</a>, provides that the  sale  of
any goods which have actually been delivered in the State of
Bombay	as a direct result of such sale for the	 purpose  of
consumption  in	 the said State, shall be  deemed,  for	 the
purposes of this Act, to have taken place in the said State,
irrespective of the fact that the property in the goods has,
by reason of such sale, passed in another State.  "Turnover"
is defined by <a href="/doc/1020147/" id="a_97">section 2(21)</a> as the aggregate of the  amounts
of sale price received and receivable by a dealer in respect
of  any	 sale  of goods made during  a	given  period  after
deducting  the amount, if any, refunded by the dealer  to  a
purchaser in respect of any goods purchased and returned  by
the  purchaser	within	the prescribed	period.	  <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_98">Section  5</a>
imposes	 the general tax on every dealer whose	turnover  in
respect	 of sales within the State of Bombay during  any  of
the three consecutive years immediately preceding the  first
day  of	 April,	 1952,	has exceeded  Rs.  30,000  or  whose
turnover  in  respect of such sales exceeds the	 said  limit
during the year commencing on the first day of April,  1952.
The  tax is to be levied on his taxable turnover in  respect
of sales of goods made on or after the appointed day,  i.e.,
1st  November,	1952,  at the rate of 3 pies  in  the  rupee
(<a href="/doc/427923/" id="a_99">section  6</a>).	By <a href="/doc/254952/" id="a_100">section 7</a> the taxable turnover is  to  be
determined  by	first  deducting from the  turnover  of	 the
dealer	in  respect  of all his sales of  goods	 during	 any
period	of  his	 liability  to pay  the	 general  tax,	his'
turnover during that period, in respect of (a) sales of	 any
goods declared from time to time as tax-free under <a href="/doc/526554/" id="a_101">section 8</a>
and(b) ,',such other sales as may be prescribed," No dealer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">1092</span>
liable	to pay the general tax shall carry on business as  a
dealer unless he has applied for registration (<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_102">section 9</a>). A
more  or less similar scheme is provided for the levy  of  a
special	 tax on the sale of certain special goods  specified
in  Schedule II.  By <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_103">section 10</a> every dealer whose  turnover
in  respect of sales of special goods made within the  State
of Bombay has exceeded Rs. 5,000 during the year ended	31st
March,	1952,  or  exceeds the said limit  during  the	year
commencing  from 1st April, 1952, is charged with a  special
tax  at	 the rate specified in Schedule 11  on	his  taxable
turnover in respect of the sales of special goods made on or
after  the  appointed  day, i.e., 1st  November,  1952.	  By
section II the taxable turnover is to be determined by first
deducting, from the turnover of the dealer in respect of his
sales  of special goods during any period of his  liability,
his  turnover  in  respect of (a)  sales  of  special  goods
purchased  by him, on or after the appointed day at a  place
in the State of Bombay from a dealer holding a licence under
<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_104">section	  12</a>  and  (b)	"    such  other  sales	 as   may be
prescribed."  Every dealer liable to pay the special tax  is
required to obtain a licence as a condition of his  carrying
on  his	 business (<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_105">section 12</a>).	 Then  follow  certain	pro-
visions	 for  returns, assessment, payment and	recovery  of
tax.   <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_106">Section	18</a> imposes a purchase tax at the rate  of  3
pies  in the rupee on the purchases of such goods as may  be
notified  by  the State Government from time to	 time  which
have  been  despatched or brought from any -place  in  India
outside	 the  State of Bombay or are delivered as  a  direct
result	of  a sale to a buyer in, the State  of	 Bombay	 for
consumption therein, and also an additional tax if the goods
are  special  goods.  <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_107">Section 21</a> (2)  prohibits	 any  person
selling goods from collecting from the purchaser any  amount
by way of tax unless he is a registered dealer or a licensed
dealer	and  is	 liable to pay the tax	under  this  Act  in
respect	 of such sale.	Chapter VI contains  provisions	 for
production   of	  accounts,  supply   of   information	 and
cancellation of registration or licence.  Chapter VII  deals
with proceedings including appeals
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">		    1093</span>
and  revision and the determination of certain questions  of
law by reference to the High Court.  <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_108">Section 45</a> empowers the
State  Government  to  make  rules  "for  carrying  out	 the
purposes  of  this  Act."  In  particular,  such  rules	 may
prescribe, among other things, "the other sales, turnover in
respect of which may be deducted from a dealer's turnover in
computing  his taxable turnover as defined in <a href="/doc/254952/" id="a_109">section 7</a>	 and
in <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_110">section 11</a>" [sub-section (2) (e)].
</p><p id="p_39">  In  exercise of the powers conferred by this section,	 the
State Government made and published rules called the  Bombay
Sales Tax Rules, 1952, which were brought into force on	 the
same day on which the charging <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_111">sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_112">10</a> of the	 Act
were also brought into force, namely, November 1, 1952.	  Of
these,	Rules 5(1) and 6(1) are important, and they  provide
for  the  deduction of the following  sales  in	 calculating
taxable	 turnover under <a href="/doc/254952/" id="a_113">section 7</a> (general tax) and  <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_114">section
11</a>  (special  tax) : (1) sales which take place (a)  in	 the
course	of  the import of the goods into or  export  of	 the
goods out of the territory of India or (b) in the course  of
inter-State trade or commerce.	It is to be noted that these
are  the  excluded categories of sales	or  purchases  under
<a href="/doc/1250882/" id="a_115">article	 286  (1) (b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_116">(2)</a> respectively.  Rule  5(2)	 (1)
requires,  as a condition of the aforesaid deductions,	that
the goods should be consigned by certain specified modes  of
transport.  Clause (v) lays down a rule of presumption to be
acted upon in the absence of evidence of actual	 consignment
of the goods within three months of the sale, that the	sale
has  not  taken place in the course of export or  of  inter-
State  trade  as the case may be.  It is  not  necessary  to
refer to the provisions of the other rules.
   Now, it will be seen from the provisions summarised above
that the Act does not in terms exclude from its purview	 the
sales or purchases taking place outside the State of  Bombay
while it does include, by Explanation (2) to the  definition
of "sale", the `sales or purchases under which the  delivery
and consumption take place in Bombay which, by virtue of the
Explanation  to	 <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_117">article 286(1)(a</a>), are to  be	regarded  as
local
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">142</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">1094</span>
sales or purchases.  On the construction we have placed upon
that  Explanation, sales or purchases effected in Bombay  in
respect	 of  goods in Bombay but delivered  for	 consumption
outside	 Bombay	 are  not  taxable  in	Bombay.	  Now,	 the
respondents  complain that the latter category of  sales  or
purchases  thus	 held not to be taxable	 are  not  expressly
excluded  by the Act which, therefore,	contravenes  <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_118">article
286  (1)(a).</a>   No doubt, there is no provision	in  the	 Act
excluding  in  express terms sales of the kind	referred  to
above,	but  neither is there any  provision  purporting  to
impose	tax on such sales or purchases.	 On the other  hand,
the two charging sections of the Act, <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_119">section 5</a> and  <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_120">section
10</a>,  purport,  in express terms, to impose the	tax  on	 all
sales  made  "within the State of Bombay", and	<a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_121">section	 18</a>,
which lays the tax on purchases, is limited in its operation
to  purchases of goods delivered to a buyer in the State  of
Bombay for consumption therein, that is to say, to purchases
which unquestionably are taxable by Bombay according to both
parties.  The charging sections cannot, therefore, be  taken
to  cover  the	class of sales or purchases  which,  on	 our
construction  of  the  Explanation, are to  be	regarded  as
taking place outside the State of Bombay.  We see no  force,
therefore,  in	the argument that the  Act  contravenes	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_122">article 286(1)(a)</a> by  purporting  to  charge
sales  or  purchases excluded by that  article	from  State-
taxation.
</p><p id="p_40">As  regards the other two categories of sales  or  purchases
excluded  by <a href="/doc/1250882/" id="a_123">article 286(1)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_124">(2</a>), it is true that	 the
Act  taken by itself does not provide for  their  exclusion.
But,  as  pointed  out already, rules 5 and  6,	 which	deal
respectively with deduction of certain sales in	 calculating
the  taxable turnover under <a href="/doc/254952/" id="a_125">sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_126">11</a> exclude  these
two  categories	 in  express terms,  and  these	 rules	were
brought into force simultaneously with the charging <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_127">sections
5</a> and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_128">10</a> on November 1, 1952.  The position, therefore,	 was
that, on the date -when the general tax and the special	 tax
became	leviable  under the Act, sales or purchases  of	 the
kind  described	 under <a href="/doc/1250882/" id="a_129">article 286(1) (b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_130">(2)</a>  stood  in
fact excluded from taxation, and the State of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">1095</span>
Bombay cannot be considered to have made a "law imposing  or
authorising  the imposition of a tax" on sales or  purchases
excluded  under the aforesaid clauses of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_131">article  286.</a>	 <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_132">The
Act</a>  and  the  rules  having  been  brought  into  operation
simultaneously,	 there	is no obvious reason why  the  rules
framed in exercise of the power delegated by the Legislature
should	not  be regarded as part of the "law"  made  by	 the
State.	[See observations at page 862 in the <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_133">Delhi Laws	 Act</a>
case(1)].  The position might be different if the rules	 had
come  into  operation  sometime	 later	than  the   charging
sections of the Act, for, in that case, it is arguable	that
if  the	 legislation, without excluding the two	 classes  of
sales  or  purchases,  was  beyond  the	 competence  of	 the
Legislature  at the date when it was passed,  the  exclusion
subsequently  effected	by the rules  cannot  validate	such
legislation.   But,  as	 already stated,  that	is  not	 the
position  here,	 and the learned Judges below fell  into  an
error by overlooking this crucial fact when they say "If the
Legislature  had  no  competence on the	 date  the  law	 was
passed,	  the  rules  subsequently  framed   cannot   confer
competence on the Legislature".
</p><p id="p_41">Even  so,  it  was contended, the  exclusion  of  the  sales
covered	 by clause (1)(b) and clause (2) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_134">article 286</a>	 was
hedged	round  with  conditions	 and  qualifications   which
neither	 the Legislature nor the rule-making  authority	 was
competent  to impose on the exclusion and,  therefore,	such
rules,	even if read as part of the Act, could not cure	 the
constitutional	  transgression.    The	   conditions	 and
qualifications	complained of are mostly found to relate  to
mere  matters  of proof, e.g., rule 5(2),  Explanation	(2),
which  insists	on the production of a certificate  from  an
appropriate authority, before a motor vehicle, despatched to
a  place outside the State of Bombay by road and  driven  by
its  own power, could be exempted as an article sold in	 the
course of interState trade.  No objection can reasonably  be
raised	if the taxing authority insists on certain modes  of
proof  being  adduced  before a claim to  exclusion  can  be
allowed.  Objection was also taken to clause (1) of
(1)  [1951] S.C.R. 747.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">1096</span>
<p id="p_42">sub-rule  (2)  of rule 5 as imposing an	 unauthorised  limi-
tation upon the exemption of sales and purchases allowed  by
rule  5(1), that is to say, while rule 5(1)(1)	(allows	 the
deduction of the sales covered by clause (1) (b) and (2)  of
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_135">article	 286</a> in calculating taxable turnover,  sub-rule	 (2)
(1)  of the same rule provides that, in order to claim	such
deduction  the	goods  shall be	 consigned  only  through  a
railway,  shipping  or	aircraft  company  or  country	boat
registered  for	 carrying cargo or  public  motor  transport
service or by registered post.	It is said that there is  no
reason	why  sales  of goods despatched by  other  modes  of
transport  should  not	also be deducted  from	the  taxable
turnover, because <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_136">article 286 (2)</a> in exempting sales in	 the
course	of inter-State trade, makes no	distinction  between
modes  of transport by which the goods are despatched.	This
limitation, it was claimed, was beyond the competence of the
rule-making  authority.	 The argument is not without  force,
and  it	 must be held that rule 5(2)(1) is ultra  vires	 the
rule-making authority and therefore void.  But it is clearly
severable from rule 5(1)(1).  The restriction regarding	 the
mode  of  transport of the goods sold or  purchased  in	 the
course of inter-State trade, to which alone sub-rule  (2)(1)
relates, can be ignored and the exemption under rule 5(1)(1)
may well be allowed to stand.
</p><p id="p_43">   Finally,  Mr.  Seervai  attempted to make  out  that	 the
provisions  of	the charging <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_137">sections 5</a> and  <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_138">10</a>	 fixing	 Rs.
30,000	and  Rs. 5,000 as the minimum taxable  turnover	 for
general tax and special tax respectively were discriminatory
and  void  under  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_139">article 14</a> read with	<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_140">article	 13</a>  of	 the
Constitution,  and  he	gave us several	 tables	 of  figures
showing how the imposition of the tax actually works out  in
practice  in  hypothetical cases.  It is unnecessary  to  go
into. the details of these cases which have been worked	 out
in figures, for it must be conceded that the general  effect
of fixing these minimum limits must necessarily be to enable
traders whose taxable turnover is below those limits to sell
their goods at lower prices to their customers than  dealers
whose turnover exceeded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">1097</span>
those  limits, for the latter have to add the  sales-tax  to
the  prices  of	 their	goods.	 But  no  discrimination  is
involved in this classification which is perfectly  reason-,
able  when  it	is borne in mind that  the  State  may	not'
consider  it  administratively worthwhile to  tax  sales  by
small  traders	who have no  organisational  facilities	 for
collecting the tax from their buyers and turn it over to the
Government.   Each  State must, in imposing a  tax  of	this
nature, fix its own limits below which it does not  consider
it  administratively  feasible or worthwhile to	 impose	 the
tax.   It  is  idle to suggest that  any  discrimination  is
involved in such classification.
</p><p id="p_44">    Apart from the considerations set forth above which tend
to  support the constitutional validity of the Act,  it	 was
broadly	 contended before us that taxing  statutes  imposing
tax  on	 subjects divisible in their nature'  which  do	 not
exclude	  in   express	terms  subjects	 exempted   by	 the
Constitution,  should  not,  for that  reason,	be  declared
wholly	ultra  vires  and void, for, in such  cases,  it  is
always	feasible  to  separate taxes  levied  on  authorised
subjects  from	those  levied on exempted  subjects  and  to
exclude	 the latter in the assessment of the tax.   In	such
cases,	it is claimed, the statute itself should be  allowed
to stand, the taxing authority being prevented by injunction
from   imposing	 the  tax  on  subjects	 exempted   by	 the
Constitution.  Our attention was called to certain  American
cases  where this principle has been consistently  followed:
(see  Bowman v. Continental Company(1), where all  the	pre-
vious cases are collected).  In the present case the tax  is
imposed,  in ultimate analysis, on receipts from  individual
sales  or purchases of goods effected during the  accounting
period,	 and  it is therefore possible to  separate  at	 the
assessment  the	 receipts  derived from	 exempted  sales  or
purchases  and allow the State to enforce the  statute	with
respect	 to the constitutionally taxable subjects, it  being
assumed	 that  the State intends naturally to keep  what  it
could lawfully tax, even where it purports to authorize	 the
taxation of what is constitutionally exempt.  The principle,
as it
(1) 256 U.S. 642 65 L. Ed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">1098</span>
<p id="p_45">is tersely put in the American case, is that severability in
such cases includes separability in enforcement.
</p><p id="p_46">     Our  attention was drawn to the decision of  the  Privy
Council in <a href="/doc/208970/" id="a_141">Punjab Province v. Daulat Singh and Others</a>(1)  as
condemnatory  of  this	principle.   The  case	is  however,
clearly distinguishable.  Their Lordships were dealing	with
a Provincial enactment providing for the avoidance of benami
transactions  as  therein  specified and  the  question	 was
whether	 it was ultra vires the Legislature as	contravening
section	 298(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935,  which
forbade	 the  prohibition,  inter alia,	 of  disposition  of
property  by  an  Indian subject on  certain  grounds  which
included  "descent".   It was found that in some  cases	 the
impugned  enactment  would operate as a prohibition  on	 the
ground	of descent alone.  The Federal Court(1) by  majority
expressed the view that the Act could not, for that  reason,
be  invalidated	 as a whole but that  the  circumstances  in
which its provisions would be inoperative must be limited to
cases  where the statute actually operated in  contravention
of  the	 constitutional inhibition.  Disagreeing  with	this
view  their Lordships made the following observations  which
were strongly relied on before us:
</p><p id="p_47">"  The	majority  of  the  Federal  Court  appear  to	have
contemplated  another  form of severability,  namely,  by  a
classification of the particular cases on which the impugned
Act  may  happen to operate, involving an inquiry  into	 the
circumstances  of each individual case.	 There are no  words
in the Act capable of being so construed, and such a  course
would  in  effect  involve an amendment of the	Act  by	 the
court, a course which is beyond the competency of the court,
as has long been well established."
</p><p id="p_48">    The subject of the constitutional prohibition was single
and indivisible, namely, disposition of property on  grounds
only  of (among other things) descent and if, in its  actual
operation, the impugned statute was found to transgress	 the
constitutional mandate, the whole Act had to be held void as
the words used
(1) [1946] F.C.R. 1. (2) [1942] F.C.R. 67.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">1099</span>
<p id="p_49">covered both what was constitutionally permissible and	what
was  not.  The same principle was applied by this  court  in
the  Cross Roads case(1).  It was, indeed, applied  also  in
Bowman's  case(1)  with respect to the licence	tax  imposed
generally on the entire business conducted including  inter-
State  commerce	 as well as domestic business, but  was	 not
applied,  as stated above, with respect to excise tax  which
was  laid  on  every gallon of gasolene sold  and  was	thus
divisible  in  its  nature.  It is a sound  rule  to  extend
severability to include separability in enforcement in	such
cases,	and we are of opinion that the principle  should  be
applied in dealing with taxing statutes in this country,
We  accordingly set aside the declaration made by the  court
below  and quash the writ issued by it except in  regard  to
rule  5	 (2)  (1).   An	 injunction  shall,  however,  issue
restraining the appellants from imposing or authorising	 the
imposition  of	a  tax	on sales  and  purchases  which	 are
exempted from taxation by <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_142">article 286</a> as interpreted above.

    BOSE  J.-I	have  had  the	advantage  of  reading	 the
judgments  of  my  Lord the Chief  Justice  and	 my  learned
brother	 Bhagwati.   I	regret I am  unable  to	 agree	with
either.	  The  range  of  disagreement	is  not	 large	 but
unfortunately it vitally affects the result.
</p><p id="p_51">     I agree with the construction which my Lord has  placed
upon entry No. 54 of List II.  I also agree that the  object
of the Explanation is to fix the locus of a sale or purchase
by means of a fiction, but with respect I cannot agree	with
my brother Bhagwati that the non-obstante clause  enunciates
the  general  law on this point.  I know of no	general	 law
which fixes the Situs of a sale, not even the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_143">Sale of  Goods
Act</a>.   What the general law does is to determine  the  place
where the property passes in the absence of a special agree-
ment,  but  the	 place	where the  property  passes  is	 not
necessarily the place where the sale takes place, nor
(1) [1950] S.C.R. 594	   (2) 256 U.S. 642,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">1100</span>
has  that  ever	 been regarded as  the	determining  factor.
What, in my opinion, happened was this.
</p><p id="p_52">   Before the passing of the Constitution, different  States
(or  Provinces as they then were) claimed the right  to	 tax
the  same  transaction for a variety of reasons	 which	have
been  pointed out by my Lord the Chief Justice.	 The  result
was   that   the  price	 of   certain	commodities   became
inordinately  high.   Take, for example, the case  of  steel
rails  manufactured  by	 the Tata Iron and  Steel  Works  at
Tatanagar  and purchased by the Government of India for	 its
railways.   The Central Government found itself called	upon
to  pay	 a  sale or purchase tax to different  States  on  a
single	transaction  of purchase.  I am not  sure  how	many
times over it had to pay but on the notions then current  it
was  open  to Bihar to claim the right to  tax	because	 the
goods  were  manufactured  there,  to  Bengal  because	 the
transaction  of sale took place at Calcutta where  the	head
offices of the company were, to a third Province because the
goods were delivered there and to a fourth because they were
"found" there.	It hardly matters whether all or any of this
would have stood scrutiny in a court of law because the fact
remains	 that  various States were actually taxing  the	 one
transaction  of sale on the nexus theory. and a real  danger
existed of more and more of them coming in to claim a  share
of the spoils.	It seems to me that the Constitution  makers
considered "this detrimental to the development and exercise
of trade and commerce and so determined to put a stop to the
practice  but at the same time left Parliament a  discretion
to  restore a part of the status quo if and when  it  should
think it safe and desirable to do so.
</p><p id="p_53">  The  narrowing of the powers was  accomplished  by
stating	 in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_144">article 286</a> that no State can impose a tax on  a
sale  or  purchase which takes place outside the  State,  by
stating that it cannot tax a sale or purchase in the  course
of  import or export and by prohibiting taxes on  sales	 and
purchases  which  take place in the  course  of	 inter-State
trade or commerce unless Parliament chooses to lift the ban.
Reading these together
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">1101</span>
in  a  simple and straightforward way it seems clear  to  me
that the idea was to permit States to tax only what I  might
call intra-state sales and purchases, at, any rate, to begin
with.
</p><p id="p_54">    But	 in legal enactments simplicity of  language  seldom
evokes	clarity of thought.  So long as the ban	 imposed  by
clause	(2)  remains, there is no  difficulty  because	when
parts  of  a  sale  take  place	 in  different	States	 the
transaction  is inter-State and no tax can be  imposed.	  On
the  other  hand, when all the	ingredients  are  intrastate
clause (2) is not attracted.  Complications only arise	when
the ban is lifted.  The Constitution makers had before	them
the  existing  practice	 of the States based  on  the  nexus
theory,	 and so it became necessary to define just  where  a
sale  takes place in order to carry out the main theme	that
only intra-astate sales can be taxed.
</p><p id="p_55">   The	difficulty  is apparent when one begins to  split  a
sale  into its component parts and analyse them.  When	this
is  done,  a  sale  is	found to  consist  of  a  number  of
ingredients  which can be said to be essential in the  sense
that  if any one of them is missing there is no	 sale.	 The
following are some of them: (1) the existence of goods which
form  the  subject-matter of the sale, (2)  the	 bargain  or
contract which, when executed, will result in the passing of
the  property in the goods for a price, (3) the payment,  or
promise	 of  payment,  of a price, (4) the  passing  of	 the
title.	When all take place in one State, there is no diffi-
culty.	The situs of the sale is the place in which all	 the
ingredients  are brought into being.  But when one  or	more
ingredients  take place in different States, what  criterion
is one to employ ? It is impossible to say that any of these
ingredients  is	 more essential than any other	because	 the
result	is  always the same the moment you  take  one  away.
There  is then no sale.	 Therefore, one either has to  adopt
the  ultra logical view and hold that the only	State  which
can  tax is the one in which all the ingredients take  place
and that no State can tax when a single ingredient
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">143</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">1102</span>
takes  place elsewhere, or resort to the old view  and	hold
that every State in which any single ingredient -takes place
can tax.  The only alternative to these extremes is to	make
an  arbitrary  selection  or to introduce  a  fiction.	 The
Constitution  chose  the  latter  course  and  enacted	 the
Explanation.
</p><p id="p_56">     I	have deemed it proper to refer to the then  existing
practice regarding taxation because in construing a  statute
it is legitimate to take into account existting laws and the
manner	in  which they were acted upon	and  enforced.	[See
Gwyer C. J. in In re The Central Provinces and <a href="/doc/560085/" id="a_145">Berar Act</a> No.
XIV  of 1938(1) and Croft v. Dunphy(2)].  I think this	rule
is  even  more appropriate in the case of  the	Constitution
because the Constitution itself continues in force all	laws
which were in existence at the date when it came into  being
except those which are inconsistent with itself.
</p><p id="p_57">     I am with respect unable to agree that <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_146">article 286	 (2)</a>
is to be interpreted in the light of <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_147">article 304 (a).</a>  In my
opinion,  the  two  articles  deal  with  different  things.
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_148">Article	 286</a>  is concerned with sales and  purchases,  while
<a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_149">article	 304</a>  relates to goods imported from  other  States.
The stress in the one case is on the transaction of sale  or
purchase;  in the other, on the goods themselves and on	 the
act  of import.	 <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_150">Article 286</a> is related to Entry No.  54  of
List  II and to Entries 41 and 42 in List I. <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_151">Article  304(a)</a>
to  Entries 26 and 27 of List II read with Entry 33 in	List
III  and to Entries 51, 52 and 56 of List II.  The  distinc-
tion is, I think, clear when it is realised that (apart from
the  Explanation)  a sale or a purchase can  be	 taxed	even
though	the goods are never actually delivered and  even  if
they  never reach the taxing State, for the right is to	 tax
the sale or purchase and that is something quite independent
of  actual delivery.  The goods might be destroyed by  flood
or fire before there is any chance of actual delivery.	They
might, as in the case of the steel rails purchased by the

<p id="p_59">Government  of	India, be delivered in a  totally  different
State,	but  the tax could still be levied if there  was  no
Explanation  to stop it.  I find it difficult to see  how,,,
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_152">article	 286(2)</a>	 could	ever come into	effective  play	 if"
<a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_153">article	 304</a>  is applied to sales and purchases	 which	take
place  in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. -A  I
do not think the change in language, "a tax on the  sale  or
purchase  of any goods" in the one case and a tax on  "goods
imported  from other States" was accidental, nor do I  think
we  will be justified in ignoring the fact that the two	 are
placed in different parts of the Constitution.	I  therefore
prefer to hold that articles 286 and 304 deal with different
things and to construe <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_154">article 286</a> without reference to 304.
In this I agree with my brother Bhagwati.
</p><p id="p_60">    Coming back to the Explanation, its object is, I  think,
to  resolve  the difficulty regarding the situs of  a  sale.
The  Constitution having decided that the only	State  which
can  tax  a  sale or a purchase is the State  in  which	 the
transaction  takes place, and having before it the  conflict
of views regarding nexus and Situs, resolved the problem  by
introducing  the fiction embodied in the  Explanation.	 The
purpose	 of the Explanation is, in my view, to explain	what
is not outside the State and therefore what is inside.	With
respect	 I  cannot agree that the Explanation is  really  an
exception, and I do not think the non-obstante clause  means
that  under  the  general lay the lace	where  the  property
passes was regarded as the place where the sale takes place,
for  that  in itself would be a fiction.  There is  no	such
law.  In my opinion all it means is that there was a  school
of thought which regarded that as the crucial element on the
nexus  view  and that the Constitution	has  negatived	that
idea.
</p><p id="p_61">      I am also unable to agree that the Explanation governs
clause	(2) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_155">article 286</a>, for it limits itself in  express
terms  to sub-clause (a) of clause (1).	 It says that is  an
Explanation  "for the purposes of sub-clause (a)".  In	view
of  that  I  do not feet justified in carrying	it  over  to
clause (2) and holding that it governs there as well.  In my
judgment, the only purpose of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">1104</span>
Explanation  is	 to explain where the situ8 of	a  sale	 is.
clause (2) has a different object.  Its purposes to prohibit
taxation  on  sales and purchases which take  place  in	 the
course of inter-State trade or commerce.
</p><p id="p_62">     If	 the  Explanation is carried over to clause  (2)  it
must, in my judgment, be equally applicable to subclause (b)
of clause (1).	As I understand the argument, the  reasoning
is this.  The Explanation turns an inter-State sale into  an
intra-state  sale by means of a fiction.  Having served	 its
purpose	 it follows as a corollary that there is  no  inter-
State transaction left and so clause (2) is not called	into
play.  In my opinion, by parity of reasoning, if the sale is
intra-	state and cannot now be regarded as external to	 the
State, it equally cannot be said to take place in the course
of  export or import in a case of that kind, for export	 and
import	predicate  the movement of goods across	 a  boundary
just as surely as inter-State trade and commerce.  But	such
a  contention  would militate against our  decision  in	 <a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_156">The
State of Travancore-Cochin &amp; Others v.	The    Bombay	 Co.
Ltd</a>.(1).
</p><p id="p_63">     This  line	 of  reasoning does not	 appeal	 to  me	 for
another	 reason also.  It concentrates on the situs  of	 the
sale  and does not give sufficient weight to the  words	 "in
the  course  of ". When we apply a fiction all we do  is  to
assume	that the situation created by the fiction  is  true.
Therefore, the same consequences must flow from the  fiction
as would have flown head the facts supposed to be true	been
the  actual facts from the start.  Now, even when the  situs
of  a sale is in truth and in fact inside a State,  with  no
essential ingredient taking place outside nevertheless if it
takes place in the course of inter-State trade and commerce,
it -will be hit by clause (2) just as surely as it is hit by
sub-clause  (b) when it takes place in the course of  export
or  import.  When we examine clause (2) and sub-clause	(b),
it  is	not enough, in my judgment, to see where  the.	sale
took place. we have also to see
(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 1112.
</p><p id="p_64">whether	 it  was  in the course	 of  inter-state  trade	 and
commerce  in  the one case, or in the course  of  export  or
import	in the other, for the stream of	 inter-State  trade&amp;
and commerce, as also that of export and import, will  catch
up  in its vortex all sales which take place in	 its  course
wherever  the  situs  of  the sale may	be.   All  that	 the
Explanation does is to shift the sutis from point A or B  or
C  in the stream to a point X, also in the stream.  It	does
not lift the sale out of the stream in those cases where  it
forms part of the stream.
</p><p id="p_65">I have also another criticism to meet.	The Explanation	 can
only come into play when the transaction is in truth and  in
fact  inter-State, and the argument runs that if clause	 (2)
is  to	ban  taxation in every such  case,  the	 Explanation
becomes	 useless.  The answer to that is  two-fold.   Clause
(2)  has a proviso.  Under it the President is empowered  to
direct	the  continuation for a period of a  tax  which	 was
being  lawfully levied at the date of the Constitution	even
though the transaction is of an inter- State character;	 and
we find that in some of the cases which have come before  us
that  was done the moment the Constitution came into  force.
Therefore,  the Explanation operated from the start on	that
kind of case.  But of course that means that the  empowering
can  only be in favour of the State in which the, goods	 are
actually  delivered for the purpose of consumption  in	that
State as a direct result of a purchase or sale effected	 for
that  purpose.	 It  will be noticed  that  the	 proviso  is
limited to cases in which the imposition of the tax would be
"   contrary to this clause", that is clause (2) and not  to
the Explanation to clause (1)(a).
</p><p id="p_66">In the second place, Parliament is empowered to lift the ban
imposed	 by clause (2).	 So long as the ban exists there  is
no need for the Explanation, for the explanation only covers
sales  or purchases which are inter-State.  But	 the  moment
the  ban is lifted, the difficulties I have mentioned  above
arise and have to be met.  I am clear that the	Constitution
makers envisaged this and resolved the doubts in the manner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">1106</span>
I  have	 indicated; nor can I see anything  inconsistent  or
illogical  in this.  The-basic idea is to prohibit  taxation
in  the	 case of inter-State trade and commerce	 unless	 and
until the ban under clause (2) is lifted - and always in the
case  of exports and ,imports; and when the ban	 is  lifted,
the Explanation is there to settle a matter of	considerable
controversy  regarding the situs of a sale.  It is  true  it
makes  an arbitrary selection but then almost any  selection
would have to be arbitrary and this is as good as any other.
The  question  how ever arises what is to happen  to  clause
(1)(a)	while  the  ban lasts if the Explanation  is  to  be
ignored	 during that period ? How is the situs of a sale  to
be  determined in the difficult class of cases	which  arose
before	the Constitution and which, in my  view,  occasioned
the ban.  My answer is that class of case can only arise  in
the course of inter-State trade and commerce, for the moment
any  one of the essential ingredients of a sale occurs in  a
State  different  from the taxing State and  the  goods	 are
contracted to move across a boundary, you get a sale in	 the
course	of inter-State trade and commerce.   Therefore,	 the
problem	 about	situs does not arise.  Sales  and  purchases
which  are in truth and in fact intrastate (and the bulk  of
sales and purchases in the States are of that character) can
of course be taxed.  The ban does not apply and there is  no
need  to call in aid the Explanation, for I repeat that	 the
Explanation  is limited to cases which in truth and in	fact
take place in the course of inter-State trade and  commerce.
On the view I take the need for the Explanation only  arises
when the ban is lifted.
</p><p id="p_67">I  now come to matters of greater detail What do  the  words
"for  the  purpose  of	consumption"  mean?   This  is	best
understood  by reference to a concrete case: A, a dealer  in
Bombay,	 actually delivers goods to B, a dealer	 in  Madras,
for  the  purpose  of  sale by	B,  the	 Madras	 dealer,  to
purchasers  C, D and E in Madras.  Can either the sale by  A
to B or the purchase by B
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38"> 1107</span>
from  A	 be taxed?  In my view, it cannot, for B  is  in  my
judgment,  as much a consumer as C, D and E. It is true	 the
word  can be used in a wide as well as a narrow sense but  I
see  no reason to restrict its meaning in the present  case.
What  after  all does "consumption" mean?  In  its  economic
sense  it is just the use which a purchaser chooses to	make
of  the goods purchased for his own purposes.  He  does	 not
have  to  destroy them nor does he have	 to  diminish  their
value  or utility.  A man who purchases a valuable piece  of
sculpture or painting for preservation in a national  museum
does  not destroy it nor does he use it himself	 except	 for
the  purposes of presenting it to the museum.  But he  is  a
consumer.   In the same way, a man who purchases  goods	 for
use  in his business so that his business can be carried  on
by  the	 constant feeding of a stream uses  the	 'goods	 and
therefore "consumes" them even though he does not keep	them
himself.   This of course means that a dealer who  purchases
from  another dealer outside the State is a  "consumer"	 and
can  be taxed if the ban is lifted even if he purchases	 for
reexport  outside  the State.  But when he  re-exports,	 his
sale  to  the  outside	consumer  cannot  be  taxed  if	 the
Explanation is attracted.
</p><p id="p_68">I  cannot  agree that goods cannot be "consumed"  more	than
once.  it  all depends on how you view the  matter.   Little
fishes	swallow	 smaller  fishes and are in  turn  eaten  by
fishes larger than themselves.	In the end, the smallest  of
the series is consumed by the biggest.	Consider the case of
a  curio  dealer who collects antiques for the	purposes  of
sale.  The older they are and the more they have been  used,
the  more valuable they become, but that would	not  prevent
them  from  being "consumed" over again when  a	 "collector"
buys  them for display in his house.  Broadly speaking,	 the
object	here is to stop multiple taxation on any single	 act
of sale or purchase made in the course of inter-state  trade
and  commerce.	I would therefore construe "consumption"  to
mean  the usual use made of an article for the	purposes  of
trade  and  commerce. When dealer buys from dealer  that  is
"consumption"
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">1108</span>
<p id="p_69">for  the purposes of the purchaser dealer's trade;  when  an
ultimate  purchaser  buys  from a  retailer,  that  is	also
"consumption" for his purposes.	 Therefore, in my  judgment,
neither	 the sale by A to B in the illustration put nor	 the
purchase  by B from A can be taxed so long as the ban  under
clause	(2) remains.  But the sales by t to C, D and  E	 can
each be taxed by the State of Madras as they are intra-state
sales.	 If this is found to work hardship on the States  in
practice, then Parliament, which has been given the power to
regulate  inter-State trade and commerce under Entry  42  of
List  1, can step in and lift the ban.	In that	 event,	 the
Explanation  comes  into  play	and  Madras  can  tax	both
transactions but Bombay cannot.
</p><p id="p_70">     On	 the  other  hand, if A, the  Bombay  dealer,  sells
direct	to the consumers C, D and E in Madras  and  actually
delivers the goods to them for the purpose of consumption in
Madras, neither State can tax unless the ban is lifted,	 and
then Madras alone will be able to tax.
</p><p id="p_71">   Next,  what do the words "actually been delivered"  mean?
In  the normal course, a dealer in Bombay, who	sends  goods
either to a dealer or consumer in Madras, would put them  on
a train or send them by a public or a private carrier.	 The
cases  in which a dealer would take them himself  to  Madras
and  hand  them over in person or send one of  his  own	 men
there  would be exceptional.  In the former class  of  case,
the  carrier would normally be regarded as the agent of	 the
Madras purchaser and the result would be that delivery would
in  that event be deemed to be delivery in Bombay  and	that
would  give  Bombay the right to tax and  not  Madras.	 See
Badische  Anilin  Und Soda Fabrik v. Basle  Chemiral  Works,
Bindschedler (1), Badische Anilin Und Soda Fabrik v. Hickson
(2).   But  such a construction would make  the	 Explanation
useless.   I  think  that  is  the  reason  why	 the   words
"actually" and "consumption" have been used.  If the  normal
rule  were  to apply, there would be no need  for  the	word
"actual",  as  delivery to the carrier in  Bombay  would  of
course
(1) [1898] A.C. 200. (2) [1906] A.C. 419.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">1109</span>
<p id="p_72">be  actual  in the sense that it would be physical  and	 not
notional.   I  think  therefore	 that  the  words  "actually
delivered" and "as a direct result" of the sale or  purchase
"for the purpose of consumption in the State" have been used
to signify that in such a case the carrier must be  regarded
as the agent of the Bombay seller.
</p><p id="p_73">   So  far as the words " in the course of " in	 clause	 (2)
are  concerned,	 the  "course" we have to  consider  is	 the
course	of  the	 inter-State  trade  and  commerce.   In  my
opinion,  the inter-State character of the course ends	when
the  goods  reach the first consumer in	 the  taxing  State.
When  he  in  turn sells to the ultimate  consumer  in	that
State,	a  different  course begins, namely  the  course  of
intra-state trade.  It is necessary to draw this distinction
because	 inter-State trade and commerce is a matter for	 the
Centre,	 intra-state  for  that	 of  the  States.   We	have
therefore to determine where the inter-State course ends and
the intra-state course begins.	I think the point at which I
have  drawn  the line is logical and convenient.  I  do	 not
think the same considerations will apply in the next set  of
cases  where  we are dealing with the  TravancoreCochin	 law
relating  to export and import.	 But it is not necessary  to
explain why in this case.
</p><p id="p_74">  It  was contended in argument that the view I take of	 the
ban on inter-State trade and commerce imposed by clause	 (2)
would  place the local dealer at a disadvantage.   But	that
would  only arise in one class of case and I cannot see	 how
inequality of this kind can be avoided in every case even on
my  Lord  the Chief Justice's view.  There are bound  to  be
some in. equalities, whichever view is taken.
    Consider  these concrete cases.  We have A, a dealer  in
Bombay,	 B,  a dealer in Madras, and C, a consumer  also  in
Madras.	  If  A	 sells directly to C in such  a	 way  as  to
satisfy the Explanation, then. assuming always that the	 ban
is still in existence, this sale is not taxable on my  view.
But if B in Madras sells to C in, Madras, it is.  Of course,
B is then at a disadvantage vis-a-vis A. But so is A  vis-a-
vis B with regard to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">114</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">1110</span>
consumers  in  Bombay.	Consequently the  tendency  of	,the
consumer  in one State to buy from a cheaper market  in	 the
other  evens  up  in the long run.   But  that	apart,	what
happens on my Lord the Chief Justice's view?
   A very large volume of the feasibly taxable trade in this
country, if not the bulk of it, at any rate in most  States,
is  in the hands of retail dealers resident in	the  various
States.	 They obtain their wares from wholesale importers or
large  dealers in other States.	 In the illustration I	have
put  above, if B in Madras gets his goods from A in  Bombay,
then, on the learned Chief Justice's view, B pays a purchase
tax on his purchase from A and again a sales tax on his sale
to the consumer C. The consumer is therefore saddled with  a
double	tax.   But if C, still in Madras,  purchases  direct
from  A in Bombay, there is only one tax in the	 transaction
on my Lord's view.  That still gives A an advantage over  B.
Therefore,  there  is a large class of cases  in  which	 the
local dealer is at a disadvantage even on the other view.
The only class of case in which the local dealer is not at a
disadvantage on my Lord's view, and is on mine, is when	 the
goods  are  manufactured  locally.  In that  event,  B,	 the
manufacturer in Madras, pays no initial sales tax.  He	only
pays  when  he sells to the consumer C in  Madras.   If	 the
goods  can also be manufactured locally in Bombay, then	 the
dealer	A in Bombay does have a theoretical  advantage	over
the  dealer  B in Madras.  But if the goods cannot  also  be
manufactured  in  Bombay, the advantage disappears,  for  'A
then  pays an initial tax on his purchase from	the  outside
State.
</p><p id="p_75">I do not think considerations of this kind should  influence
the  construction  of these articles because, in  the  first
place,	some inequalities are inevitable and, in  the  next,
the  disadvantage is more theoretical than  practical.	 For
example,  a  wholesale importer, who also  chooses  to	sell
retail	in the State of import, has a theoretical  advantage
over retailers who have to buy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">1111</span>
through	 him.	But  that did not prevent  this	 Court	from
holding	 in <a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_157">The State of Travancore -Cochin &amp; Others v.	 The
Bombay Co. Ltd</a>.(1) that the sale which occasioned his import
is free of tax.	 So here.  I do not think this consideration
should weigh.
</p><p id="p_76">But  apart  from  this,	 the matter  is,  I  think,  largely
theoretical  save  perhaps in a few exceptional	 cases.	  In
this  class  of	 case, the trade  usually  adjusts  its	 own
differences  by	 allowing the local dealer  a  discount;  in
fact, in the case of many commodities, local dealers have to
give  an  undertaking not to sell below a certain  price  in
order to maintain a steady price level over the local market
and  avoid cut throat competition.  That is how most of	 the
large  motor agencies work, and the same applies  to  radios
and  petrol  and  kerosene  oil.   The	price  the  ultimate
consumer  pays is the same wherever he purchases in a  given
area.	Also the type of consumer who will take the  trouble
to  buy in a cheaper foreign market with all the  annoyances
of  delay, transport, octroi and other import  restrictions,
is  small.   Most people prefer to pay the extra  price	 and
save themselves endless trouble.
</p><p id="p_77">I now come to the impugned legislation-the Bombay Sales	 Tax
Act (No.  XXIV of 1952).  As mine is a dissenting view which
will not affect the result, I will content myself with	very
briefly	 indicating why I consider the Act, or at  any	rate
the  relevant  provisions in it, ultra vires, and  to  begin
with  I will ignore the rules altogether and  consider	what
would happen if the rules were not there at all or had	been
brought into existence after the Act.
</p><p id="p_78">The  taxing <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_158">sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_159">10</a> empower a levy of tax  on	 all
sales  made  within the State of Bombay	 when  the  turnover
reaches a certain figure.  This would include sales made  in
the course of inter-State trade and commerce, sales made  in
the course of export and import and sales falling within the
Explanation made to consumers in outside States.  As I	have
explained  above, the mere fact that a sale is made  in	 the
State
(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 1112,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">1112</span>
of Bombay will not prevent it from being a sale effected  in
the course of inter-state trade or commerce or in the course
of  export  or import.	Even when the whole  transaction  of
sale  is  constituted  in Bombay in  the  sense	 that  every
essential  ingredient necessary to constitute a	 sale  takes
place  there, (that is to say, even when the Explanation  is
not   called  into  play),  the	 sale  would,  given   other
considerations,	 be in the course of export or import or  in
the   course   of  inter-State	trade	or   commerce.	  An
illustration will make my point clear.
</p><p id="p_79">  A, a Bombay dealer, sells goods to B, a dealer in  Madras,
for  consumption in Madras.  I will assume that delivery  is
made  to B himself in Bombay and that he carries  the  goods
across in person.  If that is the normal way in which  trade
and  commerce in that particular line of goods flows  across
the  boundary, then that would, in my opinion, be a sale  in
the  course  of inter-State trade and commerce	despite	 the
facts,	including  delivery, mentioned	above.	 Ordinarily,
goods  of  this nature are delivered to a carrier  but	that
makes my point all the stronger.  So long as the ban imposed
by clause (2) remains the situs of the sale and the place of
delivery are not material provided the sale is caught up  in
the  vortex  of	 inter-State trade  and	 commerce.   Similar
considerations apply in the case of exports and imports.
    On	this  view, the preamble to the Act  and  the  short
title which limit the ambit of the law to the levy of tax on
sales and purchases of goods in the State of Bombay, do	 not
serve to save the Act, nor do the definitions of the words "
sale  ", " dealer " and " turnover ". Actually,	 Explanation
(2) to the definition of " sale" directly offends clause (2)
of  <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_160">article  286.</a>  It embodies almost word  for	 word  every
provision  of  the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_161">article  286(1)(a).</a>	That
would  be unobjectionable if the ban imposed by	 clause	 (2)
had  been  lifted  by Parliament.  But as it  has  not	been
lifted,	 the  provision is ultra vires on the view  which  I
take of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">1113</span>
<p id="p_80">   <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_162">The	Act</a> came into force on 9th October, 1952,  with	 the
exception of the taxing sections.  The rules were  published
in the Gazette on 29th October, 1952, and together with	 the
taxing	sections,  came into effect  simultaneously  on	 1st
November,  1952.  It was argued that the rules save the	 Act
in  the following way.	Under <a href="/doc/254952/" id="a_163">sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_164">11</a> a dealer  is
entitled to deduct from his taxable turnover sales which are
from.  time to time declared to be tax-free under <a href="/doc/526554/" id="a_165">section  8</a>
and  "	such other sales as may be prescribed." It  is	said
that  the  rules have excluded all sales  which	 offend	 the
Constitution, therefore under the " law " (by which is meant
the Act and the rules read together), which came into  being
on 1st November, 1952, no sale exempted by the	Constitution
can be taxed.  It follows that the " law which is sought  to
be impugned is intra vires.
</p><p id="p_81">    I  need not examine the rules for this purpose.  I	will
assume without deciding that they do exclude all sales which
are  exempt  under the Constitution, nevertheless I  am	 not
prepared  to  agree that rules can save an Act.	  Rules	 are
made by a subordinate authority which is not the Legislature
and  I	cannot	agree  that the validity  of  an  Act  of  a
competent  Legislature can be made to depend upon what	some
subordinate authority chooses to do or not to do.  The rules
were not passed by the Legislature and in theory the  parti-
cular  shape they took was not even in	contemplation.	 Say
the rules were to be amended tomorrow by striking out  these
saving	clauses, which would be ultra vires, the Act or	 the
rules  ? It would be impossible to hold that the  rules	 are
ultra  vires the Act, for they would not in the event  I  am
contemplating travel one whit beyond the Act.  It is the Act
which  would  be bad.  And if the Act is held  to  be  ultra
vires  in an event like that, would it be competent  to	 the
rule-making   authority	 to  come  to  the  rescue  of	 the
Legislature  and  rehabilitate the Act	by  re-enacting	 the
rules which it had deleted a few days before ? It would,  in
my  judgment,  be  no  more  competent	for  a	 rule-making
authority  to do that than it would have been competent	 for
it to validate this Act if the rules had been brought into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">1114</span>
being even one day after <a href="/doc/1549763/" id="a_166">sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_167">10</a> came into force.
I can understand this court saving to a petitioner:
You are not yet hurt by this Act nor is there any  immediate
likelihood of your being hurt and until. that happens we are
not going to entertain your petition, for we are not here to
examine hypothetical situations which may never arise."	 But
that  sort  of	objection cannot lie in this  case  for	 the
reasons	 my  Lord  the	Chief Justice  has  given.   We	 are
therefore  called upon to determine the validity of the	 Act
and in doing so we must, in my opinion, ignore the rules.
I  have	 now  to consider two more  points.   One  is  about
severability and the other is whether a taxing statute is to
be treated differently from other laws.
</p><p id="p_82">On  the question of severability, I cannot see how the	good
can  be	 separated  from the bad in this case  even  if	 the
Explanation  to	 <a href="/doc/1020147/" id="a_168">section  2</a>  (14)  be  expunged	 unless	 the
Constitution  be read as part of the Act and we are to	read
into the Act some such provision as follows :
  "  Notwithstanding anything which is said in any  part  of
this  Act,  all sales which the State is prohibited  to	 tax
under  the Constitution are excluded from the scope of	this
Act."
</p><p id="p_83">    But,  in my opinion, judges are not entitled to  rewrite
an Act.	 Offending provisions can be struck out but if we do
that the whole Act goes because the defect here is that	 all
sales are permitted to be taxed provided they are within the
State  of  Bombay,  and	 the  rulemaking  authority  is	 not
restricted    to   taxation   which   is    constitutionally
permissible.   On  the contrary, <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_169">section 45</a>  says  that	 the
Government  may make rules for carrying out the purposes  of
the  Act and one of the purposes is to tax all	sales  which
the State Government wishes to tax.
</p><p id="p_84">   The	other  matter is based on the  American	 view  which
treats	taxing	statutes differently from others  and  holds
that in a taxing statute one looks to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">1115</span>
individual item of taxation and not to the generality of the
powers.	  With all respect to the American Judges  who	hold
that view, I would prefer not to make exceptions.  When	 the
question  is  whether  an Act of the  Legislature  is  ultra
vires,	the  same principles should  govern  throughout.   I
would  therefore  hold that the Bombay Sales Tax  Act,	1952
(Bombay	  Act  No.  XXIV  of  1952)  is	 ultra	 vires	 the
Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_85">      BHAGWATI J.-I had the benefit of reading the  judgment
just delivered by my Lord the Chief Justice.  While agreeing
in  the	 main  with the conclusions  reached  therein  I  am
however	 unable	 to subscribe to the reasoning as  also	 the
construction put upon the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_170">article 286(1) (a).</a>
I   wish  to  place  on	 record	 therefore  my	 points	  of
disagreement and the reasons for the same.
The  power given to a State Legislature to tax the sales  or
purchases of goods is derived from <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_171">article 246 (3)</a> read with
Entry  54  of  List  II	 of  the  Seventh  Schedule  of	 the
Constitution.  That power has got to be widely construed and
it would embrace the power to tax the sales or purchases  of
goods  by  reason  of a	 sufficient  territorial  connection
between the taxing State and what it seeks to tax.
This  was  also	 the  position	which  obtained	 before	 the
Constitution  and  was responsible for	double	or  multiple
taxation  of the same transaction by different States.	 The
Constitution  makers  therefore	 thought it  fit  to  impose
restrictions on the imposition by the States of taxes on the
sales or purchases of goods by enacting <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_172">article 286.</a>   These
restrictions were threefold :-(1) no tax could be imposed on
the  sale or purchase of goods where such sale	or  purchase
took place outside the State, (2) no tax could be imposed on
the  sale or purchase of goods where such sale	or  purchase
took place in the course of the import of goods into or	 the
export	of the goods out of the territory of India, and	 (3)
no tax could be imposed on the sale or purchase of any goods
where  such  sale or purchase took place in  the  course  of
inter-State trade or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">1116</span>
commerce  except  in  so  far as  Parliament  might  by	 law
otherwise provide.  These were the three categories of sales
or  purchases which came within the ban imposed	 by  article
</p><p id="p_86">286.   The phraseology used in the article  laid  particular
stress	on the fact that the sale or purchase should "	take
place  so  as  to  fall within one or  the  other  of  these
categories.   The  intention was that the sale	or  purchase
should take place, i.e., should be completed either  outside
the  State  or in the course of import or export or  in	 the
course of interState trade or commerce.	 Whereas before	 the
Constitution  the taxing power could be exercised by  reason
of a sufficient territorial connection involving either	 one
or  more  of  the  ingredients of a sale  in  the  shape  of
agreement  to  sell,  the  payment  of	price,	transfer  of
ownership,  delivery  of  goods	 etc  the  completion  of  a
transaction of sale or purchase by the transfer of ownership
or  the passing of the property in the goods was enacted  to
be  the sole criterion for taxability in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_173">article  286.</a>	 The
sales	or  purchases  could  be  divided  into	 two   broad
categories-(1)	sales or purchases which take  place  inside
the  State  and	 (2) sales or  purchases  which	 take  place
outside	 the  State and those which took place	outside	 the
State were certainly outside the taxing powers of the State.
In regard to the sales or purchases which took place  inside
the  State, the sales or purchases which took place  in	 the
course of import or export and in the course of	 inter-State
trade  or commerce were also brought within the ban  leaving
the  taxing power of the State unfettered in regard  to	 the
other sales or purchases which took place inside the  State.
The restrictions which were thus imposed on the taxing power
of the State confined themselves to sales or purchases which
took  place outside the State and those sales  or  purchases
which  took  place inside the State but took  place  in	 the
course of import or export and in the course of	 inter-State
trade  or commerce.  Once the transfer of ownership  or	 the
passing	 of  the property in the goods was accepted  as	 the
sole criterion of taxability it was not necessary at all  to
define what was a sale or purchase which took place
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">1117</span>
inside	the  State.  Whether a sale or purchase	 took  place
inside the State could be determined by applying the general
law relating to the sale of goods and ascertaining where the
transfer  of  ownership took place or the  property  in	 the
goods  passed.	It was only when the transfer  of  ownership
took place or the property in the goods passed that the sale
or  purchase  was completed and the sale  or  purchase	took
place and the situs or the location of the sale or  purchase
was in the place where the transfer of ownership took  place
or  the property in the goods passed under the	general	 law
relating  to  the sale of goods. [See Badische	Aniline	 Und
Soda  Fabrick v. Basle Chemical Works, Bind Schedler(1)	 and
Badische  Aniline Und Soda Fabrick v. Hickson (2) The  situs
or  location  of the sale or purchase therefore	 assumed  an
importance under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_174">article 286</a> and the Constitution makers had
before them not only the legislative practice prevailing  in
the  various  States before the Constitution  but  also	 the
concept of sale as defined in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_175">Indian Sale of Goods	Act</a>.
They  therefore incorporated in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_176">article 286</a> the notion of  a
sale or purchase taking place, i.e., being completed, by the
transfer  of  ownership or the passing of  property  in	 the
goods  under the general law relating to sale of  goods	 and
enacted	 that  those  sales or purchases  which	 took  place
outside	 the  State  or which even though  they	 took  place
inside	the State took place in the course of the import  or
export	or  in the course of inter-State trade	or  commerce
should come within the ban imposed therein.
   The	Constitution makers however took count of  the	fact
that even though the property in the goods by reason of	 the
sale  or  purchase passed in a particular  State  the  goods
might  as  a  direct  result of such  sale  or	purchase  be
delivered in another State for the purpose of consumption in
that State.  They wanted to give the delivery State in	that
event  the power to tax such sale or purchase and  therefore
introduced by the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_177">article 286 (1)(a)</a> a  legal
fiction by which
(1) [1898] A. C. 200.	  (2) [1906] A. C. 419.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">145</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">1118</span>
<p id="p_87">the sale or purchase in that event was deemed to have  taken
place in the delivery State.  What otherwise would have been
a sale or purchase which took place outside the State within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_178">article 286 (1) (a)</a> was thus by legal fiction
deemed	to have taken place inside the delivery State,	thus
assimilating  the position to a sale or purchase which	took
place inside the delivery State enabling the delivery  State
to tax the sale or purchase in question.  This legal fiction
was  thus  introduced not for defining what was	 a  sale  or
purchase which took place inside the State as distinct	from
a sale or purchase which took place outside the State.	 The
purpose	 of  the  enactment of the Explanation	was  not  to
provide a definition of a sale or purchase which took  place
inside the State.  That was determined under the general law
relating  to  the sale of goods by  ascertaining  where	 the
transfer  of  ownership took place or the  property  in	 the
goods  passed,	which  was  in another	State  and  not	 the
delivery  State.   What was a sale or  purchase	 which	took
place outside the State was by reason of the Explanation and
the  legal  fiction enacted therein deemed to be a  sale  or
purchase  which took place inside the State so as to  enable
the delivery State to tax the sale or purchase in question.
 The sale or purchase transactions which are covered by	 the
Explanation are moreover of a limited character, viz., those
in  which  as a direct result of such sale or  purchase	 the
goods have actually been delivered in the delivery State for
the  purposes  of consumption in that State.   They  do	 not
comprise all the transactions of sale or purchase which take
place  inside  the State because besides those there  are  a
large number of transactions of sale or purchase which	take
place  inside  the State and in which no element  of  inter-
State  trade  or  commerce  enters  the	 transaction.	 The
transactions  of sale or purchase which take  place  between
dealers and dealers and dealers and customers all within the
State  are really comprised in the category of	transactions
of  sale or purchase which take place inside the  State	 and
these transactions do not at all fall within the purview  of
the Explanation.  It would be surprising
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">1119</span>
to  find a definition of a transaction of sale	or  purchase
which  takes place inside the State given in the  manner  in
which  it  is alleged to have been done in  the	 Explanation
covering  only	those transactions of sale  or	purchase  in
which the goods have actually been delivered in the delivery
State  as a direct result of such sale or purchase  for	 the
purpose	 of consumption in that State.	A definition, if  at
all   it  has  any  significance,  should  cover   all	 the
transactions which come within that particular category	 and
cannot	be  enacted in the form of a legal  fiction  in	 the
manner	it  has	 been done in the  Explanation.	  It  is  no
definition  at	all.  It has no reference to  facts  but  it
merely enacts a legal fiction under which a sale which under
the  general  law  relating to sale of	goods  is  completed
outside	 the  State  by the transfer  of  ownership  or	 the
passing	 of  the property in the goods in another  State  is
deemed to have taken place inside the delivery State because
of  the	 goods having been actually delivered  as  a  direct
result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of  consump-
tion  in  the delivery State.  What is otherwise a  sale  or
purchase which takes place outside the State is thus  deemed
to  have taken place inside the delivery State and  that  is
the  only purpose of the enactment of the Explanation.	 The
contention of the Attorney-General and Shri Seervai that the
purpose	 of the enactment of the Explanation was  to  define
what  was  a sale or purchase which took  place	 inside	 the
State is therefore unsound.
</p><p id="p_88">The non-obstante clause really takes count of the fact	that
under  the  general law relating to the sale  of  goods	 the
property  in  the goods by reason of such sale	or  purchase
would  pass in another State and that the situs or  location
of the sale would accordingly be therefore in another State.
Notwithstanding	 that fact the Explanation enacts the  legal
fiction that the particular transaction of sale or  purchase
is  deemed  to have taken place within the  delivery  State.
The  non-obstante  clause has not been incorporated  in	 the
Explanation  with a view to emphasise the particular  aspect
of the passing of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">1120</span>
property  in the goods and negativing the same because	that
was  one  of the ingredients which had	been  considered  as
important  territorial connection between the  taxing  State
and  what it sought to tax.  Besides this  ingredient  there
were  various  other ingredients which	had  been  similarly
considered   sufficient	 territorial  connections   and	  to
consider  that the ingredient of the passing of property  in
the  goods  was	 the only ingredient  which  was  considered
important  to be mentioned in the non-obstante clause is  to
ignore	the  facts and do violence to the  whole  conception
underlying  the incorporation of the non-obstante clause  in
the Explanation.  It would be a more natural way of  reading
the  non-obstante  clause to read into it  an  intention  to
state  what  according to the Constitution  makers  was	 the
basic  idea of fixing the situs or the location of the	sale
or  purchase  in the place where the transfer  of  ownership
took  place  or	 the property in the  goods  passed  and  to
indicate  that notwithstanding that fact a sale or  purchase
which fell within the category mentioned in the	 Explanation
was none, the, less to be deemed to have taken place  inside
the delivery State.
</p><p id="p_89">   If the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_179">article 286(1) (a)</a> is construed  in
the  manner indicated above it follows that  notwithstanding
the  fact  that under the general law relating	to  sale  of
goods  the property in the goods has by reason of such	sale
or purchase passed in another State the sale shall be deemed
to  have taken place in the delivery State and the  delivery
State  would be entitled to tax the sale or purchase.	That
does  not  however mean that it is only the  delivery  State
which  will be entitled to tax the sale or purchase.   Under
the  general law relating to the sale of goods the  property
in  the	 goods	having by reason of such  sale	or  purchase
passed in another State that State will no doubt be entitled
to tax the sale or purchase as having taken place inside the
State.	 That position will continue to obtain in  spite  of
the  fact that by the enactment of the legal fiction in	 the
Explanation  such  sale or purchase will be deemed  to	have
taken
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">1121</span>
place  inside  the  delivery  State.   The  object  of	 the
Explanation  is not and could not be to take away the  right
which  the State in which the property in the  goods  passed
had to tax the sale or purchase which took place inside that
State.	The object and purpose of the Explanation could only
to  be to deem such purchase or sale by reason of the  legal
fiction	 to have taken place in the delivery State so as  to
enable	the delivery State also to tax the sale or  purchase
in  question.	The  object  of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_180">article	 286</a>  is  to  impose
restrictions on the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of
goods  and  the only restriction which has been	 imposed  in
connection  with the sales or purchases which take place  in
this  manner is that a State shall not impose a tax  on	 the
sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase  takes
place  outside the State.  That is a general ban  which	 has
been imposed by <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_181">article 286(1) (a)</a> and what the	 Explanation
seeks  to  do  is  to lift the ban  to	the  extent  of	 the
transactions of sale or purchase covered by the	 Explanation
and enable the delivery State also to tax such purchases  or
sales.
</p><p id="p_90">It  is no doubt true that in the Explanation the word  only'
has  not been used nor has the word 'also' been used and  we
have  to  gather  the  purpose	of  the	 enactment  of	 the
Explanation  from the words of the Explanation	itself.	  In
order  to  arrive  at a conclusion whether  the	 object	 and
purpose of the Explanation was to enable the delivery  State
to  tax	 such sales or purchases either in addition  to	 the
State  in which the property in the goods had passed  or  in
substitution  thereof one has got to bear in mind the  basic
idea  that a State would normally be entitled to tax a	sale
or  purchase where such sale or purchase took  place  inside
the State except in cases covered by <a href="/doc/1250882/" id="a_182">article 286(1) (b)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_183">article 286(2).</a>	 If that power of the State to tax the	sale
or  purchase where such sale or purchase took  place  inside
the State was in any manner whatever sought to be taken away
it could only be taken away by an express enactment in	that
behalf as in <a href="/doc/1250882/" id="a_184">article 286 (1)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_185">article 286 (2)</a> and	 not
by the backdoor as it were by enacting a legal fiction as it
has been done
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">1122</span>
in  the Explanation.  The two book cases illustration  which
was submitted before the court by Shri Seervai in the course
of  his arguments is a very specious one.  Merely because  a
book  is by a legal fiction deemed to be in the book case  B
it does not necessarily cease to exist in the book case 'A'.
As a matter of physical fact it is in the book case 'A'.  It
continues in the book case 'A' and the physical fact of	 its
existence  in  the book case 'A' can never  be	obliterated.
The legal fiction only operates to treat it as if it were in
the book case 'B' and to involve all the consequences of its
being  in  the	book case 'B'.	The two	 positions  are	 not
mutually exclusive.  They can co-exist side by side and	 the
legal  consequences of the actual fact of the book being  in
the book case 'A' can be worked out simultaneously with	 the
legal consequences of the notional existence of the book  in
the  book case 'B' by reason of the operation of  the  legal
fiction.  If this position is borne in mind it is clear that
not only would the State in which the property in the  goods
passed	continue to be entitled to tax the sale or  purchase
because	 of such sale or purchase having taken place  inside
the State, but the delivery State would also be entitled  to
tax such sale or purchase by reason of the operation of	 the
legal  fiction	in so far as the goods	have  actually	been
delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase in the
delivery  State	 for  the ,purpose of  consumption  in	that
State.	 According to the position as discussed	 above	both
the  States  would  thus be entitled to tax  such  sales  or
purchases.
</p><p id="p_91">   Before I proceed to discuss the effect of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_186">article 286 (2)</a>
on  the taxing powers of both the States it is necessary  to
consider what is the exact type of sale or purchase which is
covered by the Explanation.  That sale or purchase has to be
one as a direct result of which the goods have actually been
delivered   in	the  delivery  State  for  the	purpose	  of
consumption  in	 that State.  It is  not  every	 transaction
which results in the goods being delivered across the border
that  comes within this category.  It is only a	 transaction
of  sale  or purchase directly results in  the	delivery  of
goods
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">1123</span>
for  the purpose of consumption in the delivery	 State	that
comes  within  the category of transactions covered  by	 the
Explanation.  A dealer in the delivery State purchasing from
a dealer in the State where the property in the goods passes
by  reason of such sale or purchase cannot be said  to	have
purchased  the goods for the purpose of consumption  in	 the
delivery  State	 because the obvious purpose  for  which  he
purchases  the goods is for dealing with those goods in	 the
ordinary course of trade and not for consuming the same.   A
dealer	who deals with the goods after purchasing  the	same
does  not consume the goods.  He deals with or	disposes  of
the same in the ordinary course of trade and he is a  dealer
or  a trader in those goods.  He is not a consumer of  those
goods.	 The  word "consumption" has been  thus	 defined  in
Webster's New International Dictionary, Vol.1  , page 483:-
"  Consumption.-(3)  Economics.The use of  (economic)  goods
resulting   in	the  diminution	 or  destruction  of   their
utilities;  opposed to production.  Consumption may  consist
in the active use of goods in such a manner as to accomplish
their  direct and immediate destruction, as in eating  food,
wearing	 clothes, or burning fuel; or it may consist in	 the
mere  keeping, and enjoying the presence or prospect  of,  a
thing,	which is destroyed only by the gradual processes  of
natural	 decay, as in the maintenance of a picture  gallery.
Generally,  it	may  be said that  consumption	means  using
things, and production means adapting them for use."
   In the Oxford New English Dictionary, Vol. 11, page	888,
consumption is defined as:
</p><p id="p_92">   (1)	The  action  or fact of consuming  or  destroying  ;
destruction............	 (7)  Pol.  Econ.   The	 destructive
employment or utilisation of the products of industry."
  Delivery  of goods for the purpose of consumption  in	 the
delivery State therefore means the delivery for the  purpose
of  using by the consumer and it has no application  to	 the
case of a dealer purchasing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">1124</span>
goods across the border for dealing with or disposing of the
same  in  the  ordinary course of  trade.   The	 Explanation
therefore covers only those cases where as -a direct  result
of the sale or purchase goods are delivered for	 consumption
in  the delivery State by the consumer and it is  only	that
limited	 class	of  transactions which are  covered  by	 the
Explanation  and  which are liable to tax  by  the  delivery
State.	 I do not accept the contention that the words	"for
the  purpose  of consumption" must be understood in  a	com-
prehensive  sense as having reference both to immediate	 and
ultimate  consumption  within the State and  excluding	only
resale out of the State.  In my opinion they have  reference
only  to  immediate  consumption within	 the  State  and  no
further.
</p><p id="p_93">   If  the  matters  stood thus and  there  was	 no  further
provision  to be considered the position would be that in  a
transaction  of sale or purchase covered by the	 Explanation
construed  as above both the State in which the property  in
the goods passed and the delivery State would be entitled to
tax  such  sale	 or purchase, the former by  reason  of	 the
property  in the goods having passed inside that  State	 and
the latter by reason of the goods having been delivered as a
direct	result of such sale or purchase for the	 purpose  of
consumption  in	 that State.  We have however  got  to	take
count of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_187">article 286 (2).</a>  The transaction of ,such sale  or
purchase  even though it be as between a dealer in  the	 one
State and the consumer in the delivery State is	 nonetheless
a  transaction	in  the	 course	 of  inter-State  trade	  or
commerce.   I  do  not	agree with  the	 contention  of	 the
Advocate-General  of  Bombay that <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_188">article 286(2)</a>  should  be
interpreted as applying to the cases of transactions of sale
or  purchase taking place between dealers and  dealers	only
and not as applying to the cases of transactions of sale  or
purchase  taking place between dealers on the one  hand	 and
consumers  on the. other.  Whether a transaction of sale  or
purchase takes place between a dealer on the one hand and  a
dealer on the other or between a dealer on the one hand	 and
a consumer on the other in the respective
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">1125</span>
States	all these transactions are in the course  of  inter-
State trade or commerce and therefore hit by <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_189">article  286(2)</a>
and the transactions which are covered by the Explanation to
<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_190">article 286 (1)(a)</a> would also be accordingly hit by the	 ban
imposed under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_191">article 286 (2).</a>
</p><p id="p_94">    So	far as the State in which the property in the  goods
has passed is concerned it could certainly not tax the	sale
or  purchase in question because the transaction of sale  or
purchase  so far as the particular State is concerned  takes
place  in  the course of inter-State trade or  commerce	 and
could not be subjected to the imposition of tax except in so
far  as Parliament might by law otherwise provide.   So	 far
however	 as the delivery State is concerned the	 Explanation
empowers  the delivery State to tax such transaction and  if
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_192">article	 286(2)</a>	 be  construed	as imposing  a	ban  on	 the
taxation  of such sale or purchase it will be tantamount  to
the  giving of the right to tax by one hand and	 the  taking
away of it by another.
</p><p id="p_95">     It was contended and rightly so by the  AdvocateGeneral
of Bombay that if the transactions which are covered by	 the
Explanation  to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_193">article 286(1) (a)</a> were thus hit by  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_194">article
286(2)</a>	in the absence of a provision otherwise	 enacted  by
Parliament  the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_195">article 286(1) (a)</a>  would  be
rendered  nugatory and the Constitution makers could not  be
held  to  have contemplated such a possibility at  the	very
inception  of the Constitution leaving it to the  Parliament
by having recourse to the provision contained in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_196">article 286
(2)</a>  to remedy such a state of affairs.	 Such a	 possibility
could not be contemplated and an effort should therefore  be
made  in  so far as it was reasonably possible to do  so  to
reconcile  the	provisions  of the  Explanation	 to  <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_197">article
286(1) (a)</a> and <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_198">article 286(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_96">   It is a well-known rule of the interpretation of statutes
that  a "particular enactment is not repealed by  a  general
enactment in the same statute". (Beal on the Cardinal  Rules
of Legal Interpretation, 3rd Edition, Part VII, Section	 IX,
page 516).  Reliance is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">146</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">1126</span>
placed in support of the above proposition on the  following
observations of Best C. J. in Churchill v. Crease(1).
 "The rule is, that where a general intention is  expressed,
and   the   Act	 expresses  also  a   particular   intention
incompatible  with  the general	 intention,  the  particular
intention   is	to  be	considered  in	the  nature  of	  an
exception."
</p><p id="p_97">     To	 the same effect also are the observations of  Quain
J.  in Dryden v. Overseers of Putney (2) quoted at page	 426
of the same work:-
</p><p id="p_98">      "It may be laid down as a rule for the construction of
statutes,  that	 where	a special provision  and  a  general
provision are inserted which cover the same subjectmatter, a
case falling within the words of the special provision	must
be  governed  thereby and not by the terms  of	the  general
provision."
</p><p id="p_99">(See  also Craies on Statute Law, 5th Edition (1952)  at  p.
205; Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes 9th  Edition.
(1946)	at  p.	176  and Crawford  on  the  Construction  of

'Construction  of  Statutes'  at  p.265	 <a href="/doc/1925530/" id="a_199">section  167</a>).	  It
therefore  follows  that  the  general	provision  which  is
enacted in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_200">article 286 (2)</a> against the imposition of tax  on
the  sale or purchase of goods in the course of	 inter-State
trade  or commerce should give way to the special  provision
which  is enacted in the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_201">article 286 (1)	 (a)</a>
enabling the delivery State to tax such sale or purchase  in
the  limited  class  of cases covered  by  the	Explanation,
transactions  ,covered by the Explanation being thus  lifted
out of the category of transactions, in the course of inter-
State  trade  or  commerce covered by <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_202">article  286  (2)</a>	 and
assimilated  to transactions of sale or purchase which	take
place	inside	the  State  thus  acquiring  an	  intraState
character so far as the delivery State is concerned.
   It was suggested that this result could also be  achieved
by   having  resort  to	 the  principles  which	 have	been
enunciated in articles 301 and 304 of the Constitution
(1)  (1828) 5 Bing, 177 at p. 180. (2) (1876) 1 Ex.  D.	 232
at P 426,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">1127</span>
which  are  included in Part XIII  under  the  captionTrade,
commerce  and  intercourse within the  territory  of  India.
Even  though  these provisions of the  Constitution  may  by
analogy	 support  the conclusion that a transaction  in	 the
course	of inter-State trade or commerce is thus lifted	 out
of that category and assimilated to a transaction of sale or
purchase which takes place inside the State the analogy must
stop  there  and cannot be worked any further.	 One  cannot
construe the provisions of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_203">article 286</a> with reference to the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_204">article	 304 (a)</a> as is sought  to  be  done.
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_205">Article 286</a> and <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_206">article 304 (a)</a> refer to different states of
affairs.   Whereas <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_207">article 286</a> provides restrictions on	 the
imposition  of taxes on purchase or sale of  goods,  <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_208">article
304 (a)</a> gives the State Legislature power to impose on goods
imported  from other States any tax to which  similar  goods
manufactured  or  produced  in that  State  are	 subject  so
however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and
goods  so  manufactured or produced.   Whereas	<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_209">article	 286</a>
refers to taxes on sales or purchases of goods, <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_210">article	 304</a>
</p><p id="p_100">(a)  refers to tax on imported goods.  The two concepts	 are
thus  entirely	different.   The  only	argument  which	 was
addressed  before  us  on  articles  301  and  304  of	 the
Constitution  was  by the Government Pleader of	 Patina	 who
referred  to these provisions in order to  substantiate	 his
point that only one State, viz., the delivery State,  should
tax  the sales or purchases covered by the Explanantion	 and
argued	what the results would be if it was held  that	both
the States could tax or neither of them could tax such	sale
or  purchase.	This  aspect was  however  not	stressed  or
presented  during  the course of the arguments and  I  would
prefer not to express any opinion on the scope or meaning of
<a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_211">article 304.</a>
</p><p id="p_101">  I would therefore base my, construction of the Explanation
to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_212">article 286 (1)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_213">article 286 (2)</a> on the rule as  to
the  interpretation  of statutes which I  have	referred  to
above,	lifting the transaction of sale or purchase  covered
by the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_214">article 286(1) (a)</a> out of the category
of  the transactions in the course of inter-State  trade  or
commerce and assimilating it to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">1128</span>
a  transaction of sale or purchase which takes place  inside
the  delivery State thus investing it with the character  of
an intrastate sale qua the delivery State.
 The result therefore is that the delivery State only  would
be  entitled  to  tax the transaction of  sale	or  purchase
covered	 by  the Explanation.  Such transaction would  be  a
transaction of sale or purchase where as a direct result  of
such  sale  or	purchase  the goods  are  delivered  in	 the
delivery State for the purpose of consumption in that State'
i.e., where the transaction is between a dealer in the State
in which the property in the goods passes and a consumer  in
the delivery State.  The State in which the property in	 the
goods passes would not be able to tax such sale or  purchase
in  the absence of a provision enacted by law by  Parliament
within	the  meaning of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_215">article 286(2).</a>	 Once  that  ban  is
lifted	by  the	 appropriate  legislation  enacted  by	 the
Parliament  the	 State in which the property  in  the  goods
passes	would also be entitled to tax such sale or  purchase
but not otherwise.
</p><p id="p_102"> Save  as above, I agree with the conclusions reached by  my
Lord  the Chief Justice in the judgment just  delivered.   I
agree  that  the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, and  the  rules

provisions  of	<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_216">article 286</a>, that Rule	5(2)(1)	 is  clearly

the fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_217">article 14</a> and	that
the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so  as
