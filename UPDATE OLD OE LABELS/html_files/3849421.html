Bench of this court, vide the reference order dated 8.10.2010 in this

FAO(OS), for this larger Bench to consider as to whether a Division Bench

of this court in the case of Dabur India Ltd. Vs. Amit Jain &amp; Anr. 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 1 of 67</span>
 (39) PTC 104 (Del) (DB) has correctly held that publication abroad by

existence of the design in the records of the Registrar of designs which is

open for public inspection cannot be said to be "prior publication" as per the

meaning of the term as found in <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_1">Sections 4(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_2">19(1)(b)</a> of the Designs

Act, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as „the Act‟). The Division Bench of this

court observes that it concurs with the view of learned Single Judge of

Calcutta High Court in the case of Gopal Glass Works Ltd. Vs. Assistant

Controller of Patents &amp; Designs 2006 (33) PTC 434 (Cal.) as stated in

paras 39 and 40 of the judgment, as per which the learned Single Judge of

the Calcutta High Court holds that mere publication of designs,

specifications, drawings and /or demonstrations by the patent office in a

foreign country would not in itself amount to publication for rendering a

design registered in India liable to cancellation. The reference order doubts

the correctness of the ratio in the judgments in the cases of Dabur India Ltd.

and Gopal Gas Wors Ltd. for the reason that the said judgments are stated

to have overlooked the provision of <a href="/doc/1970883/" id="a_3">Section 44</a> of the Act which provides

that a design which is registered abroad in a Paris Convention country, and

to which convention India is a signatory, gets priority over an Indian

registered design, provided that the person who gets the designs registered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                           Page 2 of 67</span>
 abroad in a Paris convention country, within six months of the date of the

application made in the said convention country abroad, applies and gets

registration in India.
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.           In order to answer the reference with clarity it would be

necessary first to crystallize the various issues/aspects, so that not only each

of them can be approached independently, but also the inter-play and inter-

relation of those issues as regards points which are common to those

issues/aspects can be noticed. The issues/aspects as crystallized would be as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">(i)   When <a href="/doc/691857/" id="a_4">Section 19(1)</a> (a) of the Act provides for cancellation of a

design registered in India on account of a design previously registered in

India, whether the said provision has to be read literally only i.e only a

design registered in India can be basis for cancellation of a subsequent

design registered in India and not a design registered abroad in a convention

country or whether the provision of <a href="/doc/691857/" id="a_5">Section 19(1)</a> (a) takes within its sweep

and includes a previous design registered abroad in a convention country for

cancellation of a design registered in India. Putting it differently, is a design

previously registered abroad in a convention country a ground under Section


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                              Page 3 of 67</span>
 19(1) (a) of the Act for cancellation of a design subsequently registered in

India.
</p>
<p id="p_8">(ii)     If under <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_6">Section 19(1)(a)</a> a design registered in a convention country

abroad is a ground for cancellation of a design registered in India, is this rule

absolute or the rule falls in those circumstances where the design registered

abroad is not applied to be got registered India within a period of six months

of making of the application in a convention country abroad. Be it noted

that the issue of design registered abroad alongwith its prior publication can

be under certain circumstances a basis of cancellation of a design which is

registered in India, however, that is the subject matter of <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_7">Section 19(1)(b)</a>

and not 19(1)(a), because the aspect of prior publication is within the subject

matter of <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_8">Section 19(1)(b)</a> as stated in the immediately following issue.

</p><p id="p_9">(iii)    If a design registered in a convention country abroad is not a ground

for cancellation of a design registered in India under <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_9">Section 19(1)(a)</a>, then,

whether the registration abroad entitles cancellation of a design registered in

India because the registration abroad conclusively amounts to prior

publication as per that expression found in <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_10">Section 19(1)(b)</a> read with

<a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_11">Section 4(b)</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_11"> (iv)   What     is   the    meaning     of    the    expression     "publication

abroad"/"published abroad", for it then to be argued that on account of such

publication abroad, the design registered in India becomes liable to

cancellation in terms of <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_12">Section 19(1)(b)</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_12">3.            An offshoot of the aforesaid issues (iii) and (iv) above is that

whether in all circumstances and all cases, the record of the Registrar of

Designs open to public inspection abroad should be held to be prior

publication so that on the basis cancellation can be applied under <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_13">Section

19(1)(b)</a> of the Act for the design registered in India, and if, the record of the

Registrar of Designs in a convention country abroad is to be taken as a basis

for cancellation of a design registered in India, whether it is an unqualified

rule or whether it has to be examined as per the facts of each case that record

of the Registrar of Designs in a convention country abroad does or does not

amount to prior publication in terms of the expression in <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_14">Section 19(1)(b)</a>

and <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_15">Section 4(b)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_13">4.            In order to deal exhaustively with the aforesaid issues which

call for our answers, it would be necessary to refer to various relevant

Sections of the Act. One way would be to quote and deal with the different

Sections of the Act when we take up for discussion a specific issue as stated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                              Page 5 of 67</span>
 above and another way can be to set out all the relevant Sections of the Act

at the outset and thereafter refer to the language of such whichever Section is

necessary when we take up the discussion qua a particular issue. We would

prefer to take the second course of action of reproducing all the Sections

which will come into play for discussion in the present judgment at the

outset because for the issues which have to be considered, the language not

only of one particular Section or but also of various other Sections jointly

will come into play, and also because of the fact that inter-play of Sections

will have to be noticed when we deal with a specific issue. The relevant

Sections with necessary underlining/emphasis are therefore reproduced

registered in India. In order to appreciate this issue, we would at this stage

reproduce <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_40">Section 51A</a> of the erstwhile <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_41">Designs Act</a>, 1911 which dealt with

cancellation of registration, and which provision is similar to the present

<a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_42">Section 19</a> of the 2000 Act. The earlier <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_43">Section 51A</a> reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_44">Section 51A</a>. Cancellation of registration-

       the registration of a design-

       any of the following grounds, namely:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (ii) that it has been published in India prior to the date of registration;
       or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (iii)        that the design is not a new or original design; or

       on either of the grounds specified in sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of Clause

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       (2) An appeal shall lie from any order of the Controller under this
       section to the High Court, and the Controller may at any time refer
       any such petition to the High Court, and the High Court shall decide
       any petition so referred."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">(ii)      When we compare <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_45">Section 51A</a> of the 1911 Act with <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_46">Section 19</a> of

the 2000 Act, it becomes clear that the parliament has brought in prior

publication abroad by including this aspect in <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_47">Section 19(1)(b)</a> of the 2000

Act for cancellation of a design registered in India, whereas previously

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                                  Page 14 of 67</span>
 under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_48">Section 51A</a> (1)(a)(ii) of the 1911 Act the factum of prior publication

abroad was not a ground for cancellation of a design registered in India.

There is hence a conscious departure by the legislature while enacting

<a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_49">Section 19(1)(b)</a> of the 2000 Act than as compared to <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_50">Section 51A(1)(a)</a> (ii)

of the 1911 Act, however, there is no change in the language of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_51">Section

51A(1)(a)(i)</a>    of the 1911 Act when we compare the same with the

equivalent provision of <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_52">Section 19(1)(a)</a> in the 2000 Act i.e both under the

1911 Act and the present 2000 Act it is only a prior registration in India (and

not abroad) which is a ground for cancellation of a design which is

subsequently registered in India. There is therefore a marked change in

approach of the legislature while dealing with the separate aspects viz. one

of cancellation of a design registered in India on the ground of registration in

India which has remained the unchanged, and second as regards cancellation

because of prior publication and which expression has been extended to

mean prior publication not only in India but also abroad. In Gopal Glass

Works Ltd.'s case the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court has

rightly noticed this conscious act of the legislature, and this is stated in paras

28 and 29 of the said judgment, which paras read as under:-


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                               Page 15 of 67</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "28.    It is significant that prior to the enactment and enforcement
     of the 2000 Act prior registration or publication of the design in
     India was a ground for cancellation of a registered design, but no
     prior registration or publication abroad. Parliament in its wisdom
     deemed it expedient to add prior publication in a country other than
     India as a ground for cancellation of a registered design, but nor
     prior registration in a country other than India.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">     29.     Parliament has thereby consciously differentiated between
     prior registration in India and prior registration abroad. No such
     difference has, however, been made in the case of prior publication.
     Prior publication either in India or abroad is a ground for
     cancellation of a registered design."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_54">6.           Therefore, we cannot ignore this specific mandate of the

legislature whereby no change has been brought about to the language of the

earlier provision of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_53">Section 51A</a> (1)(a)(i) of the 1911 Act, and there being an

identical provision in <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_54">Section 19(1)(a)</a> of the 2000 Act.          Therefore, a

registration of a design abroad cannot be a ground included under <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_55">Section

19(1)(a)</a> of the Act for cancellation of a design registered in India.

</p><p id="p_55">7.           The question which then immediately arises is whether the

provision of <a href="/doc/1970883/" id="a_56">Section 44</a>, with its sub-Sections (1) and (2), requires any

change to be brought about in the aforesaid interpretation which we have

given to <a href="/doc/691857/" id="a_57">Section 19(1)</a> (a) that a foreign registration cannot be a ground for

seeking cancellation of an Indian registration.
</p>
<p id="p_56"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                              Page 16 of 67</span>
 8(i).        On a close reading of <a href="/doc/1970883/" id="a_58">Section 44</a> (1) and (2), and taking note of

the provision of <a href="/doc/1495227/" id="a_59">Section 5(6)</a> of the Act which provides that registration is

effective from the date of the application for registration, it is clear that the

design registered abroad which is talked off under <a href="/doc/1970883/" id="a_60">Section 44</a>, and which has

priority by giving the date of the application for registration in India the

earlier date of the application made in a convention country, the same does

not mean that it is the foreign registered design which brings about

cancellation of the Indian registered design on the ground of priority. What

we mean to say is that it is not as if the foreign registered design continues to

be a foreign registered design by virtue of <a href="/doc/599256/" id="a_61">Section 44(1)</a> of the Act, because

on registration in India the foreign registered design becomes a design

registered in India, albeit having a priority date of the date of the application

made in a convention country abroad. This becomes clear when we note an

all important expression found under <a href="/doc/599256/" id="a_62">Section 44(1)</a>, and which is "the

registration of the said design under this Act", and which shows that a

design registered abroad after making of an application within six months of

the date of application made in the convention country abroad, after its

registration in India actually does not remain a foreign registered design but

it becomes a design registered in India, of course with the earlier priority
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                              Page 17 of 67</span>
 date. Putting it in other words, the date of registration in India is taken as

the date of application made in the convention country abroad, inasmuch as,

by virtue of provision of <a href="/doc/1495227/" id="a_63">Section 5(6)</a> of the Act a design which is registered

in India will be registered as the date of the application for registration in

India; and by virtue of <a href="/doc/599256/" id="a_64">Section 44(1)</a> the date of application for registration

of the foreign design registered in India (for which an application was earlier

made in a convention country abroad) is to be taken as a date when the

application was made in the convention country abroad. Neatly put what we

are stating is actually the design which is registered abroad in fact becomes a

design registered in India on complying of the requirement of making the

application within six months in India from the date of the application being

made in the convention country abroad, and therefore, the design registered

abroad becomes a design registered in India with an earlier priority date

being the earlier date of the application made abroad, and thereby foreign

registered design on becoming an Indian registered design is therefore an

Indian registered design for seeking cancellation of a design registered in

India having a subsequent priority date.       <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_65">Section 19(1)(a)</a> accordingly

sufficiently provides for this when it talks of cancellation of one design

subsequently registered in India when there exists a previously design
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                            Page 18 of 67</span>
 registered in India. Therefore, the language of <a href="/doc/599256/" id="a_66">Section 44(1)</a> does not bring

about, nor is required to bring about, any widening of the sweep of <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_67">Section

19(1)(a)</a> for including within <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_68">Section 19(1)(a)</a> cancellation of an Indian

registered design on account of a registered design in a convention country

abroad.
</p>
<p id="p_57">8(ii).      Issue No.1 is answered accordingly by holding that <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_69">Section

19(1)(a)</a> of the Act has to be interpreted literally, and only a previously

registered Indian design can be a ground for cancellation of subsequently

registered design in India, and a foreign registered design cannot under

<a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_70">Section 19(1)(a)</a> be a ground for seeking cancellation of a design registered

in India. Of course, the issue of a design registered abroad, subject to its

prior publication, can be under certain circumstances a basis of cancellation

of a design which is registered in India, however, that is a subject matter of

<a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_71">Section 19(1)(b)</a> and not 19(1)(a), which aspect we will deal with while

taking up issue Nos.3 and 4 of para 2 above.
</p>
<p id="p_58">Effect of failing to apply in India for registration within six months of
making of an application abroad.
</p>
<p id="p_59">9.          The language of sub-Sections (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/1970883/" id="a_72">Section 44</a> leaves

no manner of doubt that if any person who has applied for registration in a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                           Page 19 of 67</span>
 convention country abroad fails to make an application for registration of the

design registered abroad in India within six months of having made the

application abroad in a convention country, then in such a case the said

person who has registered his design abroad will lose his entitlement to

priority which is claimed on the basis of date of application made in a

convention country abroad, and the date of registration in such a case of

having made an application after six months in India would be the date of

the application made in India (and which is after the six months period of the

date of the application made abroad) with the consequent effect that in the

meanwhile if there is registration of a similar/same design in India in the six

months period (or till the foreign owner makes an application in India) then

such Indian applicant will then get priority to the application of the owner of

the foreign registered design made after the six months period of the date of

application made in a convention country abroad. Thus, such registration of

a foreign registered design after the six months period will become a design

which is to be taken as a subsequently registered in India to a design which

is registered in India on an application being made in the interregnum six

months period, and therefore, the foreign registered design cannot be a

ground for cancellation of an Indian registered design under Section 19(1)(a)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                            Page 20 of 67</span>
 because the foreign registered design will have the date of application for

registration not as the priority date of an application made abroad in a

convention country but will only be of that date which is the date of

application made in India for registration being a date after the six months

period of the application made abroad for registration of the design.

</p><p id="p_60">10.          Thus issue No.2 is answered by holding that a person who fails

to apply in India within six months of making of an application in a

convention country abroad, then, such an owner of a foreign registered

design, though would have appropriate entitlement in the convention country

in which registration is applied and granted, however, in India the

registration in a convention country abroad will have no effect of destroying

the priority date of an application made for registration in India within the

interregnum six months period. Putting it differently, whereas the foreign

registered design owner in the convention country in which his design is

registered may take necessary action in such foreign country on the basis of

registration if the Indian registered owner of the design seeks to sell articles

in that country in which the design is registered by the foreigner, however, in

India, it will be the Indian registered owner who will be entitled to bring an

action for infringement of the design under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_73">Section 22</a> of the Act. Of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 21 of 67</span>
 course, we must hasten to add that if there is prior publication abroad before

the registration In India by a third party, then in such a case the foreign

registered holder will be able to challenge the registration in India i.e in

effect, both the Indian registered design owner and the foreign registered

design owner can simultaneously market their products in India with the

design, and none of them can successfully maintain an action for

infringement under the Act.

Meaning of prior publication under <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_74">Sections 19(1)(b)</a> read with <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_75">Section
4(b)</a> and whether documents existing in the record of Registrar of
Designs in a convention country abroad which are open to public
inspection results in prior publication:
</p><p id="p_62">11.          The expressions 'published' or 'publication' are not defined in

the Act. Various judgments have however defined these expressions found

in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_76">Designs Act</a>. Some judgments define publication as being opposed to

one which is kept secret, whereas other judgments define publication as

something which is available in public domain i.e available as of right to any

member of the public. We are of course looking into the issue of publication

by means of existence in public domain by publication in a paper (which

expression "paper‟ is taken to mean any other medium where the design can

be judged by the eye) inasmuch as, it was not (and could not be) disputed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                            Page 22 of 67</span>
 both the parties before us that once there is actual use of the design by

making an article out of the same, which is commercially exploited and put

in public use („by use‟ as stated in <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_77">Section 4(b)</a> of the Act), there would

surely be publication.         The issue of publication is accordingly being

specifically looked into from the point of view of whether publication by

means of publishing in a paper form available in public generally including

of their availability in the office of the Registrar of Designs.

12(i).         Let us therefore see what should be the meaning which should

be ascribed to the expression „published‟ or „publication‟ when we use such

expressions qua „published‟ or „publication‟ in paper form or by depiction in

any form which is visible to naked eye without the same having been put in

the form of an article.
</p>
<p id="p_63">         We have already in this regard reproduced the definition of design as

per <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_78">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act and the definition of expression „original‟ as per

<a href="/doc/1234344/" id="a_79">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act above, and which sections will be of relevance for

discussion of „publication‟.
</p>
<p id="p_64">(ii)     When we read the definition of a „design‟ under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_80">Section 2(d)</a> we find

that there are inter alia four important aspects in the same. The first aspect is

that the design is a design which is meant to produce an article as per the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                               Page 23 of 67</span>
 design by an industrial process or means. The second aspect is that design is

not the article itself but the conceptual design containing the features of a

shape, configuration, pattern, composition of lines etc. Third aspect is the

judging of the design which is to be put in the form of finished article solely

by the eye. Fourthly, the design which is the subject matter of the Act is not

an artistic work which falls under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_81">Copyright Act</a> or a trademark which

falls under the Trademarks Act.
</p>
<p id="p_65">(iii)   More clarity is given to the meaning of the word design when we look

at the definition of „original‟ as found under <a href="/doc/1234344/" id="a_82">Section 2(g)</a>. The definition of

the expression „original‟ shows that the design though is not new because

such design exists in public domain and is otherwise well-known, however,

the design is original because it is new in its application i.e new in its

application to a specific article. Therefore, for seeking registration under the

Act it is not necessary that the design must be totally new, and it is enough

that the existing design is applied in a new manner i.e to an article to which

that design has not been applied before.
</p>
<p id="p_66">(iv)    So far as the expression „new‟ is concerned, it is well known i.e it is

something which comes into existence for the first time and therefore a new


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 24 of 67</span>
 design which comes into existence for the first time obviously will be

entitled to copyright protection.
</p>
<p id="p_67">13(i).        When we see the provision of <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_83">Section 4(b)</a> we find that a design

which is already disclosed by publication in India or abroad will not be

registered, however, the bar for registration of a design which is disclosed to

the public in India or abroad is accompanied by the language which requires

publication „in a tangible form or by use or in any other way‟.       It is this

language and the fascicle of expressions „tangible form‟ or „use‟ or „in any

other way‟ which requires to be understood and interpreted so as to

understand the meaning of the word „publication‟.
</p>
<p id="p_68">(ii)     So far as the expression „by use‟ is concerned, there would be no

difficulty because obviously use of the design would be by translating the

same into a finished article by an industrial process or means. The real

difficulty which arises actually is qua the expressions „tangible form‟ or „in

any other way‟. These two expressions on a normal literal interpretation are

much wider than the expression „use‟ (the design having been translated to

an article). Publication in a paper form or publication as being visible to the

naked eye without the same having been put on an article is very much

otherwise included in these wide expressions. The question thus is to what
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                            Page 25 of 67</span>
 extent should there be publication for the same to be in „tangible form‟ or „in

any other way‟ for being included within the language of „publication‟ as

found in <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_84">Sections 4(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_85">19(1)(b)</a>. Before we answer this question, we

would however like to refer to the ratios of the judgments in the cases of

Gopal Glass Works and Dabur India Ltd. cases.
</p>
<p id="p_69">14.          In Gopal Glass Works's case, the design in question was

registered in India with respect to glass. The owner of the design registered

in India had purchased it from a German company. However, the design

which was sold to the Indian owner was also found to be registered in the

name of one other company M/s. Vegla Vereinigte Glassworke GMBH in

UK. Though from the illustration in the form of drawings downloaded from

the website of United Kingdom Patent Office depicted the design that may

be applied to glass sheets, however, two important conclusions are made

clear from the reading of the judgment and which are that firstly that the

patterns found in the design registered in the UK Patent Office may be the

same but the illustrations did not give the same visual effect for being

understood and applied to the article. The judgment in the case of Gopal

Glass Works has laid emphasis on applying of the design to an article in

terms of the definition of design under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_86">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act, and on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                            Page 26 of 67</span>
 account of lack of factual clarification and evidence led by the person who

opposed the Indian owner of the registered design it was held that it cannot

be said in the facts of that case that mere existence of papers downloaded

from the UK Patent Office will not amount to prior publication. It was

accordingly held that not only the papers downloaded from the UK Patent

Office did not have necessary clarity for being applied to any article, but

also there was no evidence of manufacture of glass sheets by anyone with

the design in question. Secondly, admittedly at no point of time even though

the design was registered in the UK Patent Office, there was ever any

manufacture of glass sheets by anyone other than the Indian registered

design owner. Some of the relevant paragraphs of the judgment in Gopal

Glass Works relating to the factual matrix read:-

     questioned the admissibility of the materials alleged to have been
     downloaded from the United Kingdom Patent Office website, in
     evidence, in the absence of any corroborative evidence regarding
     the authenticity of the same.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">     17. It was emphatically argued that the German Company did not
     apply the design in question on glass sheets. The catalogue of the
     German Company did not depict the application of the design on
     glass sheets. As such the catalogue as also the letter of the
     German Company dated 10th September, 2003 to M/s. IAG
     Company Ltd. were of no relevance.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_70">The ratio decidendi of the judgment in Gopal Glass Works is as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     18. The respondent No. 1 framed three issues. The first issue was
     whether the design was not new or original in view of the fact that
     the design had been published before the date of registration and
     the registered proprietor was not the owner of the design. The
     second issue was whether the design had been published outside
     India as well as in India, prior to the date of application and the
     third issue was whether the registered design was in public
     domain due to sale/use of the design prior to the date of
     application of the registered proprietor.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">     30. Under the law presently in force in India, specifications,
     drawings and/ or demonstrations in connection with registration
     of a design do not per se constitute publications which prohibit
     future registration of that design. Had publication of design
     specifications by a registering authority, particularly a registering
     authority in a foreign country, in connection with registration of a
     design, in itself, amounted to prior publication, that would hit all
     future applications in India for registration of designs, prior
     registration in India would not separately have been made a

      ground for cancellation of a registered design. Moreover, it is
     significant that Parliament consciously, made publication in a
     country other than India a ground of cancellation, in addition to
     publication in India, but expressly restricted the embargo of prior
     registration to registration in India. Registration in a country other
     than India has not been made a ground for the cancellation of a
     registered design.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">     33. The respondent No. 1 failed to appreciate that a design is
     solely judged by the eye. The visual appeal of a pattern, ornament
     or configuration on leather or rexin would not be the same as the
     visual appeal of that pattern, ornament or configuration on glass.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">     34. In order to destroy the novelty of a design registration, prior
     disclosure whether by publication or use or any other way, must
     be of the pattern, shape and/or configuration applied to the
     same article. The use of the embossing roller, to emboss a
     pattern ornament or configuration on a glass sheet, a material
     totally different in composition, nature, fragility, durability and
     look from leather, rexin or even plastic, in itself, involves
     inventive ingenuity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">     37. The embossing rollers manufactured by the German Company
     are only the device for producing the impugned design. It is
     immaterial that the embossing rollers were not developed by the
     appellant. Furthermore, in relation to designs, the expression
     "original" include designs which though old in themselves are
     new in their application. The brochures of the German Company
     do not contain any photograph or illustrations of the impugned
     design on glass.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">     38. The respondent No. 1 has apparently not considered the
     definition of "original" in <a href="/doc/1234344/" id="a_89">Section 2(g)</a> of the 2000 Act. The
     reasoning on the basis of which the respondent No. 1 arrived at
     his impugned finding that the design was not new or original is
     misconceived.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 30 of 67</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      39. The next question, in issue before this Court, is whether the
     finding of the respondent No. 1 that the document downloaded
     from the internet from the website of the Patent Office of the
     United Kingdom, might be taken as prior publication of the
     impugned design, is legally sustainable.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">     40. It is true that publication has not been defined in the 2000 Act.
     Yet, for reasons discussed above, mere publication of design
     specifications, drawings and/or demonstrations by the Patent
     Office of the United Kingdom, or for that matter, any other
     foreign country, in connection with an application for registration,
     would not, in itself, amount to publication that would render a
     design registered in India liable to cancellation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">     41. To constitute prior disclosure by publication to destroy the
     novelty of a registered design, the publication would have to be,
     in tangible form, of the design applied to the same article.
     Prior publication of a trade catalogue, brochure, book, journal,
     magazine or newspaper containing photographs or explicit picture
     illustrations that clearly depict the application of the design on the
     same article, with the same visual effect would be sufficient.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">     42. When the novelty of an article is tested against a prior
     published document, the main factor required to be adjudged is
     the visual effect and the appeal of the picture illustration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">     43. If the visual effect of the pattern, the shape or the combination
     of the pattern, shape, dimension, colour scheme, if any, are not
     clear from the picture illustrations, the novelty cannot be said to
     have been destroyed by prior publication, unless there are clear
     and unmistakable directions to make an article which is the same
     or similar enough to the impugned design.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">     45. The illustrations in the form of drawings downloaded
     from the website of the United Kingdom Patent Office depict
     the patterns that may be applied to glass sheets. The patterns
     may be same but the illustrations do not give the same visual

       effect as the samples of the glass sheets produced by the
      appellant in Court. There are also no clear unmistakable
      instructions or directions for production of glass sheets of the
      pattern illustrated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      46. The visual effect and/or appeal of a pattern embossed into
      glass sheets by use of embossing rollers could be different from
      the visual effect of the same pattern etched into glass sheets
      manually. The respondent No. I has not considered these factors.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">      47. The order impugned considered with the materials on record,
      including in particular the computer print-outs clearly reveals that
      the respondent No. 1 has only compared the pattern and/or
      configuration and considered the visual appeal thereof, but not the
      visual appeal of the pattern and/or configuration on the article. In
      other words, the respondent No. 1 has not considered the visual
      appeal of the finished product.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">      48. There are no material on record to show that the design had
      previously been applied to glass sheets. On the other hand, an
      affidavit was sworn on behalf of the appellant by a Liason
      Executive affirming that he had ascertained that the proprietor of
      the design registered in the United Kingdom had never
      manufactured glass sheets of the design registered."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">15.          A reading of the aforesaid paras shows that the following ratio

can be culled out from the judgment in Gopal Glass Works' case:-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_71">(i)   The issue of originality of design has to be necessarily looked at in

terms of the article to which it applies and there may be lack of clarity as to

existence of prior publication unless the publication is totally clear i.e it is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 32 of 67</span>
 only completely understood for its effect only when the same is actually put

on the article.
</p>
<p id="p_72">(ii)    Primacy was given to the Indian registered design because the design

which was registered in the U.K Patent Office was never used qua the article

in question viz the glass sheet and the documents downloaded from the

internet of the U.K. Patent Office could not be said to have much clarity for

being treated as a prior publication qua the specific article in question viz the

glass sheet.
</p>
<p id="p_73">(iii)   A foreign registered design cannot be the basis for cancellation under

<a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_90">Section 19(1)(a)</a> of a design registered in India unless there is application of

a design to an article which is put into public domain/use or unless there

would have been complete and sufficient clarity in the documents

downloaded through internet from the U.K. Patent Office that it can be held

that there is a clear cut clarity qua prior „publication‟.

</p><p id="p_74">(iv)    In the facts of that case since there was no clarity from the design

downloaded from U.K Patent office it was held that there was no prior

publication.
</p>
<p id="p_75">16.            Besides the aforesaid ratio, it needs to be noted on the reading

of the judgment in Gopal Glass Works that though there are observations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                              Page 33 of 67</span>
 when such observations are read only in a particular para of the judgment or

only in a particular line of a judgment, then, there may be an indication that

existence of registration in a foreign country would not be a ground to hold

prior publication, however, when such observations are read in context of

entire judgment it was found that those observations are made in the facts of

the case because there was lack of sufficient clarity and evidence of what

actually was the depiction and the effect of the design registered in U.K

Patent Office qua the specific article in question being the glass sheets.

Also, the observations of lack of prior publication in facts of that case were

made with respect to a design having to be put on an article as differentiated

from lack of clarity in a design merely by the same existing in public

records, because in the facts of that case the design registered abroad had not

been put in use in glass sheets.

   design in respect of which the registration has been granted in
   favour of the plaintiff is already in the public domain and has been
   published earlier. The Respondents have relied upon the Design
   Registration Nos. 319582 and 263373 issued by the US Patent
   Office to contend that there is no novelty as far as the plaintiff's
   designs are concerned. In the first place it must be noticed that the
   reliance upon a design registered in the US cannot satisfy the
   requirements of <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_91">Section 19</a> of the present Act which specifies the
   ground on which cancellation can be granted. <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_92">Section 19</a> reads as

       infringing its registered design."
</p><p id="p_83">(ii)     The observations of the Division Bench if taken literally may seem to

hold that registration abroad of a design taken in itself without anything

further cannot be a ground for claiming prior publication in an infringement

action. The question is, is this the law and did the Division Bench at all

intend to say that existence of papers open to public inspection in a Registrar

of Designs office abroad by that fact itself without anything further cannot

be a ground under any circumstances for cancellation of an Indian registered

design.
</p>
<p id="p_84">18.            We have extensively quoted the reasoning and ratio in the case

of Gopal Glass Works and various facets and factual matrix which led to the

conclusion.      It will not be correct to read only few paragraphs of the

judgment in isolation. In the case of Gopal Glass Works, the Court took

into consideration several aspects before reaching its conclusions and para

40 contains one of the aspects. The Division Bench of this Court in its

decision in case of Dabur India Ltd. has referred to only paras 39 and 40 of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                              Page 36 of 67</span>
 Gopal Glass Works's case. It is therefore necessary to clarify and elucidate

upon the expression „publication‟ as dilated upon in the case of Gopal Glass

Works and to what extent and when the registration abroad will result in

publication abroad which is specifically covered in <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_94">Sections 4(b)</a> and

<a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_95">19(1)(b)</a> of the 2000 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_85">19(i)        In our opinion the expression „tangible form‟ refers to a specific

physical form or shape as applied to an article and not the mere ability to

replicate, convert and give a physical shape to the design, though of course

to fall under the expression „tangible form‟ it is not necessary that the article

should have been used, but the expression „in any other way‟ takes some of

its colour from the words „used‟ or „tangible form‟.          The principle of

Nositur a Sociis will be applicable.        <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_96">Section 4(b)</a> therefore, not only,

requires publication but it should be publication by use, in tangible form or

in any other way. The expression „any other way‟ here is wider in context

and takes into its ambit a design which has been created though not still put

to use or exists in tangible form but at the same time it is guided by the

words "use" and "tangible form".            Thus, to disqualify a claim for

registration or cancel registration of a design in India, the publication abroad

should be by use, in tangible form, or in some other way, means that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                              Page 37 of 67</span>
 design should not be a factum on paper/document alone, but further that the

design on paper should be recognizable i.e. have the same impact in the

public as a furnished article will appeal when judged solely by the eye (see

<a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_97">Section 2(d)</a>). Putting it differently if the design is on paper then it must

exist upon a piece of paper in such a way that the shape or other features of

the article are made clear to the eye. The visual impact should be similar to

when we see the design on a physical object i.e. an object in tangible form/in

use. As noted otherwise in the present judgment, registration of a design is

article specific and thus-depending on the facts of each case registration or

publication of design of a particular article may or may not necessarily result

in rejection or cancellation of registration of the same or similar design on

another article. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_98">The Act</a> protects the original artistic effort not in form of an

idea or on its own as an artistic work, but is an embodiment in a

commercially produced artefact. Thus the primary concern is what the

finished article is to look like. [see observations of the Supreme Court in

Bharat Das Tools Ltd. (infra)].
</p>
<p id="p_86">(ii)   Registration in a foreign country is one aspect but what can entail

rejection of an application for registration in India or cancellation of

registration in India, is prior publication and not registration ipso facto in a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 38 of 67</span>
 foreign country.       Moreover, such publication should be of the nature

delineated in sub-<a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_99">section 4(b)</a>. Registration abroad perse cannot be a ground

for cancellation or rejection of a design in India but the registration in India

can be impugned if the design is not "new and original" or is already

published abroad as stipulated in <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_100">Section 4(b)</a>. In some cases of registration

abroad, the same not by itself a ground for rejection/cancellation in India,

yet can lead to cancellation if it can be shown and proved that the claim in

India is not "new and original" as there was publication abroad and which

publication abroad is a publication within the meaning of <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_101">Section 4(b)</a>. In

such cases registration can be refused or cancelled.

</p><p id="p_87">      New, original or novelty of the pattern or design when replicated or

applied or fully understood by the eye for being applied to an article is a sine

qua non to avail and get benefit of the rights under the Act. This underlying

principle is accentuated as well as protected when <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_102">Section 4(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_103">19</a>

stipulate and provide for rejection/cancellation of registration of a design

which has been published in any country prior in point of time. Though

publication in India or abroad are enlisted as separate grounds under <a href="/doc/562927/" id="a_104">Section

4</a> and <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_105">19</a> of the Act, they are in a way interlinked and intertwined with the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 39 of 67</span>
 question of whether design is new or original for determining the meaning of

"design" as understood and as defined in <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_106">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_88">(iii)   Registration abroad is one aspect and publication abroad in terms of

<a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_107">Section 4(b)</a> is another aspect.     There can be and will be cases when

registration abroad, may have resulted in publication of a design as

stipulated in <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_108">Section 4(b)</a>. In such cases there would be publication abroad,

not because the design is registered abroad but because the conditions

mentioned in <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_109">Section 4(b)</a> are satisfied. The observations of the Division

Bench in Dabur India Ltd.'s case cannot be read to mean that

though conditions of <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_110">Section 4(b)</a> are satisfied, the registration of design

cannot or should not be cancelled although the design has been registered

abroad.     Registration abroad and publication abroad are two distinct

parameters, each having their own consequences. When registration abroad

results in publication under <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_111">Section 4(b)</a>, the said provision gets attracted

and necessary consequences as envisaged in <a href="/doc/562927/" id="a_112">Section 4</a> and <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_113">19</a> will follow.

</p><p id="p_89">20.           In our opinion, most of the confusion or lack of clarity qua the

meaning of the words "published" or "publication" will be removed when

we refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Das

Tools Ltd. vs. Gopal Glass Work's Ltd., 2008 (10) SCC 657.                This
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                            Page 40 of 67</span>
 judgment of the Supreme Court is the judgment which has been passed in an

appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High

Court in Gopal Glass Work's case. A reference to various paragraphs of

the Supreme Court‟s judgment shows that the Supreme Court has taken note

of the fact that though design is specifically qua an article, however,

publication of a design in a paper form, may amount to prior publication,

however, each case has to be necessarily seen and decided as per the facts of

that case. The facts of each case must show sufficient amount of clarity qua

the design which must necessarily exist in a public record of a Registrar of

Designs Office and must have sufficient clarity attached to them before the

same can be treated as prior publication. Therefore, really the issue is no

longer res integra as to meaning of word "published" or "publication" as

found in <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_114">Sections 19(1)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_115">4(b)</a> of the Act because Supreme Court has

held that existence of documents in public record such as the Office of the

Registrar of Designs, will or will not, depending on facts of each particular

case be evidence of prior publication. At this stage, it would be relevant to

refer to the relevant paras of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case

of Bharat Das Tools Ltd. and which paras 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35,

    intellectual property right of the original design for a period of ten
    years or whatever further period extendable. The object behind this
    enactment is to benefit the person for his research and labour put in
    by him to evolve the new and original design. This is the sole aim
    of enacting this Act. It has also laid down that if design is not new
    or original or published previously then such design should not be
    registered. It further lays down that if it has been disclosed to the
    public anywhere in India or in any other country by publication in
    tangible form or by use or in any other way prior to the filing date,
    or where applicable, the priority date of the application for
    registration then such design will not be registered or if it is found
    that it is not significantly distinguishable from known designs or
    combination of known designs, then such designs shall not be
    registered. It also provides that registration can be cancelled under
    <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_116">Section 19</a> of the Act if proper application is filed before the
    competent authority i.e. the Controller that the design has been
    previously registered in India or published in India or in any other
    country prior to the date of registration, or that the design is not a
    new or original design or that the design is not registerable under
    this Act or that it is not a design as defined in Clause (d) of
    <a href="/doc/1437994/" id="a_117">Section 2</a>. The Controller after hearing both the parties if satisfied
    that the design is not new or original or that it has already been
    registered or if it is not registerable, cancel such registration and
    aggrieved against that order, appeal shall lie to the High Court.
    These prohibitions have been engrafted so as to protect the original
    person who has designed a new one by virtue of his own efforts by
    researching for a long time. The new and original design when
    registered is for a period of ten years. Such original design which
    is new and which has not been available in the country or has not
    been previously registered or has not been published in India or in
    any other country prior to the date of registration shall be protected
    for a period of ten years. therefore, it is in the nature of protection
    of the intellectual property right. This was the purpose as is evident
    from the statement of objects and reasons and from various
    provisions of the Act. In this background, we have to examine
    whether the design which was registered on the application filed by

     the respondent herein can be cancelled or not on the basis of the
    application filed by the appellant. In this connection, the law of
    Copyright and Industrial Designs by P.Narayanan (Fourth Edition),
    Para 27.01 needs to be quoted.

<blockquote id="blockquote_42">       "27.01. Object of registration of designs. The protection given
       by the law relating to designs to those who produce new and
       original designs, is primarily to advance industries, and keep
       them at a high level of competitive progress.

<blockquote id="blockquote_43">       Those who wish to purchase an article for use are often
       influenced in their choice not only by practical efficiency but
       the appearance. Common experience shows that not all are
       influenced in the same way. Some look for artistic merit. Some
       are attracted by a design which is a stranger or bizarre. Many
       simply choose the article which catches their eye. Whatever
       the reason may be one article with a particular design may sell
       better than one without it: then it is profitable to use the design.
       And much thought, time and expense may have been incurred
       in finding a design which will increase sales". The object of
       design registration is to see that the originator of a profitable
       design is not deprived of his reward by others applying it to
       their goods.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">       The purpose of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_118">Designs Act</a> is to protect novel designs
       devised to be applied to (or in other words, to govern the shape
       and configuration of) particular articles to be manufactured and
       marketed commercially. It is not to protect principles of
       operation or invention which, if profitable at all, ought to be
       made the subject- matter of a patent. Nor is it to prevent the
       copying of the direct product of original artistic effort in
       producing a drawing. Indeed the whole purpose of a design is
       that it shall not stand on its own as an artistic work but shall be
       copied by embodiment in a commercially produced artefact.

       look like and not with what it does and the monopoly provided

       image registered as the design but the right, over a much more
       limited period, to prevent the manufacture and sale of article of
       a design not substantially different from the registered design.
       The emphasis therefore is upon the visual image conveyed by
       the manufactured article."

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">    27. As mentioned above, the Assistant Controller primarily has
    taken into consideration the two evidence, (i) that the design was
    registered way back 1992 by the German company on the roller to
    be used either on glass, or rexin or on leather, therefore it is not
    new and original and (ii) that the same design has been obtained in
    United Kingdom as is evident from the downloading of Patent
    website of the United Kingdom. On the basis of this two evidence,
    the Assistant Controller has held that the design which was
    registered on the application filed by the respondent herein was not
    a new and original. therefore, on the application filed by the
    appellant, the Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs
    cancelled that design of the respondent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">    28. Now, we shall examine to what extent the view taken by the
    Assistant Controller can be sustained and whether the view taken
    by learned Single Judge was correct or not. Now, coming to the
    first issue which has been framed by the Assistant Controller, the
    Assistant Controller found that M/s.Dornbusch Gravuren Gmbh, a
    German Company published a brochure bearing distinctive number
    2960-910 for the first time on 10.9.1993 and the registered
    proprietor took the user's right and got it registered. The Assistant
    Controller found that it is not the inventive ingenuity of the
    respondent and found that in order to register the design it should
    be new or original and the Assistant Controller found that there is
    insufficient evidence of originality and therefore, he came to the
    conclusion that the design is not a new and original one registered
    prior to the date of registration. therefore, the question is whether
    the design is new and original.

<blockquote id="blockquote_47">     29. <a href="/doc/562927/" id="a_119">Section 4</a> which is couched in the negative terms, says that the
    design which is not a new or original then such design cannot be
    registered. therefore, the question is the design which has been
    prepared by the German Company and which has been sold to the
    respondent which became the proprietor of it, is a new or original
    or not. In this connection, the burden was on the complainant
    to show that the design was not original or new. We have no
    hesitation in recording a finding that the burden was not
    discharged by the complainant. It only tried to prove on the basis
    of the letter of the German company that they produced the rollers
    and sold in market but it was nowhere mentioned that these rollers
    have been reproduced on the glass sheets by the German company
    or by any other company. The expression, "new or original"
    appearing in <a href="/doc/562927/" id="a_120">Section 4</a> means that the design which has been
    registered has not been published anywhere or it has been made
    known to the public. The expression, "new or original" means that
    it had been invented for the first time or it has not been reproduced
    by anyone.

<blockquote id="blockquote_48">    30. The respondent company purchased the rollers from the
    German company and got it registered with the registering
    authority that by these rollers they are going to produce the design
    on the glass sheets. Design has been defined in <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_121">Section 2(d)</a> which
    means that a feature of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or
    composition of lines or colours applied to any article whether in
    two dimensional or three dimensional or in both forms, by any
    industrial process. That means that a feature or a pattern which is
    registered with the registering authority for being produced on a
    particular article by any industrial process whether manual,
    mechanical or chemical or by any other means which appears in a
    finished article and which can be judged solely by eye appeal. The
    definition of design as defined in <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_122">Section 2(d)</a> read with
    application for registration and rule 11 with form 1 makes it clear
    that the design which is registered is to be applied to any finished
    article which may be judged solely by eye appeal. A conjoined
    reading of these three provisions makes it clear that a particular
    shape or a particular configuration is to be registered which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                           Page 45 of 67</span>
     sought to be produced on any article which will have visual appeal.
    Such design once it is registered then it cannot be pirated by any
    other person. But the question is whether it is new or original.

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">    31. In the present case, the complainant relied on the
    correspondence of the German company which produced the
    rollers and sold it to the respondent herein and it gave the
    proprietary right to the present respondent company. 'Proprietor' as
    defined in <a href="/doc/1550009/" id="a_123">Section 2(j)</a> of the Act means that any person who
    acquires the design or right to apply the design to any article, either
    exclusively of any other person or otherwise, means, in the respect
    and to the extent in and to which the design or right has been so
    acquired. therefore, this right to reproduce this design on an article
    has been given by the German company to the respondent. But
    again the question is whether the complainant had discharged their
    burden to show that this design is not new or original. For this
    purpose, they only banked upon the letter of the German company
    which prepared these rollers and there is no evidence to show that
    the design which was reproduced on glass sheets was either
    produced by any other agency. therefore, the expression that ' new
    or original' in this context has to be construed that whether this
    design has ever been reproduced by any other company on the
    glass sheet or not.

<blockquote id="blockquote_50">    32. There is no evidence whatsoever produced by the complainant
    either before the Assistant Controller or before any other forum to
    show that this very design which has been reproduced on the glass
    sheet was manufactured anywhere in the market in India or in
    United Kingdom. There is no evidence to show that these rollers
    which were manufactured or originally designed by the company
    was marketed by this company to be reproduced on glass sheets in
    India or even in United Kingdom. This proprietorship of this
    design was acquired by this respondent from the German company
    and there is no evidence on record to show that these rollers were
    used for designing them on the glass sheets in Germany or in India
    or in United Kingdom.

<blockquote id="blockquote_51">     33. What is required to be registered is a design which is sought to
    be reproduced on an article. This was the roller which was
    designed and if it is reproduced on an article it will give such
    visual feature to the design. No evidence was produced by the
    complainant before the Assistant Controller that anywhere in any
    part of the world or in India this design was reproduced on glass or
    it was registered anywhere in India or in any part of the world. The
    German company only manufactured the roller and this roller
    could have been used for bringing a particular design on the glass,
    rexine or leather but we are concerned here with the reproduction
    of the design from the roller on glass which has been registered
    before the registering authority. therefore, this design which is to
    be reproduced on the article i.e. glass has been registered for the
    first time in India and the proprietary right was acquired from the
    German company. We have gone through the letter of the German
    company and it nowhere says that this was reproduced on a glass
    sheet. No evidence was produced by the complainant that this
    design was reproduced on a glass sheet in Germany or in India.
    The contents of the letter are very clear. It shows that it was
    designed in 1992 and was marketed in 1993. But there is no
    evidence to show that this design was reproduced on glass sheet
    anywhere in Germany.

       interpretation and application. Some of the more important
       embellishments to the definition, such as those dealing with

       found their way into the pre-2001 statutory definition as a
       result of the explicit adoption such requirements were held to
       be implicit in the earlier and less elaborate statutory

       of shape configuration, pattern or ornament applied to an
       article...." Thus a registrable design, as defined by the RDA
       (A), must have reference to some specific article to which it is
       to be applied. The design to be registered " is a shape,
       configuration or pattern to be applied a particular specified
       article". It can be readily seen that a particular pattern of
       surface ornamentation could be applied to wide range of

        different articles. An application for registration was not in
       respect of the pattern as such, but in respect of its
       application to the specific article named. If it was desired to
       register the same design, e.g. a surface pattern or
       decoration, in respect of a series of different articles (apart
       from the special case of articles which together form a set),
       then a separate application had to be made in respect of
       each article, and each application to register was
       numbered separately and treated as a separate and
       distinct application.

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">       In the case of designs consisting of features of shape or
       configuration, there may of course be cases where the design
       is intrinsically applicable only to a specific kind of article.
       The article itself does not, however, constitute the design. In
       Dover v. Nurnberger Celluloid Waren Fabrik Gebruder Wolff,
       Buckley L.J. said:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">       Design means, therefore, a conception or suggestion or idea of
       a shape or of a picture or of a device or of some arrangement
       which can be applied to an article by some manual,
       mechanical or chemical means. It is a conception, suggestion,
       or idea, and not an article, which is the thing capable of being
       registered.... It is a suggestion of form or ornament to be
       applied to a physical body.

<blockquote id="blockquote_63">       [Pugh v. Riely Cycle Co Ltd. (1912) 29 R.P.C. 196]

       Accordingly, it is submitted that a design is an idea or
       conception as to features of shape, configuration, pattern or
       ornament applied to an article. Although that idea, while still
       in the author's head, may be potentially capable of
       registration, in fact it must be reduced to visible form to
       be identifiable, and until it is so reduced there is nothing
       capable of registration, It may be so rendered either by its
       being embodied in the actual article, or by its being placed
       upon a piece of paper in such a way that the shape or

        other features of the article to be made are clear to the
       eye. Whenever the means of identification (under some of the
       old Acts, provision was made whereby a mere verbal
       description could in some cases be accepted as sufficient), as
       soon as the idea is reduced to a form which is identifiable,
       there is something which is a "design", and which, if new or
       original, may be registrable."

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">    36. Similarly our attention was also invited to para 27.07 of the law
    of Copyright and Industrial Designs by P. Narayanan (Fourth
    Edition) which reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_65">       "27.07. Design as a conception or idea "Design means a
       conception or suggestion or idea of a shape or of a picture or
       of a device or of some arrangement which can be applied to
       an article by some manual, mechanical or chemical means
       mentioned in the definition clause. It is a suggestion of form
       or ornament to be applied to a physical body". It is a
       conception, suggestion or idea, and not an article, which is
       the thing capable of being registered. It may according to the
       definition clause, be applicable to any article whether for the
       pattern or for the shape or configuration or for the ornament
       thereof (that is to say of the article) or for any two or more of
       such purposes. The design, therefore, is not the article, but is
       the conception, suggestion, or idea of a shape, picture, device
       or arrangement which is to be applied to the article, by some
       one of the means to be applied to a physical body.

<blockquote id="blockquote_67">    Therefore, the concept of design is that a particular figure

    therefore, whenever registration is required then those
    configuration has to be chosen for registration to be reproduced in
    any article. The idea is that the design has to be registered which
    is sought to be reproduced on any article. therefore, both the
    things are required to go together, i.e. the design and the design
    which is to be applied to an article.

    article like glass which is registered. This could have been
    registered with rexin or leather. therefore, for registration of a

    sought to be reproduced on a particular article has to be applied.
    As in the present case the design sought to be reproduced on a
    glass-sheet has been registered and there is no evidence to show
    that this design was registered earlier to be reproduced on glass in
    India or any other part of the country or in Germany or even for
    that matter in United Kingdom, therefore, it is for the first time
    registered in India which is new and original design which is to

    accepted that this design was not new and original.

    website had been downloaded from the United Kingdom Patent
    Office effecting patent that may be applied to glass sheets. No
    evidence has been produced to show that M/s.Vegla Vereinigte
    Glaswerke Gmbh had manufactured this design in glass sheet or
    not. It is only a design downloaded from the website of the Patent
    office in U.K. and it is not known whether it was reproduced on
    glass-sheet in U.K. or not. In this connection, the Assistant
    Controller has only observed that he has made a visual comparison
    of the U.K. registered design No. 2022468 with the impugned
    design No. 190336 and he was satisfied that both the designs make
    same appeal to the eye and there was sufficient resemblance
    between the two designs. therefore, the Assistant Controller held
    that the impugned design was prior published and it could not be
    said to be new or original. The Assistant Controller further
    observed that the proprietor of this design had not been able to
    make a difference between the U.K. design and the present design.

    inconclusive and it does not give us any assurance that it was a
    proper comparison of the two patters by the Assistant Controller.
    Learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court had occasion to
    go through both the patterns and found that there is no comparison.
    Likewise, the glass-sheets were placed before us with all
    dimensions along with a copy of the print out of the United

    between the two. From the visual appeal placed before us, learned
    Single Judge has rightly concluded that there is no comparison of
    pattern or configuration of two designs. We fully agree with the

paras it becomes clear that the Supreme Court in no manner laid down an

absolute rule that there can never be prior publication although in the public

record of the Registrar of Design abroad a particular design is found to be

registered. The Supreme Court in fact has specifically held that facts in each

case have to be very minutely examined and Courts have to be extremely

cautious by thoroughly scrutinizing the evidence in each case for deciding

whether the public record available in Registrar of Design abroad could or

could not be taken as prior publication, and in the peculiar facts of the case

before the Supreme Court when we refer to paragraphs 45 to 47 it becomes

clear that the Supreme Court approved the view of the learned Single Judge

of the Calcutta High Court in Gopal Glass Work's case because even the

Supreme Court found that sufficient evidence was not led on behalf of the

objector to the registered design and that the documents downloaded through

Russell-Clarke and Howe on Industrial Designs VIIIth Edition:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">      What counts as "published" for the purpose of calling into 3-097
      question the novelty of a later design registration? This is
      broader than the word at first suggests. It is by no means
      limited to the publishing of a design in a printed publication,
      although it includes that. In practical terms, there are two
      main ways in which a design can be published: by prior use of
      the design, by selling or displaying to the public articles to
      which the design has been applied; and by paper publications
      of one sort or another. It is not, in fact, necessary that
      publication should be on paper; an oral disclosure, provided it
      is non-confidential, will amount to publication.

<blockquote id="blockquote_79">      Re-registration of the same design for different articles, or
      a similar design for same or different articles



      A special exception existed to the general rule that the novelty 3-105
      of a design will be destroyed by the prior registration or
      publication of that design as applied to any kind of article. By
      S.4(1) of the RDA(A), the proprietor of a registered design
      was entitled to apply for registration of the same design, or a
      design with modifications or variations not sufficient to affect
      its identity, in respect of another article. His own previous
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                             Page 56 of 67</span>
       registration, or the publication of his design as registered, does
      not then destroy the novelty of his new design registration in
      respect of the new article, but his term of protection is limited
      to the term of the original design. This, in effect, gave the
      proprietor of a design registration the ability to extend the
      scope of the registration during its lifetime to cover further
      articles, although in formal terms each application to protect
      his design on a new article will be a separate application
      leading to a separate design registration. It appears that his
      application for registration of the design on the new article
      must precede his actual use of the design on the new article.
      This is because, if he uses the design on an article which falls
      outside the scope of his earlier registration, then that will not 3-106
      count as a publication "of the registered design", which is all
      that s.4(1) of the RDA(A) shields him against as regards the
      novelty of his new application.

<blockquote id="blockquote_80">         A person who makes an application to register a design and
      finds that it has previously been registered in respect of a
      different article was allowed to buy up the earlier design

      he did so he could take advantage of this rule in the same way
      as if he had himself been the owner of the earlier registration
      all along.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_81">         The same rule applied to the registration (whether in respect
      of the same article or a different article) of a design which is
      not exactly the same as the earlier registered design, but has
      "modifications or variations not sufficient to alter the character
      or substantially to affect the identity thereof". However, this
      provision has been interpreted narrowly so that practically any
      significant change or difference between the earlier and later
      design will destroy the protective effect of this provision. For
      an applicant to rely on s.4(1)(b), the subject of his application
      must have substantial identity with his prior published design.

<blockquote id="blockquote_82">       In Sebel Ltd's Application (No.1), it was held that substitution
      in the old design of a different stand did substantially alter the
      identity of the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_125">article (a rocking horse</a>), and that the subsection
      did not apply. Since the stand had already been published in
      an advertisement showing it applied to another horse, it was
      held that design failed to qualify for novelty under s.1, the said
      stand being a mere trade variant. In Sebel Ltd's Application
      (No.2), a design was held not to fall within s.4 because the
      character of the design was different from the character of the
      applicant‟s earlier design. Thus it seems that the applicant‟s
      own earlier design may be sufficiently similar to destroy the
      novelty of his later application for protection of his modified
      design, and yet too different to allow him to take advantage of 3-108
      the protection of RDA(A) s.4(1). This is an odd and
      unfortunate result if it is indeed correct.

<blockquote id="blockquote_83">          Publication in documents

      In cases of publication of a design by prior use as applied to an
      article, normally the only questions which arise are whether it
      has been published at all (i.e whether the articles to which it
      has been applied have been disclosed to the public), and
      whether the design is similar enough to the design in suit to
      destroy the latter‟s novelty. But where the novelty of a design
      is tested against a prior published document, a number of 3-109
      additional questions can arise which do not arise in the case of
      a prior use.
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_84">        First, it may not be clear whether or not the document
      discloses a design as applied to an article at all. A trade
      catalogue containing photographs or illustrations of articles to
      which a design has been applied may be a clear enough case.

<blockquote id="blockquote_85">       But the publication in a document of a pattern or picture does 3-110
      not as such destroy the novelty of a design which consists of
      applying that pattern or picture to an article. For it to destroy
      the novelty of such a design, the paper publication must
      suggest explicitly or implicitly by context that the pattern or
      picture should be applied to an article.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_86">           Secondly, the pattern (if it is two-dimensional) or shape (if
      it is three-dimensional) of the design may not be clear from the
      document. Particularly in a case where it involves a written
      description rather than an explicit picture or illustration, there 3-111
      may be room for argument as to the precise nature of the
      design which the document discloses, before one can go on to
      ask whether or not it is similar enough to the later design to
      destroy novelty.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_87">         Thirdly, a paper publication may be shielded from
      destroying the novelty of a later design registration by the
      special provisions of subss.6(4)-(5) of the RDA(A). These
      provisions allowed the owner of copyright in an artistic work
      to exploit his work so long as he did not apply it industrially to
                                                                         3-118
      an article, without his own exploitation of it counting against
      the novelty of his own later application for a design
      registration covering the artistic work as applied to an article.
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_88">        Does the document disclose a design applied to an
      article?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_89">       In order to destroy the novelty of a design registration, an
      earlier design must be published "in respect of the same or any
      other article".     Mere publication of the pattern which
      constitutes the design was therefore not sufficient to destroy
      the novelty of a design registration, which consisted of the
      application of that pattern to an article. In principle, the same

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">FAO (OS) No.458/2009                                                Page 59 of 67</span>
       holds true of the publication of a shape, although it is less easy
      to envisage cases where the publication of a shape does not
      implicitly convey the article to which that shape is to be
      applied. Thus, novelty may reside in the application of an old
      shape or pattern to new subject-matter. This was first laid
      down in the leading case of Saunders v Wiel. There, the 3-119
      design consisted of the handle of a spoon made to represent
      Westminster Abbey seen from a particular point of view. The
      design had actually been copied from a photograph of the
      Abbey.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_90">       The validity of the design was upheld, Bowen L.J. saying

         "It seems to me that the novelty and originality in the
      design, within this section, is not destroyed by its being taken
      from a source common to mankind...The novelty may consist
      in the applicability to the article of manufacture of a drawing
      or design which is taken from a source to which all the world
      may resort. Otherwise, it would be impossible to take any
      natural or artistic object and to reduce it into a design
      applicable to an article of manufacture, without also having
      this consequence following, that you could not do it at all in
      the first place unless you were to alter the design so as not to
      represent exactly the original; otherwise there would be no
      novelty in it, because it would be said that the thing which was
      taken was not new. You could not take a tree and put it on a
      spoon, unless you drew the tree in some shape in which a tree
      never grew, nor an elephant unless you drew it and carved it of
      a kind which had never been seen. An illustration, it seems to
      me, that may be taken about this is what we all know as the
      Apostles spoons. The figures of the Apostles are figures 3-120
      which have been embodied in sacred art for centuries, and
      there is nothing new in taking the figures of the Apostles, but
      the novelty of applying the figures of the Apostles to spoons
      was in contriving to design the Apostles‟ figures so that they

       should be applicable to that particular subject-matter. How
      does a building differ from that? In no sense it seems to me.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_91">          It should be recalled that under the 1949 Act, if a pattern
      (or shape) has been published in respect of any article, the
      publication will destroy the novelty of any design which
      consists of the application of that pattern (or shape) to an
      article of any kind, however different it is from the kind of
      article to which the publication suggests that the design should
      be applied. However, the publication will not invalidate such
      later design registrations if it does not suggest the application
      of the pattern (or shape) to an article at all. Thus, a series of
      pictures published in a fine art catalogue would not destroy the
      novelty of a later design consisting of the application of one of 3-121
      those pictures to, say, the back of a chair, because a painting or
      picture simpliciter is not an "article". But the same pictures
      published in a catalogue of patterns for application to
      wallpaper would destroy the novelty of such a later design
      registration, because wallpaper is an article.

<blockquote id="blockquote_92">       What design is disclosed by a prior published document?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_93">      Assuming that a prior published document does satisfy the
      requirement that it discloses a design, i.e a shape or pattern, as
      applied or to be applied to an article, the next question may be
      what is the shape or pattern which it discloses? In some cases
      this will be clear, for instance where the publication contains
      explicit pictures or illustrations. However, it may be less clear
      and the disclosure may consist in whole or in part of written
      text which needs to be interpreted, or general instructions
      which can be put into practice in a variety of ways. In such
      cases the test to be applied is that borrowed from the hpre- 3-122
      1977 patent law of anticipation, i.e that the prior art document
      must contain "clear and unmistakable directions" to
      make an article with the shape or pattern which is the same as ,

       or similar enough to the registered design in suit to deprive it
      of novelty.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_94">       This was laid down in Rosedale Associated Manufacturers
      Ltd v Airfix Ltd. Lord Evershed M.R. said

       "In this respect the test of prior publication of an alleged
      invention should, in my judgment, be no less applicable in the
      case of a registered design, and as regards the former, I
      venture to cite once more the oft-quoted language of Lord
      Westbury in Hills v Evans: 'The antecedent statement must, in
      order to invalidate the sub-sequent patent, be such that a
      person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once
      perceive and understand and be able practically to apply the
      discovery without the necessity of making further
      experiments.‟ By a like reasoning, to my mind, if a document
      is to constitute prior publication, then a reader of it, possessed 3-123
      of ordinary knowledge of the subject, must from his reading of
      the document be able at least to see the design in his mind‟s
      eye and should not have to depend on his own originality to
      construct the design from the ideas which the document may
      put into his head."

      apparatus described in an earlier specification could have been
      used to produce this or that result. It must also be shown that
      the specification contains clear and unmistakable directions so
      to use it.‟ These observations by Parker J. were cited with
      approval by Lord Dunedin in British Thomson Houston Co v

          delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee) in Pope
         Alliance Corporation v Spanish River Pulp &amp; Paper Mills, Ltd.
         In the latter case and at the same page Lord Dunedin posed the
         test as follows: „would a man who was grappling with the
         problem solved by the Patent attacked, and having no
         knowledge of that Patent, if he had had the alleged anticipation 3-124
         in his hand, have said "that gives me what I wish"? It is true
         that these citations were related to anticipation of inventions,

<blockquote id="blockquote_97">            It is not permissible to make a mosaic of a number of prior
         documents for the purpose of attacking novelty. If the attack
         on novelty is to succeed, the design must be disclosed in the
         single prior document. If, however, one document contains a
         reference to another document, the two may be read together.

<p id="p_93">23.            In view of the above discussion, the following conclusions in

<p id="p_94">(i)      Existence of a design registered abroad in a convention country is not

a ground under <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_126">Section 19(1)(a)</a> for cancellation of a design registered in

 application first made in the convention country abroad. Once, the foreign

registered design becomes registered in India, the very fact that it is an

Indian registered design it will be a previously registered design in India,

and by virtue of the priority rule the same will be a ground for cancellation

of a design subsequently registered in India on an application made after the

date of the priority date given of the application made abroad for registration

of the design in a convention country.

<p id="p_98">(v)   What is publication is essentially a question of fact to be decided as

per the evidence led in each case. Existence of a design in the publication

record/office of a Registrar of design abroad may or may not depending on

the facts of each case amount to prior publication and there would be prior

publication only if the prior registered design is made public and has that

much necessary clarity as applied to a specific article capable of judged by

the visual appearance or the eye of the mind, that by use of the said

knowledge and information in the public record of the Registrar of design

office, an article can be made using that design which will be a piracy or

violation of that design i.e putting it differently unless and until there is

complete clarity and understanding to the naked eye or the eye of the mind

of the foreign registered design as found in the public record of the Registrar

of design qua a specific article, it cannot be said that such public record will

amount to prior publication.

 public record in the office of Registrar of design in a convention country

abroad may or may not amount to prior publication inasmuch existence of a

design in a public record of Registrar of design in a convention country

abroad may or may not, depending on the facts of a particular case, amount

or not amount to publication abroad, and which depends on the complete

clarity available to the eye of the design found in the public record so that it

can be said to be understood for being applied to a specific article. Each

case has to be necessarily judged by putting the subject design with the

articles side by side with the prior publication material and only after

thoroughly scrutinizing the same any finding can be given of existence or

non-existence of prior publication.

<p id="p_100">25.          So far as the merits of the present case of existence of prior

publication in the facts of the present case are concerned, we find that

Division Bench has approved the decision of the learned Single Judge of

existence of prior publication in the facts of the present case because the

spatula in question was found in actual use prior to registration in India, and

with respect to which the relevant observations are made by the Division

Bench in paras 12 and 15 of the judgment/reference order of the Division

Bench dated 8.10.2010.       We may, of course, hasten to add that any

 observations made in an interim order are always prima facie in nature and

are made only for the purpose of disposing of an interim injunction, and the

issue of prior publication in the facts of the present case will be finally

decided uninfluenced by any observations qua the factual aspects made at

the interim stage as to existence of the spatula abroad after evidence is led

by both the parties in this case.
