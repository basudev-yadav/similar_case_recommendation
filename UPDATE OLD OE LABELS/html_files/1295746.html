K. Ramaswamy,J.
</p><p id="p_2">       This  appeal   by special  leave arises from the
judgment of the	 Andhra Pradesh High Court made in Writ
Appeal No.692  of 1982	on March  2, 1983. Notification
under Section  4 [1]  of the   <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition	 Act</a> [1
of 1894]  [for short, "the Act"] acquiring the lands in
question to  provide  house  sites  to	  Class	     IV
employees    of	 the  appellant-Society,  was published
in   the State	 Gazette  on   January 11,   1979.  The
substance of   the  notification was  published in  the
locality on march 17, 1979. Enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_2">Section 5A</a> of
the Act	 was conducted	and    the  Land    Acquisition
Officer [LAO]  submitted his report  to the  Government
on June	 19, 1979.  Declaration under  <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_3">Section	 6</a>  was
published on  March 29,	 1980. The LAO after conducting
enquiry made his award under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_4">Section 11</a> on December 13,
1980 and   notice  thereof   was    served    on    the
respondents. It	  is  stated that  since the respondent
did not	 attend the   office of	 the LAO,  as directed,
on January 1, 1981, the	 compensation was  deposited in
the court   of	the Subordinate	 Judge.	  It is	 stated
that   after LAO   had	taken possession  of   the land
from the  respondents, he  had handed over the	land to
the appellant	but  actual   date  was	 not mentioned.
It    is   also	  stated   by	the   appellants   that
thereafter plots  were laid  out and  were allotted  to
its members and	 some members  had started construction
of their  houses. At  that stage,  the respondents  had
filed the writ petition on  August 9, 1982 and the Full
Bench following	 its judgment  in <a href="/doc/1377511/" id="a_5">Yadaiah   &amp; Ors.  vs.
Govt.  of   A.P</a>.[(1983)	 1    DLT  233]	 quashed    the
notification   and the	 declaration  holding that  the
notifications	under	 <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_6">Section   4(1)</a>	    were    not
simultaneously published  in the  Gazette  and	in  the
locality.
</p><p id="p_3">     Thus this	appeal by  special leave.	Shri C.
Sitaramaiah,  learned	  senior  counsel    for    the
appellant contended   that  in	 <a href="/doc/1553455/" id="a_7">Deepak Pahwa	v.  Lt.
Governor</a> [(1985)  1  SCR 588]  this Court had overruled
the Full  Bench	 decision  in	 Yadaiah's  case    and
approved   of the   ratio   in	various Division  Bench
judgments   of	 that	Court	referred  therein.  The
State legislature   amended    the    Act    by	   Land
Acquisition [Andhra  Pradesh Amendment	and Validation]
Act, 1983  [Act	  9 of	  1983]	 [for	 short,	   "the
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_8">Validation   Act</a>"] giving retrospective	 effect,  viz.,
w.e.f.	September  12, 1975, the date on which the Land
Acquisition [Andhra Pradesh Amendment]	Act,  1976  had
come   into    force.	 Though	   the	Validation  Act
retrospectively prescribes publication of the substance
of  the <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_9">Section	 4</a> [1] notification within 40 days from
the  date of  its publication  in the District Gazette,
the publication	 of the	 substance even	 after 40  days
does not  become invalid   by  the   ratio in	 Deepak
Pahwa's case and by operation of  clause [b] of <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_10">Section
4</a> of the Validation Act. He also  contended that  since
possession   had already   been taken, after  the award
was made,   the	 land stood vested in the State and the
beneficiaries, free  from all  encumbrances.  The  High
Court, therefore,   was	 not   right in	  its  quashing
<a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_11">Section 4</a>  [1] notification  and <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_12">Section 6</a> declaration.
It  is	 also  contended   that	 the  Land  Acquisition
[Amendment] Act	 [68 of	  1984]	    provides  procedure
for   publication    of	  the  notification   in    the
Gazette,   newspapers  and  the	 local publication  and
limitation    for    publication   of	the declaration
under <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_13">Section  6</a> within one year from last of the dates
of   the publication  under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_14">Section  4</a> [1]  which would
indicate that  various publications under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_15">Section 4</a> [1]
could be  done	 at periodical	intervals without  time
limit within  the   maximum    period	of   one  year.
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_16">The  Validation	 Act</a>
thereafter also does not hold the field.
</p><p id="p_4">       Shri  A.	  Subbarao, learned   counsel  for  the
respondents contended	that	after  the   <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_17">Validation
Act</a>   was   given retrospective effect	from  September
12,   1975   and   local publication  made   after   40
days,	the   notification  under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_18">Section 4</a>  [1] became
invalid; consequently, the declaration under <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_19">Section  6</a>
is  not est.  He placed	 reliance  on  <a href="/doc/845127/" id="a_20">Land Acquisition
Officer,     Hyderabad	Urban	Development  Authority,
Hyderabad, A.P.	  v.  Mohd.Amri	 Khan &amp;	 Ors</a>. [(1986) 1
SCC 3]	and <a href="/doc/717564/" id="a_21">C.K.   Narayana  Chary  &amp;Ors. v. Pothepalli
Ashanna &amp; Ors</a>. [(1986) 1  SCC 9]  the ratio  wherein it
was held  that local  publication   after    40	   days
invalidates  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_22">Section  4</a>	 [1] notification.
	 The   respective contentions  give rise to the
question: whether  the	 view of   the	High   Court is
correct in  law? The  Land Acquisition	[Andhra Pradesh
Amendment] Act,	  1976	was enacted  with   a view   to
accelerate the	pace of	 acquisitions to provide  house
sites	to the	 poor  and  to	empower	 the Collectors
to issue  notification under  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_23">Section  4</a>  [11  and  the
declaration under  <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_24">Section 6</a>  and their	 publication in
the respective	 district     Gazettes	 and   to  make
payment	 of compensation to  the lands	so acquired  if
the compensation does not  exceed Rs.500/- and in other
cases in  installments not   exceeding	 Rs.500/-  with
interest  at  6%  on  such installments.
</p><p id="p_5">       In  furtherance	 thereof, acquisition	of  the
lands	of private  persons   on  massive    scale  was
undertaken  in	 all  the  districts  of    the	 State.
Collectors exercised   power   under  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_25">Section 17</a>    [4]
dispensing  with  the  enquiry	under  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_26">Section	5A</a>  and
notifications under  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_27">Section  4</a>	 [11  and  declarations
under <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_28">Section  6</a>   were simultaneously published in the
Gazette. But  the officers  at the  lower level delayed
publication of	the notification  under	 <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_29">section 4</a>  [1]
Consequentially, spate	of litigation  had   sprung  up
in  Andhra  Pradesh  High  Court invariably challenging
the validity of the notifications.
</p><p id="p_6">      As  noticed  by  this  Court  in	Deepak	Pahwa's
case [supra],  several Division Bench of the High Court
have taken  consistent	 view	   that	   simultaneous
publication   of   the notification under  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_30">Section 4</a>[1]
in the	  Gazette  and	  local	 publication  of    its
substance   was not   mandatory.  A   single Judge  and
Division Bench	had struck  a discarded note leading to
reference   to the   Full Bench which in Yadaiah's case
had held  that the  publication of  the notification in
the Gazette  and the local publication of its substance
should be  done on the same  day. Following  that view,
the	same	Full	Bench	 quashed  the  impugned
notification and  declaration covered  in that	appeal.
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_31">The Validation Act</a> expressly referred the said decision
and   validated with   retrospective  effect   all  the
notifications issued earlier than the date on which the
A.P. Amendment	Act,   1976 came  into force,  removing
the base  of the  Full	 Bench judgment.  <a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_32">Section 2</a>  of
the   Validation  Act  provides	 that	 the  Collector
shall, within 40 days from the date of	the publication
of such	  notification,	  cause	  the  substance of the
notification published. This led to further litigation.
</p><p id="p_7">       A  three-Judge  Bench was  required to  consider
whether delay  in   giving  public    notice  in    the
locality   makes   the notification  invalid. Yadaiah's
case was cited in support of the  contention.	Therein
a   combined  notification  under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_33">Sections 4</a>  and <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_34">17(4)</a>
and declaration	 under <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_35">Section 6</a> were published in  the
Gazette on  June 18,  1984 and	public	notice	of  the
substance of   the  notification   under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_36">Section  4</a> was
given in   the locality	 on July  17, 1984 with a delay
of 29  days. Post-notification	 delay	of  eight years
due to	inter- departmental  correspondence was pressed
into service  to hold  that there  was no real urgency.
Legality of  invoking urgency clause and  consequential
omission  to  hold  enquiry  under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_37">Section 5A</a> was under
challenge.
</p><p id="p_8">     This Court	 had  held  that  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_38">Section  4</a>  [1]  does
not prescribe  that  public  notice  of	 the  substance
of   the notification  should  be given in the locality
simultaneously	with   the     publication  of	    the
notification  in the  Official Gazette	or  immediately
thereafter.   They   are   two	 steps required	 to  be
taken	under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_39">Section	4</a>   [1]	 before	 taking further
steps	under sub-section [2]. The time factor is not a
vital	element and   there  is	 no warrant to read the
words 'simultaneously' or  'immediately thereafter'  in
<a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_40">Section	  4</a> [1].  They	 are not   required to	be done
simultaneously	       or    immediately    thereafter.
Contemporaneity may  involve a	gap of	time and by the
very nature  of the  things,  the  publication	in  the
Official   Gazette   and   the	public	notice	in  the
locality must	necessarily be	separated by  a gap  of
time. This  does   not mean  that the  publication  and
the  public notice may	be separated by a long interval
of time.  What is  necessary is	 that the continuity of
action should  not appear to be	 broken by  a deep gap.
If there  is publication  in the  Gazette and  if there
is public  notice in  the locality, the requirements of
<a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_41">Section 4</a>   [1] must be held to be satisfied unless the
two are	 unlinked from	each other  by a gap of time so
long   as it may lead one to the prima facie conclusion
of lack	 of   bona fides    in	the    proceedings  for
acquisition. It	 was held   that  when	 the Government
exercises   power   under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_42">Section  17</a> [4], it obviously
feels that  urgency is	such that  it does   not  brook
delay	and,   therefore,  the	Government directs that
possession  of	 the  land   be	 taken	immediately  on
publication of	 the  declaration under	 <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_43">Section 6</a>  and
followed by  notice   under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_44">Section  9</a>. Delay  of eight
years on  the part  of the   tardy  officials  to  take
further action	in the	matter of  acquisition	 is not
sufficient to	nullify	  the  urgency which existed at
the time  of issuing  the notification and to hold that
there was  never any  urgency. This Court overruled the
Full   Bench   judgment	  in   Yadaiah's  case	[supra]
and approved  of   the Division	  Bench	  judgments  of
the    Andhra  Pradesh High  Court,  apart  from  other
cases.
</p><p id="p_9">       In  Mohd.   Amri Khan's	case  and  C.K.Narayana
Chary's cases  [supra]	 this	Court	considered  the
effect	 of   the <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_45">Validation Act</a>  and another  Bench of
three Judges  held that	 after	 the	<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_46">Validation  Act</a>
had   come    into   force   with retrospective effect,
despite the   law   in	  Deepak    Pahwa's  case,  the
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_47">Validation Act</a>	 is  required	to be	 given	effect.
Notification  and    public  notice  of	 the  substance
thereof has to be  given in the locality within 40 days
from the  date of  the publication   of	 <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_48">Section  4</a> [1]
notification which would apply	to  every  notification
issued	   by	  the	 appropriate  Government  after
September 12,	1975.  ln case	the substance  of  such
notification was not given in the locality within 40
days  from   the  date	 of  the   publication	of  the
notification in the Gazette, it would introduce a fatal
infirmity invaliding  such notification. In that case a
delay of more than 40 days in  the   local  publication
of  the	  substance  of	  the notification violated the
mandate enacted	 in sub-section [1] of <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_49">Section	4</a> as it
stood from  and after September 12, 1975. Therefore, it
was liable to be struck down.
</p><p id="p_10">      The  Parliament	enacted	 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_50">Amendment  Act</a>	 68  of
1984  prescribing   the	    procedural	   steps     in
publication   of   the notification  under   <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_51">Section  4</a>
[1]    and    declaration    under  <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_52">Section  6</a>	without
prescribed  time   limit  with	 consequences  of  non-
compliance thereof   and  in <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_53">Section 11A</a> declaring that
if the	steps respectively  prescribed therein	are not
taken, the acquisition entails	lapse. In  other words,
The parliament	evinces	  that	  neither  simultaneous
nor   immediate	  local publication  of	  substance  is
insisted upon.	 But compliance thereof and publication
in two	newspapers are	required to be done. The object
is to  put the	owner or interested person on notice of
acquisition of	 the land  for public  purpose. In case
of  enquiry under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_54">Section 5A</a> it should also be done and
all the	 steps should be taken within one year from the
last of	 the	dates	 of    the    publication    of
notification	under  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_55">Section	4</a>  [1].	 Otherwise  the
acquisition  stands   lapsed.  Even   thereafter  award
should be   made  within   two years  from the date  of
the   publication    of	  <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_56">Section     6</a>	   declaration.
Publication of	 <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_57">Section  4(1)</a>	 notification in    the
Official Gazette,  its	 substance in  the locality and
also publication  of  the  notification	 in  two  local
newspapers is  envisaged but  no time  limit for  their
compliance   has    been    prescribed	thereunder.  if
urgency power	under  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_58">Section	17</a> [4]	is not invoked,
notice	under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_59">Section 5A</a> is required to be given to the
owner  and  then  enquiry  is  conducted  after	 giving
opportunity to	  the  owner	or  interested	person.
Thereafter, declaration	 should be published within one
year from  last of the dates  of the  publication under
<a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_60">Section 4</a>  [1]. In  other words,  from	 September  24,
1984,	all    the  prescribed procedural steps	 should
be   done but  without time  schedule. The  declaration
should be  published within  one  year.	 Maximum  outer
limit was  prescribed. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_61">The  Central Act</a>	 68 of 1984 and
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_62">Validation Act</a>	were enacted  under Entry  42  of  List
III [Concurrent	  List	  of   the   Seventh   Schedule
to    the  Constitution. By   operation	 of proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_63">Article 254</a>  of the  Constitution, the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_64">Amendment Act</a> 68
of 1984	 is made  operative and	 it   has occupied  the
same   field w.e.f.   September	  24,  1984. <a href="/doc/1752395/" id="a_65">In	  Gauri
Shankar	  Gaur &amp; Ors. v. State of U.P. &amp; Ors</a>. [(1994) 1

Parishad Adhiniyam,  1965 and held in paragraphs 39 and
40 that	 unless both   the     Acts  are   inconsistent
and    cannot	  operate harmoniously,	 the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_67">State Act</a>
prevails over	the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_68">Central Act</a> but to	 the extent  of
repugnancy the	<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_69">State Act</a> becomes void since it	 is not
fully consistent  with the  provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_70">Amendment
Act</a>.   In that	 case,	it   was held	that they  were
intended to  act  independently	 since	the  State  law
was enacted  under   Entries 56	  and  66   of List  II
[State	 List] while  the   <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_71">Amendment Act</a>   was enacted
under Entry 42 of the Concurrent List.
</p><p id="p_11">       The  rigor   of	40    days  thereby  under  the
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_72">Validation Act</a>	got  diffused	w.e.f.	September   24,
1984   since  it  is inconsistent with <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_73">Amendment Act</a> 68
of 1984.  It would  be seen  that the	<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_74">Validation  Act</a>
relates to  acquisition of the land for providing house
sites to  the poor  thereunder the  urgency power under
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_75">Section 17</a>   [4]  was	invoked and  possession was not
taken.	 The  notification  under  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_76">Section  4</a>  [1]  and
declaration  under    Section-	6  were	 simultaneously
published. But	public	notice of  the substance of the
notification was  not given simultaneously. But for the
Full  Bench  decision,	law  did    not	 insist	   upon
simultaneous   action which   was an impossibility  and
concept	  of	simultaneous	action	  was  judicial
interpretation	 and   its   effect   was  diffused  by
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_77">Validation  Act</a>.     It	  is	to  remember  that  the
acquisition was	 to provide   housing accommodation  to
the  poor.  The	 State Government always  exercise  the
power	of  publishing	the notification under	<a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_78">Section
4</a>   [1] and  the  declaration  under  <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_79">Section  6</a>    for
acquiring   the properties  in urban areas. The enquiry
under	<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_80">Section	  5A</a>   was   not  dispensed  with.  The
declaration under  <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_81">Section 6</a>  was published  only after
the enquiry under  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_82">Section 5A</a>  had  been  conducted  as
in   the present case.	The need,  therefore,  to  make
simultaneous local  notice of the substance was not the
requirement of	law and	 was not declared by this Court
in Deepak  Pahwa's case	 [supra	  and	also	several
decisions   of	 various  Division Benches of  the High
Courts. The   Full  Bench   judgment   was primarily in
relation to  the lands	in rural areas to provide house
sites	to the poor. The Full Bench also did not notice
the distinction	 since common  question was  argued and
the main   concentration     was    only      of    the
acquisitions   for providing  house  sites to the poor.
The same  was repeated	in  Mohd.  Amri	   Khan's  case
[supra]. C.K.  Narayana Chary's	 cases [supra]	closely
followed the heels of Mohd Amri Khan's case. Therefore,
the   <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_83">Validation Act</a>   was  not	  applicable   to   the
acquisition  made     pursuant	to    the  notification
published by the State Government in its State Gazette.
</p><p id="p_12">       That  apart,  as facts  disclose, the  award was
made on	 November 24,	1980  and the writ petition was
filed on  August 9,   1982.   It   is  not  in	dispute
that  compensation  was deposited in  the court	 of the
Subordinate  Judge.  lt	 is asserted by	 the appellant-
Society that   possession of the land was  delivered to
it and	the land  had been  divided and allotted to its
members	  for	construction   of   houses   and   that
construction of	 some houses  had been commenced by the
date the  writ	 petition was	filed.	It    would  be
obvious that the question of division of the properties
among its  members and	allotment of	the  respective
plots  to  them	 would	arise  only  after  the	   Land
Acquisition    Officer	had  taken  possession	of  the
acquired   land	 and	handed	it    over    to    the
appellant-Society. By  operation of <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_84">Section 16</a> the land
stood vested in the State  free from  all encumbrances.
<a href="/doc/1653863/" id="a_85">In Satendra   Prasad  Jain &amp;   Ors.  v.	 State of  U.P.
&amp;Ors</a>.[(1993) 4	SCC 369],  the question	 arose: whether
notification under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_86">Section 4</a>  and the declaration under
<a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_87">Section 6</a>   get	 lapsed if the award is not made within
two years   as	envisaged  under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_88">Section  11A</a>?	A Bench
of   three Judges  had held  that once	possession  was
taken and   the	 land  vested in  the Government, title
to the	land so	 vested in the State is subject only to
determination of  compensation	 and to pay the same to
the  owner.   Divesting	 the   title	to  the	   land
statutorily vested in the Government and reverting  the
same   to the	owner  is   not	 contemplated under the
Act. Only   <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_89">Section 48(1)</a>  gives power to withdrew from
acquisition  that too  before possession is taken. That
question did   not  arise  in this  case. The  property
under  acquisition   having	been  vested	in  the
appellants, in	the absence of	any power under the Act
to have The title of the appellants divested  except by
exercise of   the  power under	<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_90">Section 48(1)</a>,	  valid
title cannot be defeated. The exercise of the  power to
quash the   notification  under <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_91">Section	 4(1)</a> and   the
declaration   under    <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_92">Section	 6</a>     would   lead  to
incongruity.   Therefore,    the   High	  Court	  under
those circumstances  would not have interfered with the
acquisition  and   quashed     the   notification   and
declaration  under   <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_93">Sections  4</a>  and  <a href="/doc/89311729/" id="a_94">6</a>  respectively.
Considered from either perspective, we are of  the view
that the   High	 Court was  wrong in  allowing the writ
appeal.
</p><p id="p_13">	Consequentially,  the	 writ  appeal	 stands
dismissed and the order	 passed by  the learned	 single
Judge  in the writ petition stands restored. The appeal
is accordingly	allowed,  but,	in  the	 circumstances,
without costs.
