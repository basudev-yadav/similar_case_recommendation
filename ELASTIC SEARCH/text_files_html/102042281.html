<p id="p_3">2.   Plaintiffs claim to be the members of GlaxoSmithKline
     group of companies.      Plaintiff No. 1 is stated to be
     engaged     in   research,   development,    manufacture,

</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   As per the Plaintiffs, the trademark CLINDOXYL is an
     invented word having no dictionary meaning and has
     the highest degree of distinctiveness.      The Plaintiffs
     claim to have adopted the mark in the year 1994 in
     United States of A merica in relation to topical gel for
     the treatment of acne. The said trademark is stated to
     be continuously and extensively used since then. The

      Plaintiff claims to have commenced the user of mark
     CLINDOXYL in India in October, 2010, and is stated
     to be used in India continuously and extensively since
     then.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.   The Plaintiff claims to have registered the said mark in
     various countries across the world and in India the
     Plaintiff No. 1 is the registered proprietor of the mark
     CLINDOXYL in class 5 since 06.03.2006.

     and the Plaintiffs have been consistently promoting
     their medicinal preparations under the       CLINDOXY L
     mark through various media channels both electronic as

     worldwide sale figures of the Plaintiffs under the said
     trademark is in several million dollars and in India in
     several crores of Rupees.        The Plaintiffs have spent
     several lacs in the promotional expenses of the said

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                    Page 3 of 41</span>
<p id="p_7"> 6.   As per the Plaintiff, the Defendant has recently adopted
     a   deceptively     similar    mark    CLINOXID            that    is
     confusingly and deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs'
     registered trademark CLINDOXYL.                  The trademark
     adopted by the Defendant is also for an identical
     product that is skin ointment for treatment for acne.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   The Plaintiffs claim to have issued cease and desist
     notice dated 14.08.2012 to the Defendant to cease and
     desist from using the said mark and to amicably settle
     the matter.      The Defendant is claimed to have replied
     vide its reply dated 04.09.2012, contending that the
     rival marks were not deceptively similar, however it
     offered to amend its mark CLINOXID to CLINOXIDE
     to distinguish the same from the Plaintiffs' mark
     CLINDOXYL.           The offer of the Defendant was not
     accepted by the Plaintiffs on the ground that as per
     them, the said change was merely cosmetic and the
     mark would continue to remain deceptively similar. As
     per the Plaintiffs, the Defendant vide its reply dated
     26.12.2012       informed     the   Plaintiffs    that     it     had
     discontinued the trademark CLINOXID, and would
     continue its mark CLINO XIDE, which has also been
     registered.

<p id="p_9"> 8.    As    per     the      Plaintiffs,    the       Defendant's      marks
      CLINOXID         /    CLINOXIDE           /    CLINOXIDE-A          are
      deceptively and confusingly similar to the Plaintiffs'
      registered      mark        CLINDOXYL.               The    Plaintiffs
      accordingly filed the present suit for restraining the
      Defendant from infringing the registered trademark of
      the Plaintiffs and from passing off their goods as the
      goods of the Plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.    By    order     dated        02.12.2013        the   Defendant     was
      restrained by way of an ex parte ad interim injunction
      from marketing, selling, advertising pharmaceutical
      preparations         under     the   trademark        CLINOXID         /
      CLINOXIDE / CLINOXIDE-A or any other mark
      deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs' trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   The Defendant by the present application under the
      Order 39 Rule 4 CPC is seeking vacation of the ex parte
      ad interim injunction granted in favour of the Plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.   The Defendant has denied the claim of the Plaintiff.

      pharmaceutical company, w hose products and ethical

       quality.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.   The Defendant claims to have independently, honestly
      adopted the trademark CLINOXID by telescoping the
      prefix CLIN from the generic drug CLINDA MYCIN
      and suffix OXIDE from the generic drug BENZOY L
      PEROXIDE.          The Defendant claims to have made an
      application      for       registration     of      the      trademark
      CLINOXIDE on or about 19.10.2006. The application
      of the Defendant was not opposed and the trademark
      was registered on 27.03.2008. The Defendants claim to
      have     applied     for     registration      of   the      trademark
      CLINOXIDE-A in class 05 and the said trademark is
      also stated to be registered.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.   On 09.06.2009, the Defendant claim to have obtained
      necessary        permission       from         Food         and    Drug
      Administration,        Maharashtra,       to     manufacture         and
      market     the     aforesaid     drug     under       the    trademark
      CLINOXID, which was a variation of the Defendant's
      registered mark CLINOXIDE.                The Defendant claims
      that its total sales turnover was over few crores.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.   The Defendant admits having received the cease and
      desist notice, however, as a goodwill gesture offered to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                                 Page 6 of 41</span>
       use the registered trademark CLINOXID E instead of
      CLINOXID. The Defendant in the reply contended that
      it continues to claim the right for user of the said
      trademark. It is contended that in or about March 2011,
      the Defendant started using the trademark CLINOXID E
      in relation to the similar pharmaceutical products.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15.   As per the Defendant, the two marks are visually,
      phonetically and structurally different and there is no
      conflict between the two marks. As per the Defendant,
      the mark of the Plaintiffs is deceptively similar to
      another trademark INDOXYL. The Defendant further
      contended that the Plaintiffs are guilty of delay and
      laches and that the Plaintiffs chose to wait over a year
      before approaching this court for grant of ad interim
      relief.
</p>
<p id="p_18">16.   As per the Defendant since the mark of the Defendant is
      also registered, the Plaintiff cannot seek injunction
      against   the   Defendant,   who   is   also   a   registered
      proprietor of the two marks. As per the Defendant, it is
      customary in the pharmaceutical trade to coin a trade by
      telescoping two or more letters of the generic drug
      name to indicate to the doctors the name of the generic



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                      Page 7 of 41</span>
       drug for which the trademark is proposed to be used.
      As per the Defendant since the trademark is coined by a
      trader by telescoping two or more letters of the generic
      drug, the first user cannot claim its exclusive use. It is
      claimed that when a trademark is formed from the
      common generic name, no single proprietor can claim
      absolute monopoly in such name or mark.                     The
      Defendant has relied on various other marks registered
      with the mark CLIN as a prefix. The Defendant further
      contended that trade dress and packaging between the
      goods    of     the   Plaintiffs   and   the   Defendant     are
      completely different/dissimilar. As per the Defendant,
      the turnover of the Defendant is far greater than that of
      the Plaintiffs'.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17.   Learned senior counsel for the Plaintiffs has contended
      that both the marks are phonetically and visually similar
      and are for identical product that is skin preparation.
      As per the Plaintiffs, they adopted the trademark in the
      year 1994 in United States of America and used the
      same in India in the year 2010. Learned counsel for the
      Plaintiffs contended that the goods of the Plaintiffs are
      available across international borders and as such the
      Plaintiff is also a reputed company.           As per him, the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                        Page 8 of 41</span>
       registration of the trademark in India is on 06.03.2006,
      even though the physical user is in the year 2010. As
      compared        to   the   registration   of   the   Defendants
      trademark, which is in March, 2009 w.e.f. 19.10.2006,
      as the application was filed then, the Defendants got a
      drug licence for the purposes of manufacture of the said
      drugs on 09.06.2009 and has actually put the trademark
      to use in April, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_20">18.   Learned senior counsel for the Plaintiffs contended that
      the Plaintiffs were trying to resolve the dispute and
      settle the matter and as such there was some delay in
      approaching the court. However, he contended that a
      mere delay in approaching the Court would not be fatal
      to the claim of the Plaintiffs and the Plaintiffs cannot be
      denied the relief of injunction. However, for the
      determination of damages delay may be a factor, which
      the court may take into account.
</p>
<p id="p_21">19.   Learned senior counsel for the Plaintiffs submitted that
      the conduct of the Defendant is such that it adopts
      deceptively similar marks to already established marks.
      He relied on the list of oppositions cases filed against
      the Defendant by various entities for having adopted a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                         Page 9 of 41</span>
       deceptively similar mark to their trademarks.            He
      further contended that the settlement talks were without
      prejudice and the offer of the Defendant to change the
      mark to CLINOXIDE was never accepted.              Learned
      counsel for the Plaintiff contended that it has been held
      in the case of C LINIQUE L ABORATORIES LLC AND A NR.
      V S. G UFIC L IMITED AND A NR. 2009 (41) PTC 41(D EL),
      that suit is maintainable by a registered proprietor
      against   another   registered   proprietor.   He further
      submitted that as the user of the Plaintiffs is prior to the
      user of the Defendant, the Plaintiffs are also entitled to
      the relief of passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_22">20.   Learned counsel for the Defendant submitted that the
      priority in use of the Plaintiff is subsequent to the
      registration    of the   mark by the Defendant.          He
      submitted that the marks had been adopted honestly.
      He further submitted that passing of action cannot lie
      till the registration in favour of the Defendants is
      cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_23">21.   Learned counsel for the Defendant submitted that the
      offer made by the Defendant to change the mark from
      CLINOXID TO CLINOXIDE was still open.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                   Page 10 of 41</span>
<p id="p_24"> 22.   Learned counsel for the Defendant submitted that the
      use of the Defendant was honest and concurrent.
      Further that the marks were not deceptively similar. He
      further submitted that the law is that the generic salt
      should be ignored while comparing the two marks i.e. if
      the mark has been coined by telescoping a part of the
      name of the salt, then that should be ignored while
      comparing the similarity between the two marks.       He
      submitted that since the mark of the Plaintiffs and that
      of the Defendant are both coined by telescoping w ords
      from the generic salt, they cannot be held to be
      deceptively similar. Learned counsel for the Defendant
      further submitted that the Plaintiffs themselves were
      guilty of adopting the deceptively similar mark to the
      trademark INDOXY L and objections had been filed to
      the registration    of the trademark   of the Plaintiff
      CLINDOXYL.          Learned counsel for the Defendant
      relied on the judgment in S CHERING C ORPORATION &amp;
      O RS. V S. A LKEM L ABORATORIES L TD. 2010 (42) PTC
      772 (D EL). (DB).
</p>
<p id="p_25">23.   He relied on the judgment in the case of D RUMS F OOD
      I NTERNATIONAL P VT. L TD. VS. E URO I CE C REAM &amp;
      A NR. 2012 (49) PTC 224 (B OM .) to contend that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                Page 11 of 41</span>
       application for registration would take precedence over
      the plea of priority in use.
</p>
<p id="p_26">24.   For grant of an ad-interim injunction in a dispute
      relating to rival trademarks, the Plaintiff has to firstly
      prima facie establish priority in use to the use of the
      Defendant and secondly has to prima facie establish
      commercial      continuous     user and thirdly     deceptive
      similarity between the rival marks.
</p>
<p id="p_27">25.   As per the Plaintiffs the mark CLINDOXYL is not a
      common dictionary word and was coined by the
      Plaintiffs and the mark was adopted in the year 1994
      and was then put to use in United States of America and
      was put to use in India in the year 2010. The goods of
      the   Plaintiffs   are   stated   to   be   available   across
      international borders.
</p>
<p id="p_28">26.   The registration of the trademark in India of the
      Plaintiff is as of 06.03.2006, even though the physical
      user is stated to be since the year 2010. The Plaintiff
      has relied upon registrations of the mark CLINDOXY L
      in various countries since 23 April, 1996 and has filed
      sample invoices/sale bills since 25.06.2010.

<p id="p_29"> 27.   On the contra, the          Defendant    registration     of the
      Defendant's mark CLINOXIDE is as of 19.10.2006 and
      the first sale bill is of 30.04.2012. no document
      showing user prior to 30.04.2012 has either been filed
      or relied upon by the Defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_30">28.   On comparison of the documents and the pleadings, it is
      prima facie found that the registration of the mark of
      the Plaintiff is dated 06.03.2006 as compared to the
      Defendant of its mark on 19.10.2006. The first user in
      India shown by the Plaintiff is of 25.06.2010 and that
      by the Defendant is of 30.04.2012. The Plaintiffs have
      claimed user internationally since 1996. The Defendant
      has not claimed any such user abroad. Even if the
      Indian user alone were to be taken, then the Plaintiffs
      are prima        facie prior   in time       both in terms       of
      registration and commercial sale.

      Ashwajeet Garg &amp; Others (CS (OS) 394 of 2012
      Order     dated    01.05.2014),   I    had     the   occasion    of
      considering       various   judicial   pronouncements           and
      culling    out     the   following     legal     principles     for
      determining the deceptive similarity of marks:

<p id="p_32">        i.       Action for infringement is a statutory
                remedy     conferred     on    the  registered
                proprietor of a registered trademark. 1

       ii.      Registration   of    trademark      gives the
                proprietor the exclusive right to the use of
                the trademark in connection with the goods
                in respect of which it is registered. 2

       iii.     If the essential features of the trademark of
                the Plaintiff have been adopted by the
                Defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing
                and other writing or marks on the goods or
                on the packets shows marked differences, or
                indicate clearly a trade origin different from
                that of the registered proprietor of the mark
                would be immaterial.2

       iv.      Mere delay in filing                        of     a     suit      for

<p id="p_38">      30.   There are admittedly two set of decisions
            passed by many High Courts with regard to
            anti-dissection rule. In one set of the
            decisions, it has been held that for the

            the parties, they are to be compared as a

            taken from name of the disease, chemical
            name and name of the organ. In the second

            similar, the case of infringement is made out
            by holding that two rival marks of the
            parties are to be compared as a whole. In
            other set of cases, courts did not grant
            injunctions on the ground that part of the
            mark is derived from the chemical name,
            name of the disease and organ for which the
            product is intended. Thus, where no case of
            infringement was made out, the Court
            followed the practice of breaking the marks

            confuse a purchaser and small changes in

<p id="p_59">      41.   The anti-dissection rule which is under these
            circumstances required to be applied in
            India is really based upon nature of
            customer. It has been rightly set out in
            McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
            Competition about the said rule particularly
            in Para 23.15 which is reproduced

                  Conflicting composite marks are to be
                  compared by looking at them as a
                  whole, rather than breaking the marks
                  up into their component parts for
                  comparison.      This  is   the    "anti-
</p><p id="p_62">                  dissection" rule. The rationale for the
                  rule is that the commercial impression
                  of a composite trademark on an
                  ordinary prospective buyer is created
                  by the mark as a whole, not by its
                  component parts. However, it is not a
                  violation of the anti-dissection rule to
                  view     the    component     parts   of
                  conflicting composite marks as a
                  preliminary step on the way to an
                  ultimate determination of probable
                  customer reaction to the conflicting
                  composites      as   a  whole.     Thus,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                  Page 25 of 41</span>
                   conflicting marks must be compared in
                  their entireties. A mark should not be
                  dissected    or split up into its
                  component parts and each part then
                  compared with corresponding parts of
                  the conflicting mark to determine the
                  likelihood of confusion. It is the
                  impression that the mark as a whole
                  creates on the average reasonably
                  prudent buyer and not the parts
                  thereof, that is important. As the
                  Supreme      Court      observed:   "The
                  commercial impression of a trademark
                  is derived from it as a whole, not from
                  its elements separated and considered
                  in detail. For this reason it should be
                  considered in its entirety." The anti-</p>
<p id="p_63">                  dissection rule is based upon a
                  common        sense     observation    of
                  customer behavior: the typical shopper
                  does not retain all of the individual
                  details of a composite mark in his or
                  her mind, but retains only an overall,
                  general impression created by the
                  composite as a whole. It is the overall
                  impression created by the mark from
                  the    ordinary      shopper's    cursory
                  observation in the marketplace that
                  will or will not lead to a likelihood of
                  confusion, not the impression created
                  from a meticulous comparison as
                  expressed      in    carefully   weighed
                  analysis in legal briefs. In litigation
                  over the alleged similarity of marks,
                  the    owner      will   emphasize    the

                   similarities and the alleged infringer
                  will emphasize the differences. The
                  point is that the two marks should not
                  be examined with a microscope to find
                  the differences, for this is not the way
                  the average purchaser views the
                  marks. To the average buyer, the
                  points of similarity are more important
                  that minor points of difference. A
                  court should not engage in "technical
                  gymnastics" in an attempt to find some
                  minor differences between conflicting
                  marks. However, where there are both
                  similarities and differences in the
                  marks, there must be weighed against
                  one another to see which predominate.
</p>
<p id="p_64">                  The rationale of the anti-dissection
                  rule is based upon this assumption:
                  "An average purchaser does not retain
                  all the details of a mark, but rather the
                  mental impression of the mark creates
                  in its totality. It has been held to be a
                  violation of the anti-dissection rule to
                  focus upon the "prominent" feature of
                  a mark and decide likely confusion
                  solely upon that feature, ignoring all
                  other elements of the mark. Similarly,
                  it is improper to find that one portion
                  of a composite mark has no trademark
                  significance, leading to a direct
                  comparison between only that which
                  remains."

                 deceptive similarity between the two
                 marks is firmly engraved in a series of
                 judgments pronounced by the Courts
                 in the last half century or more. Many
                 are cited by the learned counsel for the

                   Court and other High Courts. The
                  position which emerges from the
                  reading of all these judgments can be
                  summarized in the following manner:
</p>
<p id="p_67">                  In such case, the central issue is as to
                  whether the Defendant's activities or
                  proposed activities amount to a
                  misrepresentation which is likely to
                  injure the business or goodwill of the
                  Plaintiff and cause damage to his
                  business or goodwill. To extend this
                  use to answer this, focus has to be on
                  the aspect as to whether the Defendant
                  is making some representation in
                  course     of  trade  to prospective
                  customers which is calculated to injure
                  the business or goodwill of the
                  Plaintiff thereby causing damage to
                  him. In the process, difference
                  between the confusion and deception
                  is to be understood. This difference
                  was explained by Lord Denning in
                  "Difference: Confusion &amp; Deception"
                  in the following words:
</p>
<p id="p_68">                  "Looking to the natural meaning of the
                  words,     I    would      make      two
                  observations: first, the offending mark
                  must „so nearly resemble‟ the
                  registered mark as to be „likely‟ to
                  deceive or cause confusion. It is not
                  necessary that it should be intended to
                  deceive    or    intended     to   cause
                  confusion. You do not have to look



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                 Page 29 of 41</span>
                   into the mind of the user to see what
                  he intended. It is its probable effect on
                  ordinary people which you have to
                  consider. No doubt if you find that he
                  did intend to deceive or cause
                  confusion, you will give him credit for
                  success in his intentions. You will not
                  hesitate to hold that his use of it is
                  likely to deceive or cause confusion.
                  But if he had no such intention, and
                  was completely honest, then you will
                  look carefully to see whether it is
                  likely to deceive or cause confusion
                  before you find him guilty of
                  infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_69">                  Secondly, „to deceive‟ is one thing.
                  To „cause confusion‟ is another. The
                  difference is this: when you deceive a
                  man, you tell him a lie. You make a
                  false representation to him &amp; thereby
                  cause him to believe a thing to be true
                  which is false. You may not do it
                  knowingly, or intentionally, but you
                  still do it, &amp; so you deceive him. But
                  you may cause confusion without
                  telling him a lie at all, &amp; without
                  making any false representation to
                  him. You may indeed tell him the
                  truth, the whole truth &amp; nothing but
                  the truth, but still you may cause
                  confusion in his mind, not by any fault
                  of yours, but because he has not the
                  knowledge or ability to distinguish it
                  from the other pieces of truth known

                   to him or because he may not even
                  take the trouble to do so."
</p>
<p id="p_70">            43.   While examining the question of
                  misrepresentation      or     deception,
                  comparison has to be made between
                  the two trademarks as a whole. Rules
                  of Comparison was explained by
                  Justice Parker in the following words:
</p>
<p id="p_71">                  "You must take the two words. You
                  must judge of them, both by their look
                  &amp; by their sound. You must consider
                  the goods to which they are to be
                  applied. You must consider the nature
                  &amp; kind of customer who would be
                  likely to busy those goods. In fact, you
                  must consider all the surrounding
                  circumstances; and you must further
                  consider what is likely to happen if
                  each of those trademarks is used in a
                  normal way as a trademark for the
                  goods of the respective owners of the
                  marks. If, considering all those
                  circumstances, you come to the
                  conclusion     that    there    will  be
                  confusion- that is to say, not
                  necessarily that one man will be
                  injured&amp; the other will gain illicit
                  benefit, but that there will be
                  confusion in the mind of the public
                  which will lead to confusion in the
                  goods- then you may refuse the
                  registration, or rather you must refuse
                  the registration in that case."

<p id="p_77">                   "10. A person may sell his goods or
                  deliver his services such as in case of a
                  profession under a trading name or
                  style. With the lapse of time such
                  business or services associated with a
                  person acquire a         reputation    or
                  goodwill which becomes a property
                  which is protected by courts. A
                  competitor initiating sale of goods or
                  services in the same name or by
                  imitating that name results in injury to
                  the business of one w ho has the
                  property in that name. The law does
                  not permit any one to carry on his
                  business in such a way as would
                  persuade the customers or clients in
                  believing that the goods or services
                  belonging to someone else are his or
                  are associated therewith. It does not
                  matter whether the latter person does
                  so fraudulently or otherwise. The
                  reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and
                  fair play are, and ought to be, the basic
                  policies in the world of business.
                  Secondly, when a person adopts or
                  intends to adopt a name in connection
                  with his business or services which
                  already belongs to someone else it
                  results in confusion and has propensity
                  of diverting the customers and clients
                  of someone else to himself and thereby
                  resulting in injury."

                   Modern Law of Trademarks" authored
                  by Christopher Morcom, Butterworths
                  1999, which finds approval by the
                  Supreme Court in Ramdev Food
                  Products Ltd. (supra): "The concept of
                  distinguishing goods or services of the
                  proprietor from those of others was to
                  be found in the requirements for a
                  mark to be registrable. Essentially,
                  whatever     the   wording    used,    a
                  trademark or a service mark was an
                  indication which enabled the goods or
                  services from a particular source to be
                  indentified and thus distinguished
                  from goods or services from other
                  sources. In adopting a definition of
                  'trademark' w hich simply describes the
                  function in terms of capability of
                  'distinguishing the goods or services of
                  one undertaking from those of other
                  undertakings' the new law is really
                  saying precisely the same thing."

                  learned Single Judge would further
                  demonstrate    that    "Anti-dissection
                  Rule" is discussed and applied holding
                  that such a dissection is generally not
                  permissible and can be applied only in
                  exceptional cases. After taking note of
                  the law on subject, the dissection of
                  marks as suggested by the appellant is
                  termed as „artificial one‟. We would

                  discussion from the impugned order as

                           the rule and the dissection of a
                           mark is an exception which is
                           generally not permitted. The

                       and the alleged infringer will
                       emphasize the differences. The
                       point is that the two marks
                       should not be examined with a
                       microscope      to    find    the

                       the marks. To the average buyer,
                       the points of similarity are the
                       more important that minor points

                       differences between conflicting
                       marks. However, where there are
                       both similarities and differences
                       in the marks, there must be

             applied in the cases referred by the
            Defendant. In fact the said law had been
            applied in India for the last five decisions by
            Hon'ble Supreme Court in three judgments
            delivered by the Supreme Court in the cases
            reported in Corn Products Refining (supra),
            Amritdhara Pharmacy (supra) and Kaviraj
            Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_85">      45.   Of course, there is restriction imposed to
            any trader in the decisions referred to above
            not to use the entire generic or part of
            component exclusively which may have
            been taken from the name of the disease,
            part of chemical name of bulk drug which
            form the ingredient of the medicine. But,
            apparently a party is not entitled to add the
            word along with that either prefix or suffix
            thereof in the manner which may create
            confusion and deception when the two rival
            marks of the parties are compared as a
            whole. By creating and designing the mark
            in this fashion to create confusion and
            deception by the adoption and use of the
            same would not be considered as bonafide.
</p>
<p id="p_86">33.   Applying the principles of law as laid down by the
      various judgments referred to above, it is clear that the
      rival marks have to be considered as a whole and they
      cannot   be     dissected   to   find   out   similarities   or
      dissimilarities.
</p>
<p id="p_87">34.   The rival marks are CLINDOXYL of the Plaintiffs on



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                      Page 37 of 41</span>
       the one side and CLINO XID, CLINOXIDE AN D
      CLINOXIDE - A of the Defendant on the other.
      Applying the principles as enumerated above there is no
      iota of doubt that the rival marks are deceptively similar
      and are likely to cause confusion in the minds of the
      unwary purchaser. The medicines are not prescription
      drugs and are available and sold across the counter and
      are   sold   to   consumers      for   acne       treatment.     The
      purchasers are not likely to be consumers who are well
      versed with the chemical compositions of the medicinal
      preparations.     Consumers      are     likely    to    order    the
      medicine verbally and over telephone and there is great
      likelihood of confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_88">35.   In view of the principles as enumerated above, the
      argument of the Defendant that it has adopted the mark
      by telescoping the prefix CLIN from the generic drug
      CLINDAMYCIN and suffix OXIDE from the generic
      drug BENZOYL PEROXIDE does not hold much
      water. Even as per the Defendant's understanding,
      marks adopted by telescoping letters from generic drugs
      are capable of acquiring distinctiveness and are capable
      of being used and registered as                  trademarks. The
      Defendant       has   itself   applied     for     and     obtained



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">CS(OS) No.2373/2013                                            Page 38 of 41</span>
       registration of its mark, which it claims to have adopted
      by telescoping letters from generic drugs. Further the
      court has to be very cautious in dealing with medicinal
      products.    If   rival   deceptively   similar    marks     are
      permitted    to   stay    in   the   marker   in   respect    of
      pharmaceutical products, there is likelihood of grave
      injury to the public. Where greater public interest is
      involved, the commercial rights of parties are to
      become subservient. If there is any likelihood of
      confusion in the two competing marks that have been
      applied to pharmaceutical products, the deceptively
      similar mark that had entered the market later in time
      has to go.
</p>
<p id="p_89">36.   Prima facie the marks of the Defendant had entered the
      market later in point of time than the mark of the
      Plaintiffs. The marks are deceptively similar.
</p>
<p id="p_90">37.   There is no merit in the submission of the Defendant
      that there are other marks registered with the prefix
      CLIN as the Defendants have not placed on record any
      material to show that the said marks with the prefix
      CLIN are even available in the market. No material
      about user or samples of the products have been

       produced.       Even otherwise as held hereinabove, the
      rival marks are to be compared as a whole and not to
      be dissected for the purposes of comparison.
</p>
<p id="p_91">38.   The argument of the Defendant that there is delay in
      approaching the court is also not sustainable as the
      Defendant has prima facie come into the market in
      April, 2012 and the present suit has been filed in
      November 2013. There is no inordinate delay. The
      Plaintiff had issued a cease and desist notice and the
      Defendant had even proposed to change its mark. The
      delay if any is duly explained. The delay is not fatal to
      the case of the Plaintiff for grant of an ad interim
      injunction. Even otherwise where public interest is
      involved, the rival commercial interests are subservient
      and the court is to take a liberal approach as the
      interests of the consumers is to be protected.
</p>
<p id="p_92">39.   In view of the above, the Plaintiff has established a
      strong prima facie case for grant of an ad-interim
      injunction, the balance of convenience is in favour of
      the Plaintiff and in case the injunction is not granted,
      the Plaintiff shall suffer an irreparable loss and injury.
