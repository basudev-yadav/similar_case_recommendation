     ORAL JUDGMENT





     1.      By this judgment, I propose to dispose of the preliminary
     issue of jurisdiction under Section 9A of the Code of Civil
     Procedure, 1908 ("CPC") raised by the Defendants in both suits.





     2.      In Suit No. 632 of 2014, the preliminary issue was framed on
     31st March 2016. Shortly stated the Defendants' case is that while
     the Plaintiffs have their registered office in Mumbai, they also have a
     branch office in Delhi, where the Defendants have their place of
     business and where, according to the Defendants, the cause of

     action has arisen. Therefore, according to Mr. Kirpekar for the




                                                                                  
     Defendants in this Suit, this Court would not have jurisdiction. Only
     the courts in Delhi would.




                                                          
     3.      The Defendants in Suit No. 516 of 2013 take a substantially
     similar plea. There, the Plaintiff has its registered office in Mumbai.




                                                         
     The Defendants are based in Kolhapur and they allege that the
     Plaintiffs also have office in Kolhapur, and that the situs of the suit
     should, therefore, be Kolhapur.




                                            
     4.      I have heard Dr. Saraf for the Defendants in Suit No. 516 of
                             
     2013, Mr. Kirpekar for the Defendants in Suit No. 632 of 2014, Mr.
     Kadam for the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 516 of 2013 and Mr. Kane for
                            
     the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 632 of 2014 at some length.


     5.      Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar base their submissions on a
      


     reading of the decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Performing
   



     Rights Society Limited v Sanjay Dalia &amp; Another.1 To put it in a
     nutshell, the Defendants' case before me is this: Neither Dr. Saraf
     nor Mr. Kirpekar dispute that the Plaintiffs can file a Suit under the





     <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_3">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 or under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_4">Copyright Act</a>, 1957 within the
     local limits of the jurisdiction of the District Court where the
     Plaintiff actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or





     works for gain. What they suggest, however, is that this right is
     curtailed by the decision of the Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia at
     least to this extent: that where such a Plaintiff also has a office at
     another location and the cause of action has arisen in that other

     has its principal office or registered office, but must file it within the
     jurisdiction of the court where both the subsidiary or branch office




                                                          
     and the cause of action are to be found.


     6.      Almost the entirety of the discussion before me has been on a




                                                         
     reading of Sanjay Dalia's case. Before proceeding to a consideration
     of the rival submissions on that decision, it is perhaps more
     appropriate to set out my understanding of the pre- and post-Sanjay




                                            
     Dalia jurisdictional regimes. <a href="/doc/1631603/" id="a_5">Section 134(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act,
     1999 ("TMA 1999") parallels <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_6">Section 62(2)</a> of the Copyright Act,
                             
     1957 ("CA 1957"). Both depart from the usual jurisdictional
     provision we find in Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
                            
     ("CPC"). Under the CPC, a suit must be brought (a) where all the
     defendants reside or work; or (b) where any of several defendants
     live or reside provided there is either prior leave or the others
      


     acquiesce in the jurisdiction; or (c) where the cause of action arises
   



     wholly or in part. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_7">Sections 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_8">62(2)</a>, on the other hand, do
     not have any such requirement. They simply say that a suit in
     infringement or passing off can be brought where the plaintiff





     resides or works. In the case of a corporate, this could be where it
     has its office or offices. In the pre-Sanjay Dalia era, this often
     resulted in much mischief: a corporate would have several satellite
     offices scattered around the country. Using these provisions, it





     would bring infringement and passing off suits in the courts in
     whose jurisdiction those satellite or field offices were located, even
     though the defendants were not there and no cause of action arose
     there. This was precisely the mischief the Sanjay Dalia court
     addressed. It did so not in the manner the Defendants suggest today,

     i.e., by a wholesale rewriting of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_9">Sections 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_10">62(2)</a>, for that




                                                                                  
     could never have been the Supreme Court's intention or purpose.
     There is also no indication, as we shall see, of any kind of 'reading




                                                          
     down' or 'imputing in' to the words of intellectual property statutes.
     To the contrary: the Sanjay Dalia decision closely interwove the
     special provisions of those two statutes with the regular




                                                         
     jurisdictional provisions in the CPC, retaining the integrity and
     structure of each. Keeping in mind that the discussion (and the
     preceding discord) is largely about corporate Plaintiffs, what




                                            
     emerges, in my view, is this:


             (a)
                             
                      A Plaintiff can always file a suit in a court within the
                      local jurisdiction of which its registered office or
                            
                      principal office is located. This is a 'pure' <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_11">Section
                      134(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_12">Section 62(2)</a> invocation of jurisdiction. The
                      location of the defendants and the place of accrual of
      


                      the cause of action is inconsequential. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_13">Sections 134(2)</a>
   



                      and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_14">62(2)</a> do not refer to the situs of the cause of action
                      or the situs of the defendants' location at all.





             (b)      Where a Plaintiff also has a satellite or field office
                      elsewhere, it may bring suit in a court in that location,
                      but this is no longer a <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_15">Section 134(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_16">Section 62(2)</a>
                      jurisdictional invocation. The jurisdiction is governed





                      by Section 20 of the CPC; and hence, one of the
                      defendants must be found there; or leave must be
                      obtained there if some of the defendants are within that
                      jurisdiction and some outside it; or it must be shown
                      that the cause of action has arisen, wholly or in part, in

                      that jurisdiction. This option does not oust or limit the




                                                                                  
                      plaintiff's right to move under <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_17">Section 134(2)</a> or
                      <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_18">Section 62(2)</a>.




                                                          
             (c)      A plaintiff can always travel to where the defendant is
                      located2 or where the cause of action arises and bring




                                                         
                      suit there. This again is purely a Section 20 CPC
                      invocation of jurisdiction. It has nothing at all to do
                      with <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_19">Section 134(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_20">Section 62(2)</a>. The plaintiff




                                            
                      need not have any office in that location.


     7.
                             
             From this, it will be seen that the first 'route' -- the one I
     describe as 'pure' <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_21">Section 134(2)</a> or 62(2) -- is untouched by the
                            
     others; and the others are only relatable to <a href="/doc/1271581/" id="a_22">Section 20</a>, not to the
     special provisions in the two intellectual property statutes.
      


     8.      At the cost of repetition, what was the mischief that was
   



     addressed in Sanjay Dalia? It was this: Section 134(2) of the TMA
     1999 and Section 62(2) of the CA 1957 borrow the defendant-
     specific phraseology of <a href="/doc/1271581/" id="a_23">Section 20(a)</a> and (b) of the CPC but apply it





     to a plaintiff. The difficulty then arises with the phrase 'carries on
     business', especially as applied to a corporate plaintiff. Corporates
     have branch, field or satellite offices throughout the country. Only





     one of them is the registered or principal place of business. If the
     two special intellectual property statutes are read broadly, it would
     mean that a plaintiff can file a suit in any remote location because it


     2       Or where one of several defendants is located, with leave, or if they have
             acquiesced.

     'carries on business' there. That, the Sanjay Dalia court said, was




                                                                                  
     never the legislative intent. True, an infringer should know the risk
     he runs, viz., that he will be forced to go to where the plaintiff is, but




                                                          
     this should be read to mean the jurisdictional location of plaintiff's
     registered office or principal place of business, not its far-flung
     satellite office. But this does not and cannot mean that the




                                                         
     plaintiff's right to bring suit in the jurisdiction of its registered office
     or principal place of business is in any way curtailed or fettered.




                                            
     9.      I turn now to the statutory provisions. Section 20 of the Code
     of Civil Procedure, 1908 reads thus:
                             
             "20. Other suits to be instituted where Defendants

     CPC. However, the important word in those sections is "include".




                                                          
     This suggests that the jurisdictional benefit of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_29">Sections 134(2)</a> and
     <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_30">62(2)</a> is not exclusive or exclusionary. It is an additional benefit or an
     additional provision, and, as we shall see, this is precisely the finding




                                                         
     of the Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia.


     13.     As I have noted, Section 20 of the CPC deals with the




                                            
     'ordinary' jurisdictional situs. There is then the explanation to
     <a href="/doc/1271581/" id="a_31">Section 20(c)</a>. This is a very interesting explanation. It tells us that
                             
     when it comes to defendant companies, these are deemed to 'carry
     on business' at their sole or principal office in India; or if they have a
                            
     subordinate office where the cause of action, then in that place. The
     important thing about this explanation is that it relates to defendant
     corporations, not plaintiffs.
      
   



     14.     Both Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar suggest that the law under
     Section 134(2) of the TMA 1999 and Section 62(2) of the CA 1957
     was 'changed' by the Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia. Referring to





     the 'mischief' I have described above -- dishonest plaintiffs
     bringing suit in remote locations where there was neither defendant
     nor cause of action -- they say that it was to prevent this abuse that
     the Supreme Court interpreted <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_32">Sections 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_33">62(2)</a> as it did.





     According to them, a plaintiff can no longer file a suit in the District
     Court within the jurisdiction of which the plaintiff has its registered
     or principal office, if the plaintiff also has another (satellite) office at
     another location, and which is the situs of either the defendant or
     the cause of action (or both). In short, their submission is that no

     where it has its cause of action with nothing further. That privilege
     is now constrained. If it is shown that the plaintiff has another office




                                                           
     where the defendant carries or business or resides, or where the
     cause of action has arisen, then the plaintiff must file the suit in that
     other location; the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_35">Section 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_36">62(2)</a> routes are shut to such




                                                          
     a plaintiff.


     15.     Both Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar rely extensively on the




                                             
     Supreme Court's decision in Sanjay Dalia in support of this
     proposition. They have also referred to the two decisions of the
                             
     Delhi High Court, one of a learned Single Judge and the second of a
     Division Bench in Appeal. I will consider both these decisions
                            
     presently.


     16.     It is necessary, I think, to first understand the circumstances
      


     in which the Supreme Court was required to decide the Sanjay
   



     Dalia's case. The Supreme Court had before it two matters. The
     first, Civil Appeal Nos. 10643-10644 of 2010, arose from suits filed
     by the Indian Performing Rights Society Limited ("IPRS") to





     prevent copyright infringement by Sanjay Dalia, i.e., to restrain him
     from using the copyright work without license. Mr. Sanjay Dalia
     owned (or owns) cinema halls in Maharashtra and Mumbai where
     infringement was alleged. The entire cause of action arose in





     Mumbai. Yet IPRS brought suits in Delhi where it also happened to
     have an office. The second matter before the Supreme Court, Civil
     Suit FAO (OS) No. 359 of 2007 was filed in the Delhi High Court
     on the basis that the Plaintiff in that suit had a branch office in
     Delhi. The Plaintiff's head office, however, was in Mumbai and the

     Court, saying that the suit should have been filed in the Mumbai
     High Court. The third matter appears to have been Civil Appeal




                                                          
     arising out of SLP (C) No. 8253 of 2013 for trade mark
     infringement. The Plaintiff, a corporate proprietor of the magazine
     "Vogue India" has its registered office in Mumbai, where the




                                                         
     magazine was processed and published. The Plaintiff also had a
     branch office in Delhi and on that basis sought to file the suit within
     the jurisdiction of that Court.




                                            
     17.     This was the factual conspectus before the Supreme Court.
                             
     The rival contentions on behalf of the Appellants are set out in
     paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the SCC report. On behalf of the
                            
     respondents, it was submitted inter alia that the mischief rule of</pre>

     defendants and abuse of statutory provisions, i.e., forcing them to
      


     travel to distant locations where absolutely nothing had happened
   



     only because the Plaintiff had a satellite or branch office there. After
     setting out the necessary statutory provisions, the Supreme Court
     also had occasion to note certain portions of the Parliamentary





     Debates on the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_37">Copyright Act</a>, 1957. These are debates of the
     Copyright Committee. They are most instructive. Paragraph 13 of

                      jurisdictional choice. It also says can, not must. There is
                      the element of choice.

<p id="p_9">             (b)      That choice finds recognition in the second portion,
                      with the words "Plaintiff(s) can also institute a suit at a

<p id="p_11">             (c)      The third portion deals with the mischief that faced the
                      Supreme Court: "Plaintiff is residing or carrying on
                      business at a particular place/having its head office and




                                                         
                      at such place cause of action has also arisen wholly or
                      in part, Plaintiff cannot ignore such a place under the
                      guise that he is carrying on business at other far flung




                                            
                      places also." This was therefore a situation where the
                      plaintiff had its head office or registered office at a
                             
                      place where the cause of action also arose but it chose
                      to ignore all that and brought suit at the situs of a
                            
                      satellite office where nothing at all had happened and
                      where none of the defendants resided or worked. That,
                      the Supreme Court said, was not the legislative
      


                      mandate of <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_53">Section 62(2)</a> or 134(2).
</p>   



<p id="p_12">     22.     Dr. Saraf's and Mr. Kirpekar's arguments also overlook the
     Supreme Court's finding that "the very intendment of the insertion





     of provision in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_54">Copyright Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_55">Trade Marks Act</a> is the
     convenience of the Plaintiff", a matter that is reflected in the
     Copyright Committee debates. It is therefore in this background that
     we must see paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 of Sanjay Dalia.
</p>




<p id="p_13">             19. The intendment of the aforesaid provisions
             inserted in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_56">Copyright Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_57">Trade Marks Act</a>
             is to provide a forum to the Plaintiff where he is
             residing, carrying on business or personally works for
             gain. The object is to ensure that the Plaintiff is not

             to institute a suit at the said place and not at other
             places. The provisions of <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_60">section 62</a> of the Copyright
                             
             Act and <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_61">section 134</a> of the Trade Marks Act never
             intended to operate in the field where the Plaintiff is

             place and the cause of action has also arisen at that
             place so as to enable it to file a suit at a distant place
             where its subordinate office is situated though at
      

             such place no cause of action has arisen. Such
             interpretation would cause great harm and would be
   



             juxtaposed to the very legislative intendment of the
             provisions so enacted.

<p id="p_15">             20. In our opinion, in a case where cause of action has





             arisen at a place where the Plaintiff is residing or where
             there are more than one such persons, any of them
             actually or voluntarily resides or carries on business or
             personally works for gain would oust the jurisdiction of





             other place where the cause of action has not arisen
             though at such a place, by virtue of having
             subordinate office, the Plaintiff instituting a suit or

     no suit can be filed at a site office, one that is not the registered or

             provisions of <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_71">section 62</a> of the Copyright Act. The




                                            
             provisions enabled the Plaintiff or any of them to file a
             suit at the aforesaid places. But if they were residing
                             
             or carrying on business or personally worked for gain
             already at such place, where cause of action has
             arisen, wholly or in part, the said provisions have not
                            
             provided additional remedy to them to file a suit at a
             different place. The said provisions never intended to
             operate in that field. The operation of the provisions
      

             was limited and their objective was clearly to enable
             the Plaintiff to file a suit at the place where he is
   



             ordinarily residing or carrying on business etc., as
             enumerated above, not to go away from such places.
             The Legislature has never intended that the Plaintiff
             should not institute the suit where he ordinarily





             resides or at its Head Office or registered office or
             where he otherwise carries on business or personally
             works for gain where the cause of action too has
             arisen and should drag the Defendant to a





             subordinate office or other place of business which is
             at a far distant place under the guise of the fact that
             the Plaintiff/corporation is carrying on business
             through branch or otherwise at such other place also.

             submitted on behalf of the Respondents, the abuse of

             infringement proceedings at a far flung place and at
             unconnected place as compared to a place where
             Plaintiff is carrying on their business, and at such place,




                                                         
             cause of action too has arisen. In the instant cases, the
             principal place of business is, admittedly, in Mumbai
             and the cause of action has also arisen in Mumbai.
             Thus, the provisions of <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_72">section 62</a> of the Copyright Act

             interpreted in a manner so as to confer jurisdiction on
                             
             the Delhi court in the aforesaid circumstances to
             entertain such suits. The Delhi court would have no
             territorial jurisdiction to entertain it.

             Defendant is also necessary while giving the remedy to
             the Plaintiff under the provisions in question. It was
      


             never visualised by the law makers that both the parties
   



             would be made to travel to a distant place in spite of
             the fact that the Plaintiff has a remedy of suing at the
             place where the cause of action has arisen where he is
             having head office/carrying on business etc. The





             provisions of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_74">Copyright Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_75">Trade Marks

             sue at their ordinary residence or where they carry on
             their business. The said provisions of law never





             intended to be oppressive to the Defendant. The
             Parliamentary Debate quoted above has to be
             understood in the manner that suit can be filed where
             the Plaintiff ordinarily resides or carries on business
             or personally works for gain. Discussion was to

<p id="p_29">     27.     In addition to this the Supreme Court has specifically noted
     the impact of the word "include" in paragraph 40 of the SCC





     report. It did so while referencing the decision in <a href="/doc/474885/" id="a_76">Exphar Sa v.
     Eupharma Laboratories Limited</a>.4 This decision makes it clear that
     the introduction of <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_77">Section 62(2)</a> was not to place any restriction on
     copyright owners, but quite reverse, i.e., to remove any





     impediments in their way. Any limitations or restrictions in the

<p id="p_31">     28.     This is in fact the basis and substratum of the decision of the
     Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia too. For here, the Supreme Court
     has emphasized that these two special statutes provide an additional




                                                         
     remedy to the Plaintiff. This is the only plausible way to reconcile
     the non obstante clause with the word "include".
</p>



                                            
<p id="p_32">     29.     It is also correct that while interpreting or construing a
     judgment, one must read it in its factual conspectus and see it as an
                             
     authority what it actually decides. There are several consequences
     to accepting Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar's argument, none of them
                            
     very good. The first of these suggest that in Sanjay Dalia the
     Supreme Court engineered a wholesale rewriting of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_78">Sections 134(2)</a>
     and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_79">Section 62(2)</a> by inserting in each of these sections additional
      


     qualifications that we do not find there or requiring the reading
   



     down of these provisions. It did not, and nothing in the decision
     suggests that it did or intended to.
</p>




<p id="p_33">     30.     The second consequence, one that is possibly even more
     dramatic, is that if the Defendants' interpretation is to be accepted,
     then <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_80">Sections 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_81">62(2)</a>, and the special benefits or





     advantages they confer, now recognized emphatically by the
     Supreme Court, are rendered entirely otiose; and every plaintiff is
     then left with only a Section 20 CPC route open to him. For, if a
     plaintiff cannot bring suit in the situs of its registered office or
     principal place of business 'de hors' as the Supreme Court said 'the

     134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_83">62(2)</a> have no meaning. They are not required. Section
     20 of the CPC is sufficient if a plaintiff in a trade mark or copyright




                                                          
     action can only file suit as any other plaintiff could, i.e., where the
     defendants reside or where the cause of action accrues. This
     interpretation is not correct. Every plaintiff can always bring a suit




                                                         
     where the cause of action in whole or in part arises or where the
     defendants reside or works for gain. No special dispensation was
     required for this purpose at all. A plaintiff in a trade mark or




                                            
     copyright action has, however, an additional option or route
     available: where he has his registered office, and this has nothing to
                             
     do with the defendants' location or that of the cause of action. This
     is not fettered in any way by Sanjay Dalia. It matters not how to put
                            
     it, whether in the affirmative or the negative as Dr. Saraf does
     (meaning that the Plaintiff can bring a suit where his registered
     office lies unless the cause of action arises in the jurisdiction where
      


     he has a satellite office).
</p>   



<p id="p_35">     31.     In my view, all that the Supreme Court did in Sanjay Dalia
     was to deal with the patent mischief that was placed before it:
</p>




<p id="p_36">     plaintiffs filing suits in remote locations only because they happened
     to have branch offices there, although the defendants were to be
     found in another location and the plaintiffs themselves had their
     own offices in those other locations and the entire cause of action





     had also arisen in those other locations.

             I am, with regret, unable to accept the interpretation of
     Sanjay Dalia in the decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High
                            
     Court. I would ordinarily have been loathe to stray too far from the
     decision of a Division Bench of another High Court; but this view
     seems to me to be plainly incorrect. I believe the Division Bench of
      


     the Delhi High Court was in error, and that error appears to me to
   



     be in the first sentence of paragraph 12 where it said that the
     deeming provision of <a href="/doc/1271581/" id="a_84">Section 20</a>, i.e., the explanation, had been
     'read into' <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_85">Sections 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_86">62(2)</a> (for isolating the place where





     the plaintiff can be said to be carrying on business). As we have
     seen, that was not the issue before the Supreme Court at all, nor did
     the Supreme Court read down the provisions of either of these two
     sections. If we view the provisions of <a href="/doc/1271581/" id="a_87">Section 20</a> as a three-tier





     structure, then the provisions of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_88">Section 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_89">Section 62(2)</a>

<p id="p_43">     34.     Mr. Kane draws my attention to the judgment of another
     learned Single Judge (Vipin Sanghi J) of the Delhi High Court in
     RSPL Limited v Mukesh Sharma &amp; Anr.7 Mr. Justice Sanghi was of




                                            
     the view that the case before him was unaffected by the Division
     Bench's decision in Ultra Home, one he came upon after he reserved
                             
     judgment in RSPL Ltd. Yet, as a student of law, he set out his
     reasons for disagreeing with the view of the Division Bench. Mr.
                            
     Justice Sanghi's judgment sets out several passages from Sanjay
     Dalia and he too concludes, as have I, that the Supreme Court
     recognize that an additional forum had been provided under <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_94">Section
      


     62(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1631603/" id="a_95">Section 134(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 by including
   



     the District Court within whose limits a plaintiff actually and
     voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for
     gain as a possible place for such a plaintiff to bring a trade mark or





     copyright action. In paragraph 22 of his decision, Mr. Justice Sanghi
     summarized the position as it emerges from Sanjay Dalia with
     admirable precision and concision:
