Date of Decision :             10.10.2011

FACTS</pre><p id="p_1"> :
</p><p id="p_2">      This matter was heard by a Full Bench of this Commission on
26.8.2011. The Bench consisted of the following :-
</p><p id="p_3">(i)   Shri M.L. Sharma, Information Commissioner;
</p><p id="p_4">(ii) Ms Annapurna Dixit, Information Commissioner; &amp;
</p><p id="p_5">(iii) Ms Sushma Singh, Information Commissioner.

<p id="p_6">2.    The following were present :-
</p><p id="p_7">Bombay Stock Exchange :-

RTI applicant :-
</p><p id="p_15">(i)   Shri Yogesh B Mehta
</p><p id="p_16">(ii) Shri Suresh Kabra

</p><p id="p_17">3.    The matter, in short, is that vide RTI application dated
07.12.2010, Shri Yogesh B Mehta had sought information on 22
paras from SEBI requesting for copies of certain documents. The
CPIO of SEBI had responded to it, para-wise, vide letter dated
5.1.2011. As regards paras 07, 08, 09 &amp; 13 of the RTI application,
the CPIO had observed as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "The information sought pertains to third party and hence in
      terms of <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_1">section 11</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, third party procedure
      has been initiated. Upon receipt of reply from third party, our
      reply will be furnished to you."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">4.     Vide subsequent letter dated 10.10.2011, the CPIO had informed the
appellant that in view of objections filed by the 3rd party, the said
information could not be disclosed to him Aggrieved with the decision of
 CPIO, Shri Mehta had filed the first appeal which was decided by the AA
through a cryptic order dated 1.3.2011. The said order is reproduced
below :-
</p><p id="p_19">"1.    The appellant had filed application dated December 7, 2010 under
       the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_2">Information Act</a>, 2005 <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_3">(RTI Act</a>). The respondent, vide
       letters dated January 5, 2011 and January 10, 2011, January 14, 2011
       and January 21, 2011, responded to the appellant. Aggrieved by the
       responses of the respondent, the appellant has filed this appeal dated
       February 11, 2011.
</p><p id="p_20">2.     I have carefully examined the application, the responses, and the
       appeal and find that the matter can be decided on merit based on the
       material available on record.
</p><p id="p_21">3.     The main argument in this appeal is that the respondent has not
       given the inspection as requested by the appellant. I find that the
       appellant had sought inspection of documents in his original
       application and thereafter vide letter dated January 14, 2011. If an
       applicant keeps demanding inspection of documents, it is better for
       the respondent to allow inspection of the documents after applying
       the provisions of <a href="/doc/580445/" id="a_4">section 10</a> of the RTI Act to avoid application after
       application and appeals alleging that not everything was disclosed, as
       was alleged by the appellant in this case. I feel that all other points
       raised by the appellant in this appeal would cover if he is allowed
       inspection of documents. I, therefore, direct the respondent to invite
       the appellant for inspection of relevant documents, in accordance
       with the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">RTI Act</a>, within 15 days from receipt of this order."
A bare perusal of the above order would indicate that the AA had reversed
the decision of CPIO in regard to these paras and allowed inspection of
documents subject to the severability clause of <a href="/doc/580445/" id="a_6">section 10</a> of the RTI Act.
</p>
<p id="p_22">5.      Aggrieved with the decision of the Appellate Authority, the BSE has
filed the present appeal dated 18th May, 2011, before the Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_23">6.      Shri Shyam Diwan, Sr Advocate appearing for the BSE, has assailed
the order of the AA. Refering to para 01 of the said order, he submits that
this para refers to letters dated 5.1.2011, 10.1.2011, 14.1.2011 and 21.1.2011
but the contents thereof have not been mentioned therein, making it difficult
for the BSE to make any sense out of it. He also assails this order on the
ground that no opportunity of hearing was given to BSE before passing the
impugned order. According to him, this order also suffers from the vice of
non-application of mind. It is also his submission that Shri Mehta has tried
to get information generated by and relating to BSE through SEBI indirectly
and unfairly.
</p>
<p id="p_24">7.     In his brief submission, Shri Suresh Kabra appearing for Shri Yogesh
Mehta (RTI applicant) would submit that SEBI is the regulator of the
financial markets and is entitled to seek information from the entities such as
BSE. He alleges that BSE has committed a fraud of about 90 crores and one
of the Directors of BSE had to resign. He also alleges that BSE has shown
fraudulent expenditure of Rs 60 crores on advertisements relating to Market
Making Scheme (MMS) etc. In the circumstances, disclosure of requested
information by SEBI would be in the larger public interest.
</p><p id="p_25"> 8.     Ms Jeny John appearing for SEBI deflates the whole issue by
submitting that the CPIO had sought objections from BSE and
keeping in view the objections filed by BSE, no information objected
to by BSE has been disclosed to Shri Mehta. She files a written
representation dated 23.8.2011 before this Commission, duly signed
by Dr Anil Kumar Sharma, CPIO, which is taken on record. She in
particular, draws the Commission's attention the para 07 of the
representation in this regard which is extracted below :-
"7.   Not being satisfied with the reply of Respondent 2, Respondent 1
      preferred an appeal before SEBI Appellate Authority (Respondent 3)
      who passed an order dated March 1, 2011, directing Respondent 2 to
      provide an opportunity to Respondent 1 for inspection of documents
      after applying <a href="/doc/580445/" id="a_7">section 10</a> of RTI Act (Copy of order enclosed as
      Annexure R-3). The Respondent No 2, after invoking <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_8">section 8</a> (1) (d)
      of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_9">RTI Act</a> did not provide any of the documents objected by the
      appellant to Respondent No 1 for inspection. Subsequent to
      inspection copies of documents were furnished to Respondent 1 vide
      letter reference number CPIO/AKS/JR/AAO-1084-2011/12086 dated
      April 8, 2011 (Copy enclosed as Annexure R-4). In the said letter
      reference is made that those documents objected to by the appellant
      to disclose were not furnished to Respondent 1 citing exemption
      under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_10">RTI Act</a>."
</p>
<p id="p_26">9.    In the appeal memo filed before this Commission, the BSE has
averred as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "The Respondent No 1 thereafter filed an Appeal - No 1094 of 2011
      dated February 11, 2011 against the aforesaid responses of the
      Respondent No 2 before the Appellate Authority, SEBI i.e. the
      Respondent No 3 herein. The Appellate Authority passed its order
      dated March 01, 2011 stating that the Respondent No 1 had sought
      inspection of documents in his original application and if he keeps
      demanding inspection of documents, it is better for the CPIO, SEBI
      to allow inspection of the documents after applying the provisions of
      s.10 of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_11">RTI Act</a> to avoid application after application and appeals
      alleging that not everything was disclosed, as was alleged by the
      Respondent No 1. The Appellate Authority also held that all the
      points raised by the Respondent No 1 in his appeal would be covered
      if he is allowed inspection of documents. Therefore, the Respondent
      No 3 directed the Respondent No 2 to invite the Respondent No 1 for
      inspection of relevant documents, in accordance with the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_12">RTI Act</a>,
      within 15 days from the receipt of this order. The appellant was
      neither issued with any notice of hearing nor heard in the matter nor
      served with a copy of the letters/orders of the Respondent No 2 or a
      copy of the impugned order."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">10. Needless to say, BSE would be an aggrieved party only if SEBI
discloses any information which is detrimental or injurious to its
interest and which has been objected to by it. From the representation
of SEBI extracted above, it is clear that it has not disclosed any
information which was objected to by BSE. SEBI has also not used
 the larger public interest doctrine in disclosing       any information
objected to by BSE.
</p>
<p id="p_28">11. A few day after the hearing, M/s K.J. John &amp; Co, claiming to
be the Advocates for appellant BSE, submitted a Short Note of
Submissions which is taken on record. The contentions raised in the
said Note may be summarised as follows :-
</p><p id="p_29">(i)   that the CPIO did not comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_13">section 11</a>
      (3) of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_14">RTI Act</a> inasmuchas no written notice of his decision
      was given to the appellant;
</p>
<p id="p_30">(ii)    that the AA neither issued any notice nor granted an
        opportunity of hearing to the appellant;
</p>
<p id="p_31">(iii)   that the AA did not communicate his decision to the appellant;
</p>
<p id="p_32">(iv)    that the order dated 1.3.2011 passed by the AA is indicative of
        non-application of mind on his part;
</p>
<p id="p_33">(v)     that the contention of SEBI that the appeal has become
        infructuous on account of the fact that it has not furnished any
        documents objected to by appellant BSE is factually incorrect
        as explained in the additional affidavit filed on behalf of the
        appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_34">(vi)    that the SEBI has not followed the procedure laid down in
        <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_15">section 11</a> of the RTI Act. Para 08 of the note is extracted
        below :-
</p><p id="p_35">        "8.   Even assuming, without admitting that the Respondent No 2
        has not disclosed the documents objected to by the appellant, the
        present appeal ought not and cannot be disposed of without :
</p><p id="p_36">        (a)   An undertaking of the Respondent No 2/Securities and
              Exchange Board of India that the documents objected to by
              the appellant would not be disclosed either by way of
              inspection or by way of photocopies to the Respondent No 1;
</p><p id="p_37">        (b)   Appropriate orders/directions by this Hon'ble Commission
              with respect to the non compliance/non observation of the
              requirements of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_16">RTI Act</a>, 2005 by the Respondent No 2
              and the CPIO of the Securities and Exchange Board of India."
</p>
<p id="p_38">12. An additional affidavit dated 29.8.2011 sworn by Shri Shantilal
D. Jain, Manager Legal, BSE, has also been filed before this
Commission which is taken on record. It is his allegation that despite
SEBI's averment before this Commission on 26.8.2011 that no
documents objected to by BSE were disclosed to the information
seeker, certain documents have been disclosed. Para 03 of his
affidavit is extracted below :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        "3.     I say that on 26.8.2011, the Appellant has learnt from an order
       dated 30.6.2011 passed by the Appellate Authority (Respondent No 2)
       and obtained from the website of the Securities and Exchange Board
       of India, that part of the documents which from subject matter of the
       letter dated 4.1.2011 addressed by the CPIO of the Respondent No 2
       to the Appellant (Annexure - A/2 at page 17 of the Appeal) and dealt
       with in the reply of the Appellant dated 5.1.2011 have been disclosed
       to the Respondent No 1, which is borne out by the said order of the
       Appellate Authority (Respondent No 2) dated 30.6.2011, which inter
       alia reads thus :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       The appellant paid Rs 64/- and SEBI vide letter dated January 14,
       2011 furnished the following documents to the appellant.
       i.      ......................................
       ii.     ......................................
       iii.    ......................................

       be pertinent to state that the document at serial No xi referred to
       herein above is the very document at point 13 of the letter of the
       Respondent No 2 dated 4.1.2011 (Annexure - A/2 at page 17 of the
       appeal) and dealt with in the reply of the Appellant dated 5.1.2011

       A copy of the aforesaid order of the Appellate Authority (Respondent
       No 2) dated 30.6.2011 is annexed hereto and marked as Exhibit -A."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">13. Before dealing with the merits of the case, we would like to
observe that appellant BSE did not file a copy of the RTI application
filed by the information seeker Shri Yogesh Mehta alongwith its
appeal as per standard practice. Nor did it file a copy of the order
passed by the CPIO. On a query from the Commission, Sr Adv
Diwan would submit that a copy of the CPIO's order was not sent to
the BSE.
</p>
<p id="p_40">14. Sr Adv Dewan has raised the following procedural issues in
regard to the decisions of CPIO and AA :-
</p>
<p id="p_41">(i)    whether the CPIO is required to send a copy of his order to the
       third party from whom consent had been sought u/s 11 (1) of
       the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_17">RTI Act</a>;
</p>
<p id="p_42">(ii)   whether the CPIO and FAA are required to give an opportunity
       of hearing to the third party; and
</p><p id="p_43"> (iii)      whether order dated 1.1.2011 passed by the FAA is self
           contained and self speaking and fulfills the requirements of the
           <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_18">RTI Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_44">15. Issue No (i), may be answered in unambiguous terms by
referring to the express provisions of sub section (3) of <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_19">section 11</a>
which is reproduced below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in <a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_20">section 7</a>, the Central Public
        Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may
        be, shall, within forty days after receipt of the request under <a href="/doc/1910806/" id="a_21">section 6</a>, if
        the third party has been given an opportunity to make representation
        under sub-section (2), make a decision as to whether or not to disclose
        the information or record or part thereof and give in writing the notice
        of his decision to the third party."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        From the above provision, it is clear that CPIO is required to send
        a copy of his decision to the 3rd party.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">16. Coming to issue No (ii), needless to say that rendering an
opportunity of hearing to the parties is a fundamental principle of
jurisprudence. It is conducive to fairness and transparency and
accords with the principles of natural justice. An opportunity of
hearing to the parties also brings greater clarity to the adjudicating
authorities. No wonder, an opportunity of hearing is given to the rival
parties under our procedural laws-both criminal and civil. However,
adjudication of the matters under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_22">RTI Act</a> is to be seen from a
slightly different angle. Lakhs of cases are filed before the CPIOs
and State Public Information Officers. The appeals arising therefrom
filed before the Central Information Commission and the State
Information Commissions run into hundreds of thousands. This
Commission always gives an opportunity of hearing to the parties but
this does not appear to be done by the CPIOs/SPIOs and FAAs as
there are practical difficulties therein, partly arising out of the
numbers involved and party due to the limited time frame in which
the matters are required to be decided at the level of CPIOs &amp; AAs.
In view of this, we restrain ourselves from directing the CPIOs and
AAs to always give an opportunity of hearing to the parties as an
inflexible rule and leave the matter to their discretion. All that the we
would like to suggest is that an opportunity of hearing may be given
to the parties, including the third party, if practicable, without
forgetting that essence of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_23">RTI Act</a> is adherence to the timelines
prescribed in the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_46">17. Now, we come to Issue No (iii). It is note worthy that the RTI
application filed by Shri Yogesh B Mehta runs into 22 paras. The
CPIO dealt with the application para-wise in his order dated 5.1.2011
wherein information was denied to the appellant on paras 07, 08, 09
 and 13 thereof. We would have expected the AA to deal with RTI
application para-wise, in the context of the order of the CPIO and the
appeal memo filed before him, particularly in respect of the paras
regarding which information was denied. We, however, notice that
the FAA has passed a bland order without dealing with the issues
threadbare. We also would have expected the FAA to apply the
provisions of <a href="/doc/580445/" id="a_24">section 10</a> to the information to be disclosed at his own
level rather than leaving the entire matter to the discretion of the
CPIO. In the premises, the order passed by the AA can not be said to
be self contained and self speaking. We, however, are not inclined to
remand the matter back to him as, in our opinion, no prejudice
appears to have been caused to appellant BSE, as demonstrated
hereinafter.
</p>
<p id="p_47">18. Now, we come to the most critical part of our inquiry i.e. the
merits of the case. Para 08 of this order may be recalled wherein we
had extracted para 07 of the affidavit filed by CPIO of SEBI wherein
he has categorically averred that no information whatsoever has been
disclosed which was objected to by appellant BSE. In the written
material filed before this Commission extracted herein above, there is
not even a whisper as to the information which was disclosed by the
CPIO, disregarding the objections filed by the appellant herein. We
may, however, mention that in para 03 of his affidavit extracted
hereinabove, Shri Shanti Lal D. Jain, Manager Legal, BSE, has
vaguely referred to disclosure of some information but in our
understanding, he has not categorically alleged that information
objected to by BSE was disclosed. In fact, we have carefully perused
the order dated 30.6.2011 passed by the AA of SEBI and find that in
para 08 thereof, he has categorically mentioned that 3rd party
information is not to be disclosed. This para is extracted below for
ready reference:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "8. As regards the prayer at (7.A), I find from the
      chronology of events at Para 2 supra that the respondent
      has complied with the order of the AA and provided
      inspections and relevant information to the appellant
      except the third party information and the information
      which was offered to the appellant vide letter dated
      April 8, 2011 on payment of additional fee."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">19. From the above, it is clear that the apprehensions of appellant
BSE in this regard are misplaced.
</p>

<p id="p_49">20. There is yet another issue that calls for our attention. In para
08 of the Note submitted on behalf of the appellant, we notice that the
 appellant wants to have an undertaking from SEBI to the effect that
the documents objected to by appellant BSE would not be disclosed
either by way of inspection or by way of photocopies. By
implication, the appellant is admitting that no documents objected to
by the appellant have been disclosed so far. We may, however,
observe that the objections filed by the appellant herein u/s 11 (1) are
not binding on the CPIO. These objections are only to be kept in
view by the CPIO while taking a decision regarding disclosure of
information. We make it clear that this Commission can not fetter the
discretion of the CPIO regarding the disclosure of 3rd party
information. Thus, the relief sought is misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_50">21.     The findings of this Commission can be crystalised as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_51">(i)     The CPIOs are mandated to send a copies of their orders to the
        3rd party u/s 11 (3), from whom objections are sought u/s 11
        (1).
</p>
<p id="p_52">(ii)    It is not practical to lay down an inflexible rule that PIOs and
        AAs will always offer an opportunity of hearing to the parties,
        let alone to the 3rd party. They may do so as per their
        discretion, keeping in view the complexity of legal and factual
        issues involved, without forgetting that timelines are to be
        adhered to, being the essence of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_53">(iii)   The order passed by the AA is not self-contained and speaking
        and we advise him to pass speaking orders in future.
</p>
<p id="p_54">(iv)    In view of the averment of Dr Anil Kumar, CPIO of SEBI,
        extracted above, the appeal has become infructuous and is
        dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_55">        Order reserved &amp; pronounced today dated 10th October, 2011.
