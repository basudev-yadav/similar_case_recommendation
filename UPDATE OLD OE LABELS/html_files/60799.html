HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">The Judgments of the Court were delivered by
S.   RATNAVEL PANDIAN, J.- I have had the privilege of going
through	 the erudite and scholarly judgments of	 my  learned
brothers   making  an  exhaustive  and	in-depth   analysis,
evaluating  the constitutional mechanism and  exploring	 the
whole  realm of constitutional imperatives as  envisaged  by
the Founding Fathers of the Indian Constitution on  Central-
State	relations  and	throwing  abundant  light   on	 the
controversial  role of State Governors inviting	 President's
Rule and the mode by which the Union Cabinet and  Parliament
discharged   their  responsibility  in	this   regard	with
reference  to  Articles 74(2), 163, 355, 356,  357  and	 the
other allied constitutional provisions.
</p><p id="p_2">2.   1	find  myself in agreement with the opinion  of	P.B.
Sawant,	 J.  on his conclusions 1, 2 and 4 to 8	 with  which
B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. concurs in his judgment (speaking	 for
himself and on behalf of S.C. Agrawal, J.) but so far as the
reasoning and other conclusions are concerned, I agree fully
with the judgment of B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. Yet I would	like
to  give my brief opinion on the constitutional question  of
substantial  importance	 in relation to the  powers  of	 the
President to issue Proclamations under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_1">Article 356(1)</a> of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_3">3.   The  Indian  Constitution is both a  legal	 and  social
document.  It provides a machinery for the governance of the
country.   It  also  contains the  ideals  expected  by	 the
nation.	 The political machinery created by the Constitution
is a means to the achieving of this ideal.
</p><p id="p_4">4.   To what extent we have been successful in achieving the
constitutional	ideals	is a question with a  wide  spectrum
which  needs  an  elaborate debate.   Harking  back  to	 the
question   involved  in	 this  case,  the  Framers  of	 the
Constitution  met and were engaged for months together	with
the  formidable	 task of drafting the  Constitution  on	 the
subject	 of Centre State relationship that would  solve	 all
the  problems  pertaining thereto and frame a  system  which
would enure for a long time to come.  During the debates and
deliberations,	the issues that seemed to crop up  at  every
point  was the States' rights vis-a-vis the Central  rights.
Some   of  tile	 members  seem	to  have   expressed   their
conflicting opinions and different reasoning and  sentiments
on  every  issue influenced and inspired  by  the  political
ideology  to which they were wedded.  The two spinal  issues
before the Constituent Assembly were (1) what powers were to
be taken away from the States; and (2) how could a  national
supreme Government be formed without completely eviscerating
the  power of the State.  Those favoring the formation of  a
strong Central Government insisted that the said  Government
should	enjoy supreme power while others supporting  States'
rights	expostulated  that view.  The two sides	 took  turns
making their representations but finally realising that	 all
might  be lost, they reached a compromise that resolved	 the
deadlock on the key issue and consequently the present	form
of  Government, more federal in structure, came	 into  being
instead of a unitary Government.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">66</span>
<p id="p_5">established by the people of India for themselves for  their
own  governance	 and not for the  governance  of  individual
States.	 Resultantly, the Constitution acts directly on	 the
people	by  means of power communicated	 directly  from	 the
people.
</p><p id="p_6">6.   In	 regard to the Centre State relationship  there	 are
various	 reports suggesting certain recommendations for	 the
smooth	 relationship  of  both	 the   Governments   without
frequently   coming   into   conflicts	 thereby    creating
constitutional	   crisis.     The    reports	  suggesting
recommendations	 are  that  of	(1)  Administrative  Reforms
Commission  1969;  (2)	Rajmannar Committee  1969;  and	 (3)
Sarkaria Commission 1987.
</p><p id="p_7">7.   When  the	question  with regard to  the  Centre  State
relations  stands  thus, the publication issued by  the	 Lok
Sabha  Secretariat  giving an analytical tabular  form	with
significant   details	pertaining   to	  the	 President's
Proclamation  made under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_2">Article 356(1)</a> of the	Constitution
and under <a href="/doc/517872/" id="a_3">Section 51</a> of the Government of Union	 Territories
Act, 1963 during the last 41 years of the Republic, that  is
up  to	1991,  indicates the frequency of  user	 of  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_4">Article
356(1).</a>	  It  appears from the summary table  given  in	 the
tabular	 form  (Appendix  IV)  that  on	 82  occasions	 the
President's Rule in States have been imposed by invoking  or
resorting  to  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_5">Article	356(1)</a>	and  on	 13  occasions	 the
President's  Rule  have been imposed  in  Union	 Territories
including  erstwhile  Union Territories	 which	have  become
States	 under	<a href="/doc/517872/" id="a_6">Section	 51</a>  of	 the  Government  of   Union
Territories  Act, 1963.	 All total up to 95 times, of  which
on 23 occasions the assemblies were dissolved on the  advice
of the Chief Ministers/or due to their resignations.  It may
be  recalled that on 18 occasions the  assemblies  suspended
were  subsequently revived.  The above statistics  does	 not
include	  the  Proclamations  which  are   presently   under
challenge  before  us.	 We  may  hasten  to  add  that	 the
Proclamations were made on different occasions on the advice
of  the	 Council  of Ministers	of  the	 Central  Government
belonging  to different political complexions.	Some of	 the
States,	 dissolved  valiantly  fought,	honorably  bled	 and
pathetically lost their legal battle.
</p><p id="p_8">8.   Since  my learned brothers have elaborately dealt	with
the  constitutional provisions relating to the issue of	 the
Proclamation  and  as I am in agreement with  the  reasoning
given  by B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J., it is not necessary for  me
to make further discussion on this matter except saying that
I  am of the firm opinion that the power under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_7">Article	 356</a>
should	be  used very sparingly and only when  President  is
fully  satisfied  that	a situation  has  arisen  where	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the  provisions of the Constitution.   Otherwise,	 the
frequent  use of this power and its exercise are  likely  to
disturb	  the  constitutional  balance.	  Further   if	 the
Proclamation  is  freely made, then the	 Chief	Minister  of
every	State  who  has	 to  discharge	his   constitutional
functions   will  be  in  perpetual  fear  of  the  axe	  of
Proclamation  falling  on him because he will  not  be	sure
whether	 he will remain in power or not and consequently  he
has to stand up every
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">67</span>
time   from  his  seat	without	 properly  discharging	 his
constitutional obligations and achieving the desired  target
in the interest of the State.
</p><p id="p_9">9. All the matters are disposed of accordingly with no order
as to costs.
</p><p id="p_10">AHMADI,	 J.-I have had the advantage of perusing  the  views
expressed   by	my  esteemed  colleagues  P.B.	Sawant,	  K.
Ramaswamy and B.P. Jeevan Reddy, JJ. and while I am  largely
in   agreement	with  the  'conclusions'  recorded   by	  K.
Ramaswamy, J., I would like to briefly indicate the area  of
my agreement.
</p><p id="p_11">11.  In a country geographically vast, inhabited by over 850
million people belonging to different religions, castes	 and
creeds, majority of them living in villages under  different
social orders and in abject poverty, with a constant tug  of
war between the organised and the unorganised sectors, It is
not  Surprising	 that  problems	 crop  up  time	 and   again
requiring  strong  and	at times  drastic  State  action  to
preserve   the	 unity	and  integrity	 of   the   country.
Notwithstanding- these problems arising from time to time on
account	 of  class  conflicts,	religious  intolerance	 and
socioeconomic imbalances, the fact remains that India has  a
reasonably stable democracy.  The resilience of our Republic
to  face these challenges one after another has	 proved	 the
peoples'  faith	 in the political philosophy  of  socialism,
secularism  and democracy enshrined in the Preamble  of	 our
Constitution.  Yet, the fact remains that the nation has had
from  time  to	time with  increasing  frequency  to  combat
upheavals  occasioned on account of militancy, communal	 and
class	conflicts,  politico-religious	turmoils,   strikes,
bandhs	and the like occurring in one corner of the  country
or the other, at times assuming ugly proportions.  We are  a
crisis-laden  country;	crisis situations  created  by	both
external  and  internal forces necessitating  drastic  State
action to preserve the security, unity and integrity of	 the
country.   To  deal  with  such	 extraordinarily   difficult
situations   exercise	of  emergency  powers	becomes	  an
imperative.    Such  emergency	powers	existed	 under	 the
Government  of India Act, 1935, vide <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_8">Sections 93</a> and  <a href="/doc/1002680/" id="a_9">45</a>  of
that enactment.	 However, when similar powers were sought to
be conferred on the President of India by the  Constitution,
there,	was  a strong opposition from many  members  of	 the
Constituent  Assembly, vide Constituent Assembly Debates  on
draft  Articles	 277 and 277-A.	 Dr  Ambedkar  pacified	 the
members by stating :
</p>	      "In fact I share the sentiments expressed	 ...
<p id="p_12">	      that  the proper thing we ought to  expect  is
	      that  such articles will never be called	into
	      operation	 and that they would remain  a	dead
	      letter.	If  at all, they  are  brought	into
	      operation,  I  hope  the	President,  who	  is
	      endowed  with  all  these	 powers,  will	take
	      proper precautions before actually  Suspending
	      the  administration of the provinces.  I	hope
	      the first thing he 'will do would be to  issue
	      a	 mere warning to a province that has  erred,
	      that  things were not happening in the way  in
	      which  they  were intended to  happen  in	 the
	      Constitution." (Constituent Assembly  Debates,
	      Vol.  IX, p. 177)
Dr. Ambedkar's hope that in rarest of rare cases only  there
will  be an occasion to invoke the emergency provisions	 was
soon belied as we were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">68</span>
told  at the Bar that the provisions of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_10">Article 356</a>  of	 the
Constitution  have  had to be invoked over ninety  times  by
now.   What was, therefore, expected to be a  'dead  letter'
has  in fact become an oft-invoked provision.  This  is	 not
the occasion to embark on an enquiry into the  circumstances
leading to the utilisation of this emergency power, but	 the
fact remains that the President has had to invoke the  power
quite frequently.  This may be on account of the degradation
in the political environment of the country.  Since I am not
probing	 into the circumstances in which the said power	 had
to  be	invoked,  I do not express myself  on  the  question
whether	 or  not there existed	adequate  justification	 for
resorting to this emergency power.
</p><p id="p_13">12. Although the emergency provisions found in part XVIII of
the Constitution are more or less modeled on the pattern  of
similar provisions contained in the Government of India Act,
1935,  the exercise of that power under the said  provisions
cannot be compared with its exercise under the	Constitution
for  the  obvious reason that they  operated  under  totally
different  conditions.	Under the Government of	 India	Act,
1935,  the  Governor General and the Governor  exercised  as
representatives	 of  the Crown near  absolute  powers,	only
limited	 powers	 were given to the elected  Governments	 and
those  too  could  be taken away if it	was  felt  that	 the
Government  concerned could not be carried on in  accordance
therewith.    So  also	reference  to  the   British   Joint
Parliamentary  Report  is inapposite for the  simple  reason
that the situation under the Constitution is not  comparable
with that which formed the basis for the Report.  The  power
conferred on the President of India under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_11">Article 356</a> has to
be  exercised  in  a wholly  different	political  setup  as
compared  to  that obtaining under the Government  of  India
Act, 1935.  The constitutional philosophy of a free  country
is  totally different from the philosophy of a	similar	 law
introduced  for the governance of a country by its  colonial
masters.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to examine the case-
law  based  on	the exercise of	 similar  powers  under	 the
Government of India Act, 1935.
</p><p id="p_14">Federal Character of the  Constitution
</p><p id="p_15">13.  India,  as	 the  Preamble proclaims,  is  a  Sovereign,
Socialist,   Secular,  Democratic  Republic.   It   promises
liberty	 of thought, expression, belief, faith and  worship,
besides	 equality  of  status  and  opportunity.   What	  is
paramount  is  the unity and integrity of  the	nation.	  In
order to maintain the unity and integrity of the nation	 our
Founding Fathers appear to have leaned in favour of a strong
Centre	while distributing the powers and functions  between
the Centre and the States.  This becomes obvious from even a
cursory	 examination of the provisions of the  Constitution.
There  was considerable argument at the Bar on the  question
whether	 our Constitution could be said to be  'Federal'  in
character.
</p><p id="p_16">14.  In	 order	to understand whether  our  Constitution  is
truly  federal, it is essential to know the true concept  of
federalism.   Dicey calls it a political contrivance  for  a
body of States which desire Union but not unity.  Federalism
is, therefore, a concept which unites separate States into a
Union  without sacrificing their own  fundamental  political
integrity.  Separate States,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">69</span>
therefore, desire to unite so that all the member-States may
share in formulation of the basic policies applicable to all
and  participate  in  the execution  of	 decisions  made  in
pursuance  of  such basic policies.  Thus the essence  of  a
federation is the existence of the Union and the States	 and
the  distribution  of  powers  between	them.	 Federalism,
therefore,  essentially implies demarcation of powers  in  a
federal compact.
</p><p id="p_17">15.  The oldest federal model in the modem world can be said
to be the Constitution of the United States of America.	 The
American  Federation can be described as the outcome of	 the
process	 of  evolution, in that, the separate  States  first
formed	 into  a  Confederation	 (1781)	 and  then  into   a
Federation  (1789).  Although the States may have their	 own
Constitutions,	the Federal Constitution is the suprema	 lex
and  is made binding on the States.  That is  because  under
the  American Constitution, amendments to  the	Constitution
are required to be ratified by three-fourths of the  States.
Besides	  under	  that	Constitution  there  is	  a   single
legislative  list enumerating the powers of the	 Union	and,
therefore, automatically the other subjects are left to	 the
States.	  This	is  evident from the  Tenth  Amendment.	  Of
course,	 the  responsibility to protect the  States  against
invasion  is  of the Federal Government.   The	States	are,
therefore,   prohibited	 from  entering	 into  any   treaty,
alliance,  etc., with any foreign power.  The  principle  of
dual  sovereignty is carried in the judicial set-up as	well
since  disputes under federal laws are to be adjudicated  by
federal	 courts,  while	 those under State laws	 are  to  be
adjudicated by State courts,  subject of course to an appeal
to   the   Supreme   Court  of	the   United   States.	 The
interpretation	of the Constitution is by the United  States
Supreme	  Court.
</p><p id="p_18">16.  We	 may  now  read	 some  of  the	provisions  of	 our
Constitution.  States."	 <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_12">Article 2</a>  empowers  Parliament  to
admit into the Union, or establish, new States on such terms
and conditions as it thinks fit.  Under <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_13">Article 3</a> Parliament
can by law form a new State by separation of territory	from
any  State  or	by uniting two or more States  or  parts  of
States	or by uniting any territory to a part of any  State;
increasing  the area of any State; diminishing the  area  of
any State; altering the boundaries of any State; or altering
the name of any State.	The proviso to that article requires
that  the  Bill for the purpose shall not be  introduced  in
either	House of Parliament except on the recommendation  of
the  President and unless, where the proposal  contained  in
the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of	 the
States,	 the Bill has been referred by the President to	 the
Legislature of that State for expressing its views  thereon.
On  a conjoint reading of these articles, it  becomes  clear
that Parliament has the right to form new States, alter	 the
areas of existing States, or the name of any existing State.
Thus  the  Constitution permits changes in  the	 territorial
limits	 of  the  States  and  does  not   guarantee   their
territorial  integrity.	 Even names can be  changed.   Under
<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_14">Article	 2</a> it is left to Parliament to determine  the  terms
and conditions on which it may admit any area into the Union
or  establish new States.  In doing so, it has not  to	seek
the concurrence of the State whose area, boundary or name is
likely to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">70</span>
affected by the proposal.  All that the proviso to <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_15">Article 3</a>
requires is that in such cases the President shall refer the
Bill  to the Legislatures of the States concerned likely  to
be affected "to express their views".  Once the views of the
States are known, it is left to Parliament to decide on	 the
proposed  changes.  Parliament can, therefore,	without	 the
concurrence  of	 the State or States  concerned	 change	 the
boundaries of the State or increase or diminish its area  or
change	its name.  These provisions show that in the  matter
of  constitution of States, Parliament is  paramount.	This
scheme	 substantially	differs	 from  the  federal   set-up
established  in the United States of America.  The  American
States were independent sovereign States and the territorial
boundaries of those independent States cannot be touched  by
the  Federal Government.  It is these independent  sovereign
units  which  together	decided to form	 into  a  federation
unlike	in  India  where the  States  were  not	 independent
sovereign  units  but they were formed by <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_16">Article 1</a>  of	 the
Constitution   and   their  areas  and	 boundaries   could,
therefore,   be	 altered,  without  their  concurrence,	  by
Parliament.   It is well-known that since independence,	 new
States have been created, boundaries of existing States have
been altered, States have been renamed and individual States
have been extinguished by parliamentary legislation.
</p><p id="p_19">17.  Our Founding Fathers did not deem it wise to shake	 the
basic  structure  of  Government  and  in  distributing	 the
legislative  functions	they,  by and  large,  followed	 the
pattern	 of the Government of India Act, 1935.	Some of	 the
subjects  of common interest were, however,  transferred  to
the Union List, thereby enlarging the powers of the Union to
enable	speedy	and  planned  economic	development  of	 the
nation.	  The scheme for the distribution of powers  between
the Union and the States was largely maintained except	that
some  of  the subjects of common interest  were	 transferred
from   the  Provincial	List  to  the  Union  List   thereby
strengthening  the administrative control of the Union.	  It
is in this context that this Court in <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_17">State of W.B. v. Union
of India</a>' observed : (SCR p. 397)
	      "The  exercise  of  powers,  legislative	 and
	      executive, in the allotted fields is hedged in
	      by  the  numerous restrictions,  so  that	 the
	      powers of the States are not co-ordinate	with
	      the  Union  and  are  not	 in  many   respects
	      independent."
</p><p id="p_20">18.  <a href="/doc/1235907/" id="a_18">In	 Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon2</a> (SCC p.  789,	para

to the Union Legislature or to the provincial  legislatures,

with Entry 97 in List 1 of the Vllth Schedule, the residuary
power  has  been conferred on the Union.   This	 arrangement
substantially  differs	from the scheme of  distribution  of
powers	in the United States of America where  the  residual
powers are with the States.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">71</span>
</p><p id="p_22">19.  The Preamble of our Constitution shows that the  people
of  India had resolved to constitute India into a  Sovereign
Secular	 Democratic Republic and promised to secure  to	 all
its  citizens Justice, Liberty and Equality and	 to  promote
among  them  all  Fraternity assuring  the  dignity  of	 the
individual  and the unity and integrity of the	Nation.	  In
the people of India, therefore, vests the legal	 sovereignty
while  the political sovereignty is distributed between	 the
Union  and  the States.	 <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_20">Article 73</a>  extends  the  executive
power  of  the	Union  to  matters  with  respect  to  which
Parliament  has	 power to make laws and to the	exercise  of
such  rights, authority and jurisdiction as are	 exercisable
by  the	 Government  of India by virtue	 of  any  treaty  or
agreement.   The executive power which is made	co-extensive
with  Parliament's  power to make laws shall  not,  save  as
expressly provided by the Constitution or in any law made by
Parliament,  extend in any State to matters with respect  to
which  the Legislature of the State also has power  to	make
laws.  <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_21">Article 162</a> stipulates that the executive power of  a
State  shall  extend to matters with respect  to  which	 the
Legislature  of	 the State has power to make  laws  provided
that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature  of
a  State  and  Parliament  have	 power	to  make  laws,	 the
executive  power  of  the State shall  be  subject  to,	 and
limited	 by, the executive power expressly conferred by	 the
Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union
or  authorities	 thereof.  It may also be noticed  that	 the
executive  power of every State must be so exercised as	 not
to  impede or prejudice the exercise of the executive  power
by the Union.  The executive power of the Union also extends
to  giving such directions to a State as may appear  to	 the
Government  of India to be necessary for those purposes	 and
as   to	  the	construction,  maintenance   of	  means	  of
communication  declared	 to  be	 of  national  or   military
importance and for protection of railways.  The States	have
to  depend largely on financial assistance from	 the  Union.
Under  the  scheme  of Articles 268 to 273,  States  are  in
Certain	 cases allowed to collect and retain duties  imposed
by  the Union; in other cases taxes levied and collected  by
the Union are assigned to the States and in yet other  cases
taxes  levied  and collected by the Union  are	shared	with
States.	 <a href="/doc/465538/" id="a_22">Article 275</a> also provides for the giving of  grants
by  the	 Union to certain States.  There is,  therefore,  no
doubt  that States depend for financial assistance upon	 the
Union  since their power to raise resources is limited.	  As
economic  planning  is	a concurrent  subject,	every  major
project must receive the sanction of the Central  Government
for its financial assistance since discretionary power under
<a href="/doc/1146668/" id="a_23">Article 282</a> to make grants for public purposes is vested  in
the  Union or a State, notwithstanding that the	 purpose  is
one in respect to which Parliament or State Legislature	 can
make laws.  It is only after a project is finally sanctioned
by  the	 Central Government that the  State  Government	 can
execute	 the  same which demonstrates the control  that	 the
Union  can exercise even in regard to a matter on which	 the
State can legislate.  In addition to these controls  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_24">Article
368</a> confers powers on Parliament to amend the  Constitution,
albeit	by  a  specified majority.   The  power	 extends  to
amending  matters  pertaining to the executive	as  well  as
legislative powers of the States
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">72</span>
if  the amendments are ratified by the legislatures  of	 not
less  than one-half of the States.  This provision  empowers
Parliament  to so amend the Constitution as to	curtail	 the
powers	of the States.	A strong Central Government may	 not
find  it difficult to secure the requisite majority as	well
as ratification by one half of the legislatures if one	goes
by  past  experience.	These  limitations  taken   together
indicate that the Constitution of India cannot be said to be
truly  federal in character as understood by lawyers in	 the
United States of America.

distributing  legislative powers and indicating the  spheres
of governmental powers of State and Central Governments,  is
overlaid   by  strongly	 'unitary'  features,	particularly
exhibited by lodging in Parliament the residuary legislative
powers, and in the Central Government the executive power of
appointing  certain constitutional  functionaries  including
High Court and Supreme Court Judges and issuing	 appropriate
directions to the State Governments and even displacing	 the

gradually  disappeared leading to the unification  of  India
into  a single polity with duality of governmental  agencies
for  effective and efficient administration of	the  country
under  central direction and, if I may say so,	supervision.
The duality of governmental organs on the Central and  State
levels reflect demarcation of functions in a manner as would
ensure	the sovereignty and integrity of our  country.	 The
experience of partition of the country and its aftermath had
taught	lessons which were too fresh to be forgotten by	 our

	      States.  In those cases, the federating  units
	      gave certain powers to the federal  Government
	      and  retained some.  To apply the	 meaning  to
	      the  word 'federation' or 'autonomy'  used  in
	      the  context of the American Constitution,  to
	      our Constitution will be totally misleading."
</blockquote><p id="p_31">After  tracing the history of the governance of the  country
under the British rule till the framing of our Constitution,
the Court proceeded to add is follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "The feature of the Indian Constitution is the
	      establishment  of a Government  for  governing
	      the   entire  country.   In  doing   so,	 the
	      Constitution  prescribes	the  powers  of	 the
	      Central Government and the powers of the State
	      Governments and the relations between the two.
	      In  a sense, if the word 'federation'  can  be
	      used  at	all, it is a federation	 of  various
	      States   which  were  designated	 under	 the
	      Constitution  for	 the  purpose  of  efficient
	      administration and governance of the  country.
	      The  powers  of  the  Centre  and	 States	 are
	      demarcated  under	 the  Constitution.   It  is
	      futile   to  suggest  that  the	States	 are
	      independent,  sovereign  or  autonomous  units
	      which had joined the federation under  certain
	      conditions.   No	such State ever	 existed  or
	      acceded to the Union."
</blockquote><p id="p_32">23. Under our Constitution the state as such has no inherent
sovereign   power  or  autonomous  power  which	 cannot	  be
encroached upon by the Centre.	The very fact that under our
Constitution,  <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_29">Article 3</a>, Parliament may by law form  a	 new
State  by  separation  of territory from  any  State  or  by
uniting two or more States or parts of States or by  uniting
any  territory	to  a part of  any  State,  etc.,  militates
against the view that the States are sovereign or autonomous
bodies having definite independent rights of governance.  In
fact,  as pointed out earlier in certain  circumstances	 the
Central	 Government  can issue directions to States  and  in
emergency  conditions assume far reaching  powers  affecting
the  States  as well, and the fact that	 the  President	 has
powers to take over the administration of States  demolishes
the  theory of an independent or autonomous existence  of  a
State.	  It   must  also  be  realised	 that	unlike	 the
Constitution   of  the	United	States	of   America   which
recognises dual citizenship [<a href="/doc/174585/" id="a_30">Section 1(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_31">14th</a>	 Amendment],
the Constitution of India, <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_32">Article 5</a>, does not recognise the
concept	  of   dual   citizenship.    Under   the   American
Constitution  all persons born or naturalised in the  United
States,	 and  subject  to  the	jurisdiction  thereof,	 are
citizens of the United States and of the State wherein	they
reside whereas under <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_33">Article 5</a> of the Indian Constitution at
its commencement, every person domiciled in the territory of
India and (a) who was born in the territory of India; or (b)
either of whose parents was born in the territory of  India;
or (c) who has been ordinarily resident in the territory  of
India  for  not less than five years  immediately  preceding
such  commencement shall be a citizen of India.	  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_34">Article  9</a>
makes  it clear that if any person voluntarily acquires	 the
citizenship  of any foreign country, he will cease to  be  a
citizen	 of  India.  These provisions clearly  negative	 the
concept of dual citizenship, a concept expressly  recognised
under the American Constitution.  The concept of citizenship
assumes some importance in a federation because in a country
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">75</span>
which recognises dual citizenship, the individual would	 owe
allegiance  both  to the Federal Government as well  as	 the
State	Government  but	 a  country  recognising  a   single
citizenship  does not face complications arising  from	dual
citizenship  and  by  necessary	 implication  negatives	 the
concept of State sovereignty.
</p><p id="p_33">24.  Thus  the significant absence of the  expressions	like
'federal' or 'federation' in the constitutional	 vocabulary,
Parliament's  powers  under  Articles  2  and  3  elaborated
earlier,   the	extraordinary  powers  conferred   to	meet
emergency  situations,	the residuary  powers  conferred  by
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_35">Article	 248</a>  read  with Entry 97 in List  1  of  the  VlIth
Schedule on the Union, the power to amend the  Constitution,
the  power to issue directions to States, the concept  of  a
single	citizenship, the set-up of an integrated  judiciary,
etc.,  etc.,  have led constitutional experts to  doubt	 the
appropriateness	 of the appellation 'federal' to the  Indian
Constitution.  Said Prof.  K.C. Wheare in his work
Federal Government:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	       "What  makes one doubt that the	Constitution
	      of  India	 is  strictly  and  fully   federal,
	      however, are the powers of intervention in the
	      affairs	of   the   States   given   by	 the
	      Constitution  to	the Central  Government	 and
	      Parliament."
</blockquote><p id="p_34"> Thus in the United States, the sovereign States enjoy their
own   separate	 existence   which   cannot   be   impaired;
indestructible	States having constituted an  indestructible
Union.	 In  India, on the contrary, Parliament can  by	 law
form a new State, alter the size of an existing State, alter
the  name of an existing State, etc., and even	curtail	 the
power,	both  executive	 and legislative,  by  amending	 the
Constitution.	That  is why the Constitution  of  India  is
differently described, more appropriately as 'quasi-federal'
because it is a mixture of the federal and unitary elements,
leaning- more towards the latter but then what is there in a
name,  what is important to bear in mind is the	 thrust	 and
implications  of the various provisions of the	Constitution
bearing	 on the controversy in regard to scope and ambit  of
the  Presidential  power  under	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_36">Article  356</a>  and   related
provisions.
</p><p id="p_35">Secularism under the Constitution
</p><p id="p_36">25.  India  can	 rightly be described as  the  world's	most
heterogeneous  society.	  It  is  a  country  with  a	rich
heritage.   Several  races  have  converged  in	 this	sub-
continent.   They  brought  with them  their  own  cultures,
languages,  religions and customs.  These diversities  threw
up their own problems but the early leadership showed wisdom
and sagacity in tackling them by preaching the philosophy of
accommodation  and  tolerance.	This is	 the  message  which
saints	and  sufis spread in olden days	 and  which  Mahatma
Gandhi	and  other  leaders  of	 modem	times  advocated  to
maintain  national unity and integrity.	 The British  policy
of divide and rule, aggravated by separate electorates based
on  religion, had added a new dimension of  mixing  religion
with  politics which had to be countered and which could  be
countered only if the  people realised the need for national
unity and integrity.  It was with the weapons of  secularism
and non-violence that Mahatma Gandhi fought the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">76</span>
battle for independence against the mighty colonial  rulers.
As early as 1908, Gandhiji wrote in Hind Swaraj:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      "India cannot cease to be one nation,  because
	      people  belonging to different religions	live
	      in  it.  ... In no part of the world  are	 one
	      nationality and one religion synonymous terms;
	      nor has it ever been so in India."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">Gandhiji was ably assisted by leaders like Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru,	Maulana	 Abul Kalam Azad and others in the  task  of
fighting  a  peaceful battle for  securing  independence  by
uniting	 the people of India against separatist forces.	  In
1945 Pandit Nehru wrote :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      "I am convinced that the future government  of
	      free  India must be secular in the sense	that
	      government will not associate itself  directly
	      with any religious faith but will give freedom
	      to  all  religious functions."  And  this	 was
	      followed up by Gandhiji when in 1946 he  wrote
	      in  Harijan "I swear by my religion.   I	will
	      die  for	it.  But it is my  personal  affair.
	      The  State  has nothing to do  with  it.	 The
	      State  will look after your  secular  welfare,
	      health,	communication,	foreign	  relations,
	      currency and so on, but not my religion.	That
	      is everybody's personal concern."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      26.   The	  great	  statesman-philosopher	  Dr
	      Radhakrishnan said
	      "When India is said to be a secular State,  it
	      does  not	 mean that we reject reality  of  an
	      unseen spirit or the relevance of religion  to
	      life or that we exalt irreligion.	 It does not
	      mean that secularism itself becomes a positive
	      religion	or  that the  State  assumes  divine
	      prerogatives.  Though faith in the Supreme  is
	      the  basic principle of the Indian  tradition,
	      the Indian State will not identify itself with
	      or  be controlled by any particular  religion.
	      We  hold that no one religion should be  given
	      preferential  status, or	unique	distinction,
	      that  no	one  religion  should  be   accorded
	      special	privileges  in	national   life	  or
	      international  relations for that would  be  a
	      violation of the basic principles of democracy
	      and contrary to the best interests of religion
	      and   Government.	  This	view  of   religious
	      impartiality,	of     comprehension	 and
	      forbearance,  has	 a prophetic  role  to	play
	      within  the national and	international  life.
	      No group of citizens shall arrogate to  itself
	      rights  and  privileges  which  it  denies  to
	      others.	No person should suffer any form  of
	      disability  or discrimination because  of	 his
	      religion but all alike should be free to share
	      to  the  fullest degree in  the  common  life.
	      This  is the basic principle involved  in	 the
	      separation of Church and State."

passed the following resolution on April 3, 1948
	      "Whereas	it  is	essential  for	the   proper
	      functioning   of	democracy  and	 growth	  of

minorities  were  responsible for  communal  and  separatist
tendencies, the Advisory  Committee resolved that the system
of  reservation for minorities. excluding SC/ST,  should  be
done  away  with.  Pursuant to the goal of  secularism,	 the
Constituent  Assembly adopted clauses 13, 14 and 15  roughly
corresponding to the present Articles 25, 26 and 27.  During
the  debates Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru  declared	that
secularism   was   an  ideal  to  be   achieved	  and	that
establishment of a Secular State was an act of faith, an act
of  faith above all for the majority community because	they
will  have to show that they can behave towards others in  a
enerous, fair and just way.  When objection was sought to be
voiced	from  certain  quarters,  Pandit  Laxmikantha  Mitra
explained :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "	 By  Secular State, as I understand,  it  is
	      meant that the State is not going to make	 any
	      discrimination  whatsoever  on the  ground  of
	      religion	  or  community against	 any  person
	      professing  any particular form  of  religious
	      faith.	This  means  in	 essence   that	  no
	      particular religion in the State will  receive
	      any State patronage whatsoever.  The State  is
	      not going to establish, patronize or endow any
	      particular religion to the exclusion of or  in
	      preference  to others and that no	 citizen  in
	      the State will have any preferential treatment
	      or  will	be discriminated against  simply  on
	      tile    ground that he professed a  particular
	      form  of	religion.  In other  words,  in	 the
	      affairs  of  the State the preferring  of	 any
	      particular  religion  will not be	 taken	into
	      consideration  at all.  This I consider to  be
	      the  essence of a Secular State.	At the	same
	      time  we must be very careful to see  that  in
	      this  land of ours we do not deny	 to  anybody
	      the right not only to profess or practice	 but
	      also propagate any particular religion."
</blockquote><p id="p_40">This  in  brief was the notion of secularism  and  democracy
during	the pre-independence era and immediately  before  we
gave  unto  ourselves  the Constitution.  We  may  now	very
briefly notice the provisions in the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_41">29.  Notwithstanding the fact that the words 'Socialist' and
'Secular' were added in the Preamble of the Constitution  in
1976  by the 42nd Amendment, the concept of  Secularism	 was
very  much embedded in our constitutional  philosophy.	 The
term  'Secular'	 has advisedly not been	 defined  presumably
because	 it is a very elastic term not capable of a  precise
definition  and	 perhaps  best	left  undefined.   By	this
amendment what was implicit was made explicit.	The Preamble
itself	spoke  of liberty of  thought,	expression,  belief,
faith and worship.  While granting this liberty the Preamble
promised equality of status and opportunity.  It also  spoke
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">78</span>
promoting  fraternity, thereby assuring the dignity  of	 the
individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.  While
granting  to  its  citizens liberty  of	 belief,  faith	 and
worship, the Constitution abhorred discrimination on grounds
of  religion,  etc.,  but permitted  special  treatment	 for
Scheduled  Castes  and	Tribes, vide  Articles	15  and	 16.
<a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_37">Article 25</a> next provided, subject to public order,  morality
and health, that all persons shall be entitled to freedom of
conscience and the right to profess, practice and  propagate
religion.  <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_38">Article 26</a> grants to every religious denomination
or any section thereof, the right to establish and  maintain
institutions  for religious purposes and to manage  its	 own
affairs in matters of religion.	 These two articles  clearly
confer a right to freedom of religion.	<a href="/doc/211413/" id="a_39">Article 27</a>  provides
that  no  person shall be compelled to pay  any	 taxes,	 the
proceeds whereof are specifically appropriated in payment of
expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any  particular
religion  or religious denomination.  This is  an  important
article	 which	prohibits the exercise of  State's  taxation
power	if  tile  proceeds  thereof  are  intended   to	  be
appropriated  in payment of expenses for the  promotion	 and
maintenance   of  any  particular  religion   or   religious
denomination.	That  means that State's revenue  cannot  be
utilised  for the promotion and maintenance of any  religion
or  religious  group.  <a href="/doc/1734560/" id="a_40">Article 28</a> relates to  attendance  at
religious  instructions	 or  religious	worship	 in  certain

of  granting  and.  These fundamental  rights  enshrined  in
Articles 15, 16, and 25 to 30 leave no manner of doubt	that
they  form part of the basic structure of the  Constitution.
Besides,   by  the  42nd  Amendment,  Part   IV-A   entitled
'Fundamental Duties' was introduced which inter alia casts a
duty on every citizen to cherish and follow the noble ideals
which inspired our national struggle for freedom, to  uphold
and  protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of  India,
to  promote  harmony and the spirit  of	 common	 brotherhood
amongst	 all  the people of  India  transcending  religious,
linguistic  and	 regional or sectional diversities,  and  to
value  and  preserve  the rich	heritage  of  our  composite
culture.   These  provisions which I have  recalled  briefly
clearly	 bring	out  the  dual	concept	 of  secularism	 and
democracy, the principles of accommodation and tolerance  as
advocated  by  Gandhiji and other national leaders.   I	 am,
therefore,  in	agreement  with the views  expressed  by  my
learned	 colleagues Sawant, Ramaswamy and Reddy,  JJ.,	that
secularism  is	a basic feature of our	Constitution.	They
have elaborately dealt with this aspect of the matter and  I
can do no better than express my concurrence but I have said
these few words merely to complement their views by pointing
out how this concept was understood immediately before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">79</span>
the  Constitution and till the 42nd Amendment.	By the	42nd
Amendment what was implicit was made explicit. 30.     After
the   demise  of  Gandhiji  national  leaders  like   Pandit
Nehru,Maulana  Azad, Dr Ambedkar and others tried their best
to see that the secular	 character   of	  the	nation,	  as
bequeathed  by Gandhiji, was not jeopardised.  Dr  Ambedkar,
Chairman   of	the  Drafting  Committee,   aware   of	 the
undercurrents	cautioned   that  India	 was   not   yet   a
consolidated  and integrated nation but had to	become	one.
This  anxiety  was  also reflected in his  speeches  in	 the
Constituent  Assembly.	 He was,  therefore,  careful  while
drafting the Constitution to ensure that adequate safeguards
were  provided	in the Constitution to protect	the  secular
character  of  the country and to keep	divisive  forces  in
check  so  that the interests of religious,  linguistic	 and
ethnic	groups	were not prejudiced.   He  carefully  weaved
Gandhiji's  concept  of secularism and	democracy  into	 the
constitutional fabric.	This becomes evident from a  cursory
look  at  the  provisions of the  Constitution	referred  to
earlier.
</p><p id="p_42">Judicial Review and Justiciability
Constitution, the possibility of different political parties
ruling	at  the Centre and in one or more States  cannot  be
ruled out.  The Constitution clearly permits it.  Therefore,
the mere defeat of the ruling party at the Centre cannot  by
itself,	 without  anything more, entitle the  newly  elected
party  which  comes  to power at the Centre  to	 advise	 the
President  to dissolve the Assemblies of those States  where
the  party  in power is other than the one in power  at	 the
Centre.	  Merely  because  a different	political  party  is
elected	 to  power at the Centre, even if  with	 a  thumping
majority, is no ground to hold that 'a situation has  arisen
in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in
accordance with the provisions of this Constitution',  which
is  the requirement for the exercise of power under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_43">Article
356(1)</a>	of  the Constitution.  To exercise power  under	 the
said  provision and to dissolve the State Assemblies  solely
on the ground of a new political party having come to  power
at  the	 Centre with a sweeping majority would, to  say	 the
least,	betray	intolerance  on	 the  part  of	the  Central
Government  clearly  basing  the  exercise  of	power  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_44">Article	 356(1)</a>	 on considerations extraneous  to  the	said
provision and, therefore, legally mala fide.  It is a matter
of common knowledge that people vote for different political
parties at the Centre and in the States and, therefore, if a
political party with an ideology different from the ideology
of the political party in power in any State comes to  power
in the Centre, the Central Government would not be justified
in exercising power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_45">Article 356(i)</a> unless it is  shown
that  the  ideology of the political party in power  in	 the
State  is  inconsistent with the  constitutional  philosophy
and, therefore, it is not possible for that party to run the
affairs	 of the State in accordance with the  provisions  of
the Constitution.  It is axiomatic that no State  Government
can  function  on a programme which is	destructive  of	 the
constitutional	philosophy as such functioning can never  be
in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.	 But
where a State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">80</span>
Government is functioning in accordance with the  provisions
of the Constitution and its ideology is consistent with	 the
constitutional philosophy, the Central Government would	 not
be  justified in resorting to <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_46">Article 356(1)</a> to get  rid  of
the State Government 'solely' on the ground that a different
political  party  has  come to power at the  Centre  with  a
landslide victory.  Such exercise of power would be  clearly
mala fide.  The decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_47">State of Rajasthan
v.  Union of' India3</a> to the extent it is  inconsistent	with
the above discussion, does not, in my humble view, lay	down
the law correctly.
</p><p id="p_43">32.  Since  it	was not disputed before us  by	the  learned
Attorney  General  as  well as	Mr  Parasaran,	the  learned
counsel	 for the Union of India, that a Proclamation  issued
by  the President on the advice of his Council of  Ministers
headed	by  the	 Prime Minister,  is  amenable	to  judicial
review, the controversy narrows down to the determination of
the scope and ambit of judicial review i.e. in other  words,
to  the area of justiciability.	 The debate at the  Bar	 was
limited	 to this area; the learned Attorney General as	well
as  Mr Parasaran contending for the view that the  law	laid
down  in the Rajasthan case3 in this behalf was correct	 and
did  not require reconsideration while the counsel  for	 the
State	Governments  concerned	which  were  superseded	  by
exercise  of power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_48">Article 356(1)</a> contending that	 the
said decision required reconsideration.
</p><p id="p_44">33.  Before I deal with the said issue I may dispose of	 the
question  whether  the	provision of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_49">Article  74(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution permits withholding of the reasons and material
forming the basis for the ministerial advice tendered to the
President.  <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_50">Article 74(1)</a> ordains that the President ,shall'
act in accordance with the advice tendered by the Council of
Ministers.   The proviso, however, entities him	 to  require
the Council of Ministers to reconsider its advice if he	 has
any doubts or reservation but once the Council of  Ministers
has  reconsidered  the	advice,	 he is	obliged	 to  act  in
accordance therewith.  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_51">Article 74(2)</a> then provides that "the
question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered to
the  President	shall not be inquired into  in	any  Court".
What  this clause bars from being inquired into is  "whether
any, and if so what, advice was tendered" and nothing beyond
that.	This question has been elaborately discussed  by  my
learned colleagues who have examined in detail its pros	 and
cons in their judgments and, therefore, I do not consider it
necessary  to traverse the same path.  It would	 suffice  to
say  that since reasons would form part of the	advice,	 the
Court  would be precluded from calling for their  disclosure
but  I agree that <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_52">Article 74(2)</a> is no bar to the  production
of  all	 the material on which the  ministerial	 advice	 was
based.	Of course the privilege available under the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_53">Evidence
Act</a>,  <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_54">Sections	123</a>  and <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_55">124</a>, would  stand  on	a  different
footing	 and  can  be claimed dehors <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_56">Article  74(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.  To the extent the decision in Rajasthan case3
conflicts with this view, I respectfully disagree.
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">81</span>
</p><p id="p_45">34. That takes me to the question of the scope and extent of
judicial  review i.e. the area of justiciability insofar  as
the  subjective satisfaction of the President under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_57">Article
356(1)</a> of the Constitution is concerned.  Part XVIII,  which
deals  with  emergency provisions provides for	exercise  of
emergency  powers under different situations.	<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_58">Article	 352</a>
provides  that "if the President is satisfied" that a  grave
emergency  exists threatening the security of India  or	 any
part thereof, whether by war or external aggression or armed
rebellion,  the	 President may make a  declaration  to	that
effect	 specifying  the  area	of  its	 operation  in	 the
Proclamation.	Notwithstanding the use of the language	 "if
the President is satisfied" which suggests that the decision
would	depend	on  the	 subjective  satisfaction   of	 the
President,  counsel  agreed that such a decision  cannot  be
made the subject-matter of judicial scrutiny for the obvious
reason that the existence or otherwise of a grave  emergency
does not fall within the purview of judicial scrutiny  since
the  Courts  are ill-equipped to undertake such	 a  delicate
function.   So	also  under  <a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_59">Article  360</a>  the	exercise  of
emergency  power  is dependent on the  satisfaction  of	 the
President that a situation has arisen whereby the  financial
stability  or  credit  of  India  or  any  part	 thereof  is
threatened.  The decision to issue a Proclamation containing
such   a  declaration  is  also	 based	on  the	  subjective
satisfaction  of the President, i.e., Council of  Ministers,
but the court would hardly be in a position to X-ray such  a
subjective  satisfaction for want of expertise in regard  to
fiscal matters.	 These provisions, therefore, shed light  on
the extent of judicial review.
</p><p id="p_46">35.  The  marginal note of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_60">Article 356</a>	indicates  that	 the
power conferred by that provision is exercisable "in case of
failure	 of constitutional machinery in the States".   While
the  text  of  the  said  article  does	 not  use  the	same
phraseology,  it  empowers  the	 President,  on	 his   being
satisfied  that,  "a  situation has  arisen"  in  which	 the
Government of the State 'cannot' be carried on in accordance
with  the  provisions  of the  Constitution,  i.e.,  on	 the
failure	 of the constitutional machinery, to take action  in
the manner provided in sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) and (sic
of) clause (1) thereof.	 This action he must take on receipt
of  a  report from the Governor of the	State  concerned  or
,otherwise', if he is satisfied therefrom about the  failure
of  the	 constitutional machinery.  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_61">Article  356(i)</a>  confers
extraordinary  powers  on  the	President,  which  he	must
exercise sparingly and with great circumspection, only if he
is  satisfied from the Govern's report or otherwise  that  a
situation  has arisen in which the Government of  the  State
cannot	be carried out in accordance with the provisions  of
the  Constitution.   The expression 'otherwise' is  of	very
wide import and cannot be restricted to material capable  of
being  tested  on principles relevant  to  admissibility  of
evidence  in  courts  of  law.	It  would  be  difficult  to
predicate the nature of material which may be placed  before
the President or which he may have come across before taking
action	under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_62">Article 356(1).</a>  Besides, since the  President
is  not	 expected to record his reasons for  his  subjective
satisfaction, it would be equally difficult for the Court to
enter 'the political thicket' to ascertain what weighed with
the  President	for  the exercise of power  under  the	said
provision.  The test laid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">82</span>
down  by this Court in <a href="/doc/1748256/" id="a_63">Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company	 Law
Board6</a>	and subsequent decisions for adjudging the  validity
of administrative action can have no application for testing
the  satisfaction  of the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_64">Article  356.</a>	  It
must  be remembered that the power conferred by <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_65">Article	 356</a>
is  of	an  extraordinary nature to be	exercised  in  grave
emergencies  and,  therefore,  the exercise  of	 such  power
cannot	be equated to the power exercised in  administrative
law  field  and	 cannot, therefore, be tested  by  the	same
yardstick.  Several imponderables would enter  consideration
and govern the ultimate decision, which would be based,	 not
only  on events that have preceded the decision,  but  would
also depend on likely consequences to follow and, therefore,
it  would  be wholly incorrect to view the exercise  of	 the
President's  satisfaction  on a par  with  the	satisfaction
recorded   by	executive  officers  in	 the   exercise	  of
administrative	control.   The opinion which  the  President
would form on the basis of the Govern's report or  otherwise
would be based on his political judgment and it is difficult
to evolve judicially manageable norms for scrutinising	such
political decisions.  It, therefore, seems to me that by the
very nature of things which would govern the decision-making
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_66">Article 356</a>, it is difficult to hold that the decision
of the President is justiciable.  To do so would be entering
the  political thicket and questioning the political  wisdom
which the courts of law must avoid.  The temptation to delve
into  the  President's	satisfaction may be  great  but	 the
courts	would be well advised to resist the  temptation	 for
want  of judicially manageable standards.  Therefore, in  my
view,	the   court  cannot  interdict	the   use   of	 the
constitutional	power  conferred  on  the  President   under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_67">Article	 356</a>  unless  the same is shown	 to  be	 mala  fide.
Before	exercise  of  the  court's  jurisdiction  sufficient
caution must be administered and unless a strong and  cogent
prima  facie  case  is made out, the President	 i.  e.	 the
Executive must not be called upon to answer the charge.	  In
this  connection I agree with the observation of  Ramaswamy,
J.  I am also in agreement with Verma, J. when he says	that
no  quia timet action would be permissible in such cases  in
view of the limited scope of judicial review in such  cases.
I  am,	therefore,  in respectful agreement  with  the	view
expressed  in the Rajasthan case3 as regards the  extent  of
review available in relation to a Proclamation issued  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_68">Article	 356</a> of the Constitution.  In other words it can  be
challenged  on	the limited ground that the action  is	mala
fide or ultra vires <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_69">Article 356</a> itself.
</p><p id="p_47">36.  Applying the above test I am in agreement with the view
that the Proclamations issued and consequential action taken
against	 the  States of Madhya	Pradesh,  Himachal  Pradesh,
Rajasthan  and	Karnataka  are	not  justiciable  while	 the
Proclamation  issued  in connection with  Meghalaya  may  be
vulnerable  but	 it is not necessary to issue any  order  or
direction  in  that behalf as the issue is no more  live  in
view of the subsequent developments that have taken place in
that State after fresh elections.  I am, therefore, in
6 1966 Supp SCR 311: AIR 1967 SC 295: (1966) 36 Comp Cas 639
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">83</span>
respectful agreement with the final order proposed by Verma,
J.  and Ramaswamy, J. I may also add that I agree  with	 the
view  expressed by all the three learned colleagues  on	 the
concept of secularism.
</p><p id="p_48">37.  This   also  indicates  the  areas	 of  agreement	 and
disagreements with the views expressed by Sawant and  Reddy,
JJ.
</p><p id="p_49">38.  Before concluding, I must express my gratitude for	 the
excellent  assistance  rendered	 by  the  learned   Attorney
General	 and  all the learned counsel who appeared  for	 the
contesting parties.
</p><p id="p_50">VERMA,	J.  (for  himself and  Yogeshwar  Dayal,  J.)-	This
separate opinion is occasioned by the fact that in our	view
the  area  of  justiciability is  even	narrower  than	that
indicated in the elaborate opinions prepared by our  learned
brethren.   The purpose of this separate note is  merely  to
indicate the area of such difference.  It is unnecessary  to
mention	 the facts and discuss the factors which must  guide
the  exercise  of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_70">Article 356</a>  which  have	been
elaborately discussed in the other opinions.  Indication  of
these factors including the concept of secularism for proper
exercise  of  the power does not mean necessarily  that	 the
existence  of  these factors is justiciable.  In  our  view,
these  factors must regulate the issuance of a	Proclamation
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_71">Article 356</a> to ensure proper exercise of the power but
the  judicial  scrutiny	 thereof is available  only  in	 the
limited	 area indicated hereafter, the remaining area  being
amenable  to scrutiny and correction only by Parliament	 and
the subsequent electoral verdict.
</p><p id="p_51">40.  There is no dispute that the Proclamation issued  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_72">Article 356</a> is subject	 to judicial review.  The debate  is
confined essentially to the scope of judicial	  review  or
the  area of justiciability in that sphere.  It does  appear
that  the  area of justiciability is narrow in view  of	 the
nature	of that power and the wide discretion which  inheres
in  its	 exercise.  This indication appears  also  from	 the
requirement  of approval of the Proclamation  by  Parliament
which is a check provided in the Constitution of scrutiny by
political  process of the decision taken by  the  Executive.
The  people's  verdict	in  the	 election  which  follow  is
intended to be the ultimate check.
</p><p id="p_52">41.  To determine the justiciable area, we prefer to  recall
and  keep in view that which was said in <a href="/doc/104223/" id="a_73">K. Ashok  Reddy  v.
Government of India7</a> thus: (SCC pp. 315-16, paras 21-23)
	      "21.    A	  useful   passage   from    Craig's
	      Administrative Law (Second Edn., p. 291) is as
	      under:
</p><p id="p_53">	      'The traditional position was that the  courts
	      would  control  the existence  and  extent  of
	      prerogative  power,  but	not  the  manner  of
	      exercise thereof. ... The traditional position
	      has however now been modified by the  decision
	      in the GCHQ case8.  Their Lordships emphasised
	      that the review ability of discretionary power
	      should  be dependent upon	 the  subject-matter
	      thereof, and not whether its
	      7 (1994) 2 SCC 303: JT (1994) 1 SC 401
	      8	    Council  (of  Civil	 Service  Unions  v.
</p><p id="p_54">	      Minister for the Civil Service, (1985) AC 374:
	      (1984) 3 All ER 935
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">	      84</span>
	      prerogative  power  would,  because  of  their
	      subject-matter, be less justiciable, with Lord
	      Roskill  compiling the broadest list  of	such
	      forbidden territory. ...'
</p><p id="p_55">22.  In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for	 the
Civil Service8 (GCHQ case), Lord Roskill stated thus: (AC p.
418, All ER P. 956)
	      , But I do not think that	 right of  challenge
	      can be unqualified.  It must, I think,  depend
	      upon  the	 subject-matter of  the	 prerogative
	      power which is exercised.	 Many examples	were
	      given  during  the  argument  of	 prerogative
	      powers  which as at present advised I  do	 not
	      think  could properly be made the	 subject  of
	      judicial	review.	 Prerogative powers such  as
	      those relating to the making of treaties,	 the
	      defence  of  the	realm,	the  prerogative  of
	      mercy, the grant of honors, the dissolution of
	      Parliament and the appointment of ministers as
	      well  as others are not, I think,	 susceptible
	      to  judicial review because their	 nature	 and
	      subject-matter  is such as not to be  amenable
	      to the judicial process. ...'
</p><p id="p_56">23.  The same indication of judicial self-restraint in	such
matters	 is  to be found in De Smith's	Judicial  Review  of
Administrative Action, thus: (p. 3 2)
	      "	 Judicial  self-restraint  was	still	more
	      marked  in cases where attempts were  made  to
	      impugn the exercise of discretionary powers by
	      alleging abuse of the discretion itself rather
	      than  alleging  nonexistence of the  state  of
	      affairs on which the validity of its  exercise
	      was  predicated.	Quite properly,	 the  courts
	      were  slow  to read implied  limitations	into
	      grants  to  wide	discretionary  powers  which
	      might  have  to be exercised on the  basis  of
	      broad considerations of national policy.' "
</p><p id="p_57">42.  It	 is also useful to refer to Puhlhofer v.  Hillingdon
London Borough Council9 wherein Lord Brightman with whom the
other Law Lords agreed, stated thus: (All ER p. 474)
	      "Where  the  existence or non-existence  of  a
	      fact is left to the judgment and discretion of
	      a	 public body and that fact involves a  broad
	      spectrum	ranging	 from  the  obvious  to	 the
	      debatable	 to the just conceivable, it is	 the
	      duty  of	the court to leave the	decision  of
	      that   fact  to  the  public  body   to	whom
	      Parliament  has entrusted the  decision-making
	      power save in a case where it is obvious	that
	      the public body, consciously or unconsciously,
	      are acting perversely."
</p><p id="p_58">In  our	 view, this principle is equally applicable  in	 the
present	 case  to  determine the extent	 to  which  alone  a
Proclamation issued under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_74">Article 356</a> is justiciable.
</p><pre id="pre_2">8    (1985) AC 374: (1984) 3 All ER 935
9    (1986) AC 484: (1986) 1 All ER 467
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">85</span>
</pre><p id="p_59">43. The question now is of the test applicable to  determine
the  situation	in  which the power of	judicial  review  is
capable	 of exercise or, in other words, the controversy  is
justiciable.   The  deeming provision in <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_75">Article 365</a>  is  an
indication  that cases falling within its ambit are  capable
of judicial scrutiny by application of objective  standards.
The   facts  which  attract  the  legal	 fiction  that	 the
constitutional machinery has failed are specified and  their
existence  is  capable of objective determination.   It	 is,
therefore,  reasonable to hold that the cases falling  under
<a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_76">Article 365</a> are justiciable.
</p><p id="p_60">44.  The expression 'or otherwise' in <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_77">Article 356</a>  indicates
the wide range of the	 materials  which may be taken	into
account for the formation of opinion	by  the	  President.
Obviously,   the   materials  could   consist	of   several
imponderables  including some matter which is  not  strictly
legal evidence, the credibility and authenticity of which is
incapable  of  being  tested in law  courts.   The  ultimate
opinion	 formed in such cases, would be mostly a  subjective
political  judgment.   There are  no  judicially  manageable
standards for scrutinising such materials and resolving such
a  controversy.	 By its very nature such controversy  cannot
be  justiciable.  It would appear that all such	 cases	are,
therefore, not justiciable.
</p><p id="p_61">45.  It would appear that situations wherein the failure  of
constitutional	machinery  has to be  inferred	subjectively
from  a variety of facts and circumstances,  including	some
imponderables	and  inferences	 leading  to  a	  subjective
political  decision,  judicial scrutiny of the same  is	 not
permissible  for  want of judicially  manageable  standards.
These  political  decisions  call  for	judicial  hands	 off
envisaging   correction	 only  by  a  subsequent   electoral
verdict, unless corrected earlier in Parliament.
</p><p id="p_62">46.  In other words, only cases which permit application  of
totally	  objective  standards	for  deciding  whether	 the
constitutional	 machinery  has	 failed,  are  amenable	  to
judicial review and the remaining cases wherein there is any
significant  area  of subjective satisfaction  dependent  on
some imponderables or inferences are not justiciable because
there  are no judicially manageable standards for  resolving

would  be permissible in such cases in view of	the  limited
scope  of judicial review; and electoral verdict  being	 the
ultimate check, courts can grant substantive relief only  if
the  issue remains live in cases which are justiciable.	  <a href="/doc/1686885/" id="a_84">In
Kihoto	Hollohan v. Zachillhu10</a> it was stated thus: (SCC  p.
711, para 110)
	      "In  view	 of the limited	 scope	of  judicial
	      review  that  is available on account  of	 the
	      finality clause in paragraph 6 and also having
	      regard  to the constitutional  intendment	 and
	      the   status   of	 the   repository   of	 the
	      adjudicatory   power  i.e.   Speaker/Chairman,
	      judicial review cannot be available at a stage
	      prior  to	 the  making of a  decision  by	 the
	      Speaker/	Chairman  and a	 quia  timet  action
	      would   not   be	 permissible.	 Nor   would
	      interference    be    permissible	   at	  an
	      interlocutory stage of the proceedings."
</p><p id="p_66">50.  It is also clear that mere parliamentary approval	does
not  have  the effect of excluding judicial  review  to	 the
extent	permissible.   <a href="/doc/162253/" id="a_85">In  Sarojini Ramaswami  v.  Union  of
India11</a> it has been stated thus: (SCC pp. 560-61)
	      "72.    We   may,	 however,   add	  that	 the

	      which  according to Shri Sibal  would  totally
	      exclude	judicial  review  thereafter  is   a
	      misapprehension since limited judicial  review

	      the  effect  of Parliament's  intervention  is
	      stated thus: (at p. 29)
	      'There	are    many   cases    where	some
	      administrative order or regulation is required

Later  at  p. 41 1, Wade has said that 'in  accordance	with
constitutional	principle, parliamentary approval  does	 not
affect the normal operation of judicial review'.  At p.	 870
while  discussing  'Judicial  Review',	Wade  indicates	 the
position thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      'As these cases show, judicial review is in no
	      way  inhibited  by  the  fact  that  rules  or
	      regulations  have been laid before  Parliament
	      and approved, despite the ruling of the  House
	      of  Lords	 that the test	of  unreasonableness
	      should  not  then operate in its	normal	way.
	      The Court of Appeal has emphasised that in the
	      case  of	subordinate legislation such  as  an
	      Order  in	 Council approved in draft  by	both
	      Houses,  "the  courts would without  doubt  be
	      competent to consider whether or not the order
	      was properly made in the sense of being  intra
	      vires".'
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      74.   The clear indication, therefore, is that
	      mere  parliamentary approval of an  action  or
	      even  a  report by an outside  authority	when
	      without such approval, the action or report is
	      ineffective  by  itself,	does  not  have	 the
	      effect  of  excluding judicial review  on	 the
	      permissible grounds."
</blockquote><p id="p_69">51.  Applying  this  principle, only the Meghalaya  case  is
justiciable  and that Proclamation was invalid	while  those
relating to Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan	 and
Karnataka   are	 not  justiciable.   There  is	rightly	  no
challenge  to  the Proclamation relating to  Uttar  Pradesh.
However,  in  view  of	the  subsequent	 elections  held  in
Meghalaya,  that is no longer a live issue  and,  therefore,
there is no occasion to grant any substantial relief even in
that case,
</p><p id="p_70">52.  It	 is to this extent our view differs on the  question
of  justiciability.  On this view, it is unnecessary for  us
to  express any opinion on the remaining matters,  According
to us, except to the extent indicated, the decision in <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_86">State

<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_87">Article	  356</a>  has  a  vital  bearing  on   the	  democratic
parliamentary  form  of Government and the autonomy  of	 the
States under the federal constitution that we have  adopted.
The interpretation of the article has, therefore, once again
engaged the attention of this Court in the background of the
removal	 of  the  Governments and  the	dissolution  of	 the
Legislative  Assemblies	 in  six States with  which  we	 are
concerned  here,  on different occasions  and  in  different
situations by the exercise of power under the article.	 The

matters	 is whether the President has unfettered  powers  to
issue Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_88">Article 356(1)</a> of the Constitution.
The answer to this question depends upon the answers to	 the
following  questions:  (a) Is the Proclamation	amenable  to
judicial  review?  (b)	If yes, what is	 the  scope  of	 the
judicial review in this respect? and (c) What is the meaning
of the expression "a situation has arisen in which the

</blockquote><p id="p_80">55.  Before we analyse the provisions of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_91">Article 356</a>, it  is
necessary  to bear in mind the context in which the  article
finds place in the Constitution.  The article belongs to the
family	of Articles 352 to 360 which have been	incorporated
in  Part  XVIII dealing with "Emergency Provisions"  as	 the
title  of  the said part specifically declares.	  Among	 the
preceding articles, <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_92">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">90</span>
352</a> deals with Proclamation of emergency.  It states that if
the  President	is satisfied that a grave  emergency  exists
whereby	 the  security	of  India or  of  any  part  of	 the
territory  thereof is threatened whether by war or  external
aggression or armed rebellion, he may by Proclamation make a
declaration to that effect in respect of the whole of  India
or of such part of the territory thereof as may be specified
in the Proclamation.  Explanation to clause (1) of the	said
article states that Proclamation of emergency declaring that
the  security of India or any part of the territory  thereof
is  threatened by war or by external aggression or by  armed
rebellion,  may be made before the actual occurrence of	 war
or  of any such aggression or rebellion if the President  is
satisfied that there is imminent danger thereof.  Clause (4)
of the said article requires that every Proclamation  issued
under  the said article shall be laid before each  House  of
Parliament  and shall cease to operate at the expiration  of
one  month, unless before the expiration of that  period  it
has   been  approved  by  resolutions  of  both	 Houses	  of
Parliament.  It is not necessary for our purpose to refer to
other provisions of the said article.  <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_93">Article 353</a> refers to
the effect of the Proclamation of emergency.  It states that
while  the  Proclamation  of  emergency	 is  in	  operation,
executive  power of the Union shall extend to the giving  of
the  directions to any State as to the manner In  which	 the
executive  power  thereof is to be  exercised.	 It  further
states that during the emergency the power of Parliament  to
make laws with respect to any matter, shall include power to
make   laws  conferring	 powers	 and  imposing	 duties	  or
authorising  the conferring of powers and the imposition  of
duties	upon  the Union or officers and authorities  of	 the
Union  as respects that matter even if it is not  enumerated
in the Union List.  <a href="/doc/1457920/" id="a_94">Article 354</a> gives power to the President
to  direct  that Articles 268 and 269 which  relate  to	 the
distribution  of  revenue between the Union and	 the  States
shall  cease  to  operate during the  period  of  emergency.
<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_95">Article 358</a> gives power during the emergency to suspend	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_96">Article	 19</a> to enable the  State  (i.e.	 the
Government  and Parliament of India and the  Government	 and
the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other
authorities  within  the  territory of India  or  under	 the
control	 of the Government of India) to make any law  or  to
take any executive action which the State would be competent
to make or to take but for the provisions contained in	Part
III of the Constitution while the Proclamation of  emergency
declaring  that	 the security of India or any  part  of	 the
territory  thereof  is	threatened by  way  or	by  external
aggression, is in operation.  Such power, it appears, cannot
be  assumed  by	 the State when the  security  of  India  is
threatened  by	armed  rebellion  and  the  Proclamation  of
emergency  is  issued for that purpose.	 <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_97">Article  359</a>  gives
power to the President to declare that the right to move any
court for the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III of
the Constitution except those conferred by Articles 20 and 2
1,  shall remain suspended when a Proclamation of  emergency
is in operation.
</p><p id="p_81">56.  <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_98">Article  355</a> makes an important provision.	 It casts  a
duty  on  the  Union  to  protect  States  against  external
aggression and internal disturbance, and to ensure that	 the
Government of every State is carried "in accordance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">91</span>
with  the  provisions of the  Constitution".   This  article
corresponds  to	 <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_99">Article 277-A</a> of  the	Draft  Constitution.
Explaining   the  purpose  of  the  said  article   to	 the
Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar stated as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	      "Some people might think that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_100">Article 277-A</a> is
	      merely a pious declaration, that it ought	 not
	      to be there.  The Drafting Committee has taken
	      a different view and I would therefore like to
	      explain why it is that the Drafting  Committee
	      feels that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_101">Article 277-A</a> ought to be there.  I
	      think  it	 is agreed  that  our  Constitution,
	      notwithstanding the many provisions which	 are
	      contained	 in it whereby the Centre  has	been
	      given   powers  to  override  the	  Provinces,
	      nonetheless is a Federal Constitution and when
	      we   say	that  Constitution  is	 a   Federal
	      Constitution,   it   means  this,	  that	 the
	      Provinces	 are  as sovereign  in	their  field
	      which  is left to them by the Constitution  as
	      the  Centre is in the field which is  assigned
	      to it.  In other words, barring the provisions
	      which  permit  the  Centre  to  override	 any
	      legislation   that  may  be  passed   by	 the
	      Provinces,   the	Provinces  have	 a   plenary
	      authority to make any law for the peace, order
	      and  good government of that  Province.	Now,
	      when once the Constitution makes the provinces
	      sovereign	 and  gives them plenary  powers  to
	      make  any	 law for the peace, order  and	good
	      government  of the province, really  speaking,
	      the  intervention of the Centre or  any  other
	      authority must be deemed to be barred, because
	      that  would  be an invasion of  the  sovereign
	      authority	  of  the  province.   That   is   a
	      fundamental  proposition	which, I  think,  we
	      must accept by reason of the fact that we have
	      a Federal Constitution.  That being so, if the
	      Centre  is to interfere in the  administration
	      of  provincial  affairs,	as  we	propose	  to
	      authorise the Centre by virtue of Articles 278
	      and  278-A,  it  must be	by  and	 under	some
	      obligation which the Constitution imposes upon
	      the  Centre.   The  invasion must	 not  be  an
	      invasion	 which	is  wanton,  arbitrary	 and
	      unauthorised  by law.  Therefore, in order  to
	      make it quite clear that Articles 278 and 278-
	      A are not to be deemed as a wanton invasion by
	      the Centre upon the authority of the province,
	      we  propose  to introduce <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_102">Article	 277-A.</a>	  As
	      Members  will see, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_103">Article 277-A</a> says that  it
	      shall  be	 the duty of the  Union	 to  protect
	      every   unit,   and  also	 to   maintain	 the
	      Constitution.   So far as such  obligation  is
	      concerned, it will be found that it is not our
	      Constitution  alone which is going  to  create
	      this   duty  and	this  obligation.    Similar
	      clauses  appear in the American  Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	      They    also   occur   in	   the	  Australian
	      Constitution,   where  the  constitution,	  in
	      express  terms, provides that it shall be	 the
	      duty of the Central Government to protect	 the
	      units  or the States from external  aggression
	      or internal commotion.  All that we propose to
	      do is to add one more clause to the  principle
	      enunciated  in  the  American  and  Australian
	      Constitutions,  namely, that it shall also  be
	      the   duty  of  the  Union  to  maintain	 the
	      Constitution  in the provinces as	 enacted  by
	      this law.	 There is nothing new in this and as
	      I	 said,	in  view of the	 fact  that  we	 are
	      endowing the provinces with plenary powers and
	      making them sovereign within their own  field,
	      it  is  necessary	 to  provide  that  if	 any
	      invasion of the provincial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">	      92</span>
	      field is done by the Centre it is in virtue of
	      this  obligation.	  It  will  be	an  act	  in
	      fulfillment of the duty and the obligation and
	      it   cannot   be	treated,  so  far   as	 the
	      Constitution   is	 concerned,  as	 a   wanton,
	      arbitrary,  unauthorised	act.   That  is	 the
	      reason, why we have introduced <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_104">Article  277A."</a>
	      (Constituent  Assembly Debates, Vol.   IX,  p.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	      133)
</blockquote><p id="p_82">57.  Articles  278  and	 278-A	of  the	 Draft	Constitution
referred to above correspond to present Articles 356 and 357
of  the	 Constitution respectively.  Thus it is	 clear	from
<a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_105">Article	 355</a> that it is not an independent source  of  power
for   interference  with  the  functioning  of	 the   State
Government  but	 is in the nature of justification  for	 the
measures to be adopted under Articles 356 and 357.  What  is
however,  necessary to remember in this connection  is	that
while  <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_106">Article	355</a> refers to three  situations,  viz.,	 (i)
external  aggression, (ii ) internal disturbance, and  (iii)
non-carrying  on  of  the  Government  of  the	States,	  in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution,  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_107">Article
356</a>  refers only to one situation, viz., the third one.	  As
against this, <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_108">Article 352</a> which provides for Proclamation of
emergency  speaks  of only one situation,  viz.,  where	 the
security  of India or any part of the territory thereof,  is
threatened  either  by war or external aggression  or  armed
rebellion.    The  expression  "internal   disturbance"	  is
certainly of larger connotation than "	armed rebellion" and
includes  situations  arising out of  "armed  rebellion"  as
well.  In other words, while a Proclamation of emergency can
be  made for internal disturbance only if it is	 created  by
armed  rebellion, neither such Proclamation can be made	 for
internal  disturbance  caused by any other situation  nor  a
Proclamation  can  be issued under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_109">Article  356</a>	 unless	 the
internal disturbance gives rise to a situation in which	 the
Government of tile State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the provisions of the Constitution.  A  mere  internal
disturbance  short  of	armed  rebellion  cannot  justify  a
Proclamation  of  emergency  under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_110">Article  352</a>  nor	such
disturbance  can  justify  issuance  of	 Proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_111">Article	 356(1</a>), unless it disables or prevents carrying  on
of  the	 Government  of the State  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of the Constitution.  <a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_112">Article 360</a> envisages	 the
Proclamation of financial emergency by the President when he
is  satisfied  that  a	situation  has	arisen	whereby	 the
financial stability or credit of the country or of any	part
of  the territory thereof is threatened.  It  declares	that
such  Proclamation  shall  be  laid  before  each  House  of
Parliament  and shall cease to operate at the expiration  of
two months unless it is approved by the resolutions of	both
Houses	of  Parliament.	 We have thus  emergency  provisions
contained  in  other  articles	in  the	 same  part  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_83">58.  The common thread running through all these articles in
Part XVIII relating to emergency provisions is that the said
provisions  can be invoked only when there is  an  emergency
and the emergency is of the nature described therein and not
of  any	 other kind.  The Proclamation	of  emergency  under
Articles  352,	356  and 360 is	 further  dependent  on	 the
satisfaction  of the President with regard to the  existence
of the relevant conditions precedent.  The duty cast on	 the
Union  under <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_113">Article 355</a> also arises in the twin  conditions
stated therein.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">93</span>
<p id="p_84">59. It is in the light of these other provisions relating to
the  emergency	that we have to construe the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_114">Article 356.</a>  The crucial expressions in <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_115">Article 356(i)</a>	 are
if  the	 President,  "on  the receipt  of  report  from	 the
Governor  of a State or otherwise" "is satisfied" that	"the
situation  has arisen in which the Government of  the  State
cannot be carried on" "in accordance with the provisions  of
this   Constitution".	The  conditions	 precedent  to	 the
issuance  of the Proclamation, therefore, are: (a) that	 the
President  should  be  satisfied either on the	basis  of  a
report from the Governor of the State or otherwise, (b) that
in  fact a situation has arisen in which the  Government  of
the  State  cannot  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of	the  Constitution.   In	 other	words,	 the
President's  satisfaction  has	to  be	based  on  objective
material.  That material may be available in the report sent
to him by the Governor or otherwise or both from the  report
and  other  sources.   Further, the  objective	material  so
available  must	 indicate that the Government of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.   Thus  the existence  of  the  objective
material showing that the Government of the State cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution  is a condition precedent before the  President
issues	the  Proclamation.  Once such material is  shown  to
exist,	the  satisfaction  of the  President  based  on	 the
material  is not open to question.  However, if there is  no
such  objective	 material  before  the	President,  or	 the
material  before  him  cannot reasonably  suggest  that	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the provisions of the Constitution,  the	Proclamation
issued is open to challenge.
</p><p id="p_85">60.  It	 is  further necessary to note	that  the  objective
material  before  the  President  must	indicate  that	 the
Government of the State "cannot be carried on in  accordance
with the provisions of this Constitution".  In other  words,
the   provisions  require  that	 the  material	before	 the
President  must	 be  sufficient to indicate  that  unless  a
Proclamation  is issued, it is not possible to carry on	 the
affairs	  of  the  State  as  per  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	It  is not every situation  arising  in	 the
State  but a situation which shows that	 the  constitutional
Government  has	 become an impossibility, which	 alone	will
entitle	 the  President to issue  the  Proclamation.   These
parameters of the condition precedent to the issuance of the
Proclamation indicate both the extent of and the limitations
on,  the  power of the judicial review of  the	Proclamation
issued.	 It is not disputed before us that the	Proclamation
issued under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_116">Article 356(1)</a> is open to judicial review.	 All
that  is  contended  is	 that the scope	 of  the  review  is
limited, According to us, the language of the provisions  of
the article contains sufficient guidelines on both the scope
and the limitations, of the judicial review.
</p><p id="p_86">61.  Before we examine the scope and the limitations of	 the
judicial  review  of the Proclamation issued  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_117">Article
356(1</a>),	 it is necessary to deal with the contention  raised
by  Shri  Parasaran appearing for the Union  of	 India.	  He
contended  that there is difference in the nature and  scope
of  the power of judicial review in the	 administrative	 law
and   the  constitutional  law.	  While	 in  the  field	  of
administrative law, the court's power extends to legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">94</span>
control of public authorities in exercise of their statutory
power and therefore not only to preventing excess and  abuse
of power but also to irregular exercise of power, the  scope
of judicial review in the constitutional law extends only to
preventing actions which are unconstitutional or ultra vires
the  Constitution.   The  areas where  the  judicial  power,
therefore can operate are limited and pertain to the  domain
where  the  actions  of the  Executive	or  the	 legislation
enacted infringe the scheme of the division of power between
the  executive,	 the legislature and the  judiciary  or	 the
distribution  of powers between the States and	the  Centre.
Where, there is a Bill of Rights as under our  Constitution,
the  areas also cover the infringements of  the	 Fundamental
Rights.	  The judicial power has no scope in  constitutional
law  beyond  examining	the  said  infringements.   He	also
contended that likewise, the doctrine of proportionality  or
unreasonableness  has no play in constitutional law and	 the
executive  action  and legislation cannot  be  examined	 and
interfered with on the anvil of the said doctrine.
</p><p id="p_87">62.  We	 are afraid that this contention is too broad to  be
accepted.  The implication of this contention, among others,
is that even if the Constitution provides preconditions	 for
exercise  of  power by the constitutional  authorities,	 the
courts	cannot examine whether the preconditions  have	been
satisfied.   Secondly,	if  the powers are  entrusted  to  a
constitutional authority for achieving a particular  purpose
and if the authority concerned under the guise of  attaining
the said purpose, uses the powers to attain an impermissible
object, such use of power cannot be questioned.	 We have not
been   pointed	out  any  authority  in	 support  of   these
propositions.	We also find that many of the parameters  of
judicial review developed in the field of administrative law
are not antithetical to the field of constitutional law, and
they  can  equally  apply  to  the  domain  covered  by	 the
constitutional	law.  That is also true of the	doctrine  of
proportionality.
</p><p id="p_88">63.  We	 may now examine the principles of  judicial  review
evolved	 in  the field of administrative law.  As  has	been
stated	by  Lord Brightman in Chief Constable of  the  North
Wales Police v. Evans" "judicial review, as the words imply,
is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner
in  which the decision was made".  In other words,  judicial
review	is  concerned with reviewing not the merits  of	 the
decision  but  the  decision-making  process  itself.	Lord
Diplock	 in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister	 for
the Civil Service8 (AC at p. 408) has enunciated three heads
of  grounds upon which administrative action is	 subject  to
control	 by  judicial  review, viz.,  (i)  illegality,	(ii)
irrationality and (iii) procedural impropriety.	 He has also
stated	there that the three grounds evolved till  then	 did
not  rule out that "further developments on a case  by	case
basis may not in course of time add further grounds" and has
added	that   "principle  of  proportionality"	  which	  is
recognised  in the administrative law by several members  of
European  Economic  Community may be a possible	 ground	 for
judicial review for
13 (1982) 3 AlI ER 141:(1982) 1 WLR 1155
8 (1985) AC 374: (1984) 3 All ER 935
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">95</span>
adoption in the future.	 It may be stated here that we	have
already	 adopted  the  said  ground  both  statutorily	 and
judicially  in our labour and service  jurisprudence.	Lord
Diplock	 has  explained	 the three  heads  of  grounds.	  By
"illegality"   he   means  that	 the   decision-maker	must
understand  correctly the law that regulates  its  decision-
making power and must give effect to it, and whether he	 has
or  has not, is a justiciable question.	 By  "irrationality"
he means unreasonableness.  A decision may be so  outrageous
or in defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards	that
no sensible person who had applied his mind to the  question
to  be decided, could have arrived at it, and it is for	 the
judges	to  decide  whether a decision	falls  in  the	said
category.   By	"procedural impropriety" he means  not	only
failure	 to  observe the basic rules of natural	 justice  or
failure to act with procedural fairness, but also failure to
observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down in the
legislative instrument by which the tribunal's	jurisdiction
is  conferred even where such failure does not	involve	 any
denial of natural justice.  Where the decision is one  which
does not alter rights or obligations enforceable in  private
law, but only deprives a person of legitimate  expectations,
"procedural  impropriety"  will normally  provide  the	only
ground on which the decision is open to judicial review.
</p><p id="p_89">64.  It was observed by Donaldson, L.J. in R. v. Crown Court
at Carlisle, ex p Marcus-Moore 1 4 that judicial review	 was
capable	 of being extended to meet  changing  circumstances,
but  not  to the extent that it became	something  different
from review by developing an appellate nature.	The  purpose
of  the	 remedy	 of judicial review is to  ensure  that	 the
individual is given fair treatment to substitute the opinion
of  the	 judiciary or of individual judges for that  of	 the
authority constituted by law to decide the matters in issue.
In R v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex p Guinness plc15
(LR   at  p.  842)  he	referred  to  the  judicial   review
jurisdiction   as   being  supervisory	or   as	  'longstep'
jurisdiction.	He observed that unless that restriction  on
the power of the court is observed, the court will under the
guise  of preventing the abuse of power be itself guilty  of
usurping power.	 That is so whether or not there is a  right
of  appeal against the decision on the merits.	The duty  of
the court is to confine itself to the question of  legality.
Its  concern  is with whether  a  decision-making  authority
exceeded its powers, committed an error of law, committed  a
breach	of the rules of natural justice, reached a  decision
which  no reasonable tribunal could have reached  or  abused
its powers.
</p><p id="p_90">65.  Lord  Roskil  in  Council of Civil	 Service  Unions  v.
Minister for the Civil Service8 (AC at p. 414), opined	that
the  phrase  "principles  of  natural  justice"	 "be  better
replaced by speaking of a duty to act fairly. ... It is	 not
for  the courts to determine whether a particular policy  or
particular decisions taken in fulfillment of that policy are
fair.  They are only concerned with the
14 (1981) Times 26 (October, DC)

8 (1985) AC 374: (1984) 3 All ER 935
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">96</span>
manner	in  which those decisions have been  taken  and	 the
extent of the duty to act fairly will vary greatly from case
to case. ... Many features will come into play including the
nature	of  the	 decision  and	the  relationship  of  those
involved on either side before the decision was taken".
</p><p id="p_91">66.  In Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council9 Lord
Brightman stated: (AC p. 518: All ER p. 474)
	      "Where  the  existence or non-existence  of  a
	      fact is left to the judgment and discretion of
	      a	 public body and that fact involves a  broad
	      spectrum	ranging	 from  the  obvious  to	 the
	      debatable	 to the just conceivable, it is	 the
	      duty  of	the court to leave the	decision  of
	      that   fact  to  the  public  body   to	whom
	      Parliament  has entrusted the  decision-making
	      power save in a case where it is obvious	that
	      the public body, consciously or unconsciously,
	      are acting perversely."
</p><p id="p_92">	      67.  In  Leech V. Dy.  Governor  of  Parkhurst
	      Prisonl6	Lord Oliver stated: (AC p. 583:	 All
	      ER p. 512)
	      "...  the susceptibility of a decision to	 the
	      supervision of the courts must depend, in	 the
	      ultimate	 analysis,   on	  the	nature	 and
	      consequences  of the decision and not  on	 the
	      personality or individual circumstances of the
	      person called upon to make the decision."
</p><p id="p_93">68.  While  we are on the point, it will be  instructive  to
refer to a decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan on	 the
same subject, although the language of the provisions of the
relevant  articles  of	the  Pakistan  Constitution  is	 not
couched in the same terms.  In Muhammad Sharif v. Federation
of  Pakistan  17 the question was whether the order  of	 the
President  dissolving the National Assembly on May 29,	1988
was  in	 accordance with the powers conferred on  him  under
<a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_118">Article	 58(2)(b)</a> of the Constitution.	<a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_119">Article 58(2)(b)</a>  is
as follows:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">	      97</span>
	      The Presidential Order read as follows:
	      "Whereas	the objects and purposes  for  which
	      the  National  Assembly was elected  have	 not
	      been fulfilled;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	      And  whereas the law and order in the  country
	      have   broken  down  to  an  alarming   extent
	      resulting	  in  tragic  loss  of	 innumerable
	      valuable lives as well as loss of property;
	      And  whereas  the life, property,	 honour	 and
	      security of the citizens of Pakistan have been
	      rendered totally unsafe and the integrity	 and
	      ideology	of  Pakistan  have  been   seriously
	      endangered;

	      with the provisions of the Constitution and an
	      appeal to the electorate is necessary.
	      Now therefore, 1, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq,
	      President	 of  Pakistan  in  exercise  of	 the

	      <a href="/doc/1665174/" id="a_122">Article 58</a> of the Constitution of the  Islamic
	      Republic	of  Pakistan  hereby  dissolve	 the
	      National Assembly with immediate effect and in
	      consequence  thereof the Cabinet	also  stands
	      dissolved forthwith."
</blockquote><p id="p_94">69.  The  main argument against the order was that an  order
under  the said provision is to be issued not in  subjective
discretion  or opinion but on objective facts in  the  sense
that  the  circumstances  must	exist to  lead	one  to	 the
conclusion  that  the  relevant situation  had	arisen.	  As
against this, the argument of the Attorney General and other
counsel supporting the Presidential Order was that it is the
subjective  satisfaction of the President and it is  in	 his
discretion  and opinion to dissolve the	 National  Assembly.
It was also argued on their behalf that in spite of the fact
that <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_123">Article 58 (2)(b)</a> states that "notwithstanding anything
contained  in clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_124">Article 48</a>", the  President	 may
also dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion  under
<a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_125">Article	 58(2)</a> and when he does exercise his  discretion  to
dissolve  the  Assembly,  the  validity	 thereof  cannot  be
questioned  on any ground whatsoever as provided  for  under
<a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_126">Article 48(2).</a>	Dealing with the first argument, the learned
Chief Justice Salam stated as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	      "Whether	it  is 'subjective'  or	 'objective'
	      satisfaction  of	the President or it  is	 his
	      'discretion' or 'opinion', this much is  quite
	      clear  that the President cannot exercise	 his
	      powers under the Constitution on wish or whim.
	      He has to have facts, circumstances which	 can
	      lead  a  person  of  his	status	to  form  an
	      intelligent  opinion  requiring  exercise	  of
	      discretion  of  such a grave nature  that	 the
	      representative of the people who are primarily
	      entrusted with the duty of running the affairs
	      of the State are removed with a stroke of	 the
	      pen.  His action must appear to be called	 for
	      and  justifiable	under  the  Constitution  if
	      challenged  in a Court of Law.  No doubt,	 the
	      Courts  will  be	chary to  interfere  in	 his
	      'discretion'  or	formation of  the  'opinion'
	      about the 'situation' but if there be no basis
	      or  justification	 for  the  order  under	 the
	      Constitution, the Courts will have to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">	      98</span>
	      perform  their  duty cast on  them  under	 the
	      Constitution.   While doing so, they will	 not
	      be  entering in the political arena for  which
	      appeal to electorate is provided for."
	      Dealing with the second argument, the  learned
	      Chief Justice held:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	      "If the argument be correct then the provision
	      'Notwithstanding anything contained in  clause
	      (2) of <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_127">Article 48'</a> would be rendered redundant
	      as if it was no part of the Constitution.	  It
	      is  obvious and patent that no letter or	part
	      of a provision of the Constitution can be said
	      to  be  redundant or  non-existent  under	 any
	      principle	 of construction  of  Constitutions.
	      The  argument  may be correct in	exercise  of
	      other  discretionary powers but it  cannot  be
	      employed with reference to the dissolution  of
	      National	 Assembly.   Blanket   coverage	  of
	      validity	and unquestionability of  discretion
	      under  <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_128">Article 48(2)</a> was given up when it	 was
	      provided	  under	   <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_129">Article    58(2)</a>	that
	      'Notwithstanding clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_130">Article 48	 ...</a>
	      the  discretion can be exercised in the  given
	      circumstances.  Specific provision will govern
	      the   situation.	  This	 will	also   avoid
	      redundancy.   Courts' power whenever  intended
	      to be excluded is expressly stated;  otherwise
	      it  is  presumed	to be  there  in  Courts  of
	      record.  ... Therefore, it is not quite  right
	      to   contend   that  since  it  was   in	 his
	      'discretion',  on the basis of  his  'opinion'
	      the  President  could  dissolve  the  National
	      Assembly.	  He has to have reasons  which	 are
	      justifiable  in  the eyes of  the	 people	 and
	      supportable by law in a Court of Justice.	 ...
	      It is understandable that if the President has
	      any   justifiable	 reason	 to   exercise	 his
	      'discretion'  in	his 'opinion' but  does	 not
	      wish  to	disclose, he may say so and  may  be
	      believed	or  if called upon  to	explain	 the
	      reason  he  may take the Court  in  confidence
	      without  disclosing the reason in public,	 may
	      be for reason of security of State.  After all
	      patriotism is not confined to the officeholder
	      for the time being.  He cannot simply say like
	      Caesar  it is my will, opinion or	 discretion.
	      Nor  give reasons which have no nexus  to	 the
	      action,  are bald, vague, general or  such  as
	      can  always be given and have been given	with

subject. <a href="/doc/1748256/" id="a_131">In Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board6</a>	 the
facts were that an order was issued on behalf of the Company
Law  Board  under  <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_132">Section  237(b)</a>  of	the  Companies	 Act
appointing four inspectors to investigate the affairs of the
appellant-Company  on the ground that the Board was  of	 the
opinion	 that there were circumstances suggesting  that	 the
business  of the appellant Company was being conducted	with
intent	to  defraud  its creditors,  members  or  any  other
persons and that the persons concerned in the management  of
the affairs of the Company had in connection therewith, been
guilty	of fraud, misfeasance and other	 misconduct  towards
the  Company  and its members.	 The  appellant-Company	 had
filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging	 the
said  order  and one of the grounds of	challenge  was	that
there  was no material on which such order could  have	been
made.  In reply to the petition, the Chairman of the Company
Law  Board  filed an affidavit in which	 it  was  contended,
inter  alia, that there was material on the basis  of  which
the  order was issued and that he had himself examined	this
material and formed the necessary opinion within the meaning
of the said <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_133">Section 237(b)</a> before the issue of the order and
that  it  was  not competent for the Court to  go  into	 the
question  of  the adequacy or otherwise	 of  such  material.
However,  in the course of reply to some of the	 allegations
in  the	 petition, the affidavit in paragraph  14  had	also
proceeded  to  state  the facts on the basis  of  which	 the
opinion	 was formed.  The majority of the judges  held	that
the  circumstances  disclosed in paragraph 14  of  the	said
affidavit must be regarded as the only material on the basis
of  which  the Board formed the opinion before	ordering  an
investigation  under  <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_134">Section  237(b)</a>  and  that  the	said
circumstances could not reasonably suggest that the business
of the Company was being conducted to defraud the creditors,
members	 or other persons or that the management was  guilty
of  fraud towards the Company and its members.	 They  were,
therefore,  extraneous to the matters mentioned	 in  <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_135">Section
237(b)</a>	and the impugned order was ultra vires the  section.
Hidayatullah  J., as he then was, in this connection  stated
that  the power under <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_136">Section 237(b)</a> is discretionary  power
and  the  first requirement for its exercise is	 the  honest
formation  of an opinion that an investigation is  necessary
and  the  next requirement is that there  are  circumstances
suggesting the inferences set out in the section.  An action
not  based on circumstances suggesting an inference  of	 the
enumerated  kind will not be valid.  Although the  formation
of  opinion  is subjective, the existence  of  circumstances
relevant  to the inference as the sine qua non	for  action,
must be demonstrable.  If their existence is questioned,  it
has to be proved at least prima facie.	It is not sufficient
to assert that the circumstances exist, and give no clue  to
what they are, because the circumstances must be such as  to
lead  to  conclusions of certain definiteness.	 Shelat,  J.

issue,	stated	that although the formation  of	 opinion  is
purely	subjective  process and such an	 opinion  cannot  be
challenged   in	 a  court  on  the  ground   of	  propriety,
reasonableness	or sufficiency, the authority  concerned  is
nevertheless  required	to arrive at such  an  opinion	from
circumstances suggesting what is set out in sub-clauses (i),
</p><p id="p_96">(ii)   or   (iii)  of  <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_137">Section	 237(b)</a>.    The	  expression
"circumstances	suggesting" cannot support the	construction
that  even  the existence of circumstances is  a  matter  of
subjective  opinion.   It is hard to  contemplate  that	 the
legislature  could have left to the subjective process	both
the   formation	 of  opinion  and  also	 the  existence	  of
circumstances on which it is to be founded.  It is also	 not
reasonable to say that the clause permitted the authority to
say that it has formed the opinion on circumstances which in
its  opinion  exists  and which in its	opinion	 suggest  an
intent	to defraud or a fraudulent or unlawful purpose.	  If
it is shown that the circumstances do not exist or that they
are such that it is impossible for anyone to form an opinion
therefrom  suggestive of the matters enumerated	 in  <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_138">Section
237(b)</a>,	 the opinion is challengeable on the ground of	non-
application  of mind or perversity or on the ground that  it
was formed on collateral grounds and was beyond the scope of
the statute.

readily	  defer	 to  the  conclusiveness  of  an   executive

or fact upon which the validity of the exercise of the power
is  predicated.	  Administrative decisions  in	exercise  of
powers conferred in subjective terms are to be made in	good
faith  and  on	relevant  considerations.   The	 courts	 can
inquire	 whether  a reasonable man could have  come  to	 the
decision in question without misdirecting himself or the law

reasonableness to which the administrative body is  required
to  conform  may range from the court's opinion of  what  is
reasonable to the criterion of what a reasonable body  might
have  decided; and courts will find out	 whether  conditions

basis.	But the onus of establishing unreasonableness  rests
upon the person challenging the validity of the acts.

63, paras 149 and 150)
	      "So  long	 as  a question	 arises	 whether  an
	      authority	 under	the Constitution  has  acted
	      within the limits of its power or exceeded it,
	      it  can  certainly be decided  by	 the  Court.
</p><p id="p_100">	      Indeed   it   would  be	its   constitutional

	      determining  what	 is the power  conferred  on
	      each  branch  of	Government,  whether  it  is
	      limited,	and if so, what are the	 limits	 and
	      whether any action of that branch transgresses
	      such  limits.  It is for this Court to  uphold
	      the  constitutional values and to enforce	 the
	      constitutional   limitations.   That  is	 the
	      essence of the rule of law.
</p><p id="p_101">	      We must make it clear that the  constitutional
	      jurisdiction of this Court is confined only to
	      saying   whether	the  limits  on	 the   power
	      conferred	  by  the  Constitution	 have	been
	      observed	or  there is transgression  of	such
	      limits.	Here the only limit on the power  of
	      the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_141">Article 356</a>, clause (1) is
	      that the President should be satisfied that  a
	      situation	 has arisen where the Government  of
	      the  State cannot be carried on in  accordance
	      with the provisions of the Constitution.	 The
	      satisfaction of the President is a  subjective
	      one  and cannot be tested by reference to	 any
	      objective	 tests.	  It  is  deliberately	 and
	      advisedly	 subjective  because the  matter  in
	      respect  to which he is to be satisfied is  of
	      such   a	 nature	 that  its   decision	must
	      necessarily be left to the executive branch of
	      Government.   There  may be a  wide  range  of
	      situations which may arise and their political
	      implications  and consequences may have to  be
	      evaluated	 in  order  to	decide	whether	 the
	      situation	 is such that the Government of	 the
	      State cannot be carried on in accordance	with
	      the provisions of the Constitution.  It is not
	      a	 decision  which can be based  on  what	 the
	      Supreme	Court  of  the	United	States	 has
	      described	 as  'judicially  discoverable	 and
	      manageable standards'.  It would largely be  a
	      political	 judgment  based  on  assessment  of
	      diverse  and  varied  factors,  fast  changing
	      situations,  potential  consequences,   public
	      reaction,	  motivations	and   responses	  of
	      different	  classes   of	people	 and   their
	      anticipated  future  behaviour and a  host  of
	      other   considerations,	in  the	  light	  of
	      experience  of  public affairs  and  pragmatic
	      management   of  complex	and  often   curious
	      adjustments  that	 go to make  up	 the  highly
	      sophisticated mechanism of a modem  democratic
	      government.  It cannot, therefore, by its very
	      nature  be a fit subject-matter  for  judicial
	      determination  and  hence it is  left  to	 the
	      subjective   satisfaction	  of   the   Central
	      Government  which	 is best in  a	position  to
	      decide   it.    The  court   cannot   in	 the
	      circumstances,   go  into	 the   question	  of
	      correctness  or  adequacy	 of  the  facts	 and
	      circumstances on which the satisfaction of the
	      Central Government is based. ... But one thing
	      is  certain that if the satisfaction  is	mala
	      fide  or	is based on  wholly  extraneous	 and
	      irrelevant  grounds,  the	 court	would	have
	      jurisdiction to examine it, because in that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">	      102</span>
	      case  there  would be no satisfaction  of	 the
	      President in regard to the matter on which  he
	      is required to be satisfied.  The satisfaction
	      of  the President is a condition precedent  to
	      the  exercise  of	 power	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_142">Article	356</a>,
	      clause  (1) and if it can be shown that  there
	      is  no satisfaction of the President  at	all,
	      the   exercise   of   the	  power	  would	  be
	      constitutionally	invalid.  ...  It  must	  of
	      course be conceded that in most cases it would
	      be difficult, if not impossible, to  challenge
	      the  exercise  of	 power	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_143">Article	356</a>,
	      clause  (1)  even	 on  this  limited   ground,
	      because  the facts and circumstances on  which
	      the satisfaction is based would not be  known,
	      but where it is possible, the existence of the
	      satisfaction  can always be challenged on	 the
	      ground that it is mala fide or based on wholly
	      extraneous and irrelevant grounds. ... This is
	      the narrow minimal area in which the  exercise
	      of  power	 under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_144">Article 356</a>,  clause  (1)  is
	      subject to judicial review and apart from	 it,
	      cannot  rest with the court to  challenge	 the
	      satisfaction   of	 the  President	  that	 the
	      situation contemplated in that clause exists."
</p><p id="p_102">73.  <a href="/doc/1152284/" id="a_145">In Kehar Singh v. Union of India19</a> it is held that	 the
President power under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_146">Article 72</a> of the Constitution dealing
with  the grant of pardons, reprieves, respites,  remissions
of punishments or suspensions, remissions or commutations of
sentences  of  any  person convicted of	 any  offence  falls
squarely  within the judicial domain and can be examined  by
the court by way of judicial review.  However, the order  of
the President cannot be subjected to judicial review on	 its
merits except within the strict limitations defined in	Maru
Rain v. Union of India2O.  Those limitations are whether the
power  is exercised on considerations or actions  which	 are
wholly irrelevant, irrational, discriminatory or mala  fide.
Only in these rare cases the court will examine the exercise
of the said power.
</p><p id="p_103">74.  From  these authorities, one of the  conclusions  which
may  safely  be drawn is that the exercise of power  by	 the
President  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_147">Article 356(1)</a> to  issue  Proclamation  is
subject	 to  the judicial review at least to the  extent  of
examining  whether the conditions precedent to the  issuance
of  the	 Proclamation  have been  satisfied  or	 not.	This
examination  will  necessarily involve the  scrutiny  as  to
whether	 there existed material for the satisfaction of	 the
President   that  a  situation	had  arisen  in	 which	 the
Government  of	the  State  could  not	be  carried  on	  in
accordance   with  the	provisions  of	 the   Constitution.
Needless  to  emphasise	 that it is  not  any  material	 but
material  which	 would	lead  to  the  conclusion  that	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the provisions of the Constitution which	is  relevant
for  the purpose.  It has further to be remembered that	 the
article	 requires that the President "has to  be  satisfied"
that  the  situation  in question  has	arisen.	  Hence	 the
material  in  question	has to be such	as  would  induce  a
reasonable  man to come to the conclusion in question.	 The
expression used
19 (1989) 1 SCC 204: 1989 SCC (Cri) 86: 1988 Supp 3 SCR 1102
20 (1981) 1 SCC 107: 1981 SCC (Cri) 112: (1981) 1 SCR 1196
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">103</span>
in the article is "if the President ... is satisfied".	 The
word "satisfied" has been defined in Shorter Oxford  English
Dictionary (3rd Edn. at p. 1792) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">	      "4.  To  furnish	with  sufficient  proof	  or
	      information,   to	 set  free  from  doubt	  or
	      uncertainty,   to	 convince;  5.	 To   answer
	      sufficiently  (an	 objection,  question);	  to
	      fulfill  or comply with (a request); to  solve
	      (a  doubt,  difficulty);	6.  To	answer	 the
	      requirements   of	  (a   state   of    things,
	      hypothesis,    etc.);    to    accord	with
	      (conditions)."
</blockquote><p id="p_104">Hence, it is not the personal whim, wish, view or opinion or
the  ipse dixit of the President dehors the material  but  a
legitimate  inference drawn from the material placed  before
him which is relevant for the purpose.	In other words,	 the
President  has to be convinced of or has to have  sufficient
proof  of information with regard to or has to be free	from
doubt  or uncertainty about the state of  things  indicating
that  the  situation  in  question  has	 arisen.   Although,
therefore,  the	 sufficiency or otherwise  of  the  material
cannot be questioned, the legitimacy of inference drawn from
such material is certainly open to judicial review.
</p><p id="p_105">75.  It	 has also to be remembered in this  connection	that
the power exercised by the President under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_148">Article 356(1)</a> is
on  the	 advice of the Council of Ministers  tendered  under
<a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_149">Article 74(1)</a> of the Constitution.  The Council of Ministers
under  our  system would always belong to one or  the  other
political party.  In view of the pluralist democracy and the
federal	  structure   that  we	have  accepted	 under	 our
Constitution,  the  party or parties in power  (in  case  of
coalition  Government) at the Centre and in the	 States	 may
not  be	 the  same.  Hence there is a need  to	confine	 the
exercise  of  power  under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_150">Article 356(1)</a>  strictly  to	 the
situation  mentioned therein which is a condition  precedent
to  the	 said  exercise.  That is why  the  Framers  of	 the
Constitution have taken pains to specify the situation which
alone  would  enable the exercise of the  said	power.	 The
situation  is no less than one in which "the  Government  of
the  State  cannot  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions of this Constitution".  A situation short of	 the
same does not empower the issuance of the Proclamation.	 The
word "cannot" emphatically connotes a situation of  impasse.
In  Shorter  Oxford Dictionary, 3rd Edn., at page  255,	 the
word  "can"  is	 defined as "to be able; to  have  power  or
capacity".  The word "cannot", therefore, would mean "not to
be  able"  or  "not  to have the  power	 or  capacity".	  In
Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 5th Edn., the word "cannot" is
defined	 to  include a legal inability as well	as  physical
impossibility.	Hence situations which can be remedied or do
not  create an impasse, or do not disable or interfere	with
the  governance of the State according to the  Constitution,
would  not merit the issuance of the Proclamation under	 the
article.
</p><p id="p_106">76.  It	  has  also  to	 be  remembered	 that  a   situation
contemplated  under the article is one where the  Government
of  the State cannot be carried on "in accordance  with	 the
provisions  of	this Constitution".  The  expression  indeed
envisages  varied situations.  <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_151">Article 365</a> which is in	Part
XIX  entitled  "Miscellaneous", has  contemplated  one	such
situation.  It states that:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">104</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">	      "Where any State has failed to comply with  or
	      to give effect to any directions given in	 the
	      exercise	of the executive power of the  Union
	      under   any   of	the   provisions   of	this
	      Constitution,  it	 shall	be  lawful  for	 the
	      President to hold that a situation has  arisen
	      in which the Government of the State cannot be
	      carried  on in accordance with the  provisions
	      of this Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_107">77.  The  failure  to comply with or to give effect  to	 the
directions given by the Union under any of the provisions of
the  Constitution,  is	of course, not	the  only  situation
contemplated  by  the expression "Government  of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
this Constitution".  <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_152">Article 365</a> is more in the nature of  a
deeming provision.  However, the situations other than those
mentioned  in <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_153">Article 365</a> must be such where the  governance
of the State is not possible to be carried on in  accordance
with   the   provisions	 of  the  Constitution.	   In	this
connection,  we may refer to what Dr Ambedkar had to say  on
the subject in the Constituent Assembly:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	      "Now  I come to the remarks made by my  Friend

	      thing,  which  is	 not  to  be  found  in	 any

<p id="p_110">	      A wide literal construction of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_159">Article 356(1</a>),
	      will reduce the constitutional distribution of
	      the powers between the Union and the States to
	      a	 licence  dependent on the pleasure  of	 the
	      Union  Executive.	 Further it will enable	 the
	      Union  Executive	to cut at the  root  of	 the
	      democratic parliamentary form of Government in
	      the State.  It must, therefore, be rejected in
	      favour  of a construction which will  preserve
	      that form of Government.	Hence, the  exercise
	      of the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_160">Article 356</a> must be limited
	      to rectifying a 'failure of the constitutional

</p><p id="p_112">	      6.4.01	 A    failure	of    constitutional

be said to, occur.  It is not necessary here to refer to the

</p><p id="p_122">83.  It	 was contended on behalf of the Union of India	that
since the Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_173">Article 356(1)</a> would be  issued
by  the President on the advice of the Council of  Ministers
given  under  <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_174">Article 74(1)</a> of the  Constitution  and  since
clause	(2)  of	 the  said article  bars  enquiry  into	 the
question whether any, and if so, what advice was tendered by
Ministers  to the President, judicial review of the  reasons
which  led to the issuance of tile Proclamation also  stands
barred.	 This contention is fallacious for reasons more than
one.  In the first instance, it is based on a  misconception
of  the	 purpose  of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_175">Article 74(2).</a>   As  has  been  rightly
pointed	 out by Shri Shanti Bhushan, the object	 of  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_176">Article
74(2)</a> was not to exclude any material or documents from	 the
scrutiny  of the courts but to provide that an order  issued
by  or in the name of the President could not be  questioned
on  the	 ground that it was either contrary  to	 the  advice
tendered  by the Ministers or was issued  without  obtaining
any advice from the Ministers.	Its object was only to	make
the  question whether the President had followed the  advice
of the Ministers or acted contrary thereto, non-justiciable.
What  advice, if any, was tendered by the Ministers  to	 the
President was thus to be beyond the scrutiny of the court.
</p><p id="p_123">84.  A	good  deal  of	light on the  said  purpose  of	 the
provision  is thrown by its history.   Identical  provisions
were contained in Sections 10(4) and 51(4) of the Government
of  India  Act, 1935.  However, in the Government  of  India
Act,  1915,  as amended by the Act of 1919 it  was  provided
under <a href="/doc/1377303/" id="a_177">Section 52(3)</a> as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">	      "In relation to the transferred subjects,	 the
	      Governor shall be guided by the advice of	 his
	      Ministers, unless he sees sufficient cause  to
	      dissent  from their opinion, in which case  he
	      may require action to be taken otherwise	than
	      in accordance with that advice:"
</blockquote><p id="p_124">85.  The relations of the Governor General and the  Governor
with  the Ministers were not regulated by the Act  but	were
left to be governed by an Instrument of Instructions  issued
by the Crown.  It was considered undesirable to define these
relations  in  the  Act or to impose an	 obligation  on	 the
Governor  General or Governor to be guided by the advice  of
their  Ministers,  since  such	a  course  might  convert  a
constitutional convention into a rule of law and thus  bring
it  within  the	 cognisance  of the  court.   Prior  to	 the
Constitution   (42nd   <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_178">Amendment)  Act</a>,	 1976,	 under	 the
constitutional convention, the President was bound to act in
accordance with the advice of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">109</span>
the  Council  of Ministers (Re: <a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_179">Shamsher Singh v.  State  of
Punjab22</a>.)  By	the  42nd Amendment,  it  was  expressly  so
provided in <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_180">Article 74(1).</a>  The object of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_181">Article 74(2)</a>	 was
thus  not  to  exclude any material  or	 document  from	 the
scrutiny of the courts.	 This is not to say that the rule of
exclusion  laid down in <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_182">Section 123</a> of the  Indian  Evidence
Act is given a go-by.  However, it only emphasises that	 the
said rule can be invoked in appropriate cases.
</p><p id="p_125">86.  What  is further, although <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_183">Article 74(2)</a> bars  judicial
review	so  far	 as the advice given  by  the  Ministers  is
concerned,  it does not bar scrutiny of the material on	 the
basis  of  which the advice is given.  The  courts  are	 not
interested  in either the advice given by the  Ministers  to
the  President or the reasons for such advice.	 The  courts
are,  however, justified in probing as to whether there	 was
any material on the basis of which the advice was given, and
whether	 it was relevant for such advice and  the  President
could have acted on it.	 Hence when the courts undertake  an
enquiry into the existence of such material, the prohibition
contained  in <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_184">Article 74(2)</a> does not negate their  right  to
know about the factual existence of any such material.	This
is  not	 to say that the Union Government cannot  raise	 the
plea of privilege under <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_185">Section 123</a> of the Evidence Act.  As
and  when such privilege against disclosure is claimed,	 the
courts will examine such claim within the parameters of	 the
said  section  on its merits.  In this	connection,  we	 may
quote  Justice Mathew, who in the case of State of U. P.  v.
Raj  Narain23 observed as follows: (SCR p. 360: SCC p.	454,
para 74)
	      "To  justify  a  privilege,  secrecy  must  be
	      indispensable  to induce freedom	of  official
	      communication or efficiency in the transaction
	      of official business and it must be further  a
	      secrecy  which  has  remained  or	 would	have
	      remained	inviolable  but for  the  compulsory
	      disclosure.   In	how  many  transactions	  of
	      official	business is there ordinarily such  a
	      secrecy?	 If  there  arises  at	any  time  a
	      genuine  instance of such otherwise  inviolate
	      secrecy,	let the necessity of maintaining  it
	      be determined on its merits."
</p><p id="p_126">87.  Since  further  the Proclamation issued  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_186">Article
356(1)</a> is required by clause (3) of that article to be	laid
before each House of Parliament and ceases to operate on the
expiration  of	two months unless it has  been	approved  by
resolutions  by	 both the Houses of  Parliament	 before	 the
expiration  of that period, it is evident that the  question
as to whether a Proclamation should or should not have	been
made, has to be discussed on the floor of each House and the
two Houses would be entitled to go into the material on	 the
basis  of  which the Council of Ministers had  tendered	 the
advice	to the President for issuance of  the  Proclamation.
Hence  the  secrecy claimed in respect of  the	material  in
question  cannot  remain inviolable, and the  plea  of	non-
disclosure of the material can hardly be pressed.  When	 the
Proclamation is challenged by making out a prima facie	case
with  regard to its invalidity, the burden would be  on	 the
Union Government to satisfy that
22 (1974) 2 SCC 831: 1974 SCC (L&amp;S) 550: (1975) 1 SCR 814
23 (1975) 4 SCC 428: (1975) 3 SCR 333
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">110</span>
there exists material which showed that the Government could
not  be carried on in accordance with the provisions of	 the
Constitution.	Since  such material  would  be	 exclusively
within the knowledge of the Union Government, in view of the
provisions of <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_187">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act, the burden of
proving	  the  existence  of such material would be  on	 the
Union Government.
</p><p id="p_127">88.  A	further	 question  which has  been  raised  in	this
connection is whether	 the  validity of  the	Proclamation
issued	under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_188">Article	356(1)</a> can be under  clause  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_189">Article	 356.</a>	There  is no reason to	make  a	 distinction
between	 the  Proclamation  so approved	 and  a	 legislation
enacted	 by Parliament.	 If the Proclamation is invalid,  it
does not stand validated merely because it is approved of by
Parliament.  The grounds for challenging the validity of the
Proclamation  may  be different from those  challenging	 the
validity of a legislation.  However, that does not make	 any
difference  to the vulnerability of the Proclamation on	 the
limited	 grounds  available.  As has been  stated  by  Prof.
H.W.R. Wade in Administrative Law, 6th Edn.:
</p><p id="p_128">	      "There	are    many   cases    where	some
	      administrative order or regulation is required
	      by  statute to be approved by  resolutions  of
	      the  Houses.   But this procedure	 in  no	 way
	      protects	the order or regulation	 from  being
	      condemned by the court, under the doctrine  of
	      ultra   vires,  if  it  is  not  strictly	  in
	      accordance   with	  the  Act.    Whether	 the
	      challenge	 is made before or after the  Houses
	      have  given their approval is immaterial.	 (p.
</p><p id="p_129">	      29)
	      parliamentary  approval  does not	 affect	 the
	      normal operation of judicial review. (p. 411)
	      As these cases show, judicial review is in  no
	      way  inhibited  by  the  fact  that  rules  or
	      regulations  have been laid before  Parliament
	      and approved, despite the 'ruling of the House
	      of  Lords	 that the test	of  unreasonableness
	      should  not  then operate in its	normal	way.
</p><p id="p_130">	      The Court of Appeal has emphasised that in the
	      case  of	subordinate legislation such  as  an
	      Order  in	 Council approved in draft  by	both
	      Houses,  'the  courts would without  doubt  be
	      competent to consider whether or not the Order
	      was properly made in the sense of being  intra
	      vires'." (p. 870)
</p><p id="p_131">89. In this connection a reference may also be made to R  v.
H.M. Treasury ex p Smedley24 from which decision the learned
author has extracted the aforesaid observations.
</p><p id="p_132">90.  We	 may also point out that the deletion of clause	 (5)
of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_190">Article  356</a>, as it stood prior to its deletion  by	 the
Constitution  '	 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_191">Amendment) Act</a> in 1978,  has  made  no
change	in the legal position that the satisfaction  of	 the
President  under  clause  (1) of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_192">Article  356</a>,	 was  always
judicially reviewable.	The clause read as follows:
24 (1985) QB 657: (1985) 2 WLR 576 (CA)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">111</span>
	      "5.    Notwithstanding   anything	  in	this
	      Constitution,   the   satisfaction   of	 the
	      President	 mentioned in clause (1),  shall  be
	      final   and  conclusive  and  shall   not	  be
	      questioned in any court on any ground."
</p><p id="p_133">91.  On	 the  other  hand, the deletion of  the	 clause	 has
reinforced   the   earlier  legal   position,	viz.,	that
notwithstanding	 the  existence	 of  the  clause  (5),	 the
satisfaction   of  the	President  under  clause   (1)	 was
judicially reviewable and the judicial review was not barred
on  account  of	 the  presence	of  the	 clause.   In	this
connection,  we may usefully refer to the decision  of	this
Court in <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_193">State of Rajasthan v. Union of India3</a> where it	 was
unanimously held that in spite of the said finality  clause,
the Presidential Proclamation was subject to judicial review
on various grounds.  It was observed there as
follows:  (SCR pp. 72, 82: SCC pp. 653, 663, paras 143, 150)
	      "This is indeed a very drastic power which, if
	      misused	 or   abused,	can   destroy	 the
	      constitutional  equilibrium between the  Union
	      and the States and its potential for harm	 was
	      recognised even by the Constitution-makers.
	       Of course by reason of clause (5) of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_194">Article
	      356</a>,  the	 satisfaction of  the  President  is
	      final and conclusive and cannot be assailed on
	      any  ground,  but this  immunity	from  attack
	      cannot  apply where the challenge is not	that
	      the  satisfaction is improper or	unjustified,
	      but that there is no satisfaction at all.	  In
	      such a case it is not the satisfaction arrived
	      at  by the President which is challenged,	 but
	      the existence of the satisfaction itself."
</p><p id="p_134">92.  It	 was accordingly held that in view of  the  finality
clause, the narrow area in which the exercise of power under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_195">Article	 356</a>  was subject to judicial  review  included	 the
grounds	 where the satisfaction is perverse or mala fide  or
based  on wholly extraneous and irrelevant grounds and	was,
therefore, no satisfaction at all.
</p><p id="p_135">93.  <a href="/doc/875590/" id="a_196">In	 A.K.  Roy v. Union of India25</a> (SCC p. 297:  SCR  p.

deleted	  by   the  44th  Amendment  and,   therefore,	 any
observations  made  in the State of Rajasthan case3  on	 the

observations  imply that after the deletion of	clause	(5),
the judicial review of the Proclamation issued under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_197">Article

These	observations  are  of  course,	in  the	  field	  of

</p><p id="p_140">96.  It	 will  be  an  inexcusable  error  to  examine	 the
provisions  of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_200">Article 356</a> from a pure legalistic angle	 and
interpret   their   meaning  only   through   jurisdictional
technicalities.	 The Constitution is essentially a political
document   and	provisions  such  as  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_201">Article  356</a>  have   a
potentiality   to   unsettle   and   subvert   the    entire
constitutional scheme.	The exercise of powers vested  under
such  provisions  needs, therefore, to be  circumscribed  to
maintain  the  fundamental constitutional balance  lest	 the
Constitution is defaced and destroyed.	This can be achieved
even without bending much less breaking the normal rules  of
interpretation, if the interpretation is alive to the  other
equally	 important  provisions of the Constitution  and	 its
bearing on them.  Democracy and federalism are the essential
features  of  our  Constitution and are part  of  its  basic
structure.  Any interpretation that we may place on  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_202">Article
356</a>  must, therefore help to preserve and not subvert  their
fabric.	  The power vested de jure in the President  but  de
facto in the Council of Ministers under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_203">Article 356</a> has	 all
the latent capacity to emasculate the two basic features  of
the Constitution and hence it is necessary to scrutinise the
material  on the basis of which the advice is given and	 the
President   forms   his	 satisfaction	more   closely	 and
circumspectly.	 This  can  be	done  by  the  courts  while
confining  themselves to the acknowledged parameters of	 the
judicial  review  as  discussed	 above,	 viz.,	 illegality,
irrationality and mala fides.  Such scrutiny of the material
will   also  be	 within	 the  judicially  discoverable	 and
manageable standards.
</p><p id="p_141">97.  We	 may in this connection, refer to the principles  of
federalism   and  democracy  which  are	 embedded   in	 our
Constitution.	<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_204">Article	 1</a> of the Constitution	states	that
India  shall  be  a Union of States.  Thus  the	 States	 are
constitutionally  recognised units and not  mere  convenient
administrative	divisions.   Both the Union and	 the  States
have  sprung from the provisions of the	 Constitution.	 The
learned	  author,   H.M.   Seervai,   in   his	  commentary
Constitutional	Law of India (p. 166, 3rd Edn. _  5.36)	 has
summed	up  the	 federal  nature  of  our  Constitution	  by
observing  that	 the federal principle is  dominant  in	 our
Constitution  and the principle of federalism has  not	been
watered down for the following reasons:t
	      "(a)  It is no objection to  our	Constitution
	      being   federal  that  the  States  were	 not
	      independent States before they became parts of
	      a	 Federation.  A federal	 situation  existed,
	      first, when the British Parliament
	      26    (1971) 1 SCC 396: (1971) 3 SCR 483

</pre><p id="p_142">	      adopted  a federal solution in the  G.I.	Act,
	      1935,  and  secondly,  when  the	 Constituent
	      Assembly	adopted	 a federal solution  in	 our
	      Constitution;
</p><p id="p_143">	      (b) Parliament's power to alter the boundaries
	      of States without their consent is a breach of
	      the  federal principle, but in fact it is	 not
			    Parliament which has, on its own, altered  the
	      boundaries of States, By	extra-constitutional
	      agitation,  the States have forced  Parliament
	      to   alter  the  boundaries  of  States.	  In
	      practice, therefore, the federal principle has
	      not been violated;
</p><p id="p_144">	      (c)   The allocation of the residuary power of
	      legislation    to	  Parliament	(i.e.	 the
	      Federation) is irrelevant for determining	 the
	      federal  nature of a Constitution.   The	U.S.
	      and the Australian Constitutions do not confer
	      the  residuary power on the Federation but  on
	      the   States,  yet  those	 Constitutions	 are
	      indisputably federal;
</p><p id="p_145">	      (d)   External sovereignty is not relevant  to
	      the federal nature of a Constitution, for such
	      sovereignty  must belong to the country  as  a
	      whole.	But   the   division   of   internal
	      sovereignty  by a distribution of	 legislative
	      powers is an essential feature of	 federalism,
	      and  our Constitution possesses that  feature.
	      With   limited  exceptions,   the	  Australian
	      Constitution  confers overlapping	 legislative
	      powers  on  the States and  the  Commonwealth,
	      whereas	List   11,  Schedule  VII   of	 our
	      Constitution   confers  exclusive	 powers	  of
	      legislation  on the States,  thus	 emphasising
	      the federal nature of our Constitution;
</p><p id="p_146">	      (e)   The	 enactment  in <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_205">Article	352</a>  of	 the
	      emergency	 power arising from war or  external
	      aggression  which	 threatens the	security  of
	      India  merely recognises de jure what  happens
	      de  facto in great federal countries like	 the
	      U.S., Canada and Australia in times of war, or
	      imminent threat of war, because in war,  these
	      federal  countries  act as  though  they	were
	      unitary.	The presence in our Constitution  of
	      exclusive legislative powers conferred on	 the
	      States  makes  it reasonable to  provide	that
	      during   the  emergency  created	by  war	  or
	      external	aggression,  the Union	should	have
	      power  to	 legislate  on	topics	 exclusively
	      assigned	 to   the   States   and   to	take
	      corresponding executive action.  The Emergency
	      Provisions,  therefore,  do  not	dilute	 the
	      principle of Federalism, although the abuse of
	      those  provisions by continuing the  emergency
	      when  the occasion which caused it had  ceased
	      to  exist does detract from the  principle  of
	      Federal Government.  The amendments introduced
	      in <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_206">Article 352</a> by the 44th Amendment have,  to
	      a considerable extent, reduced the chances  of
	      such abuse.  And by deleting the clauses which
	      made  the declaration and the  continuance  of
	      emergency	 by  the President  conclusive,	 the
	      44th  Amendment has provided  opportunity	 for
	      judicial	review which, it is  submitted,	 the
	      courts  should not lightly decline when  as  a
	      matter of common knowledge, the emergency	 has
	      ceased   to  exist.   This  deletion  of	 the
	      conclusive  satisfaction of the President	 has
	      been  prompted  not only by the abuse  of	 the
	      Proclamation  of emergency arising out of	 war
			    or external aggression, but, even more, by	th
e
	      wholly  unjustified Proclamation of  emergency
	      issued   in  1975	 to  protect  the   personal
	      position of the Prime Minister;

	      armed  rebellion,	 does not detract  from	 the
	      principle of federalism because such a  power,

	      not  inconsistent with the federal  principle.
	      The  war	power belongs to the  Union  in	 all
	      Federal Governments, and therefore the defence
	      of  a  State against  external  aggression  is
	      essential	 in any Federal Government.   As  to
	      internal disturbance, the position reached  in
	      Deb  case28  shows  that	the  absence  of  an
	      application  by the State does not  materially

	      follow  that  in case of conflict of  a  valid

	      expediency  which does not affect the  federal

Ambedkar  had  to  say while answering	the  debate  in	 the
Constituent  Assembly  in the context of the  very  Articles
355,  356 and 357.  The relevant portion of his	 speech	 has
already been reproduced above.	He has emphasised there that
notwithstanding	 the fact that there are many provisions  in
the Constitution whereunder the Centre has been given powers
to  override  the  States, our	Constitution  is  a  federal
Constitution.  It means that the States are sovereign in the
field which is left to them.  They have a plenary  authority
to make any law for the peace, order and good Government  of
the State.
</p><p id="p_156">99.  The above discussion thus shows that the States have an
independent  constitutional  existence	and  they  have	  as
important   a  role  to	 play  in  the	political,   social,
educational  and cultural life of the people as	 the  Union.
They  are neither satellites nor agents of the Centre.	 The
fact   that   during   emergency  and	in   certain   other
eventualities their powers are overridden or invaded by	 the
Centre is not destructive of the essential federal nature of
our   Constitution.    The  invasion  of   power   in	such
circumstances  is not a normal feature of the  Constitution.
They  are  exceptions  and  have  to  be  resorted  to	only
occasionally   to  meet	 the  exigencies  of   the   special
situations.  The exceptions are not a rule.
</p><p id="p_157">100.	  For	our  purpose,  further	it  is	really	 not
necessary  to determine whether, in spite of the  provisions
of  the Constitution referred to above, our Constitution  is
federal, quasi-federal or unitary in nature.  It is not	 the
theoretical   label  given  to	the  Constitution  but	 the
practical implications of the provisions of the Constitution
which  are of importance to decide the question that  arises
in  the	 present  context, viz., whether  the  powers  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_217">Article 356(1)</a> can be exercised by the President arbitrarily
and  unmindful of its consequences to the governance in	 the
State  concerned.   So	long  as the  States  are  not	mere
administrative units but in their own right constitutional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">116</span>
potentates  with  the same paraphernalia as the	 Union,	 and
with  independent Legislature and the Executive	 constituted
by  the	 same  process as the Union, whatever  the  bias  in
favour	of  the	 Centre, it cannot  be	argued	that  merely
because	 (and  assuming it is correct) the  Constitution  is
labeled unitary or quasi-federal or a mixture of federal and
unitary	 structure, the President has unrestricted power  of
issuing	  Proclamation	 under	<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_218">Article	 356(1).</a>    If	 the
Presidential powers under the said provision are subject  to
judicial  review  within the limits discussed  above,  those
limitations   will  have  to  be  applied   strictly   while
scrutinising the concerned material.
</p><p id="p_158">101. It must further not be forgotten that in a representive
democracy in a populous country like ours when	Legislatures
of the States are dissolved pursuant to the power used under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_219">Article	 356(1)</a>	 of the Constitution and the  elections	 are
proposed to be held, it involves for the public exchequer an
enormous expenditure and consequently taxes the public.	 The
machinery  and the resources of the State are diverted	from
other  useful  work.  The expenses of  contesting  elections
which  even otherwise are heavy and unaffordable for  common
man  are  multiplied.  Frequent	 elections  consequent	upon
unjustified  use  of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_220">Article 356(1)</a> has thus  a	 potentially
dangerous  consequence	of  negating  the  very	  democratic
principle  by  making  the  election-contest  the  exclusive
preserve  of  the affluent.  What is further,  the  frequent
dissolution  of the legislature, has the tendency to  create
disenchantment	in the people with the process	of  election
and  thus with the democratic way of life  itself.   History
warns  us that the frustration with democracy has  often  in
the past, led to an invitation	to fascism and	dictatorship
of one form or the other.
</p><p id="p_159">102. The Presidential power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_221">Article 356(1)</a> has also to
be viewed from yet  another  and  equally  important  angle.
Decentralisation    of	 power	 is   not   only    valuable
administrative	  device   to	ensure	 closer	   scrutiny,
accountability and efficiency, but is also an essential part
of  democracy.	 It is for this purpose that <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_222">Article  40</a>  in
Part  IV  of  our Constitution dealing	with  the  Directive
Principles  of State Policy enjoins upon the State  to	take
steps  to  organise village panchayats and endow  them	with
such  powers and authorities as may be necessary  to  enable
them   to  function  as	 units	of  self  governance.	 The
participation of the people in the governance is a sine	 qua
non  of	 democracy.   The democratic way of  life  began  by
direct participation of the people in the day to day affairs
of  the	 society.   With the growth of	population  and	 the
expansion  of  the  territorial	 boundaries  of	 the  State,
representative	democracy  replaced  direct  democracy	 and
people	gradually surrendered more and more of their  rights
of   direct   participation,   to   their   representatives.
Notwithstanding	 the surrender of the requisite	 powers,  in
matters which are retained, the powers are jealously guarded
and  rightly  so.  If it is true to say that  in  democracy,
people are sovereign and all power belongs primarily to	 the
people,	 the retention of such power by the people  and	 the
anxiety	 to  exercise them is legitimate.  The	normal	rule
being the self-govemance, according to the wishes  expressed
by  the	 people, the occasions to interfere with  the  self-
govemance should both be rare and demonstrably compelling.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">117</span>
<p id="p_160">103.  In  this connection, a very  significant	and  special
feature	 of our society has to be constantly kept  in  mind.
Our  society  is, among other things,  multilingual,  multi-
ethnic and multi-cultural.  Prior to independence, political
promises  were	made  that  the States	will  be  formed  on
linguistic basis and the ethnic and cultural identities will
not  only be protected but promoted.  It is in keeping	with
the  said promises, that the States eventually have come  to
be  organised  broadly on linguistic,  ethnic  and  cultural
basis.	The people in every State desire to fulfil their own
aspirations  through self-govemance within the framework  of
the   Constitution.   Hence  interference  with	 the   self-
governance  also amounts to the betrayal of the	 people	 and
unwarranted  interference.  The betrayal of  the  democratic
aspirations  of the people is a negation of  the  democratic
principle which runs through our Constitution.
</p><p id="p_161">104.  What  is further and this is an equally  if  not	more
important aspect of our Constitutional law we have adopted a
pluralist  democracy.	It implies, among  other  things,  a
multi-party system.  Whatever the nature of federalism,	 the
fact remains that as stated above, as per the provisions  of
the Constitution, every State is constituent political	unit
and  has  to  have an exclusive	 Executive  and	 Legislature
elected	 and  constituted by the same process as  the  Union
Government.   Under  our  political  and  electoral  system,
political  parties  may operate at the	State  and  national
level  or  exclusively	at the State level.   There  may  be
different  political parties in different States and at	 the
national  level.   Consequently, situations  may  arise,  as
indeed	they  have, when the political parties in  power  in
various	 States and at the Centre may be different.  It	 may
also happen as has happened till date that through political
bargaining,  adjustment	 and understanding,  a	State  level
party  may  agree to elect candidates of  a  national  level
party  to  Parliament  and  vice  versa.   This	 mosaic	  of
variegated pattern of political life is potentially inherent
in  a pluralist multi-party democracy like ours.  Hence	 the
temptation of the political party or parties in power (in  a
coalition Government) to destabilise or sack the  Government
in the State not run by the same political party or  parties
is  not	 rare and in fact the experience of the	 working  of
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_223">Article	 356(1)</a>	 since the inception  of  the  Constitution,
shows  that the State Governments have been sacked  and	 the
Legislative    Assemblies    dissolved	  on	 irrelevant,
objectionable  and unsound grounds.  So far the power  under
the provision has been used on more than 90 occasions and in
almost	all  cases  against  Governments  run  by  political
parties	 in  opposition.   If the fabric  of  pluralism	 and
pluralist  democracy  and  the unity and  integrity  of	 the
country are to be preserved, judiciary in the  circumstances
is the only institution which can act as the saviour of	 the
system and of the nation.
</p><p id="p_162">105. It	 is  for these reasons that we are unable  to  agree
with the view that if the ruling party in the States suffers
an  overwhelming  defeat in the elections to the  Lok  Sabha
however	 complete the defeat may be it will be a ground	 for
the  issue of the Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_224">Article 356(1).</a>  We  do
not  read the decision in State of Rajasthan case3  to	have
taken such a view.
</p><p id="p_163">3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">118</span>
This is particularly so since it is observed in the judgment
that: (SCR pp. 84-85:	 SCC pp. 664-65, para 153)
	      "Now,  we	 have no doubt at  all	that  merely
	      because  the ruling party in a  State  suffers
	      defeat  in the elections to the Lok  Sabha  or
	      for  the	matter	of that,  in  the  panchayat
	      elections, that by itself can be no ground for
	      saying that the Government of the State cannot
	      be   carried   on	 in  accordance	  with	 the
	      provisions  of the Constitution.	The  Federal
	      structure	  under	 our  Constitution   clearly
	      postulates  that	there may be  one  party  in
	      power in the State and another at the  Centre.
	      It is also not an unusual phenomenon that	 the
	      same  electorate	may  elect  a  majority	  of
	      members  of  one	party  to  the	 Legislative
	      Assembly,	 while at the same time	 electing  a
	      majority	of members of another party  to	 the
	      Lok   Sabha.    Moreover,	  the	 Legislative
	      Assembly,	 once elected, is to continue for  a
	      specific term and mere defeat at the elections
	      to  the Lok Sabha prior to the  expiration  of
	      the  term	 without anything more would  be  no
	      ground for its dissolution.  The defeat  would
	      not necessarily in all cases indicate that the
	      electorate is no longer supporting the  ruling
	      party  because  the issues may  be  different.
	      But  even if it were indicative of a  definite
	      shift  in the opinion of the electorate,	that
	      by itself would be no ground for	dissolution,
	      because  the  Constitution  contemplates	that
	      ordinarily the will of the electorate shall be
	      expressed	 at  the  end of  the  term  of	 the
	      Legislative  Assembly  and  a  change  in	 the
	      electorate's  will  in between  would  not  be
	      relevant ... the defeat of the ruling party in
	      a	 State at the Lok Sabha elections cannot  by
	      itself,  without	anything more,	support	 the
	      inference	 that  the Government of  the  State
	      cannot  be carried on in accordance  with	 the
	      provisions  of the Constitution.	To  dissolve
	      the Legislative Assembly solely on such ground
	      would be an indirect exercise of the right  of
	      recall  of  all the members by  the  President
	      without  there  being  any  provision  in	 the
	      Constitution   for   recall   even   by	 the
	      electorate."
</p><p id="p_164">There  is  no doubt that certain observations  in  the	said
decision  create  an impression to the	contrary.   We	have
already endorsed earlier the recommendation in the Report of
the Sarkaria Commission that the concerned ground cannot  be
available  for invoking power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_225">Article 356(1).</a>  It	 has
no  relevance to the conditions precedent for  invoking	 the
said  power,  viz.,  the  breakdown  of	 the  constitutional
machinery in the State.
</p><p id="p_165">106. Thus  the	federal	 principle,  social  pluralism	 and
pluralist  democracy which form the basic structure  of	 our
Constitution   demand  that  the  judicial  review  of	 the
Proclamation  issued  under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_226">Article 356(1)</a> is  not  only  an
imperative  necessity  but  is	a  stringent  duty  and	 the
exercise  of  power  under the said  provision	is  confined
strictly for the purpose and to the circumstances  mentioned
therein	 and  for  none else.  It  also	 requires  that	 the
material  on  the basis of which the power is  exercised  is
scrutinised circumspectly.  In this connection, we may refer
to what Dr Ambedkar had to say in reply to the apprehensions
expressed  by the other Hon'ble Members of  the	 Constituent
Assembly, in this context which also bring out the  concerns
weighing on the mind of the Hon'ble Members:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">119</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">	      "In  regard  to the general debate  which	 has
	      taken  place  in which it has  been  suggested
	      that these articles are liable to be abused, I
	      may  say	that I do not altogether  deny	that
	      there is a possibility of these articles being
	      abused  or  employed for	political  purposes.</blockquote>
<p id="p_166">	      But  that objection applies to every  part  of
	      the  Constitution	 which gives  power  to	 the
	      Centre  to override the Provinces.  In fact  I
	      share   the   sentiments	 expressed   by	  my
	      honorable	 Friend Mr Gupte yesterday that	 the
	      proper  thing we ought to expect is that	such
	      articles	will never be called into  operation
	      and that they would remain a dead letter.	  If
	      at all they are brought into operation, I hope
			    the	 President,  who  is  endowed  with   thes
e
	      powers,  will take proper	 precautions  before
	      actually suspending the administration of	 the
	      provinces.  I hope the first thing he will  do
	      would be to issue a mere warning to a province
	      that has erred, that things were not happening
	      in  the  way in which they  were	intended  to
	      happen  in the Constitution.  If that  warning
	      fails, the second thing for him to do will  be
	      to  order an election allowing the  people  of
	      the province to settle matters by	 themselves.
	      It  is only when these two remedies fail	that
	      he would resort to this article: It is only in
	      those  circumstances he would resort  to	this
	      article.	 I  do not think we could  then	 say
	      that  these articles were imported in vain  or
	      that   the  President  had  acted	  wantonly."
</p><p id="p_167">	      (Constituent  Assembly Debates, Vol.   IX,  p.
</p><p id="p_168">	      177)
</p><p id="p_169">107. The extract from the Report of the Sarkaria  Commission
which  has been reproduced in paragraph 82 above  will	show
that these hopes of Dr Ambedkar and other Hon'ble Members of
the Constituent Assembly have not come true.
</p><p id="p_170">108. The  further equally important question that arises  in
this  context  is  whether  the	 President  when  he  issues
Proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_227">Article 356(1</a>), would be  justified  in
removing   the	Government  in	power  or   dissolving	 the
Legislative  Assembly and thus in exercising all the  powers
mentioned  in sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) of clause (1)  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_228">Article	 356</a>  whatever the nature of the  situation  or	 the
degree	of the failure of the constitutional  machinery.   A
strong contention was raised that situations of the  failure
of the constitutional machinery may be varied in nature	 and
extent,	 and  hence  measures to remedy	 the  situation	 may
differ	 both	in  kind  and  degree.	 It   would   be   a
disproportionate  and unreasonable exercise of power if	 the
removal	 of  Government or dissolution of  the	Assembly  is
ordered	 when what the situation required, was for  example,
only   assumption  of  some  functions	or  powers  of	 the
Government  of the State or of anybody or authority  in	 the
State  under <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_229">Article 356(1)(a).</a>	 The excessive use of  power
also  amounts to illegal, irrational and mala fide  exercise
of  power.   Hence,  it	 is  urged  that  the  doctrine	  of
proportionality	 is relevant in this context and has  to  be
applied in such circumstances.	To appreciate the discussion
on the point, it is necessary to realise that the removal of
Government  and the dissolution of Assembly are effected  by
the President, if he exercises powers of the Governor  under
Articles 164(1) and 174(2)(b) respectively under  sub-clause
</p><p id="p_171">(a) of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_230">Article 356(1</a>), though that is neither necessary	 nor
obligatory while issuing the Proclamation.  In other  words,
the removal of the Ministry or the dissolution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">120</span>
of the Legislative Assembly is not an automatic	 consequence
of  the issuance of the Proclamation.  The exercise  of	 the
powers under sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_231">Article  356(1)</a>
may  also co-exist with a mere suspension of  the  political
executive and the Legislature of the State.  Sub-clause	 (c)
of  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_232">Article 356(1)</a> makes it clear.  It speaks of  incidental
and  consequential provisions to give effect to the  objects
of the Proclamation including suspension in whole or part of
the operation of any provision of the Constitution  relating
to  anybody or authority in the State.	It has to  be  noted
that  unlike  sub-clause  (a),	it  does  not  exclude	 the
Legislature  of	 the State.  Sub-clause (b) only  speaks  of
exercise of the powers of the Legislature of the State by or
under  the  authority of Parliament.  What is  further,	 the
assumption  of only some of the functions of the  Government
and the powers of the Governor or of anybody or authority in
the State other than the Legislature of the State under sub-
clause	(a), is also conceivable with the retention  of	 the
other functions and powers with the Government of the  State
and the Governor or anybody or authority in the State.	 The
language of sub-clause (a) is very clear on the subject.  It
must be remembered in this connection that where there is  a
bicameral   legislature,   the	upper	house,	 i.e.,	 the
Legislative  Council  cannot be dissolved.  Yet	 under	sub-
clause	(b) of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_233">Article 356(1)</a> its powers are exercisable  by
or  under the authority of Parliament.	The word used  there
is    "Legislature"   and   not	  "Legislative	  Assembly".
Legislature  includes  both the lower house  and  the  upper
house,	i.e., the Legislative Assembly and  the	 Legislative
Council.   It has also to be noted that when the  powers  of
the Legislature of the State are declared to be	 exercisable
by  or	under  the authority  of  Parliament  under  <a href="/doc/526520/" id="a_234">Article
356(1)(b</a>), it is competent for Parliament under <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_235">Article 357</a>,
to confer on the President the power of such legislature  to
make  laws  and to authorise the President to  delegate	 the
powers so conferred, to any other authority to be  specified
by  him.   The	authority  so chosen may  be  the  Union  or
officers and authorities thereof.  Legally, therefore, it is
permissible  under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_236">Article 356(1</a>), firstly, only to  suspend
the political executive or anybody or authority in the State
and  also the Legislature of the State and not to remove  or
dissolve  them.	  Secondly, it is also permissible  for	 the
President  to  assume  only some of  the  functions  of	 the
political executive or of anybody or authority of the  State
other  than  the Legislature while  neither  suspending	 nor
removing  them.	 The fact that some of these exercises	have
not  been resorted to in practice so far, does not  militate
against	 the  legal position which emerges  from  the  clear
language  of  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_237">Article 356(1).</a>  In this	connection,  we	 may
refer  to what Dr Ambedkar had to say on the subject in	 the
Constituent Assembly.  The relevant extract from his  speech
is reproduced in paragraph 106 above.  Hence it is  possible
for  the President to use only some of the requisite  powers
vested in him under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_238">Article 356(1)</a> to meet the situation  in
question.   He does not have to use all the powers  to	meet
all  the  situations  whatever the kind and  degree  of	 the
failure	 of the constitutional machinery in the	 State.	  To
that  extent,  the  contention is  indeed  valid.   However,
whether in a particular situation the extent of powers	used
is  proper and justifiable is a question which would  remain
debatable and beyond judicially discoverable and manageable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">121</span>
standards  unless the exercise of the excessive power is  so
palpably  irrational  or  mala fide as	to  invite  judicial
intervention.	 In   fact,  once  the	 issuance   of	 the
Proclamation  is  held valid, the scrutiny of the  kind	 and
degree	of  power used under the Proclamation,	falls  in  a
narrower compass.  There is every risk and fear of the court
undertaking  upon  itself the task of evaluating  with	fine
scales and through its own lenses the comparative merits  of
one  rather  than the other measure.  The  court  will	thus
travel	unwittingly  into the political	 arena	and  subject
itself	more  readily  to the charges  of  encroaching	upon
policy-making.	 The  "political thicket"  objection  sticks
more easily in such circumstances.  Although, therefore,  on
the language of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_239">Article 356(1</a>), it is legal to hold that the
President may exercise only some of the powers given to him,
in  practice  it may not always be easy to  demonstrate	 the
excessive use of the power.
</p><p id="p_172">109. An	 allied question which arises in this connection  is
whether,  notwithstanding  the	fact that  a  situation	 has
arisen	where  there is a breakdown  of	 the  constitutional
machinery in the State, it is always necessary to resort  to
the power of issuing Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_240">Article 356(1).</a>	 The
contention  is that since under <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_241">Article 355</a>, it is the	duty
of the Union to ensure that the Government of every State is
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution   and  since  further  the	 issuance   of	 the
Proclamation  under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_242">Article 356(1)</a> is admittedly  a  drastic
step,  there is a corresponding obligation on the  President
to  resort to other measures before the step is taken  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_243">Article 356(1).</a>	 This is all the more necessary	 considering
the principles of federal and democratic polity embedded  in
our Constitution.  In this connection, we may refer again to
what Dr Ambedkar himself had to say on the subject.  We have
quoted the relevant extract from his speech in paragraph  77
above.	 He  has  expressed the hope there  that  resort  to
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_244">Article	 356(1)</a> would be only as a last measure	 and  before
the  article is brought into operation, the President  would
take  proper precaution.  He hoped that the first thing	 the
President would do would be to issue a mere warning.  If the
warning	 failed, he would order an election and it  is	only
when the said two remedies fail that he would resort to	 the
article.  We must admit that we are unable to appreciate the
second	 measure  to  which  Dr	 Ambedkar  referred   as   a
preliminary to the resort to <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_245">Article 356(1).</a>  We should have
thought that the elections to the Legislative Assembly are a
last  resort and if they are held, there is nothing  further
to  be	done by exercising power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_246">Article	356(1).</a>	  We
may, therefore, ignore the said suggestion made by him.	 But
we respectively endorse the first measure viz. of warning to
which the President should resort before rushing to exercise
the power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_247">Article 356(1).</a>	 In addition to warning, the
President will always have the power to issue the  necessary
directives.   We are of the view that except  in  situations
where  urgent  steps  are imperative  and  exercise  of	 the
drastic	 power	under the article cannot  brook	 delay,	 the
President  should  use	all other measures  to	restore	 the
constitutional	 machinery  in	the  State.   The   Sarkaria
Commission  has also made recommendations in that behalf  in
paragraphs  6.8.01  to	6.8.04 of its  Report.	 It  is	 not
necessary   to	quote  them  here.   We	 endorse  the	said
recommendations.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">122</span>
<p id="p_173">110. The next important question to be considered is of	 the
nature and effect of the action to be taken by the President
pursuant  to the Proclamation issued by him.   The  question
has  to	 be  considered with reference	to  three  different
situations.  Since clause (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_248">Article 356</a> requires  every
Proclamation  issued  under clause (1) thereof, to  be	laid
before	each  House of Parliament and also  states  that  it
shall  cease  to  operate at the expiration  of	 two  months
unless	before	the expiration of that period  it  has	been
approved  by resolutions of both Houses of  Parliament,	 the
question  which emerges is what is the legal consequence  of
the actions taken by the President, (a) if the	Proclamation
is valid, yet, it is approved by both Houses of	 Parliament;
</p><p id="p_174">(b)  if	 the  Proclamation is invalid and  not	approved  by
either	or  both  Houses  of  Parliament;  and	(c)  if	 the
Proclamation  is  valid but not approved by either  or	both
Houses	of  Parliament.	 The other question that  arises  in
this connection is, whether the legal consequences differ in
these  three classes of cases, depending upon the nature  of
the action taken by the President.
</p><p id="p_175">111.	  The Proclamation falling under classes (a) and (b)
will  not  make any difference to the legal  status  of	 the
actions taken by the President under them.  The actions will
undoubtedly  be	 illegal.  However, the	 court	by  suitably
moulding   the	 relief,  and  Parliament  and	 the   State
Legislature  by legislation, may validate those acts of	 the
President  which are capable of being validated.  As far  as
Parliament  is	concerned, such acts will  not	include	 the
removal	 of the Council of Ministers and the dissolution  of
the Legislative Assembly since there is no provision in	 the
Constitution  which  gives such power to  Parliament.	That
power  is given exclusively to the Governor  under  Articles
164(1) and 174(2)(b) respectively.  It is this power,  among
others,	 which	the President is entitled  to  assume  under
<a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_249">Article	  356(1)(a).</a>	Parliament  can	 only	approve	  or
disapprove  of the removal of the Council of  Ministers	 and
the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly under clause (3)
of  that article, if such action is taken by the  President.
The question then arises is whether the Council of Ministers
and  the Legislative Assembly can be restored by  the  Court
when  it  declares the Proclamation invalid.   There  is  no
reason	why  the Council of Ministers  and  the	 Legislative
Assembly  should not stand restored as a consequence of	 the
invalidation of the Proclamation, the same being the  normal
legal  effect of the invalid action.  In the context of	 the
constitutional	provisions  which we have discussed  and  in
view  of  the  power of the judicial review  vested  in	 the
court, such a consequence is also a necessary constitutional
fall out.  Unless such result is read, the power of judicial
review	vested	in the judiciary is  rendered  nugatory	 and
meaningless.   To  hold	 otherwise  is	also  tantamount  to
holding that the Proclamation issued under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_250">Article 356(1)</a> is
beyond the scope of judicial review.  For when the  validity
of  the	 Proclamation  is  challenged,	the  court  will  be
powerless  to give relief and would always be met  with	 the
fait accompli.	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_251">Article 356</a> would then have to be read as an
exception  to  judicial review.	 Such an  interpretation  is
neither	 possible  nor	permissible.   Hence  the  necessary
consequence of the invalidation of the Proclamation would be
the  restoration of the Ministry as well as the	 Legislative
Assembly in the State.	In this connection, we may refer  to
the decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">123</span>
Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of Pakistan29.	 The
Court  there held that the impugned order of dissolution  of
National  Assembly and the dismissal of the Federal  Cabinet
were  without lawful authority and, therefore, of  no  legal
effect.	 As a consequence of the said declaration, the Court
declared that the National Assembly, Prime Minister and	 the
Cabinet	  stood	 restored  and	entitled  to   function	  as
immediately before the impugned order was passed.  The Court
further	 declared  that	 all steps  taken  pursuant  to	 the
impugned  order	 including  the	 appointment  of   caretaker
Cabinet	 and caretaker Prime Minister were also of no  legal
effect.	  The Court, however, added that all orders  passed,
acts  done  and	 measures taken in  the	 meanwhile,  by	 the
caretaker  Government which had been done, taken  and  given
effect	to in accordance with the terms of the	Constitution
and  were required to be done or taken for the ordinary	 and
orderly	 running of the State, shall be deemed to have	been
validly and legally done.
</p><p id="p_176">112.  As  regards  the	third  class  of  cases	 where	 the
Proclamation is held valid but is not approved by either  or
both Houses of Parliament, the consequence of the same would
be   the   same	 as  where  the	 Proclamation	is   revoked
subsequently or is not laid before each House of  Parliament
before	the expiration of two months or where it is  revoked
after its approval by Parliament or ceases to operate on the
expiration  of a period of six months from the date  of	 its
issue, or of the further permissible period under clause (4)
of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_252">Article  356.</a>   It does not, however,  appear  from	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_253">Article 356</a> or any other  provision  of	 the
Constitution, that mere nonapproval of a valid	Proclamation
by Parliament or its revocation or cessation, will have	 the
effect	either of restoring the Council of Ministers or	 the
Legislative Assembly.  The inevitable consequence in such  a
situation is fresh elections and the constitution of the new
Legislative Assembly and the Ministry in the State.  The law
made  in  exercise of the power of the	Legislature  of	 the
State by Parliament or the President or any other  authority
during the period the valid Proclamation subsists before  it
is  revoked  or	 disapproved,  or  before  it  expires,	  is
protected by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_254">Article 357.</a>
</p><p id="p_177">113. It is therefore, necessary to interpret clauses (1) and
(3)  of	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_255">Article 356</a> harmoniously since	 the  provisions  of
clause	(3) are obviously meant to be a check by  Parliament
(which also consist of members from the States concerned) on
the  powers  of the President under clause (1).	  The  check
would  become  meaningless and rendered ineffective  if	 the
President  takes irreversible actions while  exercising	 his
powers	under sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) of clause (1)  of
the  said  article.   The dissolution  of  the	Assembly  by
exercising   the  powers  of  the  Governor  under   <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_256">Article
174(2)(b)</a>  will be one such irreversible action.  Hence,  it
will  have to be held that in no case, the  President  shall
exercise  the Govern's power of dissolving  the	 Legislative
Assembly  till at least both the Houses of  Parliament	have
approved of the Proclamation issued by him under clause	 (1)
of the said article.  The dissolution of the assembly  prior
to  the	 approval of the Proclamation  by  Parliament  under
clause (3) of the said article will be per se invalid.	The
29 PLD (1993)SC473
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">124</span>
President  may,	 however, have the power of  suspending	 the
Legislature  under sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of the	said
article.
</p><p id="p_178">114. Our conclusion therefore firstly is that the  President
has  no	 power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly  of	 the
State by using his power under sub-clause (a) of clause	 (1)
of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_257">Article 356</a> till the Proclamation is approved by both the
Houses	of Parliament under clause (3) of the said  article.
He  may have power only to suspend the Legislative  Assembly
under  sub-clause  (c) of clause (1) of	 the  said  article.
Secondly, the court may invalidate the Proclamation  whether
it  is	approved  by  Parliament  or  not.   The   necessary
consequence of the invalidation of the Proclamation could be
to  restore the status quo ante and, therefore,	 to  restore
the  Council  of Ministers and the Legislative	Assembly  as
they stood on the date of the issuance of the  Proclamation.
The  actions  taken  including	the  laws  made	 during	 the
interregnum may or may not be validated either by the  court
or  by	Parliament  or by the State  Legislature.   It	may,
however, be made clear that it is for the court to mould the
relief to meet the requirements of the situation.  It is not
bound in all cases to grant the relief of restoration of the
Legislative  Assembly  and the Ministry.   The	question  of
relief	to be granted in a particular case pertains  to	 the
discretionary jurisdiction of the court.
</p><p id="p_179">115. The  further important question that arises is  whether
the  court will be justified in granting interim relief	 and
what would be the nature of such relief and at what stage it
may  be granted.  The grant of interim relief  would  depend
upon  various  circumstances including	the  expeditiousness
with  which  the court is moved, the prima facie  case	with
regard	to the invalidity of the Proclamation made out,	 the
steps  which  are contemplated to be taken pursuant  to	 the
Proclamation,	etc.   However,	 if  other  conditions	 are
satisfied,  it will defeat the very purpose of the  judicial
review if the requisite interim relief is denied.  The least
relief	that  can  be granted in such  circumstances  is  an
injunction  restraining the holding of fresh  elections	 for
constituting  the  new Legislative Assembly.   There  is  no
reason why such a relief should be denied if a precaution is
taken  to  hear the challenge as expeditiously	as  possible
taking	into  consideration the public	interests  involved.
The possibility of a delay in the disposal of the  challenge
cannot be a ground for frustrating the constitutional  right
and  defeating	the  constitutional  provisions.   It	has,
however, to be made clear that the interlocutory relief that
may  be	 granted  on  such  challenge  is  to  prevent	 the
frustration  of	 the constitutional remedy.  It	 is  not  to
prevent	 the  constitutional authority from  exercising	 its
powers	and  discharging its functions.	 Hence it  would  be
wholly impermissible either to interdict the issuance of the
Proclamation  or its operation till a final verdict  on	 its
validity  is  pronounced.  Hence the normal  rules  of	quia
timet action have no relevance in matters pertaining to	 the
challenge  to the Proclamation.	 To conclude, the  court  in
appropriate  cases will not only be justified in  preventing
holding of fresh elections but would be duty-bound to do  so
by  granting suitable interim relief to make  effective	 the
constitutional remedy of judicial review and to prevent	 the
emasculation of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">125</span>
<p id="p_180">116.  In  the light of our conclusions with  regard  to	 the
scope  of the power of the President to	 issue	Proclamation
under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_258">Article 356(1</a>), of the parameters of judicial  review
and  of the quia timet action, we may now examine the  facts
in  the individual cases before us.  It has, however, to  be
made  clear  at	 the outset that the  facts  are  not  being
discussed  with a view to give relief prayed for,  since  in
all  cases fresh elections have been held,  new	 Legislative
Assemblies  have been elected and new Ministries  have	been
installed.  Nor do the petitioners/appellants seek any	such
relief.	  The facts are being discussed to find out  whether
the  action of the President was justified in the  light  of
our conclusions above.	The finding may serve as a  guidance
for future.  For the sake of convenience, we propose to deal
with  the  cases of the States of Karnataka,  Meghalaya	 and
Nagaland  separately  from those of the States	of  Himachal
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
</p><p id="p_181">KARNATAKA
C.A. No. 3645 of 1989
</p><p id="p_182">117.  Taking first the challange to the Proclamation  issued
by the President on April 21, 1989 dismissing the Government
of   Karnataka	and  dissolving	 the  State  Assembly,	 the
Proclamation does not contain any reasons and merely recites
that  the President is satisfied on a consideration  of	 the
report	of  the Governor and other information	received  by
him,  that the Government of the State cannot be carried  on
in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.	 The
facts were that the Janata Party being the majority party in
the  State  Legislature	 had  formed  Government  under	 the
leadership of Shri S.R. Bommai on August 30, 1988  following
the  resignation  on  August 1, 1988 of	 the  earlier  Chief
Minister, Shri Hegde who headed the Ministry from March 1985
till  his resignation.	In September 1988, the Janata  Party
and  Lok Dal (B) merged into a new party called Janata	Dal.
The Ministry was expanded on April 15, 1989 with addition of
13 members.  Within two days thereafter, i.e., on April	 17,
1989,  one  Shri K.R. Molakery, a legislator of	 Janata	 Dal
defected  from	the  party and presented  a  letter  to	 the
Governor  withdrawing his support to the Ministry.   On	 the
next day, he presented to the Governor 19 letters  allegedly
signed	by  17 Janata Dal legislators, one  independent	 but
associate  legislator  and one legislator belonging  to	 the
Bhartiya  Janata  Party which was supporting  the  Ministry,
withdrawing  their support to the Ministry.  On	 receipt  of
these  letters,	 the  Governor is said to  have	 called	 the
Secretary   of	the  Legislature  Department  and  got	 the
authenticity of the signatures on the said letters verified.
On  April  19,	1989,  the Governor sent  a  report  to	 the
President stating therein that there were dissensions in the
Janata Party which had led to the resignation of Shri  Hegde
and even after the formation of the new party, viz.,  Janata
Dal,  there were dissensions and defections.  In support  of
his case, he referred to the 19 letters received by him.  He
further stated that in view of the withdrawal of the support
by the said legislators, the Chief Minister, Shri Bommai did
not  command a majority in the Assembly and, hence,  it	 was
inappropriate  under  the Constitution, to  have  the  State
administered  by  an  Executive	 consisting  of	 Council  of
Ministers which did
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">126</span>
not  command the majority in the House.	 He also added	that
no  other  political  party was in a position  to  form	 the
Government.   He,  therefore, recommended to  the  President
that  he should exercise power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_259">Article 356(1).</a>  It  is
not disputed that the Governor did not ascertain the view of
Shri  Bommai either after the receipt of the 19	 letters  or
before making his report to the President.  On the next day,
i.e.,  April 20, 1989, 7 out of the 19 legislators  who	 had
allegedly  written  the said letters to	 the  Governor	sent
letters	 to  him  complaining  that  their  signatures	were
obtained  on  the earlier letters by  misrepresentation	 and
affirmed  their support to the Ministry.  The State  Cabinet
met  on the same day and decided to convene the	 Session  of
the  Assembly within a week, i.e., on April 27,	 1989.	 The
Chief  Minister	 and his Law Minister met the  Governor	 the
same  day and informed him about the decision to summon	 the
Assembly  Session.  It is also averred in the petition	that
they  had pointed out to the Governor the recommendation  of
the  Sarkaria Commission that the strength of  the  Ministry
should	be  tested  on the floor of the	 House.	  The  Chief
Minister also offered to prove his majority on the floor  of
the House even by preponing the Assembly Session, if needed.
To  the	 same  effect,	he  sent  a  telex  message  to	 the
President.   The Governor, however, sent yet another  report
to  the President on the same day, i. e. April 20, 1989,  in
particular,  referring to the letters of 7 members  pledging
their support to the Ministry and withdrawing their  earlier
letters.  He, however, opined in the report that the letters
from  the 7 legislators were obtained by the Chief  Minister
by  pressurising them and added that horsetrading was  going
on  and	 atmosphere was getting vitiated.  In  the  end,  he
reiterated his opinion that the Chief Minister had lost	 the
confidence  of	the majority in the House and  repeated	 his
earlier	 request for action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_260">Article 356(1).</a>   On	that
very day, the President issued the Proclamation in  question
with   the   recitals  already	referred  to   above.	 The
Proclamation  was,  thereafter	approved  by  Parliament  as
required  by  <a href="/doc/1133729/" id="a_261">Article 356(3).</a>  Shri Bommai  and	 some  other
members of the Council of Ministers challenged the  validity
of  the	 Proclamation before the Karnataka High Court  by  a
writ petition on various grounds.  The petition was resisted
by the Union of India, among others.  A three-Judge Bench of
the  High Court dismissed the petition holding, among  other
things, that the facts stated in the Governor's report could
not  be	 held  to  be irrelevant  and  that  the  Governor's
satisfaction  that no other party was in a position to	form
the  Government had to be accepted since his  personal	bona
fides  were  not questioned and his satisfaction  was  based
upon  reasonable assessment of all the relevant facts.	 The
court  also  held that recourse to  floor-test	was  neither
compulsory  nor	 obligatory and was not	 a  prerequisite  to
sending the report to the President.  It was also held	that
the Govern's report could not be challenged on the ground of
legal mala fides since the Proclamation had to be issued  on
the  satisfaction  of the Union Council of  Ministers.	 The
Court further relied upon the test laid down in the State of
Rajasthan  case3 and held that on the basis of the  material
disclosed,  the	 satisfaction arrived at  by  the  President
could not be faulted.
</p><p id="p_183">3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">127</span>
</p><p id="p_184">118. In	 view of the conclusions that we have  reached	with
regard to the parameters of the judicial review, it is clear
that  the High Court had committed an error in ignoring	 the
most  relevant fact that in view of the conflicting  letters
of  the	 7 legislators, it was improper on the part  of	 the
Governor  to have arrogated to himself the task of  holding,
firstly,  that the earlier 19 letters were genuine and	were
written	 by  the  said legislators of their  free  will	 and
volition.   He	had  not even cared to	interview  the	said
legislators,  but  had merely got the  authenticity  of	 the
signatures  verified through the  Legislatures	Secretariat.
Secondly,  he  also took upon himself the task	of  deciding
that  the  7  out  of the 19  legislators  had	written	 the
subsequent letters on account of the pressure from the Chief
Minister  and not out of their free will.  Again he had	 not
cared  even to interview the said legislators.	Thirdly,  it
is  not	 known from where the Governor got  the	 information
that   there   was  horse-trading  going  on   between	 the
legislators.  Even assuming that it was so, the correct	 and
the proper course for him to adopt was to await the test  on
the  floor  of the House which test the Chief  Minister	 had
willingly  undertaken  to  go through on any  day  that	 the
Governor chose.	 In fact, the State Cabinet had itself taken
an  initiative	to convene the meeting of  the	Assembly  on
April 27, 1989, i.e., only a week ahead of the date on which
the  Governor  chose to send his report	 to  the  President.
Lastly,	 what is important to note in connection  with	this
episode	 is  that the Governor at no time  asked  the  Chief
Minister even to produce the legislators before him who were
supporting the Chief Minister, if the Governor thought	that
the  situation posed such grave threat to the governance  of
the  State that he could not await the result of the  floor-
test  in the House.  We are of the view that this is a	case
where  all cannons of propriety were thrown to the wind	 and
the  undue  haste  made	 by the	 Governor  in  inviting	 the
President  to  issue the Proclamation under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_262">Article  356(1)</a>
clearly	 smacked of mala fides.	 The Proclamation issued  by
the  President	on  the	 basis of the  said  report  of	 the
Governor  and in the circumstances so obtaining,  therefore,
equally	 suffered  from	 mala  fides.	A  duly	 constituted
Ministry  was dismissed on the basis of material  which	 was
neither tested nor allowed to be tested and was no more than
the ipse dixit of the Governor.	 The action of the  Governor
was  more  objectionable  since	 as  a	high  constitutional
functionary, he was expected to conduct himself more firmly,
cautiously and circumspectly.  Instead, it appears that	 the
Governor was in a hurry to dismiss the Ministry and dissolve
the  Assembly.	 The Proclamation having been based  on	 the
said  report  and so-called other information which  is	 not
disclosed, was therefore liable to be struck down.
</p><p id="p_185">119. In	 this connection, it is necessary to stress that  in
all  cases where the support to the Ministry is	 claimed  to
have  been withdrawn by some legislators, the proper  course
for testing the strength of the Ministry is holding the test
on   the   floor   of  the  House.   That   alone   is	 the
constitutionally  ordained  forum  for	seeking	 openly	 and
objectively  the  claims and counterclaims in  that  behalf.
The  assessment	 of the strength of the Ministry  is  not  a
matter	of  private  opinion of any individual,	 be  he	 the
Governor   or  the  President.	 It  is	 capable  of   being
demonstrated and ascertained publicly in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">128</span>
House.	Hence when such demonstration is possible, it is not
open  to  bypass it and instead depend upon  the  subjective
satisfaction of the Governor or the President.	Such private
assessment is an anathema to the democratic principle, apart
from  being  open  to serious objections  of  personal	mala
fides.	 It  is possible that on some  rare  occasions,	 the
floor-test  may be impossible, although it is  difficult  to
envisage  such situation.  Even assuming that  there  arises
one,  it  should  be  obligatory on  the  Governor  in	such
circumstances,	to  state in writing, the  reasons  for	 not
holding	 the  floor-test.  The High  Court  was,  therefore,
wrong in holding that the floor-test was neither  compulsory
nor obligatory or that it was not a prerequisite to  sending
the  report  to	 the  President	 recommending  action  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_263">Article	 356(1).</a>   Since  we have already  referred  to	 the
recommendations	  of   the  Sarkaria  Commission   in	this
connection, it is not necessary to repeat them here.
</p><p id="p_186">120. The  High	Court was further wrong in taking  the	view
that  the  facts  stated in the	 Govern's  report  were	 not
irrelevant  when  the Governor without	ascertaining  either
from  the  Chief Minister or from the 7 MLAs  whether  their
retraction  was	 genuine  or  not,  proceeded  to  give	 his
unverified   opinion  in  the  matter.	 What  was   further
forgotten  by  the  High Court was that	 assuming  that	 the
support was withdrawn to the Ministry by the 19 MLAS, it was
incumbent  upon the Governor to ascertain whether any  other
Ministry  could	 be formed.  The question of  personal	bona
fides  of the Governor is irrelevant in such matters.	What
is  to be ascertained is whether the Governor had  proceeded
legally	 and  explored	all  possibilities  of	ensuring   a
constitutional Government in the State before reporting that
the constitutional machinery had broken down.  Even if	this
meant  installing  the Government belonging  to	 a  minority
party, the Governor was duty-bound to opt for it so long  as
the  Government	 could enjoy the confidence  of	 the  House.
That is also the recommendation of the five-member Committee
of the Governors appointed by the President pursuant to	 the
decision  taken at the Conference of Governors held  in	 New
Delhi  in  November  1970, and of  the	Sarkaria  Commission
quoted above.  It is also obvious that beyond the report  of
the  Governor,	there  was  no	other  material	 before	 the
President  before  he issued the  Proclamation.	  Since	 the
"facts" stated by the Governor in his report, as pointed out
above  contained  his  own opinion  based  on  unascertained
material, in the circumstances, they could hardly be said to
form an objective material on which the President could have
acted.	The Proclamation issued was, therefore, invalid.
</p><p id="p_187">121. We may on this subject refer to the unanimous Report of
the five member Committee of Governors which recommended  as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">	      "...  the test of confidence in  the  ministry
	      should  normally	be  left to a  vote  in	 the
	      Assembly	... where the Governor is  satisfied
	      by   whatever  process  or  means,  that	 the
	      ministry no longer enjoys majority support, he
	      should  ask  the Chief Minister  to  face	 the
	      Assembly	and  prove his majority	 within	 the
	      shortest possible time.  If the Chief Minister
	      shirks  this primary responsibility and  fails
	      to comply, the Governor would be in duty bound
	      to  initiate  steps  to  form  an	 alternative
	      ministry.	 A Chief
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">	      129</span>
	       Minister's  refusal to test his	strength  on
	      the   floor  of  the  Assembly  can  well	  be
	      interpreted  as  prima facie proof of  his  no
	      longer   enjoying	  the  confidence   of	 the
			    legislature.  If then, an alternative  ministr
y
	      can be formed, which, in the Governor's  view,
	      is able to command a majority in the Assembly,
	      he  must	dismiss the ministry  in  power	 and

October 11, 1991 issued under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_267">Article 356(1).</a>  The facts are
that  the  writ petitioner G.S. Massar belonged to  a  front
known  as Meghalaya United Parliamentary Party (MUPP)  which
had a majority in the Legislative Assembly and had formed in
March  1990, a Government under the leadership of Shri	B.B.
</blockquote><p id="p_188">Lyngdoh.   On July 25, 1991, one Kyndiah Arthree who was  at
the relevant time, the Speaker of the House, was elected  as
the leader of the opposition group known as United Meghalaya
Parliamentary  Forum  (UMPF).  The majority  in	 this  group
belonged  to  the  Congress Party.  On	his  election,	Shri
Arthree	 claimed support of majority of the members  in	 the
Assembly  and requested the Governor to invite him  to	form
the  Government.   Thereupon, the Governor  asked  the	then
Chief  Minister	 Shri Lyngdoh to prove his majority  on	 the
floor  of the House.  Accordingly, a special session of	 the
Assembly  was  convened on August 7, 1991 and  a  motion  of
confidence  in the Ministry was moved.	 Thirty	 legislators
supported  the	motion and 27 voted  against  it.   However,
instead	 of  announcing	 the result of	the  voting  on	 the
motion,	 the  Speaker  declared	 that  he  had	received   a
complaint against 5 independent MLAs of the ruling coalition
front  alleging that they were disqualified  as	 legislators
under  the  anti-defection  law and since  they	 had  become
disentitled to vote, he was suspending their right to  vote.
On this announcement, uproar ensued in the House and it	 had
to  be	adjourned.  On August 11, 1991, the  Speaker  issued
show-cause notices to the alleged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">130</span>
defectors,  the 5 independent MLAs on a complaint  filed  by
one  of the legislators Shri Shylla.  The 5 MLAs replied  to
the  notice denying that they had joined any of the  parties
and contended that they had continued to be independent.  On
receipt	 of  the  replies, the Speaker passed  an  order  on
August 17, 1991, disqualifying the 5 MLAs on the ground that
4  of  them were Ministers in the then Ministry and  one  of
them  was  the Deputy Government  Chief	 Whip.	 Thereafter,
again  on  the Governor's advice, the  Chief  Minister	Shri
Lyngdoh summoned the session of the Assembly on September 9,
1991 for passing a vote of confidence in the Ministry.	 The
Speaker however, refused to send the notices of the  session
to   the  5  independent  MLAs	disqualified  by   him	 and
simultaneously	made  arrangements to prohibit	their  entry
into  the  Assembly.   On September 6,	1991,  the  5  MLAS,
approached  this  Court.  This Court  issued  interim  order
staying	 the operation of the Speaker's orders dated  August
7, 1991 and August 17, 1991 in respect of four of them.	  It
appears	 that  one  of the members did not  apply  for	such
order.	The Speaker, thereafter, issued a Press statement in
which he declared that he did not accept any interference by
any court With his order of August 17, 1991.  The  Governor,
therefore, prorogued the Assembly indefinitely by his  order
dated September 8, 1991.  The Assembly was again convened at
the  instance  of the Governor on October 8, 1991.   In	 the
meanwhile,  the	 4  independent MLAs who  had  obtained	 the
interim	 orders	 moved	a contempt petition  in	 this  Court
against the Speaker who had not only made the declaration in
the Press statement defying the interim order of this  Court
but  also taken steps to prevent the independent  MLAs	from
entering  the House.  On October 8, 1991, this Court  passed
another	 order directing that all authorities of  the  State
should ensure the compliance of the Court's interim order of
September  6, 1991.  Pursuant to this direction, 4 of the  5
independent  MLAs received invitation to attend the  session
of  the	 Assembly convened on October 8, 1991.	In  all,  56
MLAs including the 4 independent MLAs attended the  session.
After  the motion of confidence in the Ministry was  put  to
vote, the Speaker declared that 26 voted for the motion	 and
26  against it and excluded the votes of the  4	 independent
MLAS.  Thereafter, declaring that there was a tie in voting,
he  cast his own vote against the motion and  declared	that
the  motion  had failed and adjourned the  House  sine	die.
However,  30 MLAs, viz., 26 plus 4 independent MLAs who	 had
voted  for  the motion, continued to stay in the  House	 and
elected	 the Speaker from amongst themselves to conduct	 the
business.   The	 new  Speaker declared that  the  motion  of
confidence  in the Ministry had been carried since  30	MLAs
had  voted  in	favour	of  the	 Government.   They  further
proceeded to pass a motion of no-confidence in the  Speaker.
The 30 MLAs thereafter sent a letter to the Governor stating
therein	 that they had voted in favour of the  Ministry	 and
had  also passed a motion of no-confidence in  the  Speaker.
However, on October 9, 1991, the Governor wrote a letter  to
the Chief Minister asking him to resign in view of what	 had
transpired   in	  the	Session	  on   October	 8,    1991.
Unfortunately,	 the  Governor	in  the	 said  letter	also
proceeded to observe that the non-cognisance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">131</span>
by the Speaker of the Supreme Court's orders relating to the
4 independent MLAs was a matter between the Speaker and	 the
Court.	 The  Chief Minister moved this	 Court,	 thereafter,
against	 the  letter  of the Governor,	and  this  Court  on
October	 9, 1991, among other things, asked the Governor  to
take  into consideration the orders of this Court and  votes
cast by the 4 independent MLAs before taking any decision on
the  question whether the Government had lost the motion  of
confidence.  In spite of this, the President on October	 11,
1991   issued  Proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_268">Article   356(1).</a>	 The
Proclamation stated that the President was satisfied on	 the
basis of the report from the Governor and other	 information
received  by him that the situation had arisen in which	 the
Government  of	the  State  could  not	be  carried  on	  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the	 Constitution.	 The
Government  was	 dismissed and the Assembly  was  dissolved.
This  Court by an order of October 12, 1991, set  aside	 the
order  dated August 17, 1991 of the then Speaker.   However,
thereafter,  both the Houses of Parliament met and  approved
the Proclamation issued by the President.
</p><p id="p_189">123.	  The  unflattering  episode shows  in	unmistakable
terms  the  Governor's unnecessary anxiety  to	dismiss	 the
Ministry and dissolve the Assembly and also his failure as a
constitutional	functionary  to realise	 the  binding  legal
consequences of and give effect to the orders of this Court.
What is worse, the Union Council of Ministers also chose  to
give  advice to the President to issue the  Proclamation  on
the  material in question.  It is not necessary	 to  comment
upon  the validity of the Proclamation any further save	 and
except	to observe that prima facie the material before	 the
President  was not only irrational but motivated by  factual
and  legal  mala fides.	 The  Proclamation  was,  therefore,
invalid.
</p><p id="p_190">			  NAGALAND
C.A. Nos. 193-94 of 1989
</p><p id="p_191">124. The Presidential Proclamation dated August 7, 1988	 was
issued under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_269">Article 356(1)</a> imposing President's rule in the
State  of Nagaland.  At the relevant time, in  the  Nagaland
Assembly  consisting of 60 members, 34 belonged to  Congress
1,  18	to Naga National Democratic Party, one	belonged  to
Naga  Peoples Party and 7 were independent.  Shri Sema,	 the
leader	of the ruling party was the Chief  Minister  heading
the  State Government.	On July 28, 1988, 13 out of  the  34
MLAs of the ruling Congress I Party informed the Speaker  of
the  Assembly  that they had formed a  party  separate	from
Congress  I ruling party and requested him for allotment  of
separate  seats for them in the House.	The session  was  to
commence  on August 28, 1988.  By his decision of  July	 30,
1988,  the Speaker held that there was a split in the  party
within	 the   meaning	of  the	 Tenth	 Schedule   of	 the
Constitution.  On July 31, 1988, Shri Vamuzo, one of the  13
defecting MLAs who had formed a separate party, informed the
Governor that he commanded the support of 35 out of the then
59 members in the Assembly and was in a position to form the
Government.   On  October 1988, the Chief Secretary  of	 the
State wrote to Shri Vamuzo that cording to his	information,
Shri Vamuzo had wrongfully confined the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">132</span>
MLAs  who had formed the new party.  Shri Vamuzo denied	 the
said allegation and asked the Chief Secretary to verify	 the
truth  from  the members themselves.  On  verification,	 the
members	 told  the  Chief Secretary that none  of  them	 was
confined, as alleged.  On August 6, 1988, the Governor	sent
a report to the President of India about the formation of  a
new party by the 13 MLAS.  He also stated that the said MLAs
were allured by money.	He further stated that the said MLAs
were  kept  in forcible confinement by Shri Vamuzo  and	 one
other  person,	and that the story of split  in	 the  ruling
party was not true.  He added that the Speaker was hasty  in
according recognition to the new group of the 13 members and
commented that horse-trading was going on in the State.	  He
made  a special reference to the insurgency in Nagaland	 and
also  stated that some of the members of the  Assembly	were
having	contacts  with	the insurgents.	  He  expressed	 the
apprehension that if the affairs were allowed to continue as
they  were, it would affect the stability of the State.	  In
the meanwhile, the Chief Minister submitted his	 resignation
to  the	 Governor  and recommended  the	 imposition  of	 the
President's  rule.   The President  thereafter,	 issued	 the
impugned  Proclamation	and  dismissed	the  Government	 and
dissolved the Assembly.	 Shri Vamuzo, the leader of the	 new
group  challenged  the validity of the Proclamation  in	 the
Gauhati	 High Court.  The petition was heard by	 a  Division
Bench  comprising  the Chief Justice and  Hansaria,  J.	 The
Bench differed on the effect and operation of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_270">Article  74(2)</a>
and  hence the matter was referred to the third Judge.	 But
before	the third learned Judge could hear the	matter,	 the
Union  of India moved this Court for grant of special  leave
which was granted and the proceedings in the High Court were
stayed.	  It may be stated here that the Division Bench	 was
agreed	that  the  validity of	the  Proclamation  could  be
examined  by the court and it was not immune  from  judicial
review.	  We  have  already discussed  the  implications  of
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_271">Article 74(2)</a> earlier and have pointed out that although the
advice	given by the Council of Ministers is free  from	 the
gaze  of the court, the material on the basis of  which	 the
advice	is given cannot be kept away from it and is open  to
judicial scrutiny.  On the facts of this case also we are of
the  view that the Governor should have allowed Shri  Vamuzo
to  test his strength on the floor of the House.   This	 was
particularly  so because the Chief Minister, Shri  Sema	 had
already submitted his resignation to the Governor.  This  is
notwithstanding the fact that the Governor in his report had
stated	that during the preceding 25 years, no less than  11
Governments   had   been  formed  and	according   to	 his
information,  the  Congress  I	MLAs  were  allured  by	 the
monetary  benefits and that amounted to incredible  lack  of
political  morality and complete disregard of the wishes  of
the electorate.	 It has to be emphasised here that  although
the Tenth Schedule was added to the Constitution to  prevent
political bargaining and defections, it did not prohibit the
formation of another political party if it was backed by  no
less  than 1/3rd members of the existing legislature  party.
Since  no opportunity was given to Shri Vamuzo to prove	 his
strength on the floor of the House as claimed by him and  to
form	the   Ministry,	  the	Proclamation   issued	 was
unconstitutional.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">133</span>
<p id="p_192">125. We may now deal with the cases of the States of  Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh.  The elections were
held  to  the Legislative Assemblies in these  States  along
with  the  elections to the Legislative	 Assembly  of  Uttar
Pradesh, in February 1990.  The Bhartiya Janata Party  (BJP)
secured	 majority in the Assemblies of all the	four  States
and formed Governments there.
</p><p id="p_193">126. Following	appeals of some organisations including	 the
BJP,  thousands of kar sevaks from Uttar Pradesh as well  as
from  other States including Madhya Pradesh,  Rajasthan	 and
Himachal  Pradesh  gathered near the Ram  Janam	 Bhumi-Babri
Masjid structure on December 6, 1992 and eventually some  of
them  demolished  the  disputed	 structure.   Following	 the
demolition,  on	 the same day the Uttar	 Pradesh  Government
resigned.  Thereafter, on the same day the President  issued
Proclamation   under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_272">Article  356(1)</a>  and   dissolved	 the
Legislative Assembly of the State.  The said Proclamation is
not  challenged.   Hence  we  are  not	concerned  in  these
proceedings with its validity.
</p><p id="p_194">127. As	 a result of the demolition of the  structure  which
was  admittedly a mosque standing at the site for about	 400
years, there were violent reactions in this country as	well
as  in	the neighbouring countries where some  temples	were
destroyed.   This in turn created further reactions in	this
country	 resulting  in	violence  and  destruction  of	 the
property.   The Union Government tried to cope up  with	 the
situation by taking several steps including a ban on several
organisations  including Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  (RSS),
Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal which had  along
with  BJP  given  a call for kar  sevaks  to  march  towards
Ayodhya	 on December 6, 1992.  The ban order was  issued  on
December 10, 1992 under the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_273">Unlawful Activities (Prevention)
Act</a>,  1967.  The dismissal of the State Governments and	 the
State  Legislative Assemblies in Madhya	 Pradesh,  Rajasthan
and Himachal Pradesh were admittedly a consequence of  these
developments   and   were  effected  by	 the   issuance	  of
Proclamations  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_274">Article 356(1</a>), all  on  December	 15,
1992.
</p><p id="p_195">		       MADHYA PRADESH
CA.  Nos. 1692, 1692-A to 1692-C of 1993 and CA.  Nos. 4627-
30 of 1993
</p><p id="p_196">128. The  Proclamation	was a consequence of  three  reports
sent by the Governor	 to the President.  The first was of
December 8, 1992.  It referred to the fast   deteriorating
law  and order situation in the wake of widespread  acts  of
the  State Government to stem the tide primarily because  of
the political leadership's "overt and covert support to	 the
associate communal organisations" which seemed to point	 out
that  there was a breakdown of the administrative  machinery
of the State.  This report was followed by second report  on
December  10, 1992 which referred to the spread of  violence
to  the other till then peaceful areas.	 Yet another  report
was sent by him on December 13, 1992 along with a copy of  a
letter	dated  December 11, 1992 received by  him  from	 the
Executive Director, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd.,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">134</span>
Bhopal	(BHEL).	  This	letter had  referred  to  the  total
failure of the law and order machinery to provide safety and
security of life and property in the areas in and around the
BHEL factory and the pressure brought on the  administration
of  the	 factory to accommodate the kar sevaks in  the	BHEL
area.	The Governor also referred to the statement  of	 the
Chief  Minister	 of Madhya Pradesh, Shri  Sunder  Lal  Patwa
describing  the ban of RSS and VHP as unfortunate.  In	view
of  the	 statement  of	the  Chief  Minister,  the  Governor
expressed  his	doubt  about the credibility  of  the  State
Government to implement sincerely the Centre's direction  to
ban  the  said organisations, particularly because  the	 BJP
leaders including the Chief Minister, Shri Patwa had  always
sworn  by  the values and traditions of the  RSS.   In	this
context,  he  also referred to the decision of	the  VHP  to
observe 13th December as blackday to protest against the ban
and  to observe protest week against the "heinous law"	from
December 14 to 20, 1992.  He expressed his anxiety that	 all
these  moves were fraught with danger in the context of	 the
situation   obtaining	then.	The   Governor,	  therefore,
recommended  that  considering the said facts and  the	fact
that the RSS was contemplating a fresh strategy to chalk out
its future plan, and also the possibility of the leaders  of
the  banned  organisations going  underground,	particularly
with  the  connivance  of  the	State  Administration,	 the
situation  demanded immediate issuance of the  Proclamation.
Hence the Proclamation.
</p><p id="p_197">HIMACHAL PRADESH
T.   C. No. 8 of 1993
</p><p id="p_198">129. The Proclamation issued by the President succeeded	 the
report of the Governor of Himachal Pradesh which was sent to
him  on December 15, 1992.  In his report the  Governor	 had
stated, among other things, that the Chief Minister and	 his
Cabinet	 had instigated kar sevaks from Himachal Pradesh  to
participate in the kar seva on December 6, 1992 at  Ayodhya.
Not only that, but some of the Ministers had expressed their
desire	publicly  to participate in kar seva  if  the  party
high-command permitted them to do so.  As a result, a number
of  kar sevaks including some BJP MLAs participated  in	 the
kar  seva at Ayodhya.  A member of the Legislative  Assembly
belonging  to the ruling BJP had also openly stated that  he
had participated in the demolition of the Babri Masjid.	 The
Governor  then added that Chief Minister, Shri Shanta  Kumar
had  met him on December 13, 1992, i.e., two days before  he
sent the letter to the President, and had informed him "that
he  desired  to	 implement the ban  orders  imposed  by	 the
Government   of	  India	 on  RSS,  VHP	 and   three   other
organisations  and that he had already issued directions  in
that behalf'.  The Governor, however, opined that since	 the
Chief Minister himself was a member of RSS, he was not in  a
position   to	implement  the	 directions   honestly	 and
effectively  and that most of the people in the	 State	felt
the  same  way.	 He also stated that some of  the  Ministers
were publicly criticising the ban on the said three communal
organisations  and when the Chief Ministers and some of	 his
colleagues  in the Ministry were members of the RSS, it	 was
not possible for the administrative machinery to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">135</span>
implement  the ban honestly and effectively.  It is  on	 the
basis  of this report that the Proclamation in question	 was
issued.
</p><p id="p_199">RAJASTHAN
T.   C. No. 9 of 1993
</p><p id="p_200">130.  The President Proclamation was pursuant to the  report
of  the Governor sent to the Prime Minister that  Government
of Rajasthan had played "an obvious role" in the episode  at
Ayodhya; that the BJP had control over RSS, VHP and  Bajrang
Dal which were the banned organisations, and the ban was not
being implemented at all.  One of the Ministers had resigned
and  along  with  him, 22 MLAs and  15500  BJP	workers	 had
participated in the kar seva at Ayodhya.  They were given  a
royal send-off on their departure from the State and a royal
welcome	 on  their return by the influential people  in	 the
political party running the Government, i.e., BJP.  For more
than  a week, the law and order situation  had	deteriorated
and  the  dominant feature of the breakdown of the  law	 and
order situation was the anti-minority acts.  He opined	that
it  was	 not  possible for the	Administration	to  function
effectively, objectively and in accordance with the rule  of
law  in the then political set-up and hence a situation	 had
arisen	in  which the Government of the State could  not  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_201">131. The validity of the three Proclamations was  challenged
by writ petitions in the respective State High Courts.	 The
writ  petition challenging the Proclamations in	 respect  of
Madhya	Pradesh Government and the Legislative Assembly	 was
allowed	 by  the  High Court+ and  the	appeal	against	 the
decision of the High Court is preferred in this Court by the
Union of India.	 By its order dated April 16, 1993, the writ
petitions  challenging the Proclamations in respect  of	 the
Governments and the Legislative Assemblies of Rajasthan	 and
Himachal  Pradesh which were pending in the respective	High
Courts, stood transferred to this Court.
</p><p id="p_202">132. It is contended that the imposition of the	 President's
rule in the States of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal
Pradesh	 was  mala fide, based on no  satisfaction  and	 was
purely	 a   political	act.   Mere   fact   that   communal
disturbances  and/or  instances of arson  and  looting	took
place  is  no  ground for  imposing  the  President's  rule.
Indeed,	 such incidents took place in several Congress	(I)-
ruled  States  as well, as in particular, in  the  State  of
Maharashtra  on	 a much larger scale and yet no	 action	 was
taken to displace those Government whereas action was  taken
only against BJP Governments.  It is pointed out that so far
as  Himachal  Pradesh is concerned, here  were	no  communal
disturbances  at  all.	There was no law and  order  problem
worth the name.	 Even the Governor's report did not speak of
any  such  incidents.  The Governments	of  Madhya  Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, it is argued, cannot be held
responsible  for  what happened at Ayodhya  on	December  6,
1992.	For that incident, the Government of  Uttar  Pradesh
had  resigned  owning  responsibility  therefor.   It	also
pointed out that according to the report of the Governor  of
Himachal
Ed.: <a href="/doc/488734/" id="a_275">Sunderlal Patwa v. Union of India</a>, 1993 Jab LJ 387 (FB)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">136</span>
Pradesh, the Chief Minister met him and indicated I  clearly
that  he was desirous of and was implementing the  ban,	 and
that  some  arrests were also made.  In	 such  a  situation,
there  was  no	reason for the Governor to  believe,  or  to
report,	 that the Chief Minister is not sincere or  keen  to
implement the ban on the said organisations.  As a matter of
fact,  the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_276">Unlawful  Activities	(Prevention)
Act</a>,  1967,  has  declared the ban on  RSS  as	illegal	 and
accordingly  the  ban  has since  been	revoked.   The	non-
implementation of an illegal ban cannot be made the basis of
action	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_277">Article 356.</a>  Assuming that  there  was	such
inaction  or  refusal,	it  cannot  be	made  a	 ground	 for
dismissing  the	 State	Government and	for  dissolving	 the
Assembly.   The White Paper now placed before the Court	 was
not  in	 existence  on December 15,  1992.   The  manifestos
issued	by the BJP from time to time cannot  constitute	 the
information  referred  to in the Proclamations not,  in	 any
event, legally relevant material.
</p><p id="p_203">133.  In  the  counter to the writ petition  in	 the  Madhya
Pradesh	 high  Court, the case of the Union of	India  inter
alia,	was  that  the	Proclamation  was  issued   on	 the
satisfaction of the President that the Government of  Madhya
Pradesh	 cannot	 be  carried  on  in  Accordance  with	 the
provisions of the Constitution.	 The reports of the Governor
disclosed that the State Government had miserably failed  to
protect	 the  citizens	and property of	 the  State  against
internal disturbance.  On the basis of the said reports, the
President   formed   the   requisite   satisfaction.	 The
Proclamation  under  clause (1) has been  approved  by	both
Houses	of Parliament.	In such a situation the court  ought
not to entertain the writ petition to scrutinise the  wisdom
or  otherwise  of the Presidential Proclamation	 or  of	 the
approval of Parliament.
</p><p id="p_204">134. It was further contended that the circumstances in	 the
State of M.P. were different from several other States where
too serious disturbance to law and order took place.   There
is no comparison between both situations.  "Besides  Bhopal,
over-all situation in the State of M.P. was such that  there
were sufficient and cogent reasons to be satisfied that	 the
Government  in	the  State  could  not	be  carried  on	  in
accordance  with the provisions of the Constitution.  It  is
denied	that  there was no law and order  situation  in	 the
State."	 The  Governor's  reports are  based  upon  relevant
material and are made bona fide, and after due verification.
</p><p id="p_205">135. In the counter-affidavit filed in the writ petition (TC
No.  8 of 1993) relating to Himachal Pradesh, it  is  stated
that  the events of December 6, 1992 were not the  handiwork
of  few persons.  It is "the public attitude and  statements
of various groups and political parties including BJP  which
led  to	 the destruction of the structure  in  question	 and
caused	great  damage  to the very  secular  fabric  of	 the
country and created communal discord and disharmony all over
the  country including Himachal Pradesh." It is stated	that
the repercussions of the event cannot be judged by comparing
the  number  of persons killed in different States.   It  is
asserted  that	the Council of Ministers and  the  President
"had  a wealth of material available to them in the  present
case  which  are relevant to the satisfaction  formed  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_278">Article 356.</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">137</span>
<p id="p_206">They were also aware of the serious damage to communal amity
and  harmony  which has been caused in the State  of  Madhya
Pradesh,  among others.	 They were extremely concerned	with
repercussions  which events at Ayodhya might still  have  in
the  States" and "the ways and means to bring back  normalcy
not  only in the law and order situation but  also  communal
amity  and  harmony  which had been so badly  damaged  as  a
result	of the activities, attitude and stand of inter	alia
the  party in power in the State".  It is also stated  that,
according  to  the  definite information  available  to	 the
Government  of	India,	members of the	RSS  were  not	only
present on the spot at Ayodhya but actually participated  in
the  demolition and they were responsible for  promotion  of
communal  disharmony.  It is also asserted that	 the  action
was  taken  by the President not only on the  basis  of	 the
report	of  the	 Governor but also on  the  basis  of  other
information received by him.
</p><p id="p_207">136.  In  the counter-affidavit field in the  writ  petition
relating to Rajasthan (TC No. 9 of 1993), it is stated	that
after  the demolition on December 6, 1992, violence  started
in various parts of the country leading to loss of life	 and
property.  It is asserted that it is not possible to  assess
the law and order situation in different States only on	 the
basis of casualty figures.  The situation in each State	 has
to be assessed differently.  The averment of the  petitioner
that  the  State  Government  implemented  the	ban  on	 RSS
properly is denied.  There is no requirement that the report
of  the Governor should be addressed to the  President.	  It
can  also be addressed to the Prime Minister.	Besides	 the
report of the Governor, other information was also available
on  which  the President had formed his	 satisfaction.	 The
allegations of mala fide, capricious and arbitrary  exercise
of power are denied.  The Presidential Proclamation need not
contain	 reasons  for  the  action,  it	 is  submitted.	  No
irrelevant  material  was taken into  consideration  by	 the
President.
</p><p id="p_208">137. The  learned  counsel  for Union  of  India  and  other
counsel	 supporting the impugned Proclamations	argued	that
the  main  plank and the primary programme of  BJP  was	 the
construction  of  a Ram Temple at the very  site  where	 the
Babri  Masjid  stood.  The party openly proclaimed  that  it
will  remove  relocate,	 as it called it  the  Babri  Masjid
structure  since  according  to	 it  the  Babri	 Masjid	 was
superimposed  on  an existing Ram Temple by  Emperor  Babar.
The  party came to power in all the four States on the	said
plank and since then had been working towards the said goal.
It has been the single goal of all the leaders of BJP, their
Ministers,  legislators and all cadres.	 For  this  purpose,
they  had  been repeatedly collecting kar  sevaks  from	 all
comers	 at  Ayodhya  from  time  to  time.   In  the	days
immediately  preceding December 6, 1992, their	leaders	 had
been inciting and exhorting their followers to demolish	 the
Babri Masjid and to build a temple there.  The Ministers  in
Madhya	Pradesh,  Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan  had  taken
active part in organising and sending kar sevaks to Ayodhya.
When the kar sevaks returned from Ayodhya after	 demolishing
the  Masjid,  they  were welcomed as heroes  by	 those	very
persons.   Many	 of the Ministers and Chief  Ministers	were
members of RSS and were protesting against the ban on it.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">138</span>
<p id="p_209">They  could not, therefore, be trusted to enforce  the	ban,
notwithstanding the protestations to the contrary by some of
them.  The counsel relied for the purpose upon the following
facts to support their contentions :
</p><p id="p_210">138. In May/June 1991, mid-term poll was held to Lok  Sabha.
The manifesto issued by the BJP on the eve of May/June	1991
mid-term poll states that the BJP "seeks the restoration  of
Ram  Janambhoomi  in  Ayodhya  only by	way  of	 a  symbolic
righting of historic wrongs, so that the old unhappy chapter
of   acrimony	could  be  ended,  and	a   Grand   National
Reconciliation	effected".  At another place under the	head
"Sri  Ram  Mandir at Janmasthan",  the	following  statement
occurs	:  "BJP	 firmly believes that  construction  of	 Ram
Mandir	at Janmasthan is a symbol of the vindication of	 our
cultural heritage and national self-respect.  For BJP it  is
purely	a  national issue and it will not allow	 any  vested
interests  to  give  it a  sectarian  and  communal  colour.
Hence,	the  party is committed to build Sri Ram  Mandir  at
Janmasthan  by relocating superimposed Babri structure	with
due  respect." By themselves, the above statements  may	 not
mean  that  the	 programme envisaged  unlawful	or  forcible
demolition  of the disputed structure.	The said  statements
are  also  capable of being understood as meaning  that	 the
party  proposed to vindicate their stand  by  constitutional
means  that  the  disputed structure was  in  fact  the	 Ram
Janmasthan  which  was forcibly converted into a  mosque  by
Emperor	 Babar and that only thereafter they would  relocate
the  said structure and build Sri Ram Temple at	 that  site.
However, the above statements when read in the light of	 the
speeches  and acts of the leaders of the BJP, give room	 for
another interpretation as well.	 Those facts are brought out
in the "White Paper on Ayodhya" issued by the Government  of
India in February 1993.	 They are as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">	      "A movement to construct the Sri Ram Temple at
	      the site of the disputed structure by removing
	      or  relocating it gathered strength in  recent
	      years.	A  determined  bid  to	 storm	 the
	      structure in October/November 1990 resulted in
	      some damage to the structure and loss of lives
	      as  a  result of police firing.	The  Central
	      Government   was	negotiating   with   various
	      parties  and  organisations  for	a   peaceful
	      settlement  of  the  issue.   However,  a	 new
	      dimension	 was  added  to	 the  campaign	 for
	      construction of the temple with the  formation
	      of  the  Government in Uttar Pradesh  in	June
	      1991.    The   Government	  declared    itself
	      committed	 to the construction of the   temple
	      and took certain steps like the acquisition of
	      land   adjoining	 the   disputed	  structure,
	      demolition   of  certain	 other	 structures,
	      including	 temples  standing on  the  acquired
	      land,  and digging and levelling of a part  of
	      the  acquired  land.  The	 disputed  structure
	      itself  was left out of  the  acquisition.-The
	      plan  of the proposed temple released  by	 the
	      VHP   envisaged	location  of   the   sanctum
	      sanctorum	 of the temple at the very  site  of
	      the disputed structure.  The Union  Government
	      was   concerned  about  the  safety   of	 the
	      structure.  But at the meeting of the National
	      Integration Council held on November 2,  1991,
	      the  Chief  Minister of  Uttar  Pradesh,	Shri
	      Kalyan   Singh,  undertook  to   protect	 the
			    structure and assured everybody there that	it
	      is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">	      139</span>
	      responsibility  of  the  State  Government  to
	      protect the disputed structure and that no one
	      would  be	 allowed  to  go  there.   He	also
	      undertook	 that  all the orders of  the  court
	      will be faithfully implemented.  In July 1992,
	      a	 large number of kar sevaks gathered on	 the
	      acquired	land  and  proposed  to	 start	 the
	      construction.   The situation was averted	 and
	      kar seva was called off on July 26, 1992.	 The
	      BJP decided to re-enact the Rath Yatra by Shri
	      L.K. Advani and Shri M.M. Joshi on the pattern
	      of  1990	Rath  Yatra with  the  objective  of
	      mobilising  people  and  kar  sevaks  for	 the
	      construction  of Sri Ram Temple.	Shri  Advani
	      said  that  they	have now  plunged  into	 the
	      temple movement in full strength.	 The leaders
	      of  the BJP were acting in concert  with	VHP,
	      RSS and allied organisations.  The Rath Yatras
	      started  on  December 1,	1992.	Shri  Advani
	      started  from  Varanasi and  Shri	 Joshi	from
	      Mathura.	 The starting points had  their	 own
	      sinister	significance for the future  demands
	      and programmes for restoration of the  temples
	      at  both	these  places.	 Both  the   leaders
	      travelled through eastern and western parts of
	      Uttar  Pradesh  and reached  Ayodhya.   During
	      their   Yatra,   both   these   leaders	gave
	      provocative speeches and mobilised kar  sevaks
	      and  asked their workers and people  to  reach
	      Ayodhya in large numbers to perform kar  seva.
	      Shri L.K. Advani, during the Rath Yatra,	kept
	      constantly appealing to the kar sevaks to take
	      the  plunge and not bother about the  survival
	      of the Kalyan Singh Government.  He also	kept
	      saying  that  kar seva in	 Ayodhya  would	 not
	      remain  restricted to 'bhajan or	kirtan'	 but
	      would  involve physical labour.	Shri  Joshi,
	      during the Rath Yatra, maintained that the BJP
	      Government in U.P. would not use force against
	      the kar sevaks in Ayodhya and that the  nature
	      of kar seva would be decided by  Sants/Mahants
	      and  the	RJBBM issue was a  religious  matter
	      which can be solved only by the  Dharmacharyas
	      but  not by the Supreme Court.  He  threatened
	      of serious consequences if the BJP  Government
	      in  U.P. was dismissed.  On December 1,  1992,
	      Shri  Joshi  appealed  to	 the  gathering	 (at
	      Mathura)	to  assemble  at  Ayodhya  in  large
	      numbers for kar seva and demolish the socalled
	      Babri Masjid.  Smt Vijayaraje Scindia, another
	      leader of the BJP stated at Patna on  November
	      23, 1992 that the Babri Masjid will have to be
	      demolished, Shri V.H. Dalmiya, a leader of VHP
	      declared on November 9, 1992 at Delhi that the
	      RJB  Temple would be constructed in  the	same
	      way  it  was demolished by Babar.	  He  stated
	      that   kar   sevaks  were	  pressurising	 the
	      leadership  that they should be called not  to
	      construct	 the RJB Temple but to demolish	 the
	      masjid.  As early as December 1, 1992,  25,000
	      kar  sevaks had reached Ayodhya.	By  December
	      5,    their   number   crossed   two    lakhs.
	      Arrangements were made for their accommodation
	      in tents, schools and colleges and even in the
	      open  near the disputed structure.  The  local
	      Administration  stepped  up  its	efforts	  to
	      increase	civic  amenities  in  view  of	 the
	      arrival of kar sevaks in such large numbers.
	      The Central Government had posted paramilitary
	      forces at Ayodhya to meet any eventuality	 and
	      to be ready for any assistance that the local
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">	      140</span>
	      Administration  or the BJP Goverment  may	 ask
	      for . Instead of utilising the services of the
	      said  forces,  the  Chief	 Minister  of  Uttar
	      Pradesh  had  been protesting to	the  Central
	      Government  about	 the  camping  of  the	said
	      forces  at  Ayodhya.   In	 his  letter   dated
	      December	1,  1992  addressed  to	 the   Prime
	      Minister,	 Shri  Kalyan  Singh  recorded	 his
	      protest  about the continued presence  of	 the
	      said   forces   at  Ayodhya,  termed   it	  as
	      unauthorised  and illegal on the	ground	that
	      they were stationed there without the  consent
	      and   against   the  wishes   of	 the   State
	      Government.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">	      On  December 6, 1992, while the crowd  of	 kar
	      sevaks  was being addressed by leaders of	 the
	      BJP,  VHP,  etc.,	 roughly 150  persons  in  a
	      sudden  move broke through the cordon  on	 the
	      terrace, regrouped and started pelting  stones
	      at the police personnel.	A large crowd  broke
	      into the disputed structure.  The mob  swelled
	      enormously  within  a short time	and  started
	      demolishing  the structure.  The local  police
	      stood  by as mute spectators since  they	were
	      under orders of the Chief Minister not to	 use
	      force  against  the kar sevaks.	The  central
	      forces  were equally helpless since they	were
	      not   allowed  to	 intervene  by	 the   local
	      Magistrate on the spot."
</blockquote><p id="p_211">139. It was also emphasised that according to the  statement
of  the Union Home Minister made in Rajya Sabha on  December
21,  1992, "all these kar sevaks, when they  returned,	were
received by the Chief Ministers and Ministers".
</p><p id="p_212">140. Relying  on  these facts and events, it  was  contended
that  what happened on December 6, 1992 did not happen in  a
day.  It was the culmination of a sustained campaign carried
on  by the BJP and other allied organisations over the	last
few  years.  It was then pointed out that in  the  manifesto
issued	by  the	 BJP in connection  with  the  1993  General
Elections, there is not a word of regret about what happened
on  December  6,  1992.	  On  the  contrary,  the  following
statement occurs there under the heading "Ayodhya" :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">				 Ayodhya
	      In their actions and utterances, the forces of
	      pseudo-secularism	  convey  the	unmistakable
	      impression of a deep repugnance for all things
	      Hindu.   Indeed,	in their minds	'Hindu'	 has
	      come  to be associated with  'communal'.	 The
	      controversy over the Ram Janambhoomi temple in
	      Ayodhya  is  a powerful illustration  of	this
	      phenomenon.  For them 'Sahmat' is secular	 and
	      'Saffron' communal.  Although the facts of the
	      dispute are well known, certain features merit
	      repetition.   First,  it was  always  apparent
	      that  a vast majority of Hindus  were  totally
	      committed	 to  the  construction	of  a  grand
	      temple  for Lord Rama at the site	 where	puja
	      has been performed uninterruptedly since	1948
	      and  where besides, no namaz has been  offered
	      since 1936.  The structure built by the Moghul
	      Emperor  Babar was viewed by the Hindus  as  a
	      symbol of national humiliation.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">	      141</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">	      Second  the election of 1991 in Uttar  Pradesh
	      centered	on  the Ayodhya dispute.  It  was  a
	      virtual referendum on Ram Janmabhoomi and	 the
	      BJP   with  its  promise	to  facilitate	 the
	      construction   of	 the  Ram  Temple  won	 the
	      election.	  However,  this  mandate  did	 not
	      prevent the Congress and other  pseudo-secular
	      parties	from   wilfully	  obstructing	 the
	      initiatives  of the Uttar Pradesh	 Government.
	      Everything, from administrative subterfuge  to
	      judicial	delay, was used by the opponents  of
	      the temple to prevent the BJP Government	from
	      fulfilling its promise to the electorate.
	      On  December 6, 1992 kar sevaks from all	over
	      India  assembled	in  Ayodhya  to	 begin	 the
	      reconstruction of the Rama Temple at the	site
	      adjoining	 the garbha griha.  Matters took  an
	      unexpected   turn	  when,	  angered   by	 the
	      obstructive  tactics  of	the  Narasimha	 Rao
	      Government,  inordinate  judicial	 delays	 and
	      pseudo-secularist taunts, the kar sevaks	took
	      matters  into their own hands, demolished	 the
	      disputed structure and constructed a makeshift
	      temple for Lord Rama at the garbha griha.
	      Owning  responsibility  for its  inability  to
	      prevent  the  demolition, the  BJP  Government
	      headed  by  Shri Kalyan  Singh  submitted	 its
	      resignation.  A disoriented Central Government
	      was   not	 content  with	the  imposition	  of
	      President's   rule  in  Uttar   Pradesh.	  In
	      violation	 of  democratic	 norms,	 the  Centre
	      dismissed	 the BJP Governments  in  Rajasthan,
	      Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.  Further,
	      it  banned  the  Rashtriya  Swaymsevak  Sangh,
	      Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal.
	      Worst of all, in collusion with other rootless
	      forces  the  Government  unleashed  a  vicious
	      propaganda  offensive aimed at belittling	 the
	      Hindus.	The  kar sevaks were  denigrated  as
	      fascists, lumpens and vandals, and December 6,
	      was   described	as   a	 'national   shame'.
	      Recently,	 the  CBI  has	filed  charge-sheets
	      against  leaders	of the BJP  and	 the  Vishwa
	      Hindu Parishad with the purpose of  projecting
	      them as criminals.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_62">	      This  relentless	onslaught  of  the   pseudo-
	      secular forces against the people of India had
	      very  serious consequences.  For a  start,  it
	      created  a  wide emotional  gulf	between	 the
	      rulers and the people.  Ayodhya was a  popular
	      indictment of the spurious politics of double-
	      standards.   Far from recognising it as  such,
	      the  Congress and other anti-BJP parties	used
	      it  as a pretext for furthering the  cause  of
	      unprincipled minorityism.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_63">	      It  is  this  minorityism	 that  prevents	 the
	      Congress, Janata Dal, Samajvadi Party and	 the
	      Communist	 Parties  from coming  out  with  an
	      unambiguous declaration of intent on  Ayodhya.
	      This   BJP   is  the  only  party	  which	  is
	      categorical in its assurance to facilitate the
	      construction of the Rama Temple at the site of
	      the  erstwhile Babri structure.  This is	what
	      the people desire."
</blockquote><p id="p_213">141. The  further submission was that the demolition of	 the
disputed   structure  was  the	outcome	 of  the   speeches,
programme  and the several campaigns including	Rath  Yatras
undertaken  by	the  leaders  of the  BJP.   It	 is  neither
possible  nor  realistic to dissociate	the  Governments  of
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh from the acts
and deeds of their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">142</span>
party.	It is one party with one programme.  It is stated in
the  report of the Himachal Pradesh Governor that the  Chief
Minister himself was a member of the RSS.  In the report  of
the  Governor of Madhya Pradesh also, it is stated that	 the
Chief  Minister and other Ministers swore by the values	 and
traditions of the RSS.	The reports also indicate that these
Governments   actively	 participated  in   organising	 and
despatching the kar sevaks to Ayodhya and welcomed them	 and
praised	 when they came back after doing the deed.  Thus,  a
common thread runs through ail the four BJP Governments	 and
binds  them  together.	The manifestos of the party  on	 the
basis of which these Governments came to power coupled	with
their speeches and actions clearly demonstrate a  commonness
and  unity  of	action	between	 the  party  and  the	four
Governments.   The  very manifestos and their  programme  of
action	were such as to hurt the religious feelings  of	 the
Muslim community.  The demolition of the disputed  structure
was  no ordinary event.	 The disputed structure	 had  become
the  focal  point  and the bone of  contention	between	 two
religious  communities.	 The process which resulted  in	 the
demolition and the manner in which it was perpetrated, dealt
a  serious  blow to the communal harmony and  peace  in	 the
country.   It  had adverse  international  repercussions  as
well.  A number of Hindu temples were demolished in Pakistan
and Bangladesh in reprisal of the demolition at Ayodhya.  It
was  difficult in this situation for the minorities  in	 the
four States to have any faith in tile neutrality of the four
Governments.   It  was absolutely necessary  to	 recreate  a
feeling of security among them.	 They required to be assured
of  the	 safety and security of their person  and  property.
This was not possible with the BJP Governments in power.
</p><p id="p_214">142.  It  was  also stressed that  the	Chief  Ministers  of
Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were the members of	 the
banned RSS.  In such circumstances, the respective Governors
were rightly of the view that the said Chief Ministers could
not  be	 expected to, or relied upon to	 implement  the	 ban
sincerely.   Hence it could not be said to be  an  unfounded
opinion.   Allowing  a	party  which  had  consciously	 and
actively  brought  about  such a situation  to	continue  in
office	in  these  circumstances would not  have  helped  in
restoring  the	faith  of  people  in  general	and  of	 the
minorities  in	particular.   It is no answer  to  say	that
disturbance  took  place on a much larger scale	 in  certain
States ruled by Congress (1) parties and that no action	 was
taken against those Governments.
</p><p id="p_215">143. In	 reply	to these contentions, the  counsel  for	 the
petitioners  submitted that if the reasoning of the  counsel
for the Union of India was accepted, it would mean that	 BJP
cannot form Government in any State and the party has to  be
banned	and  that the acceptance of such  submissions  would
create a serious political situation.  They also pointed out
that  the majority judgment of the two judges of the  Madhya
Pradesh High Court+ had quashed the Proclamation taking	 the
view that it was not possible to accept that failure on	 the
part  of  the  State  Government  to  save  the	 lives	 and
properties  of	citizens in a few cities in the State  as  a
result of sudden

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">143</span>
outbreak   of	violence  could	 reasonably  lead   to	 the
satisfaction of the President that the Government was unable
to  function  in  accordance  with  the	 Constitution	and,
therefore,  the consequent dissolution of the  Assembly	 was
also bad in law.
</p><p id="p_216">144. The gist of the contentions of the petitioners was that
mere  disturbance  in  some  parts  of	Madhya	Pradesh	 and
Rajasthan  involving the loss of some lives and	 destruction
of  some  property did not amount to a	situation  where  it
could be said that the Governments of those States could not
be  carried  on	 in accordance with the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	Further,  the fact that	 the  Ministries  of
these  States  belonged to BJP whose one  of  the  political
planks in the election manifesto was the construction of Sri
Ram  Temple  at	 the site of the mosque	 by  relocating	 the
mosque somewhere else, did not amount to an act to give rise
to  the apprehension that the Ministries of that party	were
infidel	 to  the objective of secularism  enshrined  in	 the
Constitution.	So  also, the pursuit of  the  programme  of
constructing  the  temple  on  the site	 of  the  mosque  by
relocating   the  latter  elsewhere,  by  speeches  and	  by
exhorting the kar sevaks to assemble at Ayodhya on  December
6,  1992 and by giving them a warm send-off for the  purpose
did  not amount to a deviation from the creed of  secularism
nor did the welcome to the kar sevaks in the State after the
destruction of the mosque or the inaction of the leaders  of
the  BJP  present at the site in preventing the	 kar  sevaks
from  destroying  the mosque or want of	 the  expression  of
regret	on  their  part over such destruction  amount  to  a
breach	of  the goal of secularism.  A mere  continuance  in
office	of  the	 Ministries which were formed  on  the	said
political  plank in the aftermath of the destruction of	 the
mosque by itself could not further have led to the  feelings
of  insecurity	in the minds of the Muslims when  the  State
Governments  of	 Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh could  not  be
said to be remiss in taking all necessary actions to prevent
riots  and  violence  and  when there  was  no	incident  of
violence  or  destruction in Himachal Pradesh.	 As  against
this, the sum and substance of the contentions on behalf  of
the  Union of India and others supporting the  Proclamations
in  these  States  was	that  the  Ministries  heading	 the
Administration	in  these  States could not  be	 trusted  to
adhere to secularism when they had admittedly come to  power
on the political plank of constructing Sri Ram Mandir on the
site of the mosque by relocating the mosque elsewhere  which
meant  by destroying it and then reconstructing it at  other
place.	This was particularly so, when by its actual deed on
December  6, 1992, the party in question  demonstrated	what
they meant by their said political manifesto.  It was facile
thereafter  to contend that the party only wanted to  follow
the constitutional means to pursue the goal of	constructing
the Ram Temple on the said site.  The destruction of  mosque
was  a	concrete  proof	 of the creed  which  the  party  in
question  wanted  to  pursue.  In  such	 circumstances,	 the
Ministries formed by the said party could not be trusted  to
follow	the  objective of secularism which was part  of	 the
basic structure of the Constitution and also the soul of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_217">145. These  contentions inevitably invite us to discuss	 the
concept of secularism as accepted by our Constitution.	 Our
Constitution does not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">144</span>
prohibit  the practice of any religion either  privately  or
publicly.   Through  the Preamble of the  Constitution,	 the
people of this country have solemnly resolved to  constitute
this  country, among others, into a secular republic and  to
secure to all its citizens (i) JUSTICE, social, economic and
political;  (ii)  LIBERTY of  thought,	expression,  belief,
faith	and  worship;  (iii)  EQUALITY	of  status  and	  of
opportunity;  and (iv) to promote among them all  FRATERNITY
assuring  the  dignity of the individual and the  unity	 and
integrity  of  the Nation.  <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_279">Article 25</a> of  the	Constitution
guarantees to all persons equally the freedom of  conscience
and  the  right to freely profess,  practise  and  propagate
religion  subject to public order, morality and	 health	 and
subject	 to  the other Fundamental Rights  and	the  State's
power  to  make	 any  law  regulating  or  restricting	 any
economic,  financial,  political or other  secular  activity
which may be associated with religious practice.  <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_280">Article 26</a>
guarantees  every  religious  denomination  or	any  section
thereof the right (a) to establish and maintain institutions
for religious and charitable purposes, (b) to manage its own
affairs	 in  matters  of religion, (c) to  own	and  acquire
movable	 and immovable property and (d) to  administer	such
property  in  accordance with law.   <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_281">Article  29</a>  guarantees
every  section of the citizens its distinct  culture,  among
others.	  <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_282">Article 30</a> provides that all minorities  based  on
religion  shall have the right to establish  and  administer
educational institutions of their choice.  It prohibits	 the
State  from making any discrimination in granting aid to  an
educational  institution  managed by a	religious  minority.
Under  Articles	 14, 15 and 16, the  Constitution  prohibits
discrimination	against	 any citizen on the  ground  of	 his
religion  and guarantees equal protection of law  and  equal
opportunity  of public employment.  <a href="/doc/1406604/" id="a_283">Article 44</a> enjoins	upon
the  State to endeavour to secure to its citizens a  uniform
civil  code.  <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_284">Article 51-A</a> casts a duty on every citizen  of
India,	among others, (a) to abide by the  Constitution	 and
respect its ideals and institutions, (b) to promote  harmony
and  the spirit of common brotherhood, among all the  people
of   India,  transcending,  among  others,   religious	 and
sectional  diversities, (c) to value and preserve  the	rich
heritage of our composite culture, (d) to develop scientific
temper,	 humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;	 and
</p><p id="p_218">(e) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence.
</p><p id="p_219">146. These   provisions	  by   implication   prohibit	 the
establishment  of a theocratic State and prevent  the  State
either	identifying itself with or favouring any  particular
religion  or religious sect or denomination.  The  State  is
enjoined  to  accord equal treatment to	 all  religions	 and
religious sects and denominations.
</p><p id="p_220">147. As	 has  been explained by Shri  M.C.  Setalvad  (Patel
Memorial Lectures-- 1965 on Secularism)-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">	      "Secularism often denotes the way of life	 and
	      conduct guided by materialistic considerations
	      devoid   of  religion.   The  basis  of	this
	      ideology	is  that material  means  alone	 can
	      advance  mankind	and that  religious  beliefs
	      retard the growth of the human beings ... this
	      ideology is of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">	       145</span>
		 recent	 growth and it is obvious that it  is
	      quite  different from the concept	 of  secular
	      State  in	 the  West  which  took	 root	many
	      centuries ago. ...
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">	      A	 different view in relation to	religion  is
	      the  basis of 'secularism' understood  in	 the
	      sense  of	 what  may  be	called	a   'secular
	      attitude' towards life.  Society generally  or
	      the    individual	  constituting	  it	tend
	      progressively  to	 isolate religion  from	 the
	      more  significant areas of common life.	Many
	      of  us, Hindus and Muslims and others, are  in
	      our  way of life, and outlook on most  matters
	      largely governed by ideas and practices  which
	      are  connected  with  or	are  rooted  in	 our
	      religion.	 The secular attitude would wean  us
	      away  from  this	approach  so  that  in	 our
	      relations	  with	our  fellow  beings  or	  in
	      dealings	with  other social groups,  we	have
	      less   and  less	regard	for   religion	 and
	      religious	 practices  and base our  lives	 and
	      actions	more  on   worldly   considerations,
	      restricting religion and its influence to what
	      has been called its 'proper' sphere, i.e., the
	      advancement  of the spiritual life  and  well-
	      being  of the individual.	 Secularism of	this
	      character	 is  said  to be  essential  to	 our
	      progress	as  human  beings and  as  a  nation
	      because  it  will enable us to shake  off	 the
	      narrow and restrictive outlook arising out  of
	      casteism,	 communalism  and other	 like  ideas
	      which come in the way of our development.
	      'secularism' of the kinds we have adverted  to
	      above.  ...  No doubt, the  two  concepts	 are
	      interdependent   in  the	sense  that  it	  is
	      difficult to conceive of a society or a  group
	      of  individuals  being  induced  to  adopt   a
	      secular  philosophy  or  a  secular   attitude
	      without the aid of a secular State.
	      A	 secular  State	 is  not  easy	to   define.
	      According to the liberal democratic  tradition
	      of the West, the secular State is not  hostile
	      to  religion  but	 holds	itself	neutral	  in
	      matters of religion.......
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_66">	      Thereafter, referring to the Indian concept of
	      secularism,  the	learned	 jurist	 stated	  as
	      follows :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_67">	      "... the secularist way of life was repeatedly
	      preached	by  leaders  of	 movement  so	that
	      religious matters came to be regarded entirely
	      as   relating   to  the  conscience   of	 the
	      individuals.......
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_68">	      "The  coming of the partition  emphasised	 the
	      great	 importance	 of	 secularism.
	      Notwithstanding the partition, a large  Muslim
	      minority	 consisting  of	 a  tenth   of	 the
	      population  continued  to be the	citizens  of
	      independent India.  There are other  important
	      minority	 groups	  of   citizens.    In	 the
	      circumstances,  a	 secular  Constitution	 for
	      independent  India under which  all  religions
	      could  enjoy  equal freedom and  all  citizens
	      equal right and which could weld together into
	      one    nation,   the    different	   religious
	      communities, become inevitable."
</blockquote><p id="p_221">Thereafter, the learned jurist has gone on to point out that
our  Constitution  undoubtedly lacks a	complete  separation
between the church and the State as in the United States and
at  the same time we have no established church as in  Great
Britain	 or  some  other countries.   In  our  country,	 all
religions are placed on the basis of equality and it  would,
therefore, seem that it is erroneous to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">146</span>
describe  our  country	as a secular State.   He  quoted  Dr
Radhakrishnan  who said that "the religious impartiality  of
the  Indian State is not to be confused with  secularism  or
atheism".   He also pointed out that the proceedings of	 the
Constituent  Assembly  show  that  "two	 attempts  made	  to
introduce  the	word  'secular'	 in  the  Constitution	 had
failed.	 ..."  At  the same time,  he  asserted	 that.......
nevertheless, it could not be said that the Indian State did
not  possess  some important characteristics  of  a  Secular
State"	and  has pointed out some of the provisions  of	 the
Constitution  to  which	 we have already  made	a  reference
above.	He has then stated that the ideal of a Secular State
in the sense of a State which treats all religions alike and
displays benevolence towards them is in a way more suited to
the  Indian  environment and climate than that	of  a  truly
Secular	 State	by  which he meant  a  State  which  creates
complete separation between religion and the State.  Justice
Chinnappa Reddy, delivering his Ambedkar Memorial Lecture on
'Indian Constitution and Secularism' has observed that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">	      "Indian	constitutional	secularism  is	 not
	      supportive of religion at all but has  adopted
	      what  may	 be termed  as	permissive  attitude
	      towards religion out of respect for individual
	      conscience  and  dignity.	 There,	 even  while
	      recognising the right to profess and  practise
	      religion,	 etc., it has excluded	all  secular
	      activities  from the purview of  religion	 and
	      also  of	practices  which  are  repugnant  to
	      public  order,  morality and  health  and	 are
	      abhorrent	 to  human rights  and	dignity,  as
	      embodied	in  the	 other	fundamental   rights
	      guaranteed by the Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_222">148. One  thing	 which prominently emerges  from  the  above
discussion  on	secularism under our  Constitution  is	that
whatever  the attitude of the State towards  the  religions,
religious sects and denominations, religion cannot be  mixed
with  any  secular  activity of the  State.   In  fact,	 the
encroachment of religion into secular activities is strictly
prohibited.   This  is evident from the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution  to  which we have made reference	above.	 The
State's tolerance of religion or religions does not make  it
either	a religious or a theocratic State.  When  the  State
allows citizens to practise and profess their religions,  it
does  not  either  explicitly or implicitly  allow  them  to
introduce religion into non-religious and secular activities
of the State.  The freedom and tolerance of religion is only
to the extent of permitting pursuit of spiritual life  which
is different from the secular life.  The latter falls in the
exclusive domain of the affairs of the State.  This is	also
clear	from   sub-section  (3)	 of  <a href="/doc/70252546/" id="a_285">Section  123</a>   of	 the
Representation	of the People Act, 1951 which  prohibits  an
appeal	by a candidate or his agent or by any  other  person
with  the consent of the candidate or his election agent  to
vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground  of
his religion, race, caste, community or language or the	 use
of or appeal to religious symbols.  Subsection (3-A) of	 the
same  section prohibits the promotion or attempt to  promote
feelings  of enmity and hatred between different classes  of
the  citizens  of India on the grounds	of  religion,  race,
caste, community or language by a candidate or his agent  or
any  other person with the consent of the candidate  or	 his
election agent for the furtherance of the prospects of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">147</span>
election  of that candidate or for  prejudicially  affecting
the  election of any candidate.	 A breach of the  provisions
of  the	 said sub-sections (3) and (3-A) are  deemed  to  be
corrupt practices within the meaning of the said section.
</p><p id="p_223">149.  Mr. Ram Jethmalani contented that what was  prohibited
by <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_286">Section 123(3)</a> was not an appeal to religion as such	 but
an  appeal to religion of the candidate and seeking vote  in
the name of the said religion.	According to him, it did not
prohibit  the candidate from seeking vote in the name  of  a
religion  to  which  the candidate  did	 not  belong.	With
respect,  we are unable to accept this contention.   Reading
sub-sections  (3) and (3-A) of <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_287">Section 123</a> together,  it  is
clear that appealing to any religion or seeking votes in the
name  of any religion is prohibited by the  two	 provisions.
To  read otherwise is to subvert the intent and	 purpose  of
the  said  provisions.	 What is  more,	 assuming  that	 the
interpretation placed by the learned counsel is correct,  it
cannot	control the content of secularism which is  accepted
by and is implicit in our Constitution.
</p><p id="p_224">150. In	 view  of the content of secularism adopted  by	 our
Constitution  as  discussed above, the question	 that  poses
itself for our consideration in these matters is whether the
three  Governments  when they had to their credit  the	acts
discussed above, could be trusted to carry on the governance
of  the	 State	in accordance with  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution  and the President's satisfaction based on	 the
said acts could be challenged in law.  To recapitulate,	 the
acts  were (i) the BJP manifesto on the basis of  which	 the
elections were contested and pursuant to which elections the
3 Ministries came to power stated as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_70">	      "BJP firmly believes that construction of	 Sri
	      Ram  Mandir at Janmasthan is a symbol  of	 the
	      vindication  of  our  cultural  heritage	 and
	      national self-respect.  For BJP it is purely a
	      national	issue  and it (sic)  not  allow	 any
	      vested  interest	to give it a  sectarian	 and
	      communal	colour. Hence party is committed  to
	      build   Sri  Ram	Mandir	at   Janmasthan	  by
	      relocating  superimposed Babri structure	with
	      due respect."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_71">				      (emphasis supplied)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">(ii)  Leaders  of  the BJP had	consistently  made  speeches
thereafter  to	the  same effect. (iii) Some  of  the  Chief
Ministers  and Ministers belonged to RSS which was a  banned
Organisation at the relevant time. (iv) The Ministers in  he
Ministries  concerned  exhorted people to join kar  seva  in
Ayodhya	 on  December  6, 1992.	 One MLA  belonging  to	 the
ruling BJP in Himachal Pradesh made a public statement	that
he  had	 actually  participated in  the	 estruction  of	 the
mosque.	 (v) Ministers had given public send-off to the	 kar
sevaks and had also welcomed them on their return after	 the
destruction  of	 he mosque. (vi) The implementation  of	 the
policy	pursuant to the ban of the SS was to be executed  by
the  Ministers	who  were  themselves  members	of  he	said
Organisation.  (vii)  At least in two States,  viz.,  Madhya
Pradesh	 and  Rajasthan there were  atrocities	against	 the
Muslims and loss of lives and destruction of property.
</blockquote><p id="p_225">151. As	  stated  above,  religious  tolerance	 and   equal
treatment  of all religious groups and protection  of  their
life and property and of the places of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">148</span>
their worship are an essential part of secularism  enshrined
in  our	 Constitution.	We have accepted the said  goal	 not
only  because it is our historical legacy and a need of	 our
national  unity	 and  integrity	 but  also  as	a  creed  of
universal  brotherhood	and humanism.  It  is  our  cardinal
faith.	 Any profession and action which go counter  to	 the
aforesaid  creed are a prima facie proof of the	 conduct  in
defiance   of  the  provisions	of  our	 Constitution.	  If
therefore,   the  President  had  acted	 on  the   aforesaid
"credentials"  of the Ministries in these States  which	 had
unforeseen  and imponderable cascading consequences, it	 can
hardly	be argued that there was no material before  him  to
come  to  the conclusion that the Governments in  the  three
States	could  not  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of the Constitution.  The consequences  of	such
professions  and  acts	which  are  evidently  against	 the
provisions  of the Constitution cannot be measured  only  by
what happens in praesenti.  A reasonable prognosis of events
to  come  and of their multifarious effects  to	 follow	 can
always be made on the basis of the events occurring, and  if
such  prognosis	 had  led  to the  conclusion  that  in	 the
circumstances,	the Governments of the States could  not  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution,  the  inference could hardly be  faulted.	  We
are,  therefore, of the view that the President	 had  enough
material  in the form of the aforesaid professions and	acts
of  the responsible section in the political set-up  of	 the
three	States	including  the	Ministries,  to	  form	 his
satisfaction that the Governments of the three States  could
not  be carried on in accordance with the provisions of	 the
Constitution.	Hence the Proclamations issued could not  be
said to be invalid.
</p><p id="p_226">152. The  appeals filed against the judgment of	 the  Madhya
Pradesh	 High Court have, therefore, to be allowed  and	 the
transfer  cases	 challenging the Proclamation,	have  to  be
dismissed.

</p><p id="p_230">K.   RAMASWAMY, J.- The appeals and transferred cases  raise
questions of far-reaching,consequences in the working of the
federal structure under the Constitution of India.   Whether
the  President of India can keep fiddling like Emperor	Nero
while Rome was burning or like Hamlet, Prince of Denmark  of
Shakespeare keep the pendulum oscillating between "to be  or
not  to	 be"  for the issuance	of  the	 Proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_295">Article	 356</a>  of  the  Constitution  dismissing	 the   State
Government  and	 dissolving the State  Legislatures  and  to
bring the administration of the State under his rule.  If he
so  acts, the scope and width of the exercise of  the  power
and  parameters	 of  judicial  review,	by  this  Court,  as

of  one State Government found seismic vibrations  in  other
States	governed  by  the  same	 political  party,  (in	 the
language  of S/Shri Parasaran and P.P. Rao,  learned  Senior
Counsel, 'common thread rule') are also liable to be brought
under the President Rule need to be critically examined arid
decided	  for	successful   working   of   the	  democratic
institutions set up by the suprema lex.	 Though the need  to
decide	these questions practically became academic  due  to
conducting  elections  to the State Assemblies and  the	 new
Legislative  Assemblies	 were constituted in the  States  of
U.P.,  Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal  Pradesh,	 all
the counsel requested us to decide the questions  regardless
of the relief to be granted in this case.  As stated earlier
since  the  decision  on these	questions  is  of  paramount
importance  for successful working of the  Constitution,  we
acceded to their prayer.
</p><p id="p_231">155. In S.R. Bommai's appeal the facts are that on March  5,
1985  elections	 held  to the  Karnataka  State	 Legislative
Assembly  and the Janata Dal won 139 seats out of 225  seats
and  the Congress Party was the next largest party  securing
66  seats.   Shri R.K. Hegde was elected as  the  leader  of
Janata	Dal  and  became the Chief  Minister.	Due  to	 his
resignation  on	 August	 12, 1988,  Shri  S.R.	Bommai,	 was
elected	 as  leader  of	 the  party  and  became  the  Chief
Minister.  As on February 1, 1989 the strength of Janata Dal
was  111  and the Congress was 65 and Janata Party  was	 27,
apart  from  others.  On April 15, 1989	 his  expanding	 the
Ministry  caused dissatisfaction to some of  the  aspirants.
One Kalyan Molakery and others defected from Janata Dal	 and
he  wrote letters on April 17 and 18, 1989 to  the  Governor
enclosing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">151</span>
letters	 of 19 others expressing want of confidence in	Shri
Bommai.	 On April 19, 1989 the Governor of Karnataka sent  a
report	to  the President.  On April 20, 1989, 7 out  of  19
MLAs  that supported Kalyan Molakery, wrote to the  Governor
that their signatures were obtained by misrepresentation and
reaffirmed  their support to Shri Bommai.  On the  same	 day
the cabinet also decided to convene the assembly session  on
April 27, 1989 at 3.30 p.m. to obtain vote of confidence and
Shri  Bommai  met the Governor and requested him,  to  allow
floor-test to prove his majority and he was prepared even to
advance	 the  date  of the session.  In	 this  scenario	 the
Governor  sent	his  second  report  to	 the  President	 and
exercising the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_300">Article 356</a> the President  issued
Proclamation, dismissed Bommai Government and dissolved	 the
Assembly on April 21, 1989 and assumed the administration of
the  State of Karnataka.  When a writ petition was filed  on
April 26, 1989, a special Bench of three Judges of the	High
Court of Karnataka dismissed the writ petition (reported  in
<a href="/doc/334013/" id="a_301">S.R.  Bommai  v.  Union of India30</a>).  Thus  this  appeal  by
special leave.
</p><p id="p_232">156. In	 the elections held in February 1990,  the  Bhartiya
Janata	Party, for short BJP, emerged as majority  party  in
the Legislative Assemblies of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh and formed the Governments in
the respective States.	One of the programmes of the BJP was
to  construct a temple for Lord Sri Rama at  his  birthplace
Ayodhya.   That was made an issue in its manifesto  for	 the
elections  to  the legislative assemblies.  On	December  6,
1992  Ram  Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid structure  (there  is  a
dispute	 that after destroying Lord Sri Rama  temple  Babur,
the Moghul invader, built Babri Masjid at the birthplace  of
Lord Sri Rama.	It is an acutely disputed question as to its
correctness.) However Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid structure
was  demolished by the kar sevaks gathered at Ayodhya, as  a
result of sustained momentum generated by BJP, Vishwa  Hindu
Parishad  for  short VHP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak	 Sangh,	 for
short RSS, Bajrang Dal for short BD, Shiv Sena for short  SS
and other organisations.  Preceding thereto when the dispute
was brought to this Court, the Government of India was	made
to act on behalf of the Supreme Court and from time to	time
directions were issued to the State Government which gave an
assurance  of full protection to Sri  Ram  Janmabhoomi-Babri
Masjid	structure.  On its demolition though the  Government
of  Uttar  Pradesh  resigned,  the  President  of  India  by
Proclamation  issued under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_302">Article 356</a> dissolved  the  State
Legislature on December 6, 1992.  The disastrous fall out of
the  demolition was in the nature of loss of precious  lives
of innocents, and property throughout the country and in the
neighbouring countries.	 The President, therefore, exercised
the  power  under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_303">Article 356</a> and by  the  Proclamations  of
December  15,  1992,  dismissed the  State  Governments	 and
dissolved  the Legislative Assemblies of  Rajasthan,  Madhya
Pradesh	 and Himachal Pradesh and assumed administration  of
the respective States.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">152</span>
</p><p id="p_234">157. Shri J. Sorabjee, the learned Senior Counsel  appearing
for Shri Bommai contended that power of the President  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_304">Article 356</a> is not unfettered nor unlimited; its exercise is
dependent upon the existence of an objective fact, namely  a
situation  has arisen in which the Government of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the Constitution.  This condition precedent is sine qua	 non
to  the exercise of power and issuance of  the	Proclamation
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_305">Article	356.</a>  The Proclamation must  set  forth	 the
grounds and reasons for reaching the satisfaction  supported
with  the  materials or the gist of the	 events	 in  support
thereof.   The	grounds	 and reasons should  be	 cogent	 and
credible  and must bear proximate nexus to the	exercise  of
the   power  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_306">Article  356.</a>   The	 breakdown  of	 the
constitutional	machinery is generally capable of  objective
determination.	 The  power  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_307">Article  356</a>  cannot  be
exercised  on  the basis of the report of  the	Governor  or
otherwise  of  an  inefficient	or  malfunctioning  of	 the
Government  or	mere  violation of some	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	 It  could  be	exercised  only	  when	 the
Government  misuses its power contrary to the  basic  scheme
and  purpose  of the Constitution or for  its  inability  to
discharge its basic constitutional duties and functions	 due
to  political or economic crises which have led to  complete
paralysing of the State Administration.
</p><p id="p_235">158. The  federal character of the Constitution	 carries  by
its  implication an obligation to exercise the	power  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_308">Article	 356</a>  only when there is a total  breakdown  of	 the
administration	of the State.  In interpreting	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_309">Article	 356</a>
the   court  should  keep  in  view  the   legislative	 and
constitutional	history	 of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_310">Article  356</a>  and  corresponding
provisions  of Government of India Act, 1935.  The  exercise
of the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_311">Article 356</a> impinges upon federalism	 and
visits with great political consequences.  Therefore,  court
should	exercise the power of judicial review and  interdict
and  restrict  wide scope of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_312">Article  356.</a>	 The
scope  of  judicial review would be on the same	 or  similar
grounds	 on  which  the executive action  of  the  State  is
challengeable  under  constitutional or	 administrative	 law
principles  evolved  by this Court,  namely,  non-compliance
with  the  requirements of natural  justice,  irrational  or
arbitrary, perverse, irrelevant to the purpose or extraneous
grounds	 weighed with the President, misdirection in law  or
mala fide or colourable exercise of power, on all or some of
the  principles.   The petitioner has to satisfy  the  Court
only  prima facie that the Proclamation is vitiated  by	 any
one  or some of the above grounds and burden then shifts  on
the  Council  of  Ministers  to satisfy	 the  Court  of	 the
legality  and  validity	 of  the  Presidential	Proclamation
issued under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_313">Article 356.</a>  The prohibition of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_314">Article  74(2)</a>
has  to	 be understood and interpreted in  that	 background.
The legal immunity under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_315">Article 74(2)</a> must be distinguished
from  the actions done by the President in discharge of	 his
administrative	functions under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_316">Article 356.</a>  The  Executive
cannot	seek shelter under "or other information"  mentioned
in  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_317">Article 356(1)</a> as an embargo under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_318">Article 361</a> to  state
reasons	 or  as a shield to disclose all  the  materials  in
their  custody	preventing the court  to  exercise  judicial
review.	  Only	the  actual advice or  part  of	 the  advice
tendered by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">153</span>
Minister  or Council of Ministers alone would be beyond	 the
ken  and  scrutiny of judicial review.	 The  administrative
decision  taken	 by  the Council of  Ministers	is  entirely
different from the advice tendered to the President, and the
latter cannot be equated with the grounds or the reasons for
Presidential  Proclamation.  The former are not part of	 the
advice	 tendered  to  the  President  by  the	Council	  of
Ministers.
</p><p id="p_236">159.  Shri  Shanti  Bhushan  learned  Senior  Counsel  while
adopting  the above contentions argued that the exercise  of
the  power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_319">Article 356</a> must be regarded  as  arbitrary
when  there was no constitutional breakdown.  Every  act  of
the State Government cannot be regarded as violation of	 the
provisions of the Constitution or constitutional  breakdown.
The  power  under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_320">Article 356</a> must be  exercised  only	when
there  was actual breakdown of the constitutional  machinery
and  not  mere	opinion in that behalf	of  the	 Council  of
Ministers.   The  Government, to justify  its  action,	must
place all relevant materials before the court and only	when
court is satisfied that the cases relate to actual breakdown
of   the   constitutional  machinery  in  the	State,	 the
Proclamation  may be upheld.  The burden of proof is  always
on  the Government to establish the validity or legality  of
the  Proclamation  issued  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_321">Article  356.</a>	  Shri	 Ram
Jethmalani tracing historical evidence from the debates that
took  place  on	 the  floor  of	 the  Constituent  Assembly,
contended that the keywords for construction are "cannot  be
carried	 on" and "failure of machinery".  The provisions  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_322">Article	 356</a> would be strictly construed so as	to  preserve
the  federal character of the Constitution.  The State is  a
sovereign  and	autonomous  entity  in	its  own  field	 and
intervention  by the Centre would be permissible  only	when
there  is no other way for the Centre to perform its  duties
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_323">Article	356.</a>  It cannot be invoked for the  sake  of
good governance of the State or to prevent misgovernance  of
the  State.  The words "cannot be carried on" are not to  be
confused with, and are vitally different from the words	 "is
not being carried on".	The significance of the keyword gets
accentuation from the marginal note of the article  "failure
of the constitutional machinery" and the legislative history
of  Sections 45 and 93 of the Government of India Act,	1935
must be kept in view for proper construction of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_324">Article 356.</a>
According  to  the  learned counsel, <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_325">Article  356</a>  gives  an
indication  that extreme step of Proclamation under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_326">Article
356</a>   could   be  invoked  sparingly  only  when   all	 the
alternatives are exhausted.  Secularism part of the preamble
is  not	 a  part  of the  Constitution	and  religion  is  a
fundamental  right  to	every  citizen	who  composes  of  a
political  party.   The	 election  law	prohibits   election
prospects  on  religious grounds if  the  other	 candidate's
religion  is  attacked.	  It  cannot  be  tested  on   vague
secularism  nor	 be  buttressed	 into  religious  right	  in
particular  to	a  political party.  There  is	no  pleading
founded	 by  factual base in these cases that BJP  had	used
Hindutva as a ground, or criticised lslamic faith.  It	used
in its manifesto the need for construction of Sri Ram Temple
at  his	 birthplace by demolishing Babri  Masjid  with	most
respectful and dignified language.  Even otherwise  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_327">Sections
29-A</a>  and <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_328">123</a>(3-A) of R.P. Act are ultra vires	<a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_329">Article	 25.</a>
The  consistent view of this Court that corrupt practice  on
grounds of religion is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">154</span>
only  of the other candidate and not of the petitioner	much
more  so to a political party.	Shri K.	 Parasaran,  learned
Senior	Counsel	 for the Union and Shri	 P.P.  Rao,  learned
counsel	 for  the  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  refuted	 the
contentions.
</p><p id="p_237">160. The crux of the question is the width of the presidents
power  under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_330">Article 356.</a>  It finds its birth from a  family
of  Emergency Provisions in Part XVIII of the  Constitution.
<a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_331">Article	 355</a>  imposes duty on the Union	 to  protect  States
against external aggression and internal disturbance and  to
ensure	that the Government of every State is carried on  in
accordance  with the provisions of the Constitution.   As  a
corollary  when	 the Government of the State  is  not  being
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution,  a constitutional duty and  responsibility  is
put on the Union to set it right.  The foundational  factual
matrix is the report of the Governor or other information in
possession  of	the  Union received  otherwise	to  reach  a
satisfaction   that   a	 situation  has	  arisen   for	 the
intervention by the Union of India.  Then comes the exercise
of  the	 power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_332">Article 356</a> by the President.   On	 the
receipt	 of  a	report	from the  Governor  of	a  State  or
otherwise  if the President (the Council of  Ministers	with
Prime  Minister as its head) is satisfied that	a  situation
has  arisen  in which the Government of a  State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution, the President may by Proclamation: (a)  assume
to himself all or any of the functions of the Government  of
a State and all or any of the powers vested in or  exercised
by the Governor or any body or authority in the State  other
than  the  Legislature of the State; (b)  declare  that	 the
powers of the Legislature of the State shall be	 exercisable
by  or	under  the authority of Parliament;  (c)  make	such
incidental  or	consequential provisions as  appear  to	 the
President to be necessary or desirable for giving effect  to
the  objects  of the Proclamation including  provisions	 for
suspending  in	whole  or  in  part  the  operation  of	 any
provisions  of	the  Constitution relating to  any  body  or
authority  in  the State.  By operation of  the	 proviso  to
clause (1) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_333">Article 356</a>, the President shall not assume to
himself any of the powers vested in or exercisable by a High
Court or to suspend in whole or in part the operation of any
provisions of the Constitution relating to High Courts.
</p><p id="p_238">161. Clause  (2)  of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_334">Article 356</a>  controls  the	 President's
exercise  of  power, if the Proclamation is not	 revoked  or
varied	by  a subsequent Proclamation, in other	 words,	 the
President,  through the Council of Ministers has been  given
full  play  to	reconsider the question and  may  revoke  it
before Parliament's approval is sought.	 It shall remain  in
operation  for	a period of two months unless it  is  either
revoked	 by another Proclamation or approved by	 Parliament.
Clause	(3)  guarantees built-in check and  control  on	 the
exercise   of	the  power.   It   postulates	that   every
Proclamation  issued under clause (1) shall be	laid  before
each  House  of Parliament and shall, except where it  is  a
Proclamation  revoking	a previous  Proclamation,  cease  to
operate	 at the expiration of two months unless	 before	 the
expiration  of	that  period  it  has  been  approved  by  a
resolution  of both Houses of Parliament.  In  other  words,
the duration of the operation of the Proclamation issued  by
the President was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">155</span>
limited	 only  for a period of two months from the  date  of
issue of such Proclamation.
</p><p id="p_239">162.  Unless it is revoked or disapproved by  Parliament  in
the   meanwhile,   it  casts  an  obligation  to   lay	 the
Proclamation  on the floor of both Houses of  Parliament  in
accordance  with the provisions of the Constitution and	 the
business  rules.  This clearly meant that it was to  operate
up  to	the time of two months and when it was in  force  it
carries with it its necessary implication that all acts done
or  actions taken under the Proclamation during	 the  period
are legal and valid.
</p><p id="p_240">163. Under  the proviso to clause (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_335">Article 356</a> if	 any
such  Proclamation  not	 being	a  Proclamation	 revoking  a
previous  Proclamation	is issued at a time  when  House  of
People	is  dissolved  or the dissolution of  the  House  of
People takes place during the period of two months  referred
to  in	the  clause  and  if  a	 resolution  approving	 the
Proclamation has been passed by the Council of States but no
resolution with respect to such Proclamation has been passed
by the House of People before the expiry of that period, the
Proclamation shall cease to operate at the expiration of  30
days  from the date on which the House of People first	sits
after its reconstitution unless before the expiration of the
said   period  of  30  days  a	resolution   approving	 the
Proclamation has been also passed by the House of People.
</p><p id="p_241">164. By	  operation   of  clause  (4)  of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_336">Article   356</a>   a
Proclamation so approved under proviso to clause (3)  shall,
unless	revoked,  cease to operate on the  expiration  of  a
period of six months from the date of issue of	Proclamation
provided that if and so often as a resolution approving	 the
continuance in force of such Proclamation is passed by	both
Houses of Parliament, the Proclamation shall unless  revoked
continue  in force for a further period of six	months	from
the date on which it would otherwise have ceased to  operate
and  no such Proclamation shall in any case remain in  force
for  more  than one year with second approval.	 The  second
proviso	 adumbrates that if the resolution of the  House  of
People takes place during any such period of six months	 and
a  resolution  approving the continuance in  force  of	such
Proclamation has been passed by the Council of States but no
resolution with respect to the continuance in force of	such
Proclamation  has been passed by the House of People  during
the said date the Proclamation shall cease to operate at the
expiration  of 30 days from the date on which the  House  of
People first sits after the reconstitution unless before the
expiration  of	the  said period of  30	 days  a  resolution
approving the continuance in force of the Proclamation	have
also been passed by the House of People.  The third  proviso
is  not	 material  for	the purpose  of	 this  case.   Hence
omitted.    Under   clause  (5)	 for  continuance   of	 the
Proclamation beyond one year and not more than three  years,
two conditions are necessary i.e. (i) existence of emergency
issued	under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_337">Article 352</a> in the whole of India or whole  or
part of the State at the time of passing the resolution	 and

social, economic and cultural advancement of its people	 and
to  create  fraternity	among the people.  <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_341">Article  1</a>  is  a
recognition of the history that Union of India's territorial

under  <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_343">Article 143(1)</a> of the Constitution of India, in	re3l
Gajendragadkar, J. speaking for eight-judge Bench held	that
: (SCR p. 285)
	      "Unlike  other  federations,  the	  Federation
	      embodied in the said Act was not the result of
	      a	  pact	 or  union  between   separate	 and
	      independent  communities	of States  who	came
	      together	for  certain  common  purposes	 and
	      surrendered a part of their sovereignty.	 The
	      constituent  units  of  the  federation	were
	      deliberately  created  and it  is	 significant
	      that   they,   unlike  the  units	  of   other
	      federations, had no organic roots in the past.
	      Hence, in the Indian Constitution, by contrast
	      with other Federal Constitutions, the emphasis
	      on   the	preservation  of   the	 territorial
	      integrity of the constituent States is absent.
	      The  makers of the Constitution were aware  of
	      the  peculiar conditions under which, and	 the
	      reasons  for  which,  the	 States	 (originally
	      Provinces)  were formed and  their  boundaries
	      were defined, and so they deliberately adopted
	      the  provisions  in <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_344">Article 3</a> with a  view  to
	      meet the possibility of the redistribution  of
	      the said territories after the integration  of
	      the  Indian States.  In fact it is  well-known
	      that as a result of the <a href="/doc/1211891/" id="a_345">States  Reorganisation

</p><p id="p_248">168. The  Constitution decentralises the governance  of	 the
States	 by   a	 four  tier  administration   i.e.   Central
Government,    State	Government,    Union	Territories,
Municipalities	and  Panchayats.  See the  Constitution	 for
Municipalities	and  Panchayats : Part IX  (Panchayats)	 and
Part   IX-A   (Municipalities)	 introduced   through	 the
Constitution   73rd  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_346">Amendment	Act</a>,  making  the   peoples'
participation  in  the democratic  process  from  grass-root
level a reality.  Participation of the people in  governance
of the State is sine qua non of functional democracy.  Their
surrender  of  rights  to  be governed	is  to	have  direct
encounter    in	  electoral   process	to   choose    their
representatives for resolution of common problems and social
welfare.    Needless  interference  in	self-governance	  is
betrayal of their faith to fulfil self-governance and  their
democratic  aspirations.   The	constitutional	culture	 and
political  morality  based on healthy  conventions  are	 the
fruitful  soil	to nurture and for sustained growth  of	 the
federal	 institutions set down by the Constitution.  In	 the
context	 of the Indian Constitution federalism is not  based
on  any	 agreement  between  federating	 units	but  one  of
integrated whole as pleaded with vision by Dr B.R.  Ambedkar
on  the	 floor	of  the Constituent  Assembly  at  the	very
inception of the deliberations and the Constituent  Assembly
unanimously  approved the resolution of	 federal  structure.
He  poignantly projected the pitfalls flowing from the	word
"federation".
</p><p id="p_249">169. The  federal State is a political convenience  intended
to  reconcile  national unity and integrity and	 power	with
maintenance  of	 the  State's right.  The  end	aim  of	 the
essential character of the Indian federalism is to place the
nation	as a whole under control of a  national	 Government,
while  the  States are allowed to exercise  their  sovereign
power within their legislative and coextensive executive and
administrative sphere.	The common interest is shared by the
Centre and the local interests are controlled by the States.
The  distribution  of the legislative  and  executive  power
within	limits and coordinate authority of different  organs
are  delineated in the organic law of the land,	 namely	 the
Constitution itself.  The essence of federalism,  therefore,
is  distribution  of  the  power  of  the  State  among	 its
coordinate bodies.  Each is
1 (1964) 1 SCR 37 1: AIR 1963 SC 1241
32 (1977) 4 SCC 608
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">158</span>
organised and controlled by the Constitution.  The  division
of power between the Union and the States is made in such  a
way   that   whatever  has  been  the	power	distributed,
legislative  and executive, be exercised by  the  respective
units making each a sovereign in its sphere and the rule  of
law requires that there should be a responsible	 Government.
Thus  the  State  is a federal status.	The  State  qua	 the
Centre	has  quasi-federal unit.  In the language  of  Prof.
K.C. Wheare in his Federal Government, 1963 Edn. at page  12
to ascertain the federal character, the important point	 is,
"whether  the powers of the Government are  divided  between
coordinate  independent authorities or not", and at page  33
he   stated   that  "the  systems   of	 Government   embody
predominantly  on  division  of powers	between	 Centre	 and
regional  authority  each  of which in	its  own  sphere  is
coordinating with the other independent as of them,    and
if so is that Government federal?"
</p><p id="p_250">170. Salmond in his Jurisprudence, 9th Edn. brought out	 the
distinction between unitary  type of Government and  federal
form  of Government. According to him a unitary or a  simple
State  is one which is not made up of territorial  divisions
which are States themselves.  A composite State on the other
hand  is  one  which  is itself an  aggregate  or  group  of
constituent States.  Such composite States can be called  as
imperial, federal or confederate.  The Constitution of India
itself	provided the amendments to territorial	limits	from
which	we  discern  that  the	federal	 structure  is	 not
obliterated  but regrouped with distribution of	 legislative
powers and their scope as well as the coextensive  executive
and  administrative  powers  of the Union  and	the  States.
Articles  245 to 255 of the Constitution deal with  relative
power  of  the	Union and the State  Legislature  read	with
Schedule  VII of the Constitution and the entries in List  1
preserved exclusively to Parliament to make law and List  II
confines  solely  to  the State	 Legislature  and  List	 III
Concurrent  List in which both Parliament as well the  State
Legislature have concurrent jurisdiction to make law in	 the
occupied  field,  with	predominance  to  the  law  made  by
Parliament, by operation of proviso to clause (2) of Article
</p><p id="p_251">254.   <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_347">Article	248</a>,  gives  residuary	legislative   powers
exclusively  to Parliament to make any law with	 respect  to
any  matters  not enumerated in the Concurrent List  or	 the
State  List  including	making any law imposing	 a  tax	 not
mentioned in either of those lists.  The relative importance
of  entries  in the respective lists to the  VIIth  Schedule
assigned  to Parliament or a State Legislature	are  neither
relevant nor decisive though contended by Shri K. Parasaran.
Indian federalism is in contradistinction to the  federalism
prevalent in USA, Australia and Canada.
</p><p id="p_252">171. In	 regard	 to  distribution of  executive	 powers	 the
Constitution  itself made demarcation between the Union	 and
the States.  <a href="/doc/1584119/" id="a_348">Article 73(1)</a> read with proviso and <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_349">Article 162</a>
read with proviso bring out this demarcation.  The executive
power of the Union and the State are coextensive with  their
legislative powers.  However, during the period of emergency
Articles  352  and 250 envisaged  certain  contingencies  in
which  the executive power of the State concerned  would  be
divested and taken over by the Union of India
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">159</span>
which  would  last up to a period of 6	months,	 after	that

Articles  268 and 269 enjoin the Union to  render  financial

Union  to  depend  on the States to enforce  the  Union	 law
within States concerned.  The composition of Rajya Sabha  as

and the States make the Constitution a quasi-federal.
</p><p id="p_255">174.  As earlier stated the organic federalism	designed  by
the  founding Fathers is to suit the parliamentary  form  of
Government to suit the Indian conditions with the  objective
of promoting mutuality and common purpose rendering  social,
economic  and  political  justice, equality  of	 status	 and
opportunity;   dignity	of  person  to	all   its   citizens
transcending  regional, religious, sectional  or  linguistic
barriers as complimentary units in working the	Constitution
without	 confrontation.	  Institutional mechanism  aimed  to
avoid  friction	 to promote harmony, to	 set  constitutional
culture	 on firm foothold for successful functioning of	 the
democratic  institutions, to bring about matching  political
culture	 adjustment  and distribution of the  roles  in	 the
operational mechanism are necessary for national integration
and  transformation  of stagnant social order  into  vibrant
egalitarian   social  order  with  change   and	  continuity
economically, socially and culturally.	<a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_366">In the State of W.B.
v. Union of India</a>', this Court laid emphasis that the  basis
of  distribution of powers between Union and the  States  is
that  only those powers and authorities which are  concerned
with  the  regulation of local problems are  vested  in	 the
State  and those which tend to maintain the economic  nature
and  commerce, unity of the nation are left with the  Union.
<a href="/doc/366070/" id="a_367">In Shamsher Singh v. Union of India</a> 22 this Court held	that
parliamentary	system	of  quasi-federalism  was   accepted
rejecting the substance of Presidential style of  Executive.
Dr Ambedkar stated on the floor of the Constituent  Assembly
that  the Constitution is, "both unitary as well as  federal
according to the requirement of time and circumstances".  He
also  further stated that the Centre would work	 for  common
good  and  for general interest of the country	as  a  whole
while  the States work for local interest.  He also  refuted
the  plea  for exclusive autonomy of the States.   It  would
thus  appear that the overwhelming opinion of  the  Founding
Fathers and the law of the land is to preserve the unity and
territorial integrity of the nation and entrusted the common
wheel  (sic  weal)  to	the  Union  insulating	from  future
divisive forces or local zealots with disintegrating  India.
It  neither  leaned  heavily in favour of  wider  powers  in
favour	of  the	 Union while  maintaining  to  preserve	 the
federal	 character of the States which are an integral	part
of  the	 Union.	 The Constitution being	 permanent  and	 not

</p><p id="p_256">		    ROLE OF THE GOVERNOR
</p><p id="p_257">175. The  key  actor in the Centre-State  relations  is	 the
Governor,  a  bridge between the Union and the	State.	 The
Founding Fathers deliberately avoided election to the office
of  the	 Governor,  as is in vogue in USA  to  insulate	 the
office	from linguistic chauvinism.  The President has	been
empowered  to  appoint him as executive head  of  the  State
under  <a href="/doc/686327/" id="a_368">Article	155</a> in Part VI, Chapter 11.   The  executive
power  of  the	State is vested in him by  <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_369">Article  154</a>	 and
exercised  by him with the aid and advice of the Council  of
Ministers,  the Chief Minister as its head.   Under  <a href="/doc/586056/" id="a_370">Article
159</a> the Governor shall discharge his functions in accordance
with  the oath "to protect and defend the  Constitution	 and
the  law".   The  office  of  the  Governor,  therefore,  is
intended   to  ensure  protection  and	sustenance  of	 the
constitutional process of the working of the Constitution by
the elected executive and gives him an umpire's role.	When
a  Gandhian  economist member of  the  Constituent  Assembly
wrote a letter to Gandhiji of his plea for abolition of	 the
Office	of  the	 Governor, Gandhiji wrote  to  him  for	 its
retention, thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_80">	      "The Governor had been given a very useful and
	      necessary place in the scheme of the team.  He
	      would   be  an  arbiter  when  there   was   a
	      constitutional  deadlock in the State  and  he
	      would  be	 able  to play	an  impartial  role.
	      There   would  be	  administrative   mechanism
	      through which the constitutional crises  would
	      be resolved in the State."
</blockquote><p id="p_258">The  Governor  thus should play an important role.   In	 his
dual  undivided	 capacity as a head of the State  he  should
impartially assist the President.  As a constitutional	head
of the State Government in times of constitutional crisis he
should	bring about sobriety.  The link is apparent when  we
find  that <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_371">Article 356</a> would be put into operation  normally
based  on Governor's report.  He should truthfully and	with
high  degree of constitutional responsibility, in  terms  of
oath,  inform the President that a situation has  arisen  in
which  the constitutional machinery in the State has  failed
and  the  Government  of  State	 cannot	 be  carried  on  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the	 Constitution,	with
necessary detailed factual foundation.	The report  normally
is   the  foundation  to  reach	 the  satisfaction  by	 the
President.   So	 it must furnish material with	clarity	 for
later fruitful discussion by Parliament. When challenged  in
a   constitutional   court  it	gives	insight	  into	 the
satisfaction  reached  by  the	President.   The   Governor,
therefore,  owes constitutional duty and  responsibility  in
sending	 the  report with necessary fectual details  and  it
does  require  the  approval of the  Council  of  Ministers;
equally not with their aid and advice.
</p><p id="p_259">		  DEMOCRACY AND SECULARISM
</p><p id="p_260">176. Democracy stands for freedom of conscience and  belief,
tolerance and mutual respect.  India being a plural  society
with  multi-religious  faiths, diverse	creeds,	 castes	 and
cultures, secularism is the bastion to build
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">162</span>
fraternity   and  amity	 with  dignity	of  person  as	 its
constitutional policy.	It allows diverse faiths to flourish
and make it a norm for tolerance and mutual respect  between
various	 sections of the people and to integrate  them	with
dignity	 and fulfilment of cravings for self-realisation  of
religious belief with larger national loyalty and  progress.
Rule  of  law has been chosen as an  instrument	 for  social
adjustment  in the event of clash of interests.	 In  a	free
society,  law  interacts  between  competing  claims  in   a
continuing  process to establish order with stability.	 Law
should not only reflect social and religious resilience	 but
has  also to provide a lead by holding forth the  norms	 for
continuity   for   its	orderly	 march	towards	  an   ideal
egalitarian  social order envisioned in the preamble of	 the
Constitution.	The  culture  of  the  law,  in	 the  Indian
Democratic Republic should be on secular lines.	 A  balance,
therefore, has to be struck to ensure an atmosphere of	full
faith  and  confidence.	 Charles Broadlaugh  in	 seventeenth
century	 for the first time used secularism as	antagonistic
to religious dogma as ethical and moral binding force.	This
Western	 thought,  in  course  of  time	 gained	  humanistic
acceptance.    The   word  secularism  defined	 in   Oxford
Dictionary  means that "morality should be based  solely  in
regard to the well-being of the mankind in the present	life
to the exclusion of all considerations drawn from the belief
in  God	 or a future study".   In  Encyclopaedia  Britannica
secularism is defined as "branch of totalitarian ethics,  it
is for the physical, moral and social improvement of mankind
which  neither	affirms	 nor  denies  theistic	problems  of
religion".   Prof.   Goethinysem of  the  Berlin  University
writing	 on  secularism in the Encyclopaedia of	 the  Social
Sciences (1939 Edn.) defined it as "the attempt to establish
autonomous  sphere  of	knowledge  purged  of  supernatural,
fideistic   presuppositions".	He  described  it,  in	 its
philosophical  aspect, "as a revolt against theological	 and
eventually  against metaphysical absolutes and	universals".
He  pointed out that "the same trend may be charted  out  in
the attitudes towards social and political institutions", so
that  men in general broke away from their  dependence	upon
the Church which was regarded as the guardian of an  eternal
welfare which included that in this world as well as that in
the next, and, therefore, was considered entitled to primacy
or   supremacy	over  transient	 secular  authorities.	  He
indicated  how this movement expanded in the second half  of
the  eighteenth	 century, into a  secularised  universalism,
described  as  "Enlightenment", which conceived	 of  man  on
earth as the source of all really significant and verifiable
knowledge and light.  It was increasingly realised that	 man
depended  for  his  welfare  in	 this  world  upon  his	 own
scientific  knowledge and wisdom and their applications	 and
upon a socioeconomic system of which, willy-nilly, he  found
himself a part.	 He had, therefore, argued that the man	 has
to  take the responsibility for and bear the consequence  of
his  own follies and inequities and not look upon them as  a
part of some inscrutable design of external powers or beings
controlling  his  destiny.  G.L. Holyoake, an  associate  of
Charles	 Broadlaugh in his Principles of Secularism in	1859
advocated   for	 secularism  which  received  approval	 and
acceptance  by celebrated political philosopher	 J.S.  Mill.
Jeremy Bentham's The 'Theory of Legislation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">163</span>
formulated  in the eighteenth century stands on	 moral-based
politics  and  defined law from the point of view  of  human
welfare	 sought	 through  democratic  liberal  channels	 and
intended  to attain "the greatest happiness of the  greatest
number",  a maxim dear to democratic  utilitarian  political
philosophers.
</p><p id="p_261">177. Secularism became the means and consciously pursued for
full  practical	 necessities of human life to  liberate	 the
human  spirit  from bondage, ignorance,	 superstition  which
have  held  back  humanity.  The  goal	of  every  civilised
democratic society is the maximisation of human welfare	 and
happiness   which   would  be  best  served   by   a   happy
Organisation.
</p><p id="p_262">178. Freedom  of faith and religion is an integral  part  of
social structure.  Such freedom is not a bounty of the State
but  constitutes the very foundation on which the  State  is
erected.  Human liberty sometimes means to satisfy the human
needs in one's own way.	 Freedom of religion is imparted  in
every  free  society  because it is a part  of	the  general
structure  of  the liberty in such a  society  and  secondly
because	 restrictions  imposed by one religion would  be  an
obstacle  for  others.	In the past religious  beliefs	have
become	 battlegrounds	 for  power  and  root	 cause	 for
suppression  of	 liberty.   Religion has  often	 provided  a
pretext to have control over vast majority of the members of
the  society.	Democratic  society realises  folly  of	 the
vigour of religious practices in society.  Strong  religious
consciousness  not only narrows the vision but hampers	rule
of   law.   The	 Founding  Fathers  of	 the   Constitution,
therefore,  gave unto themselves "we people of	India",	 the
Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State  Policy
to establish an egalitarian social order for all sections of
the  society in the supreme law of the land itself.   Though
the  concept  of "secularism" was  not	expressly  engrafted
while  making  the Constitution, its  sweep,  operation	 and
visibility   are  apparent  from  fundamental	rights	 and
directive  principles and their related provisions.  It	 was
made  explicit by amending the preamble of the	Constitution
42nd  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_372">Amendment	 Act</a>.  The concept of  secularism  of  which
religious  freedom is the foremost appears to visualise	 not
only of the subject of God but also an understanding between
man and man.  Secularism in the Constitution is not anti-God
and it is sometimes believed to be a stay in a free society.
Matters which are purely religious are left personal to	 the
individual and the secular part is taken charge by the State
on  grounds of public interest, order and  general  welfare.
The  State  guarantee  individual  and	corporate  religious
freedom and dealt with an individual as citizen irrespective
of  his faith and religious belief and does not promote	 any
particular  religion nor prefers one against  another.	 The
concept	 of the secular State is, therefore,  essential	 for
successful  working  of the democratic form  of	 Government.
There can be no democracy if anti-secular forces are allowed
to  work  dividing followers of	 different  religious  faith
flying	at  each other's throats.   The	 secular  Government
should	negate the attempt and bring order in  the  society.
Religion  in the positive sense, is an active instrument  to
allow the citizen full development of his person, not merely
in  the	 physical and material but in the  non-material	 and
non-secular life.

<p id="p_263">179.   Prof.   Goethinysem  in	his  article   referred	  to
hereinbefore outlined the process of secularism of life	 and
thoughts by which religious sectarianism comes into  contact
in  daily  social  and	economic  spheres  of  life  and  he
summarises  with  "the ideal of human and  social  happiness
through	 secularisation of life all the groups of people  in
the   country  striving	 by  most  enlightened	methods	  to
establish  the maximum of social justice and welfare in	 the
world".	  According  to	 Pt.   Jawaharlal  Nehru   democracy
necessarily  implies rigorous self-discipline without  which
democracy cannot succeed.  Swami Vivekananda explaining	 the
Vedantic  ideas	 of  God and  religion	in  comparison	with
western	 thoughts  stated  that the  religious	attitude  is
always	to seek the dignity inside his ownself as a  natural
characteristic	of Hindu religion and religious attitude  is
always	presented  by  making the  subject  close  his	eyes
looking	 inward.   Dr Thouless in his  Introduction  to	 the
Psychology of Religion after analysing diverse elements	 and
definitions   of  religion  defined  religion  as  "a	felt
practical relationship with what is believed in a superhuman
being or beings".  The process of secularisation of life and
thought	  consistently	 increasing   the   withdrawal	 and
separation of religion properly so-called from other spheres
of  life and thought which are governed by independent	from
above  rules and standards.  According to Sir James  Freezer
in his Golden Bough religion consists largely of not only of
methodological	and rituals dominated by all aspects of	 his
life, social, economic, political, legal, cultural,  ethical
or  moral,  but	 also  technological.	The  interaction  of
religion  and  secular factors in ultimate  analysis  is  to
expose the abuses of religion and of belief in God by purely
partisan,  narrow  or  for  selfish  purpose  to  serve	 the
economic  or  political interests of a particular  class  or
group  or  a  country.	The progress  of  human	 history  is
replete	 with  full  misuse of	religious  notions  in	that
behalf.	   But	 the  scientific   and	 analytical   spirit
characterises  secularism as saviour of the people from	 the
dangers	 of supposed fusion of religion with  political	 and
economic activities and inspire the people.  The secularism,
therefore,  represents	faiths born out of the	exercise  of
rational faculties.  It enables people to see the imperative
requirements for human progress in all aspects and  cultural
and social advancement and indeed for human survival itself.
It  also not only improves the material conditions of  human
life,  but also liberates the human spirit from	 bondage  of
ignorance,  superstition, irrationality,  injustice,  fraud,
hypocrisy  and	oppressive exploitations.  In  other  words,
though	the  whole  course of  human  history  discloses  an
increasing liberation of mankind, accomplished thought,	 all
is  covered by the term secularism.  Trevor Ling's  writings
on Buddhism spoke of it as a secular religion, which teaches
eight-fold  path  of  his mastery and  virtuous	 conduct  of
ceaseless,  self-critical endeavour for right belief,  right
aspiration,  right  speech, right conduct,  right  modes  of
livelihood,   right  efforts,  right-mindedness	 and   right
scripture.    Buddhism	 rationalises	the   religion	 and
civilisation to liberate individual from blindfold adherence
to  religious belief to rationalisation, in the language  of
Trevor	Ling  "flat alluvial expansion of  secularism".	  Dr
Ambedkar believed that Buddhism is the religion best  suited
to the Indian
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">165</span>
soil.	Mahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, spoke for	 the
need of religion thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_81">	      ,,The  need  of  the mankind  is	not  one  of
	      religion, but mutual respect and tolerance  of
	      the devotees of different religions.  We	want
	      to  reach	 not  a data  level,  but  unity  in
	      diversity.  The soul of all religions is	one,
	      but  it is encased in the multitude of  forms.
	      The  latter  will persist to the	end  of	 the
	      time."
</blockquote><p id="p_264">180. Dr S. Radhakrishnan, the philosopher, former  President
of  India,  in	his  Discovery	of  Faith  stated  that	 the
religious  impartiality	 of the Indian State is	 not  to  be
confused  with	the secularism or  atheism.   Secularism  as
defined	 here is in accordance with the	 enormous  religious
traditions of India.  It is for living in harmony with	each
other.	 This  fellowship  is  based  on  the  principle  of
diversity  in  unity  which  alone  has	 all  qualities	  of
creativeness.	In  his foreword to Dr	Abid  Hussain's	 The
National Culture of India, Dr S. Radhakrishnan remarked that
secularism  does  not mean licence or a thrust	of  material
comfort.   It  lays thrust on universality  of	the  supreme
fellow	which  may be attained by variety of  ways.   Indian
concept	 of  secularism	 means	"the  equal  status  to	 all
religions".   He said that "no one religion should be  given
preferential  status or unique distinction and that  no	 one
religion  should be accorded special privileges in  national
life".	 That  would  be violative of  basic  principles  of
democracy.   No group of citizens can so arrogate to  itself
the  right  and	 privilege which it denies  to	others.	  No
person shall suffer any form of disability or discrimination
because	 of his religion, but also alike should be  free  to
share to the fullest degree in the common life.	 This is the
basic  principle  in separation of religion and	 the  State.
Granville   Austin   in	 his  The  Indian   Constitution   :
Cornerstone of a Nation stated that the Constitution  makers
intended to secure secular and socialist goals envisaged  in
the preamble of the Constitution.  <a href="/doc/382199/" id="a_373">In Ziyauddin	 Burhanuddin
Bukhari v. Brijmohan Ramdass Mehra</a> 33 this Court held that :
(SCR p. 297: SCC p. 32, para 44)
	      "The   Secular   State   rising	above	 all
	      differences  of religion, attempts  to  secure
	      the  good of all its citizens irrespective  of
	      their religious beliefs and practices.  It  is
	      neutral or impartial in extending its benefits
	      to   citizens  of	 all  castes   and   creeds.
</p><p id="p_265">	      Maitland had pointed out that such a state has

	      right  or the right or capacity to occupy	 any
	      office or position under it or to perform	 any
	      public duty connected with it does not  depend
	      upon   the  profession  or  practice  of	 any
	      particular religion."
</p><p id="p_266">	      It was further pointed out : (SCR p. 297:	 SCC
	      p. 32, para 45)
	      "Our   Constitution   and	 the   laws   framed
	      thereunder  leave	 citizens free to  work	 out
	      happy  and  harmonious  relationships  between
	      their   religions	 and  the  quite   separable
	      secular fields of law and politics.  But, they
	      do  not  permit an unjustifiable	invasion  of
	      what belongs to one sphere by what  appertains
	      really  to  another.   It	 is  for  courts  to
	      determine, in a case
	      33 (1976) 2 SCC 17: 1975 Supp SCR 281
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">	      166</span>
	      of dispute, whether any sphere was or was	 not
	      properly	interfered with, in accordance	with
	      the Constitution, even by a purported law."
Thereby	 this  Court did not accept the wall  of  separation
between	 law  and the religion with a  wider  camouflage  to
impress	 control  of  what  may	 be  described	exploitative
parading  under	 the  garb  of	religion.   Throughout	ages
endless	 stream	 of humans of diverse creeds,  cultures	 and
races have come to India from outside regions and climes and
contributed to the rich cultural diversity.  Hindu  religion
developed   resilience	to  accommodate	 and   imbibe	with
tolerance the cultural richness with religious	assimilation
and became a land of religious tolerance.
</p><p id="p_267">181. Swami Vivekanada stated that right of religious  system
and ideals is the same morality; one thing is only preached:
Myself, say "Om"; another one says "Johova", another "Allah-
ho-Mohammad",  another cries "Jesus".	Gandhiji  recognised
that  all  religions  are imperfect  and  because  they	 are
imperfect  they	 require perfecting themselves	rather	than
conducting individually.  He stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_82">	      "The   separate  religions  Hinduism,   Islam,
	      Christianity,  Buddhism are  different  rights
	      converging on the same point even as the	tree
	      has  the	single trunk but many  branches	 and
	      leaves so there is one perfect religion but it
	      becomes  many as it passes through  the  human
	      medium.	The Allah of Muslims is the same  as
	      the God of Christians and Ishwara of Hindus."
</blockquote><p id="p_268">182. Making   of   a  nation   State   involves	  increasing
secularisation of society and culture.	Secularism  operates
as a bridge to cross over from tradition to modernity.	 The
Indian State opted this path for universal tolerance due  to
its  historical and cultural background and  multi-religious
faiths.	 Secularism in the Indian context bears positive and
affirmative  emphasis.	Religions with secular	craving	 for
spiritual  tolerance have flourished more and  survived	 for
longer period in the human history than those who claimed to
live  in  a  non-existent  world  of  their  own.   Positive
secularism,   therefore,  separates  the   religious   faith
personal to man and limited to material, temporal aspects of
human  life.   Positive	 secularism believes  in  the  basic
values	of  freedom, equality and fellowship.  It  does	 not
believe	 in  hark  back either	into  country's	 history  or
seeking shelter in its spiritual or cultural identity dehors
the  man's need for his full development.  It  moves  mainly
around	the  State and its institution	and,  therefore,  is
political  in  nature.	At the same time religion  does	 not
include	 other socioeconomic or cultural  social  structure.
The  State  is enjoined to counteract the  evils  of  social
forces, maintaining internal peace and to defend the  nation
from   external	  aggression.	Welfare	 State	 under	 the
Constitution is enjoined to provide means for well-being  of
its  citizens; essential services and amenities to  all	 its
people.	  Morality under positive secularism is a  pervasive
force  in favour of human freedom or secular living.   Prof.
Holyoake,  as  stated earlier, who is the father  of  modern
secularism  stated that "morality should be based on  regard
for well-being of the mankind in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">167</span>
the  person,  to the exclusion of all  considerations  drawn
from the belief in God or a future State".  Morality to	 him
was a system of human duty commencing from man and not	from
God  as	 in  the case of  religion.   He  distinguished	 his
secularism  from  Christianity, the living interest  of	 the
world	that  is  prospects  of	 another   life.    Positive
secularism  gives birth to biological and social  nature  of
the man as a source of morality.  True religion must develop
into  a	 dynamic  force for integration	 without  which	 the
continued  existence  of  human	 race  itself  would  become
uncertain   and	 unreal.   Secularism  teaches	 spirit	  of
tolerance, catholicity of outlook, respect for each  other's
faith and willingness to abide by rules of  self-discipline.
This has to be for both as an individual and as a member  of
the  group.   Religion and secularism operate  at  different
planes.	 Religion is a matter of personal belief and mode of
worship	 and  prayer,  personal	 to  the  individual   while
secularism  operates,  as stated earlier,  on  the  temporal
aspect	of  the State activity in dealing  with	 the  people
professing  different religious faiths.	 The more devoted  a
person	in his religious belief, the greater should  be	 his
sense  of heart, spirit of tolerance, adherence	 of  secular
path.  Secularism, therefore, is not antithesis of religious
devoutness.   Swami Vivekananda, and Mahatma Gandhi,  though
greatest Hindus, their teachings and examples of lives	give
us  the message of the blend of religion and the  secularism
for  the good of all the men.  True religion does not  teach
to  hate  those	 professing other faiths.   Bigotry  is	 not
religion,  nor can narrow-minded favouritism be taken to  be
an index of one's loyalty to his religion.  Secularism	does
not   contemplate  closing  each  other's  voices   to	 the
sufferings   of	 the  people  of  other	 community  nor	  it
postulates  keeping  mum when his or  other  community	make
legitimate demands.  If any group of people are subjected to
hardship or sufferings, secularism always requires that	 one
should	never remain insensitive and aloof to  the  feelings
and sufferings of the victims.	At moments of testing  times
people rose above religion and protected the victims.	This
cultural  heritage  in	India  shaped  that  people  of	 all
religious  faiths, living in different parts of the  country
are to tolerate each other's religious faith or beliefs	 and
each religion made its contribution to enrich the  composite
Indian culture as a happy blend or synthesis.  Our religious
tolerance received reflections in our constitutional creed.

Freedom	 of  conscience	 allows	 a  person  to	believe	  in
particular  religious  tenets of his choice.   It  is  quite
distinct  from	the  freedom to	 perform  external  acts  in
pursuance  of  faith.  Freedom of conscience  means  that  a
person	cannot	be made answerable for rights  of  religion.
Undoubtedly,  it  means	 that no man possesses	a  right  to
dictate	 to  another  what religion  he	 believes  in;	what
philosophy  he	holds, what shall be his  politics  or	what
views he shall accept, etc.  <a href="/doc/86224/" id="a_391">Article 25(1)</a> protects  freedom

order,	 morality  and	health	which	includes   economic,
financial or other secular activities.	Could the  religious
practice  exercise  control over members to vote or  not  to
vote, to ignore the National Flag, National Anthem, national
institutions?	Freedom	 of  conscience	 under	<a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_392">Article	  25</a>
whether guarantees people of different religious faiths	 the
right  to religious procession to antagonise the  people  of
different  religious faiths or right to public worship?	  It
is  a  fact of social and religious history  in	 India	that
religious  processions are known to ignite serious  communal
riots,	disturb peace, tranquillity and public	order.	 The
right to free profession of religion and exercising right to
organise religious congregations does not carry with it	 the
right  to  make inflammatory speeches, nor be a	 licence  to
spread	violence,  nor	speak religious	 intolerance  as  an
aspect	of religious faiths.  They are subject to the  State
control.  In order to secure constitutional protection,	 the
religious practices should not only be an essential part but
should also be an integral part of proponent's religion	 but
subject	 to State's control.  Otherwise even purely  secular
practices which are not an essential or an integral part  of
religion are apt to be quoted as religious forms and make  a
claim  for being treated as religious practices.  Law  as  a
social engineer provides the means as well as lays down	 the
rules for social control and resolution of conflicts of	 all
kinds in a human society.  But the motive force for  social,
economic and cultural transformation comes from	 individuals
who comprise the society.  They are the movers in the  mould
of  the	 law  as  the principal	 instrument  of	 an  orderly
transient to a new socioeconomic order or social integration
and  fraternity	 among	the people.   The  Constitution	 has
chosen secularism as its vehicle to establish an egalitarian
social	order.	 I  am respectfully in	agreement  with	 our
Brethren  Sawant  and  Jeevan Reddy, JJ.  in  this  respect.
Secularism,  therefore, is part of the fundamental  law	 and
basic structure of the Indian political system to secure  to
all  its  people  socioeconomic needs  essential  for  man's
excellence  and of (sic his) moral wellbeing, fulfilment  of
material and prosperity and political justice.
SEPARATION OF POLITICS AND RELIGION
</p><p id="p_274">187. Black's  Law  Dictionary (6th Edn.) page  1158  defined
'political'  as pertaining or relating to the policy or	 the
administration of Government, State or national;  pertaining
to, or incidental to, the exercise of the functions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">171</span>
vested	in  those charged with the  conduct  of	 Government;
relating to the management of affairs of State as  political
theories;  of  or  pertaining  to  exercise  of	 rights	 and
privileges or the influence by which individuals of a  State
seek to determine or control its public policy; having to do
with  organization  or action of  individuals,	parties,  or
interests  that	 seek to control appointment  or  action  of
those  who manage affairs of a State.  Political  party	 was
defined	 as  an	 association of	 individuals  whose  primary
parliamentary	purposes  are  to  promote   or	  accomplish
elections  or appointments to public offices,  positions  or
jobs.  A political party, association or Organisation  which
makes  contributions  for  the	purpose	 of  influencing  or
attempting  to	influence  the	electoral  process  of	 any
individual  or political party whose name is  presented	 for
election  to  any  State or local  elective  public  office,
whether	 or  not such individual is  elected.	Politics  in
positively  secular State is to get over their religion,  in
other  words, in politics a political party  should  neither
invoke	religion  nor  be dependent on	it  for	 support  or
sustenance.   Constitution  ensures  to	 the  individual  to
protect	 religion,  right to belief or	propagate  teachings
conducive for secular living, later to be controlled by	 the
State  for betterment of human life and progress.   Positive
secularism  concerns with such aspects of human	 life.	 The
political conduct in his "Political Thought by Dr  Ambedkar"
compiled  by  R.K. Ksheersagar, Intellectual  Public  House,
1992 Edn. at page 155, stated that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_83">	      "In  India  the majority is  not	a  political
	      majority.	 The majority is born but not  made,
	      that  is	the difference	between	 a  communal
	      majority	 and   a  political   majority.	   A
	      political	 majority is not purely a  majority,
	      it  is  the  majority which  is  always  made,
	      unmade  and  remade.  A communal	majority  is
	      unalterable   majority  in  its  ethics,	 its
	      attitudes.    Whether   the   Hindu   communal
	      majority	was prepared to accept the views  of
	      the  minorities,	whether it was	prepared  to
	      conceive the constitutional safeguards to	 the
	      minorities."  The	 problems  according  to  Dr
	      Ambedkar	should be solved by  adopting  right
	      principles which should be evolved and applied
	      equally without fear or favour.  According  to
	      him  the	majority community should  accept  a
	      relative majority and it should claim absolute
	      majority.	   Communal   majority	is   not   a
	      political	  majority  and	 in   politics	 the
	      principle	 of  one vote one  value  should  be
	      adopted	   irrespective	     of	     related
	      considerations.  According to Abul Kalam Azad:
	      "India  is  a democracy  secular	where  every
	      citizen  whether he is Hindu, Muslim  or	Sikh
	      has  equal  rights and  privileges.   Rise  of
	      fundamentalism and communalisation in national
	      or regional politics are anti-secular and tend
	      to  encourage separatist and  divisive  forces
	      laying   the   seeds   to	  disintegrate	 the
	      parliamentary    democratic    system.	 The
	      political	 parties  or  candidates  should  be
	      stopped  from  running after  vote  banks	 and
	      judicial	process must promote  the  citizens'
	      active participation by interpretation of	 the
	      Constitution   and   the	 laws	in    proper
	      perspective   in	 order	 to   maintain	 the
	      democratic process on an even keel."

	      "In  our	opinion,  placing  such	  restricted

	      Courts have got to be very circumspect in such

democracy, like ours, mingling of religion with politics  is
unconstitutional,  in  other  words  a	flagrant  breach  of

therefore, imperative that the religion and caste should not

association or an individual and it is imperative to prevent
religious and caste pollution of politics.  Every  political

</p><p id="p_285">SCOPE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_406">ARTICLE 356</a>
</p><p id="p_286">198. In	 the judicial review in the field of  administrative
law and the constitutional law, the courts are not concerned
with  the  merits of the decision, but with  the  manner  in
which  the decision was taken or order was  made.   Judicial
review	is entirely different from an ordinary appeal.	 The
purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the  individual
is given fair treatment by the authority or the tribunal  to
which  he has been subjected to.  It is no part of the	duty
or power of the court to substitute its opinion for that  of
the  tribunal or authority or person constituted by  law  or
administrative	agency in deciding the matter  in  question.
Under the thin guise of preventing the abuse of power, there
is  a lurking suspicion that the court itself is  guilty  of
usurping  that power.  The duty of the court, therefore,  is
to confine itself to the question of legality, propriety  or
regularity  of	the  procedure adopted by  the	tribunal  or
authority to find whether it committed an error of law or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">176</span>
jurisdiction  in reaching the decision or making the  order.
The  judicial review is, therefore, a protection, but not  a
weapon.	  The  court  with an  avowed  endeavour  to  render
justice,  applied principles of natural justice with a	view
to see that the authority would act fairly.  Therefore,	 the
grounds	 of  illegality,  irrationality,   unreasonableness,
procedural impropriety and in some cases proportionality has
been applied, to test the validity of the decision or order,
apart	 from	 its   ultra   vires,	 mala	 fides	  or
unconstitutionality.   Initially in the process of  judicial
review	the court tested the functions from the	 purview  of
the  "source  of  power".  In the  course  of  evolution  of
judicial  review  it tested on the "nature of  the  subject-
matter",  "the nature of the power", "the purpose"  or	"the
indelible effect" of the order or decision on the individual
or  public.   The  public  element  was	 evolved,  confining
initially  judicial review to the actions of  State,  public
authority  or  instrumentality of the State but in  its	 due
course	many  a time it entrenched into	 private  law  field
where  public element or public duty or public	interest  is
created by private person or corporate person and  relegated
purely	private	 issues to private law remedy.	 This  Court
relaxed	  standing  in	favour	of  bona  fide	persons	  or
accredited  associations to espouse the cause on  behalf  of
the  underprivileged  or  handicapped  groups  of   persons.
Interpreting  Articles	14  and	 21,  tested  administrative
orders or actions or processes on grounds of  arbitrariness,
irrationality,	unfairness or unjustness, It would  thus  be
apparent  that in exercising the power of  judicial  review,
the    constitutional	courts	 in   India   testing	 the
constitutionality  of  an administrative  or  constitutional
acts did not adopt any rigid formula universally  applicable
to all occasions.  Therefore, it serves no useful purpose to
elaborately consider various decisions or textbooks referred
to  us during the course of hearing.  Suffice to state	that
each case should be considered, depending upon the authority
that  exercises the power, the source, the nature, or  scope
of  the	 power	and indelible effects it  generates  in	 the
operation  of  law  or affects	the  individual	 or  society
without	  laying  down	any  exhaustive	 or   catalogue	  of
principles.   Lest  it would itself result  in	standardised
rule.	To  determine  whether	a  particular  policy  or  a
decision  taken in furtherance thereof is in  fulfilment  of
that policy or is in accordance with the Constitution or the
law,  many  an	imponderable feature  will  come  into	play
including  the nature of the decision, the  relationship  of
those involved on either side before the decision was taken,
existence or nonexistence of the factual foundation on which
the decision was taken or the scope of the discretion of the
authority  or  the functionary.	 Supervision of	 the  court,
ultimately,  depends upon the analysis of the nature of	 the
consequences  of  the  decision	 and  yet  times  upon	 the
personality   of  the  authority  that	takes  decision	  or
individual circumstances in which the person was called upon
to make the decision and acted on the decision itself.

(Thirty-eighth)	  Amendment  Act,  1975	  which	  prohibited
judicial review of the Presidential Proclamation [which	 was
later  on  substituted by  the	Constitution  (Forty-fourth)
Amendment Act, 1978], was called into operation.  Before its
substitution  the constitutionality of the letter issued  by
the Home Minister and dissolution of the Assemblies of North
Indian	States	were  in  question.   The  reason  for	 the
dissolution   was  that	 the  Congress	Party	was   routed
completely  in	1977  parliamentary election  in  all  those
States	and  thereby the people's mandate  was	against	 the
legitimacy  of the Governments of the States represented  by
the Congress Party to remain in office.	 Suits under <a href="/doc/1325025/" id="a_409">Article
133</a>  and  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_410">Article  32</a> were filed in  this  Court.   In	that
context	 this  Court  held  that though	 the  power  of	 the
judicial  review was excluded by clause (5) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_411">Article	356</a>,
as  it	then  stood, judicial review  was  open	 on  limited
grounds, namely mala fides, wholly extraneous or  irrelevant
grounds	 without  nexus	 between  power	 exercised  and	 the
reasons	  in  support  thereof.	  The  contention  of	Shri
Parasaran, learned counsel for the Union, as stated earlier,
is  that though judicial review is available, he paused	 and
fell upon the operation of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_412">Article 74(2</a>), and contended that
the  Union of India need not produce the records; burden  is
on  the	 writ  petitioners  to prove  that  the	 orders	 are
unconstitutional  or ultra vires; the exercise of  power  by
the  President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_413">Article 356</a> is constitutional  exercise
of  the	 power	like one under <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_414">Article	123</a>  or	 legislative
process	  and  the  principles	evolved	 in  the  field	  of
administrative	law are inapplicable.  It should  be  tested
only  on the grounds of ultra vires or	unconstitutionality.
The  reasons in support of the satisfaction reached  by	 the
President are part of the advice tendered by the Council  of
Ministers.   Therefore,	 they  are  immuned  from   judicial
scrutiny,  though every order passed by the  President	does
not  receive the protection under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_415">Article 74(2)</a>	 or  <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_416">Section
123</a> of the Evidence Act.
</p><p id="p_288">200. The  question,  therefore,	 is what  is  the  scope  of
judicial  review  of  the  Presidential	 Proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_417">Article 356.</a>  Though the arm of the court is long enough  to
reach injustice wherever it finds and any order or action is
not beyond its ken, whether its reach could be projected  to
constitutional	extraordinary functionary of the  coordinate
branch	of  the Government, the highest executive,  when  it
records subjective satisfaction to issue Proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_418">Article 356.</a>  The contention of S/Shri Shanti Bhushan,	Soli
Sorabjee  and  Ram  Jethmalani that all	 the  principles  of
judicial   review  of  administrative  action  would   stand
attracted to the Presidential Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_419">Article 356</a>
cannot be accepted in toto.  Equally the wide proposition of
law  canvassed by Shri Parasaran is also untenable.  At	 the
cost  of repetition it is to reiterate that judicial  review
is  the basic feature of the Constitution.  This  Court	 has
constitutional	duty  and  responsibility,  since   judicial
review	 having	 been  expressly  entrusted  to	 it   as   a
constituent power, to review the acts done by the coordinate
branches,  the	executive  or  the  legislature	 under	 the
Constitution,  or under law or administrative orders  within
the  parameters applicable to a particular impugned  action.
This  Court has duty and responsibility to find	 the  extent
and limits of the power of the coordinate authorities and to
find the law.  It is the province and duty of this Court, as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">178</span>
ultimate  interpreter of the Constitution, to say  what	 the
law  is.  This is a delicate task assigned to the  Court  to
determine  what	 power Constitution has	 conferred  on	each
branch of the Government, whether it is limited to and if so
what  are the limits and whether any action of	that  branch
transgresses such limits.  The action of the President under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_420">Article	 356</a>  is a constitutional function and the  same  is
subject	 to  judicial review.  Shri T.R.  Andhyarujina,	 the
learned	 Advocate  General of  Maharashtra,  contended	that
though the Presidential Proclamation is amenable to judicial
review,	 it is in the thicket of political question  and  is
not    generally   justiciable.	    Applying	self-imposed
limitations this Court may be refrained to exercise judicial
review.	  This	contention  too needs to  be  qualified	 and
circumscribed.
</p><p id="p_289">201.	Judicial   review   must   be	 distinguish	from
justiciability.	 the two concepts are not  synonymous.	 The
power of judicial review goes to the authority of the court,
though in exercising the power of judicial review, the court
in an appropriate case may decline to exercise the power  as
being not justiciable.	The Constitution is both the  source
of power as well as it limits the power of an authority,  ex
necessitate.   Judiciary has to decide the  source,  extent,
limitations of the power and legitimacy in some cases of the
authority exercising the power.	 There are no hard and	fast
fixed  rules  as to justiciability of  a  controversy.	 The
satisfaction  of  the  President  under	 <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_421">Article  356(1)</a>  is
basically  subjective satisfaction based on the material  on
record.	   It	may  not  be   susceptible   to	  scientific
verification   hedged  with  several   imponderables.	 The
question, therefore, may be looked at from the point of view
of   common  sense  limitation,	 keeping  always  that	 the
Constitution   has  entrusted  the  power  to  the   highest
executive,  the	 President of India, to	 issue	Proclamation
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_422">Article 356</a>, with the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers, again further subject to his own discretion given
in  proviso to <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_423">Article 74(1).</a>  Whether the  question  raised
for  decision is judicially based on  manageable  standards?
The question relating to the extent, scope and power of	 the
President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_424">Article 356</a> though wrapped up with political
thicket,  per  se  it does not get  immunity  from  judicial
review.
</p><p id="p_290">202. However, a distinction be drawn between judicial review
of  the	 interpretation of the order or the  extent  of	 the
exercise  of the power by the President under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_425">Article	356.</a>
In the latter case the limits of the power of the  President
in issuing the Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_426">Article 356</a> and the limits
of  judicial  review  itself are to be kept  in	 view.	 The
question  of  justiciability would in either  case  mutually
arise  for decision.  In this behalf, the question would  be
whether the controversy is amenable to judicial review in  a
limited	 area but the latter depends upon the nature of	 the
order  and  its contents.  The question may  be	 camouflaged
with  a	 political  thicket,  yet  since  the	Constitution
entrusted   that  delicate  task  in  the  scheme   of	 the
Constitution  itself to this Court, in an appropriate  case,
the  court may unwrap the dressed up question, to  find	 the
validity  thereof.   The doctrine of  political	 thicket  is
founded	 on the theory of separation of powers	between	 the
executive,   the   legislature	and  the   judiciary.	 The
Constitution  of  the  United States  of  America,  gave  no
express power of judicial review to the Supreme Court of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">179</span>
USA.  Therefore, the scope of political question, when	came
up  for consideration in Baker v. Carr 42, it was held in  a
restricted sense, but the same was considerably watered down
in  later decision of that Court.  Vide Gilligan  v.  Morgan
43  . But in deciding the political question the court	must
keep   in  forefront  whether  the  court   has	  judicially
discoverable   and  manageable	standards  to	decide	 the
particular  controversy	 placed before it, keeping  in	view
that the subjective satisfaction was conferred in the widest
terms	to  a  coordinated  political  department,  by	 the
Constitution itself.
</p><p id="p_291">203. In the State of Rajasthan case 3 Chandrachud, J., as he
then was, held that: (SCR p. 61: SCC p. 644, para 131)
	      "Probing at any greater depth into the reasons
	      given by the Home Minister is to enter a field
	      from which Judges must scrupulously keep away.
	      The field is reserved for the politicians	 and
	      the courts must avoid trespassing into it."
Bhagwati,  J.,	as  he then was, speaking  for	himself	 and
Gupta, J., held that (SCR p. 82: SCC p. 662, para 150)
	      "It  is not a decision which can be  based  on
	      what  the Supreme Court of the  United  States
	      has described as 'judicially discoverable	 and
	      manageable standards'.  It would largely be  a
	      political	 judgment  based  on  assessment  of
	      diverse  and  varied  factors,  fast  changing
	      situations,  potential  consequences,   public
	      reaction,	  motivations	and   responses	  of
	      different	  classes   of	people	 and   their
	      anticipated  future  behaviour and a  host  of
	      other   considerations,	in  the	  light	  of
	      experience  of  public affairs  and  pragmatic
	      management   of  complex	and  often   curious
	      adjustments  that	 go to make  up	 the  highly
	      sophisticated mechanism of a modem  democratic
	      government.  It cannot, therefore, by its very
	      nature  be a fit subject-matter  for  judicial
	      determination  and  hence it is  left  to	 the
	      subjective   satisfaction	  of   the   Central
	      Government  which	 is best in  a	position  to
	      decide it."
</p><p id="p_292">	      Untwalia, J., laid down that: (SCR p. 94:	 SCC
	      p. 672, para 183)
	      "[E]ven  if one were to assume such a fact  in
	      favour  of the plaintiffs or  the	 petitioners
	      the  facts disclosed, undoubtedly, lie in	 the
	      field or an area purely of a political nature,
	      which  are  essentially  non-justiciable.	  It
	      would  be	 legitimate to characterise  such  a
	      field  as	 a prohibited area in  which  it  is
	      neither  permissible for the courts to  enter,
	      nor should they ever take upon themselves	 the
	      hazardous task of entering into such an area.
	      Fazal Ali, J. reiterating the same view  held,
	      that : (SCR p. II 5: SCC p. 689, para 208)
	      "It  is manifestly clear that the	 court	does
	      not  possess the resources which are  'In	 the

	      that they seek to subserve and the feelings or
	      the  aspirations of the nation that require  a
	      particular action to be taken at a  particular
	      time.  It is difficult for the court to embark
	      on an enquiry of that type."
</p><p id="p_293">	      Beg,  C.J. held that: (SCR p. 26: SCC p.	616,
	      para 39)
	      "Insofar as <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_427">article 356(1)</a> may embrace matters
	      of   political   and  executive	policy	 and
	      expediency, courts cannot interfere with these
	      unless   and   until   it	  is   shown	what
	      constitutional  provision	 the  President	  is
	      going to contravene......
</p><p id="p_294">204. We respectfully agree that the above approach would  be
the  proper  course  to tackle	the  problem.	Yet  another
question  to  be disposed of at this stage is the  scope  of
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_428">Article 74(2).</a>	In the cabinet system of the Government	 the
Council	 of  Ministers with the Prime Minister as  the	head
would aid and advise the President to exercise the functions
under the Constitution except where the power was  expressly
given  to the President to his individual  discretion.	 The
scope	thereof	 was  considered  vis-a-vis  the  claim	  of
privilege  under  <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_429">Section 123</a> of the Evidence Act.   At	 the
outset we say that <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_430">Section 123</a> of Evidence Act is  available
to the President to claim privilege.  <a href="/doc/1180101/" id="a_431">In R. K. Jain v. Union
of India</a>  44  in paragraph 23 at page 143 it was  held	that
the  President	exercises his executive	 power	through	 the
Council	 of  Ministers	as per the  rules  of  business	 for
convenient transaction of the Government business made under
<a href="/doc/1608494/" id="a_432">Article	 77(3).</a>	  The Government of  India  (Transaction  of
Business) Rules, 1961 provide the procedure in that  behalf.
After  discussing  the	scope  of  the	cabinet	 system	  of
Government  in	paragraphs  24 to 28 it was  held  that	 the
cabinet	 known as Council of Ministers headed by  the  Prime
Minister  is the driving and steering body  responsible	 for
the governance of the country.	They enjoy the confidence of
Parliament and remain in office so long as they maintain the
confidence   of	 the  majority.	  They	are  answerable	  to
Parliament  and	 accountable  to  the  people.	 They	bear
collective   responsibility.   Their   executive   functions
comprise  both	the determination of the policy as  well  as
carrying  its  execution,  the	initiation  of	legislation,
maintenance  of	 order,	 promotion of  social  and  economic
welfare	 and  direction	 of foreign policy.   In  short	 the
carrying on or supervision of the general administration  of
the affairs of the Union which includes political'  activity
and  carrying on all trading activities, etc. and they	bear
collective responsibility to the Constitution.	It was	also
held  therein that subject to the claim of  privilege  under
<a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_433">Section	  123</a>  of  the	Evidence  Act,	the   Minister	 was
constitutionally bound under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_434">Article 142</a> to assist the court
in  producing the documents before the court and  the  court
has  to strike a balance between the competing	interest  of
public	justice	 and  the  interest  of	 the  State   before
directing  to disclose the documents to the opposite  party.
But  the documents shall be placed before the court for	 its
perusal in camera.
</p><p id="p_295">205. <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_435">Article  74(2)</a> provides that the question whether	any,
and  if	 sc what, advice was tendered by  Ministers  to	 the
President shall not be inquired into in any court.  In other
words it intends to give immunity to the Council
44  (1993) 4 SCC 11 9: 1993 SCC (L&amp;S) 11 28: (1993)  25	 ATC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">464</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">181</span>
of  Ministers  to  withhold production	of  the	 advice	 for
consideration  by  the	court.	 In  other  words  it  is  a
restrictive   power.   Judicial	 review	 is  a	 basic	 and
fundamental  feature of the Constitution and it is the	duty
and  responsibility of the constitutional court to  exercise
the  power of judicial review.	<a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_436">Article 142</a>, in	 particular,
gives	power  to  this	 Court	in  its	 exercise   of	 the
jurisdiction to make any necessary order "for doing complete
justice in any cause or matter pending before it" and  shall
be  enforceable	 throughout the territory of India  in	such
manner as prescribed by or under any law made by  Parliament
and  subject to such law.  The said restriction is  only  in
matter	of  procedure and does not affect  the	power  under
<a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_437">Article 142.</a>  This Court has all or every power to make	 any
order to secure the "attendance of any person, discovery  or
production  of any document or investigation".	Thereby	 the
power  of this Court to secure or direct production  of	 any
document  or  discovery	 is  a	constitutional	power.	 The
restrictive  clause under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_438">Article 74(2)</a> and the wider  power
of this Court under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_439">Article 142</a> need to be harmonised.
</p><p id="p_296">206. In	 R.K.  Jain  case44 it was held that  the  court  is
required to consider whether public interest is so strong to
override  the  ordinary right and interest of  the  litigant
that  he shall be able to lay before a court of justice	 the
relevant  evidence in balancing the competing interest.	  It
is  the	 duty  of the court to see hat	there  is  a  public
interest and that harm shall not be done to the nation or of
the  public service by disclosure of the document and  there
is  a  public interest that the	 administration	 of  justice
shall  not be frustrated by withholding the documents  which
must  be  produced,  if	 justice  is  to  be  done.  it	 is,
therefore, the paramount right and duty of the court, not of
the  executive,	 to  decide whether  the  document  will  be
produced or withheld.  The Court must decide which aspect of
the  public  interest  predominates, in	 other	words  which
public interest requires that the document whether should be
produced  for effectuating justice and	meaningful  judicial
review	performing  its	 function and/or should	 it  not  be
produced.   In some cases, therefore, the court must,  in  a
clash  of  competing  public  interests	 of  the  State	 and
administration of justice, weigh the scales and decide where
the  balance  lies. The basic question to  which  the  court
would, therefore, have to address itself for the purpose  of
deciding the validity of the objection would be, whether the
document relates to affairs of the State, in other words, is
of such a character that its disclosure would be against the
interest  of  the  State or the public	service	 and  if  so
whether	 public interest in its non-disclosure is so  strong
that   it   must  prevail  over	 the  public   interest	  in
administration of justice.  On that account it should not be
allowed to be disclosed. (Vide paras 6 and 1744.)
</p><p id="p_297">207. When public interest immunity against disclosure of the
State  documents in the transaction of the business  by	 the
Council	 of Ministers of a class character was	claimed,  in
the clash of this interest, it is the right and duty of	 the
court  to weigh the balance in that case also and  that	 the
harm
(1993) 4 SCC 119: 1993 SCC (L&amp;S) 1128: (1993) 25 ATC 464
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">182</span>
shall not be done to the nation or the public service and in
the  administration of justice each case must be  considered
in its backdrop.
</p><p id="p_298">208. The  President  has  no  implied  authority  under	 the
Constitution to withhold the document.	On the other hand it
is his solemn constitutional duty to act in aid of the court
to  effectuate	judicial  review. (Vide	 paragraphs  54	 and
5544.)	That was a case of statutory exercise of  power,  in
accordance  with  the  business	 rules	in  appointing	 the
President  of CEGAT and considering the facts in that  case,
it  was held that it was not necessary to direct  disclosure
of  the documents to the other side.  In view of the  scheme
of  the	 Constitution and paramount judicial  review  to  do
complete justice it must be considered in each case  whether
record	should	be produced.  But by  operation	 of  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_440">Article
74(2)</a>  only  the actual advice tendered by  the	 Council  of
Ministers gets immunity from production and the court  shall
not inquire into the question whether and if so what  advice
was  tendered by the Minister.	In other words, the  records
other  than  the  advice tendered by  the  Minister  to	 the
President,  if	found  necessary,  may	be  required  to  be
produced before the constitutional court.  This	 restrictive
interpretation would subserve the wider power under  <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_441">Article
142</a>  given  to	this Court and the  protection	accorded  by
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_442">Article 74(2)</a> maintaining equibalance.
</p><p id="p_299">209. <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_443">Article 74(2)</a> creates bar of enquiry and not a claim of
privilege  for decision in the exercise of the	jurisdiction
whether and, if so, what advice was tendered by the  Council
of  Ministers to the President.	 The power of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_444">Article  74(2)</a>
applies	 only to limited cases where the matter has gone  to
the President for his orders on the advice of the Council of
Ministers.   Exercise  of personal  discretion	calling	 the
leader	of a political party that secured majority  to	form
the  Government or the leader expressing his  inability,  to
explore	 other	possibilities  is  not	liable	to  judicial
scrutiny.    Action  based  on	the  aid  and  advice	also
restricted  the	 scope,	 for  instance,	 the  power  of	 the
President to grant pardon or appointing a Minister, etc.  is
the  discretion	 of  President.	  Similarly  prorogation  of
Parliament  or dissolution of Parliament done under  <a href="/doc/284788/" id="a_445">Article
85</a> is not liable to judicial review.  The accountability  is
of  the	 Prime Minister to the people though  the  President
acts in his discretionary power, with the aid and advice  of
the  Prime Minister.  Similarly, the right of the  President
to address and send message to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
as under <a href="/doc/736613/" id="a_446">Article 86</a> are also in the area of discretion	with
the  aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.  The  power
of  President to promulgate an ordinance under	<a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_447">Article	 123</a>
and  the assent of the Bills under <a href="/doc/1580975/" id="a_448">Article 200</a> are  reserved
for consideration under <a href="/doc/1776802/" id="a_449">Article 201.</a>  As stated earlier, the
discretion  of	the  President on the choice  of  the  Prime
Minister   is  his  personal  discretion  though   paramount
consideration  in  the	choice would be of  the	 person	 who
should command the majority in the House.  Equally when	 the
Government has lost its majority in the House and refuses to
lay down the office, it is his paramount duty to dismiss the
Government.  Equally as said earlier, the dissolution of the
Lok Sabha would be on aid and advice

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">183</span>
of  the Prime Minister, the President while  dissolving	 the
Lok  Sabha  without  getting  involved	in  politics   would
exercise  his discretion under <a href="/doc/284788/" id="a_450">Article 85</a>, but the  ultimate
responsibility and the accountability for such advice is  of
the  Prime Minister and the President would  act  consistent
with  the  conventions with an appeal to the people  of	 the
necessity  to dissolve the House and their need	 to  express
their will at the polls.  In this area the communication  of
the aid and advice whether receives confidentiality and bars
the  enquiry  as to the nature of the advice or	 the  record
itself.	  Therefore, the enquiry under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_451">Article 74(2)</a>  is  to
the  advice  and  if so, what advice  was  tendered  to	 the
President  would be confined to limit power but not  to	 the
decision taken on administrative routine though expressed in
the name of the President under <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_452">Article 73</a> read with <a href="/doc/1185443/" id="a_453">Article

perspective that under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_454">Article 361</a>, the President shall	 not
be  answerable	to  any	 court	for  the  exercise  or	 the
performance  of his power and duty of his office or for	 any
act  purported to have been done by him in the exercise	 and
performance of those powers and duties.	 When the  President
acts not necessarily on the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers  but	only  "or  otherwise"  i.e.  on	 any   other
information  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_455">Article  356(1)</a> his	 satisfaction  is  a
subjective  one	 that a situation has arisen  in  which	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the  provisions  of the Constitution  and	 issues	 the
Proclamation   required	  under	 <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_456">Article   356(1)</a>   of	 the
Constitution.	When it is challenged and asked to give	 his
reasons, he is immuned from judicial process.  The Union  of
India  will  not  have	a  say	for  the  exercise  of	 the
satisfaction  reached by the President "on  otherwise  self-
satisfaction" for his issuing his Proclamation under Article
</p><p id="p_301">356.  Then no one can satisfy the court the grounds for	 the
exercise of the powers by the President.  Therefore, we	 are
of  the	 considered view that the advice and,  if  so,	what
advice was tendered by the Council of Ministers for exercise
of  the	 power	under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_457">Article 356(1)</a>  would  be	 beyond	 the
judicial  enquiry under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_458">Article 74(2)</a> of  the  Constitution.
Nevertheless,  the record on the basis of which	 the  advice
was  tendered  constitute the material.	 But,  however,	 the
material on record, the foundation for advice or a decision,
does  not  receive  total protection  under  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_459">Article  74(2).</a>
Normally  the record may not be summoned by "rule  nisi"  or
"discovery  order nisi".  Even if so summoned it may not  be
looked	into unless a very strong case is made out from	 the
pleadings,  the order of Proclamation if produced and  other
relevant  material  on	record.	  If  the  court  after	 due
deliberation  and,  reasoned order by a High  Court,  issues
"discovery order nisi" the record is liable to be reproduced
pursuant to discovery order nisi issued by this Court or the
High  Court  subject  to  the claim  under  <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_460">Section  123</a>  of
Evidence Act to examine the record in camera.
</p><p id="p_302">211. At	 this  juncture we are to  reiterate  that  judicial
review is not concerned with the merits of the decision	 but
with  the decision-making process.  This is on	the  premise
that  modern  democratic system has  chosen  that  political
accountability	is  more  important  than  other  kinds	  of
accountability	and  the judiciary exercising  its  judicial
review may be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">184</span>
refrained to do so when it finds that the controversy is not
based  on judicially discoverable and manageable  standards.
However,  if  a	 legal	question  camouflaged  by  political
thicket	  has	arisen,	  the  power  and   the	  doors	  of
constitutional	court  are  not	 closed,  nor  can  they  be
prohibited to enter in the political field under the garb of
political     thicket	  in	particular,	when	 the
Constitution.expressly has entrusted the duty to it.  If  it
is  satisfied that a judicially discoverable and  manageable
issue arises, it may be open to the court to issue discovery
order  nisi and consider the case and then issue rule  nisi.
It  would thus be the duty and responsibility of this  Court
to determine and found law as its premise and lay the law in
its   duty  entrusted  by  the	Constitution,  as   ultimate
interpretor  of	 the Constitution, though it is	 a  delicate
task, and issue appropriate declaration.  This Court equally
declares and determines the limit, and whether the action is
in transgression of such limit.
</p><p id="p_303">Interpretation	of  the	 Constitution  and  scope  of  value
orientation
</p><p id="p_304">212. Before  discussing	 the  crucial  question	 it  may  be
necessary  to preface that the Constitution is	intended  to
endure for succeeding generations to come.  The best of	 the
vision	of  the	 Founding Fathers could	 not  visualise	 the
pitfalls  in  the  political governance,  except  the  hoary
history	 of the working of the emergency provisions  in	 the
Government  of India Act and wished that <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_461">Article 356</a>  should
not be "put to operation" or be a "dead letter" and at	best
"sparingly"  be used.  In working the Constitution,  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_462">Article
356</a> has been used 90 times so far a daunting exercise of the
power.	 But  it  is settled law that  in  interpreting	 the
Constitution  neither  motives nor bad faith  nor  abuse  of
power  be  presumed  unless  in an  individual	case  it  is
assailed  and  arises  for consideration  on  that  premise.
<a href="/doc/520370/" id="a_463">Section	  114(e)</a>  of  the  Evidence  Act  raises   statutory
presumption   that   official  acts  have   been   regularly
performed.
</p><p id="p_305">213. Prof.   Bork in his "Neutral Principles and Some  First
Amendment Problems" 47 Ind.  Law Journal, p. 1, 8, 1971 Edn.
stated	that the choice of fundamental values by the  courts
cannot	be justified.  When constitutional materials do	 not
clearly	 specify  the  value to be preferred,  there  is  no
principle weighing to prefer any claimed human value to	 any
other.	 The  judge  must stick close to the  text  and	 the
history and their fair implications and not to construct new
rights.	  The same neutral principle was preferred by  Prof.
Hans Linde in his "Judges Critics and Realistic	 Traditions"
[82 Yale Law Journal, 227 at 254, (1972)] that "the judicial
responsibility begins and ends with determining the  present
scope  and  meaning  of a decision that the  nation,  at  an
earlier	 time, articulated and enacted	into  constitutional
text.  Prof.  Ely in his "Wages of Crying Wolf' a comment on
Reo  v. Ved 45 stated that a neutral principle if  it  lacks
connection  with  any value, the constitution  marks  it  as
special.  It is not a constitutional principle and the court
has  no	 business in missing it.  In  Encyclopaedia  of	 the
American Constitution by
45 1982 Yale LJ 1920, 1949, 1973
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">185</span>
Leonard	  W.  Levy  at	p.  464	 it  is	 stated	 that	"the
Constitution  is a political document; it  serves  political
ends;  its interpretations are political acts".	 Any  theory
of  constitutional  interpretation therefore  presupposes  a
normative  theory of the Constitution itself a	theory,	 for
example, about the constraints that the words and intentions
of  the	 adopters  should  impose  on  those  who  apply  or
interpret the Constitution.  As Ronald Dworkin observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_85">	      "Some parts of any constitutional theory	must
	      be independent of the intentions or beliefs or
	      indeed  the  acts	 of the	 people	 the  theory
	      designates  as framers.  Some part must  stand
	      on   its	own  political	or   moral   theory;
	      otherwise	  the	theory	 would	 be   wholly
	      circular."
</blockquote><p id="p_306">The  courts  as interpreters are called upon to	 fill  those
significant  constitutional  gaps in variety of	 ways.	 The
court should vigorously describe as determinaters, of public
values as small revolution and principles.  Their source  of
moral reasoning and search for moral truth are at least	 the
best  moral foundation available at the time when  momentous
issues based on ethical or moral principles arise.  What  is
left  for the other social decision makers, the	 State,	 the
legislature and the executive?	Where does the	non-original
political  process  fit in?  Prof.  Neil K. Komuser  in	 his
"The  Features of Interpreting Constitution" (North  Western
Law  Review,  1986-87,	191, 202-10) stated  that  the	non-
originalist  interpreters leave the above questions  largely
unanswered.  He says:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_86">	      "They  seem or busy of timing to convince	 the
	      world  that one cannot and should not  have  a
	      non-narrow  originalist approach nor that	 one
	      or  another branch of philosophy	of  language
	      should prevail for they have failed to address
	      an   essential  to  my  mind,  the   essential
	      question	of constitutional law, who  decides?
	      None  of the non-originalists vaguely  phrased
	      assignments for the judiciary, such as 'search
	      for   public   or	 traditional   values';	  or
	      'protection  of principles' or  'evolution  of
	      morals'  tell us what the courts should do  or
	      hold or describe, what they actually do."
</blockquote><p id="p_307">The  judiciary	can be seen as doing everything	 or  nothing
under  these schemes.  If the judiciary is meant  merely  to
list  values  or  principles that  might  be  considered  by
political process, the judicial role is toothless.  The list
of values or principles that might be justiciably considered
is   virtually	 infinite.   Anyone   with   the   slightest
sophistication	can find some benefit, value or	 justiciable
principles  in virtually any legislation.  That is  how	 the
minimal	 scrutiny or rational review techniques of  judicial
review	generally have been employed.  This level of  review
is no review at all.  On the other hand one close up to	 the
tenor of the arguments that the non-originalists can be seen
as  giving  the judicial task of balancing  the	 conflicting
public	values	for Proclamation which	principles  triumph.
Here  the judiciary becomes the central	 societal  decision-
maker.	 The resolution of conflicts among public values  is
coterminous  with  social decision-making.  It is  what	 the
legislature,  the executive and even the judiciary do.	 Put
simply, the value formulations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">186</span>
of  the non-originalists do not address the essential  issue
raised by the earlier discussions.  How shall responsibility
for  decisions be allocated in a world of  highly  imperfect
decision-makers?   How would these scholars  have  judiciary
(let  alone  the  other	 institution)  face  such  terms  as
distrust,  uncertainty and ignorance?  One does not have  to
be  hostile to a substantial role for judicial review to  be
concerned when so much constitutional scholarship skirts  so
central an issue.  Indeed, one could allow for significantly
more  judicial	activism  than	our  constitutional  history
reveals	 without  approaching  the limits  inherent  in	 the
nebulous   formulations	 of  the   various   non-originalist
positions.   As a general matter even in the  most  activist
spirit, for example "the Lochner and Warran's Courts  Eras",
the  judiciary	seems to have decided, not  to	decide	more
questions  leaving  the discovery of the  public  values  or
moral  evolution in most areas to other	 societal  decision-
makers.	  Although such things are within the  measures,  it
seems that there are legislative, executive and to a greater
extent	administrative agencies, interpreters have  actively
influenced  only  a  small percentage  of  public  decision-
making.	   This	 it  seems  to	me   the   non-originalists'
literature   threatens	 to   be   largely   irrelevant	  to
"constitutional	 analysis" so long as it does  not  consider
with  greater  care  under what	 circumstances	the  usually
passive mode of judicial interpretation is to be replaced by
the less common, but more important active mode.  Bennion on
Statutory  Interpretation  at  p.  721	stated	that   since
constitutional	law is the framework of the State it is	 not
to  be	altered by a side wind.	 A caveat is  needed  to  be
entered	 here.	 In interpreting the Constitution,  to	give
effect	to  personal liberty or rights of a section  of	 the
society, a little play provides teeth to operate the law  or
filling	 the yearning gaps even "purposive principle"  would
be  adaptable which may seek to serve the law.	But  we	 are
called	 to  interpret	the  constitutional   operation	  in
political  field,  whether it would be	permissible  is	 the
question.
</p><p id="p_308">SATISFACTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND JUSTICIABILITY
</p><p id="p_309">214. The satisfaction of the President that a President that
a situation has arisen in which the Government of the  State
cannot	be carried out in accordance with the provisions  of
the  Constitution is founded normally upon the	report	from
the  Governor or any other information which  the  President
has   in  possession,  in  other  words,  "the	Council	  of
Ministers",   "the   President"	 reached   a   satisfaction.
Normally,  the report of the Governor would form basis.	  It
is already stated that the Governor's report should  contain
material  facts relevant to the satisfaction reached by	 the
President.   In an appropriate case where the  Governor	 was
not  inclined to report to the President of  the  prevailing
situation  contemplated	 by <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_464">Article 356</a>, the  President	 may
otherwise  have information through accredited	channels  of
communications	 and  have  it	in  their  custody  and	  on
consideration	of  which  the	President  would   reach   a
satisfaction  that  a  situation has  arisen  in  which	 the
Government  of	a State cannot be carried on  in  accordance
with the provisions.

<p id="p_310">			"OTHERWISE"
</p><p id="p_311">215. The   word	 "otherwise"  in  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_465">Article  356(1)</a>  was	 not
originally found in the Draft <a href="/doc/999886/" id="a_466">Article 278</a>, but it was  later
introduced  by	an  amendment.	Dr  Ambedkar  supported	 the
amendment  on the floor of the Constituent Assembly  stating
that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_87">	      "The original <a href="/doc/136927/" id="a_467">Article 188</a> merely provided that
	      the President should act on the report made by
	      the  Governor.  The word 'otherwise'  was	 not
	      there.   Now  it is felt that in view  of	 the
	      fact  that  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_468">Article 277-A	 (now  <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_469">Article	355</a>)</a>
	      which  precedes  <a href="/doc/999886/" id="a_470">Article	278  (<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_471">Article	356</a>)</a>
	      imposed  a  duty and an  obligation  upon	 the
	      Centre, it would not be proper to restrict and
	      confine	action	of  the	  President,   which
	      undoubtedly will be taken in the fulfilment of
	      the  duty, to the report made by the  Governor
	      of the province.	It may be that the  Governor
	      does  not	 make a report.	  None-theless,	 the
	      facts  are such that the President feels	that
	      his intervention is necessary and imminent.  I
	      think  as	 a  necessary  consequence  to	 the
	      introduction  of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_472">Article 277-A</a>, we  must	also
	      give liberty to the President to act even when
	      there  is no report by the Governor  and	when
	      the President has got certain facts within his
	      knowledge	 on which he thinks he ought to	 act
	      in fulfilment of his duty."
</blockquote><p id="p_312">The width of the power is very wide, the satisfaction of the
President  is subjective satisfaction.	It must be based  on
relevant  materials.   The doctrine  that  the	satisfaction
reached by an administrative officer based on irrelevant and
relevant grounds and when some irrelevant grounds were taken
into   account,	 the  whole  order  gets  vitiated  has	  no
application  to	 the  action under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_473">Article  356.</a>   Judicial
review	of  the Presidential Proclamation is  not  concerned
with the merits of the decision, but to the manner in  which
the  decision  had been reached.  The  satisfaction  of	 the
President  cannot be equated with the  discretion  conferred
upon   an   administrative   agency,   of   his	  subjective
satisfaction  upon  objective  material	 like  in  detention
cases, administrative action or by subordinate	legislation.
The analogy of the provisions in the Government of India Act
or similar provision in the Constitution of Pakistan and the
interpretation put upon it by the Supreme Court of  Pakistan
do  not assist us.  The exercise of the power under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_474">Article
356</a>  is with the aid and advice of the Council of  Ministers
with the Prime Minister as its head.  They are answerable to
Parliament and accountable to the people.
</p><p id="p_313">216. To test the satisfaction reached by the President there
is no satisfactory criteria for judicially discoverable	 and
manageable  standards that what grounds prevailed  with	 the
President  to reach his subjective satisfaction.  There	 may
be  diverse,  varied and variegated considerations  for	 the
President  to  reach  the  satisfaction.   The	question  of
satisfaction is basically a political one, practically it is
an  impossible	question  to adjudicate	 on  any  judicially
manageable   standards.	  Obviously  the  Founding   Fathers
entrusted that power to the highest executive, the President
of  India,  with  the  aid and	advice	of  the	 Council  of
Ministers.  The satisfaction of the President
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">188</span>
being  subjective, it is not judicially discoverable by	 any
manageable  standards  and the court  would  not  substitute
their  own  satisfaction  for that of  the  President.	 The
President's   satisfaction  would  be  the  result  of	 his
comprehending  in  his own way the facts  and  circumstances
relevant  to  the satisfaction that the	 Government  of	 the
State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
of the Constitution.  There may be wide range of  situations
and  sometimes may not be enumerated, nor can there  be	 any
satisfactory criteria, but on a conspectus of the facts	 and
circumstances the President may reach the satisfaction	that
the  Government	 of  the  State	 cannot	 be  carried  on  in
accordance   with  the	provisions  of	 the   Constitution.
Therefore, the subjective satisfaction is not justiciable on
any   judicially   manageable  standards.    Moreover,	 the
executive decision of the President receives the flavour  of
the  legislative  approval after both Houses  of  Parliament
have  approved the Proclamation and  executive	satisfaction
ceases	to  be relevant.  <a href="/doc/1553978/" id="a_475">Article 100</a>  of  the	Constitution
protects  the parliamentary approval from assailment on	 any
ground.	  The  judicial review	becomes	 unavailable.	That
apart a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_476">Article 226</a>, if is	maintainable
to  question the satisfaction, equally a declaration that  a
situation  has arisen in the State to clamp emergency or  to
declare	 President's rule by judicial order  is	 permissible
and cannot be wished away.  Could it be done?
</p><p id="p_314">217. The use of the word "may" in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_477">Article	 356</a>
discerns  discretion  vested in the  President	(Council  of

necessitated  to dismiss the State Government  and  dissolve
the  Assembly to take over the administration of a State  or
any one of the steps envisaged in sub-clauses (a) to (c)  of
clause	(1).   The issuance of Proclamation  is	 subject  to
approval which includes (disapproval in inappropriate  case)
by both Houses of Parliament.  In other words, the  issuance
of the Proclamation and actions taken in furtherance thereof
are  subject to the parliamentary control which itself is  a
check and safeguard to protect the federal character of	 the
State and the democratic form of Government.  The  President
is  not necessarily required to approve the advice given  by
the Council of Ministers to exercise the power under Article
</p><p id="p_315">356.  The proviso to sub-<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_479">article (1)</a> of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_480">Article 74</a>,  brought
by the Constitution 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_481">Amendment Act</a>, itself is a  further
assurance   that   it  was  issued  after  due	 and   great
deliberations.	It also assures that the President  actively
applied	 his  mind to the advice tendered and  the  material
placed before him to arrive at his subjective  satisfaction.
In  an	appropriate  case  he may  require  the	 Council  of
Ministers to reconsider such advice, either generally or  he
may  himself suggest an alternative course of action to	 the
proposed  advice tendered by the Council of  Ministers.	  By
necessary  implication it assures that the President  is  an
active	participant  not merely acting as  a  constitutional
head  under <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_482">Article 73</a>, but also active participant  in	 the
decision-making	 process  and the  Proclamation	 was  issued
after  due deliberations.  The court cannot,  therefore,  go

of  the operational area of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_487">Article 356(1).</a>   Suppose  after
general	 elections held, no political party or coalition  of
parties or groups is able to secure absolute majority in the
legislative  assembly and despite the  Governor's  exploring
the  alternatives,  the	 situation has arisen  in  which  no
political party is able to form stable Government, it  would
be  a  case  of completely  demonstrable  inability  of	 any
political  party to form a stable Government commanding	 the
confidence  of the majority members of the legislature.	  It
would  be  a case of failure  of  constitutional  machinery.
After  formation  of the Ministry, suppose due	to  internal
dissensions, a deliberate deadlock was created by a party or
a group of parties or members and the Governor recommends to
the  President	to dissolve the Assembly, situation  may  be
founded	 on  imponderable  variable  opinions  and  if	 the

resigns due to loss of support and no other political  party
is  in	a position to form an alternative  Government  or  a
party having majority refuses to form the Ministry would not
a   constitutional  deadlock  be  created?   When  in	such
situations  the	 Governor  reported to	the  President,	 and
President issued Proclamation could it be said that it would
be  unreasonable  or  mala fide	 exercise  of  power?	Take
another	 instance where the Government of a State,  although
enjoying  the  majority	 support in  the  Assembly,  It	 has

365</a>  that on the failure of the State Government  to  comply
with or to give effect to any directions given by the  Union
Government  in	exercise of its executive powers  and  other
provisions  of the Constitution it shall be lawful  for	 the
President  to hold that a situation has arisen in which	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution.  For instance,	 the
State  failed  to  preserve  the  maintenance  of  means  of
communication  declared to be of national or material  means
envisaged  under  <a href="/doc/1346400/" id="a_490">Article  257(2)</a> of  the  Constitution	 and
despite the directions, the State Government fails to comply
with  the  same.  It would be an  instance  envisaged  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_491">Article	 356.</a>  Similarly protection of the  railways  within
the State is of paramount importance.  If a direction issued
under  <a href="/doc/79408/" id="a_492">Article 257(3)</a> was failed to be complied with by	 the
State to protect the railways, it would be another  instance
envisaged  under <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_493">Article 365.</a>  In these or  other  analogous
situations the warning envisaged by Dr Ambedkar needs to  be
given  and failure to comply with the same would be  obvious
failure	   of	the   constitutional   machinery.     During
Proclamation  of emergency under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_494">Article 352</a>  if  directions
issued	under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_495">Article 353-A</a> were not complied with or  given
effect	to, it would also be an instance under <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_496">Article	365.</a>
Equally	  directions  given  under  <a href="/doc/1923607/" id="a_497">Article  360(3)</a>  as	  to
observance of financial propriety or the Proclamation as  to
financial  emergency  is yet another instance  envisaged  by
<a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_498">Article	 365.</a>  The recent phenomena that the Chief  Minister
gets life-size photo published in all national and  regional
dailies	 everyday  at  great  public  expenditure.   Central
Government  has	 responsibility	 to  prevent  such  wasteful
expenditure.   Sufficient warning given yielded no  response
nor  the Chief Minister desisted to have it published is  it
not  a case for action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_499">Article 356?</a>   These  instances
would furnish evidence as to the circumstances in which	 the
President  could  be satisfied that the	 Government  of	 the
State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
of the Constitution.  These instances appear to be  curative
in  nature.   In these cases forewarning may be	 called	 for
before acting under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_500">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_323">221. Take another instance that under <a href="/doc/391743/" id="a_501">Article 339(2)</a> of	 the
Constitution the Union of India gives direction to the State
to  draw and execute the schemes specified therein  for	 the
welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in that State and  allocated
funds for the purpose.	The State, in defiance, neither drew
the  plans  nor	 executed  the	schemes,  but  diverted	 the
finances allocated for other purposes, it would be a failure
of the constitutional machinery to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">191</span>
elongate    the	  constitutional   purpose    of    securing
socioeconomic  justice	to  the	 tribals  envisaged  in	 the
directive  principles warranting the President to reach	 his
satisfaction  that the Government of the State is not  being
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	 Where	 owing	 to   armed   rebellion	  or
extraordinary	natural	 calamity,  like   earthquake,	 the
Government  of	the State is unable to perform its  duty  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the	 Constitution,	then
also  satisfaction of the President that the  Government  of
the  State is unable to perform as a responsible  Government
in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution is not
justiciable.
</p><p id="p_324">222. Conversely,  on the resignation of the  Chief  Minister
the  Governor  without	attempting or  probing	to  form  an
alternative Government by an opposition party recommends for
dissolution of the Assembly, it would be an obvious case  of
highly	irrational exercise of the power.  Where  the  Chief
Minister  himself  expresses  inability	 to  cope  with	 his
majority   legislators,	 recommends  to	 the  Governor	 for
dissolution,   and   dissolution   accordingly	 was   made,
exercising  the power by the President, it would also  be  a
case of highly irrational exercise of the power.  Where	 the
Governor  recommends  to  the  President  to  dissolve	 the
Assembly on the ground that the Chief Minister belongs to  a
particular religion, caste or creed, it would also be a case
that  the  President  reached satisfaction  only  on  highly
irrational  consideration  and does not bear  any  nexus  or
correlation to the approximate purpose of the action.  It is
clearly	 unconstitutional.  Take an instance  that  national
language  is  Hindi.  Centre  directs  a  non-Hindi-speaking
State  to  adopt  Hindi in the Devanagari  script  as  State
language,  though predominantly 95% of the  population	does
not  know Hindi, nor has need to adopt it as lingua  franca,
the  violation of the directives does not entail  imposition
of President's rule.
</p><p id="p_325">223. The  exercise  of	power  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_502">Article  356</a>  by	 the
President  through  Council  of	 Ministers  places  a  great
responsibility	on it and inherent therein are the seeds  of
bitterness  between  the Union of India and the	 States.   A
political party with people's mandate of requisite  majority
or  of coalition with value-based principles  or  programmes
and  not of convenience are entitled to form Government	 and
carry on administration for its full term unless voted	down
from  power  in accordance with the Constitution.   We	have
multi-party  system and in recent past regional parties	 are
also emerging.	So one political party would be in power  at
the  Centre and another at the State level.  In	 particular,
when  the Union of India seeks to dismiss a  State  Ministry
belonging to a different political party, there is bound  to
exist  friction.   The motivating factor  for  action  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_503">Article	 356(1)</a>	 should never be for political gain  to	 the
party in power at the Centre, rather it must be only when it
is  satisfied that the constitutional machinery has  failed.
It  is	to  reiterate  that the	 federal  character  of	 the
Government  reimposes the belief that the people's faith  in
democratically	elected	 majority  or  coalition  Government
would  run  its full term, would not be	 belied	 unless	 the
situation is otherwise unavoidable.  The frequent  elections
would  belie the people's belief and faith in  parliamentary
form of Government, apart from enormous election expenditure
to the State and the candidates.  It also generates
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">192</span>
disbelief in the efficacy of the democratic process which is
a  death-knell for the parliamentary system itself.  It	 is,
therefore,   extremely	 necessary   that   the	  power	  of
Proclamation   under   <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_504">Article	356</a>  must   be	 used	with
circumspection	and  in a non-partisan manner.	 It  is	 not
meant to be invoked to serve political gain or to get rid of
an inconvenient State Government for good or bad governance.
But only in cases of failure of the constitutional machinery
of the State Government.
</p><p id="p_326">224. As	 stated	 earlier, the constitutional  and  political
features  should be nurtured and set conventions be laid  by
consensus  among  the  political parties  either  by  mutual
agreement  or  resolution  passed in  this  behalf.   It  is
undoubted that Sarkaria Commission appointed by the Union of
India  and  Rajamannar	Commission appointed  by  the  State
Government  of	Tamil Nadu suggested certain  amendments  to
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_505">Article	 356</a>, distinguished Judges gave guidelines.   Though
they  bear  weight,  it	 is for	 the  consideration  of	 the
political  parties or Governments, but judicially  it  would
not  be adapted as guidance as some of them would  be  beset
with difficulties in implementation.  However, their creases
could  be  ironed out by conference or by consensus  of	 the
political   parties.   As  regards  horse-trading   by	 the
legislators,  there  are  no  judicially  discoverable	 and
manageable standards to decide in judicial review.  A floor-
test  may provide impetus for corruption and rank force	 and
violence by musclemen or wrongful confinement or  volitional
captivity of legislators occurs till the date of the  floor-
test  in  the House, to gain majority on the  floor  of	 the
House.
</p><p id="p_327">225. At	 some  quarters	 it is	believed  that	power  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_506">Article 356</a> was misused.  We are not called to examine	each
case.  Taking a bird's-eye view of the Proclamations  issued
by  the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_507">Article 356</a> it would appear that  on
three  occasions  the Speaker of  the  Legislative  Assembly
created deadlock to pass the financial bills.  The power was
used  to resolve the deadlock.	When there was breakdown  of
law  and  order	 and  public order  due	 to  agitations	 for
creation  of separate States for Telangana and	Andhra,	 the
Andhra	Pradesh Legislative Assembly was dissolved  and	 the
Congress Ministry itself was dismissed while the same  party
was  in	 power at the Centre.  Similar instance	 would	show
that   the   power   under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_508">Article  356</a>   was	 used	when
constitutional machinery failed.  This would establish	that
the width of the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_509">Article 356</a> cannot be cut down,
clipped	 or crabbed.  Moreover, the elected  representatives
from  that State represent in Parliament and do	 participate
in the discussion of the Presidential Proclamation when	 its
approval  is  sought  and  the	transaction  of	 legislative
business  concerning  that State and express  their  dissent
when it is misused.  Though temporarily the democratic	form
of  Government was not in the governance of that State,	 the
basic  feature of the Constitution, namely democracy is	 not
affected  for  the  governance	by  the	 elected  executives
temporarily at times for maximum period of three years.
</p><p id="p_328">226. The President being the highest executive of the State,
it is impermissible to attribute personal mala fides or	 bad
faith  to  the	President.  The	 proviso  to  <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_510">Article  74(1)</a>
presumptively prohibits such a charge, unless
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">193</span>
established by unimpeachable evidence at the threshold.	 For
the  exercise  of  the power under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_511">Article  356</a>  the  Prime
Minister   and	his  Council  of  Ministers,   he/they	 are
collectively  responsible to Parliament and  accountable  to
the  people.  The only recourse, in case of misuse or  abuse
of  power  by the President, is to take	 either	 impeachment
proceedings  under <a href="/doc/594857/" id="a_512">Article 61</a> against the President or	seek
confidence of the people at the polls.
</p><p id="p_329">227. These  conclusions	 do  not reach	the  journey's	end.
However, it does not mean     that  the court can merely  be
an onlooker and a helpless spectator to exercise  of	 the
power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_513">Article 356.</a>  It owes duty and responsibility to
defend	the  democracy.	  If the court,	 upon  the  material
placed before it finds that the satisfaction reached by	 the
President is unconstitutional, highly irrational or  without
any nexus, then the court would consider the contents of the
Proclamation  or  reasons disclosed therein and	 in  extreme
cases the material produced pursuant to discovery order nisi
to  find the action is wholly irrelevant or bears  no  nexus
between	 purpose of the action and the satisfaction  reached
by  the	 President  or does not bear any  rationale  to	 the
proximate  purpose of the Proclamation.	 In that  event	 the
court  may  declare  that the satisfaction  reached  by	 the
President  was	either	on  wholly  irrelevant	grounds	  or
colourable  exercise of power and consequently	Proclamation
issued under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_514">Article 356</a> would be declared unconstitutional.
The  court  cannot go into the question of adequacy  of	 the
material  or  circumstances justifying	the  declaration  of
President's  rule.   Roscoupoun in his	Development  of	 the
Constitutional	Guarantees  of	Liberty,  1963	Edn.  quoted
Jahering  that,	 "Form is sworn enemy of caprice,  the	twin
sisters of liberty, fixed forms are the school of discipline
and  order and thereby of liberty itself." The	exercise  of
the   discretion  by  the  President  is  hedged  with	 the
constitutional	constraint to obtain approval of  Parliament
within	two months from the date of the issue, itself is  an
assurance of proper exercise of the power that the President
exercises  the	power  properly and  legitimately  that	 the
administration of the State is not carried on in  accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution.

<p id="p_332">CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS PROVIDE FLESH WHICH
		  CLOTHES DRY BONES OF LAW
</p><p id="p_333">229. Ever since <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_515">Article 356</a> was put in operation  convention
has   been  developed  that  the  Legislative  Assembly	  is
dissolved, the State Government is removed and the executive
power assumed by the President is entrusted to the  Governor
to carry on the executive actions with the aid and advice of
the   appointed	  Advisors.    Parliament   exercises	 the
legislative powers of the entries in List 11 of the Schedule
and  delegates	legislative  power to  the  President.	 The
President  makes  incidental and  consequential	 provisions.
The Government of the State is thus under the administration
of  the Union Government.  The Constitution though  provided
an  elaborate  procedure with minute details,  that  in	 the
event  Parliament  did not approve the	Proclamation  issued
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_516">Article 356</a>, the contingency of restitution of removed
Government and restoration of dissolved Assembly,  obviously
with  the  fond hope that <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_517">Article 356</a> would remain  a  "dead
letter"	 or  it will "not be put to operation", or  at	best
"sparingly" used.  Dr Ambedkar in his closing speech in	 the
Constituent  Assembly  stated  that  "the  conventions	 and
political  morality"  would help successful working  of	 the
Constitution.	Constitution cannot provide  detailed  rules
for  every  eventuality.   Conventions	are  found  in	 all
established  Constitutions.   The conventions are  meant  to
bring about constitutional development without formal change
in  the	 law.  Prof K.C. Wheare in his book The	 Statute  of
Westminster  and  Dominion  Status (4th	 Edn.)	defined	 the
conventions thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_88">	      "The  definition	of conventions may  thus  be
	      amplified	 by saying that their purpose is  to
	      define  the use of constitutional	 discretion.
	      To  put this in slightly different  words,  it
	      may  be  said that conventions  are  non-legal
	      rules regulating the way in which legal  rules
	      shall be applied."
</blockquote><p id="p_334">230.  Sir W. Ivor Jennings, in his Law and the	Constitution
(5th Edn.) elaborated the constitutional convention :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_89">	      "Thus within the framework of the law there is
	      room for the development of rules of practice,
	      rules which may be followed as consistently as
	      the  rules  of law, and  which  determine	 the
	      procedure	  which	 the  men   concerned	with
	      government must follow."
</blockquote><p id="p_335">231. The constitutional conventions provide the flesh  which
clothes the dry bones of the law; they make the constitution
work;  they  keep it in touch with the growth of  ideas.   A
constitution  does not work itself; it has to be  worked  by
men.   It is an instrument of national cooperation which  is
as  necessary  as the instrument.  The conventions  are	 the
rules	 elaborated   for   effecting	that	cooperation.
Conventions  entrust power granted in the constitution	from
one  person to the other when the law is exercised  by	whom
they are granted, they are in practice by some other  person
or  body of persons.  The primary role of conventions is  to
regulate   exercise   of   the	 discretion   facing	that
irresponsible abuse of power.
</p><p id="p_336">232. K.C. Wheare in his book Modern Constitution (1967 Edn.)
stated that:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">195</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_90">	      "The  conventions not only give  discretionary
	      powers to the Government but also in executive
	      governance  and  a  legislature  or  executive
	      relations,  where	 such  rules  and   practice
	      operate.	 They may be found in other  spheres
	      of constitutional activities also."
</blockquote><p id="p_337">He stated that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_91">	      "A  course of conduct may be persisted over  a
	      period  of  time and  gradually  attain  first
	      persuasive  and  then  obligatory	 force.	   A
	      convention  may arise much more  quickly	than
	      that.   There  may be an agreement  among	 the
	      people  concerned to work in a particular	 way
	      and to adopt a particular rule of conduct".
	      Sir W. Ivor Jennings had stated that:
	      "The law provides only a framework; those	 who
	      put the laws into operation give the framework
	      a meaning and fill in the interstices.   Those
	      who  take	 decisions create  precedents  which
	      others tend to follow, and when they have been
	      followed long enough they acquire the sanctity
	      and the respectability of age.  They not	only
	      are followed but they have to be followed."
</blockquote><p id="p_338">One of us, learned Brother Kuldip Singh, J. had	 elaborately
considered the scope of conventions which obviated the	need
to  tread  the	path once over and  held  in  Supreme  Court
<a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_518">Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India46</a>, that  :
(SCC p. 651, para 340)
	      "The written Constitutions cannot provide	 for
	      every	  eventuality.	      Constitutional
	      institutions   are   often  created   by	 the
	      provisions  which are generally worded.	Such
	      provisions  are interpreted with the  help  of
	      conventions  which  grow with the	 passage  of
	      time.   Conventions are vital insofar as	they
	      fill  up the gaps in the Constitution  itself,
	      help  solve  problems of	interpretation,	 and
	      allow  for  the  future  development  of	 the
	      constitutional framework.	 Whatever the nature
	      of the Constitution, a great deal may be	left
	      unsaid   in  legal  rules	 allowing   enormous
	      discretion      to     the      constitutional
	      functionaries.	Conventions   regulate	 the
	      exercise of that discretion."

constitutional	law filling the interstices  of	 legislative

with  the  choice left to him by sub-clauses (a) to  (c)  of

</p><p id="p_341">234. The  Proclamation issued under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_523">Article 356</a> requires  to
be  laid before each House of Parliament within	 two  months
from  the  date	 of  its  issue.   Unless  it  receives	 the

months.	  The  legal consequences of  the  Proclamation,  as
stated earlier, is that the State Government is removed, the

power  mentioned in sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c)  of  clause
(1)  of	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_524">Article  356</a>  the  President  takes  either   steps

while  exercising legislative powers in the entries in	List

that  till  expiry of two months  the  Legislative  Assembly
should	not be dissolved and on the approval  received	from
both the Houses of Parliament the President should  dissolve
it.   If  the President fails to get the approval  then	 the

difficult to give acceptance to this contention and if given
acceptance  it would be beset with grave  incongruities	 and
result	in  operational	 disharmony.   Parliament  did	 not
disapprove  any	 Proclamation so far issued.   There  is  no
express	 provision engrafted in the Constitution to fill  in
this contingency.  In Rajasthan case3 this Court  considered
the contingency and held that dissolution of the Legislative
Assembly is part of the same Proclamation or by a subsequent
order  and  that  even if Parliament does  not	approve	 the
Proclamation the dissolved Assembly and the removed Ministry
cannot be restored.  We respectfully agree with the view for
the reasons we independently give hereinunder.
FUNCTIONAL INCONGRUITY AND DISHARMONY
</p><p id="p_342">235. The  executive  power  of the Union  or  the  State  is
coextensive  with  their  legislative  powers  respectively.
When the President assumed administration of the State under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_526">Article	 356</a>,  without dissolving the  Legislative  Assembly
could  the President discharge the executive powers  without
legislative  powers being armed with by	 Parliament?   Could
the  President discharge the duties under the directions  of
the   State   Legislature,  if	need  arises   for   passing
appropriate  legislative sanctions.  Bicameral operation  of
the  legislative  and  executive powers both  by  the  State
Legislature  and Parliament in List 11 of VIlth Schedule  is
an  anathema to the democratic principle and  constitutional
scheme.	 The question of conflict of
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">197</span>
parliamentary  supremacy and executive overbearing  is	more
imaginary than actual or real.
</p><p id="p_343">236. The reinduction of the Government of the State is	also
beset with several  incongruities.   It	 cannot	 be  assumed
that the President lightly removed the State Government.  It
must  be  for  formidable  grounds,  though  not  judicially
discoverable  nor discernable to strict	 judicial  scrutiny.
All the Proclamations so far issued were not disapproved  by
Parliament.   The dismissed Government, if  restituted	into
power,	may  violate  with impunity the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution   and  laws  for  the  balance  period   taking
advantage  of  majority in the	legislature  and  full-scale
corruption  or other unconstitutional acts will	 have  their
free play.  The political party itself and all their members
of  the legislature should collectively	 own  responsibility
for   the   removal   of   their   Government	and    their
unconstitutional  governance writes its own  death  warrant.
Restitution   thereby	puts  a	 premium  on   failing	 the
Constitution.  The political party must seek afresh  mandate
from  the  electorates and establish  their  credibility  by
winning	 majority seats.  The existence of  the	 Legislative
Council	 which is not dissolvable, like Rajya Sabha,  cannot
by  itself transact any business, in particular the  finance
bills or appropriation bills or annual financial statements.
Therefore,  its continuance shall render no criteria to	 the
continuance of legislature or to assume it be not  dissolved
on grammarian rule to reconstitute the dissolved Legislative
Assembly  of which the majority members belong to  the	same
party.	 No doubt dissolution of the  Legislature  literally
would include Legislative Council but not every State has  a
council.   No distinction between two types of	States,	 one
with  Council  and another without Council  and	 the  former
would be eligible for revival and later per force would	 not
be,  was  not meant by the  Constitution.   Grammarian	rule
carries no consistence.	 Moreover this problem could also be
tested	from  the expediency and functional  efficacy.	 The
possibility   of  reinduction  creates	functional   hiatus.
Suppose	 the court grants stay till Parliament approves	 the
Proclamation,  if  urgent need arose to issue  ordinance  or
transact legislative or financial business, who would do it?
The  suspended	Assembly  cannot  do  nor  Parliament.	 The
dismissed Ministry cannot transact the legislative business.
Even   if   permitted  to  function   and   ultimately	 the
Proclamation is approved by Parliament, what would happen to
the  validity of the executive and legislative acts done  in
the  interregnum.   As stated, is there	 no  possibility  of
large-scale abuse of office for personal or political  gain?
If  the	 orders	 are issued by	the  courts  on	 value-based
opinion,  where is the finality and at what point a stop  is
to  be	put?  If stay is granted, by a High Court  and	writ
petition is not disposed of and the term of the	 legislative
Assembly  expires  what	 would happen  to  the	Ministry  in
office?	 whether  it would continue by order of	 the  court?
How   elections	 are  to  be  conducted	 by   the   Election
Commission?   Is it under the orders of the court or by	 the
exercise  of  the power under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_527">Article 324?</a>  Are day  to	 day
executive, legislative and administrative actions to be done
under  the  writ  of the court? of a  High  Court  issues  a
direction to allow the dissolved assembly its full course of
balance period including the suspended period what would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">198</span>
happen?	  Is  it not violative of <a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_528">Article 172?</a>	 Whether  it
could  be  prevented  to  be done?  If	such  order  is	 not
complied  with, is not the President liable to	contempt  of
the  court  and	 if so what happens  to	 the  protection  of
<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_529">Article 361 ?</a> Instead of solving the problems, does not	 the
writ of the court create constitutional crisis?	 Giving deep
and  anxious consideration and visualising the	far-reaching
constitutional	crisis, we are firmly of the view  that	 the
self-restraint	constrains  us to express no  value  opinion
leaving	 it  to	 Parliament to ponder  over  and  if  deemed
necessary amend <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_530">Article 356</a> suitably.

CASUS OMISSUS - WHETHER PERMISSIBLE To SUPPLY
</p><p id="p_345">238. The question, further arises whether by  interpretative
process, would it   be	permissible  to fill  in  the  gaps.
Though it is settled law that in working the law and finding
yearning  gaps	therein,  to  give life	 and  force  to	 the
legislative  intent, instead of blaming the  draftsman,	 the
courts	ironed out the creases by appropriate  technique  of
interpretation and infused life into dry bones of law.	 But
such  an  interpretation  in  our  respectful  view  is	 not
permissible,  when  we	are called  upon  to  interpret	 the
organic Constitution and working the political	institutions
created therein.  When Parliament has had an opportunity  to
consider  what	exactly is going wrong	with  the  political
system	designed  by the Constitution but took no  steps  to
amend the Constitution in this behalf, it is a principle  of
legal  policy, that the law should be altered  deliberately,
rather	than  casually	by a sidewind  only,  by  major	 and
considered  process.   Amendment of the	 Constitution  is  a
serious	 legislative business and change in the	 basic	law,
carefully work out, more fundamental changes are brought out
by  more  thorough-going  and  in-depth	 consideration	 and
specific   provisions  should  be  made	 by  which   it	  is
implemented.   Such is the way to contradict the problem  by
the legislative process of a civilised State.  It is a well-
established principle of construction that a statute is	 not
to  be	taken as affecting parliamentary alteration  in	 the
general	  law	unless	it  shows  words  that	 are   found
unmistakably to that conclusion.  No motive or bad faith  is
attributable  to  the  legislature.   Bennion  at  page	 338
extracting from the Institute of the Law of Scotland Vol. 3,
page  1	 of  The  Practice by  David  Maxwell  at  page	 127
abstracted  that  "Where a matter depends  entirely  on	 the
construction of the words of a statute, there cannot be	 any
appeal to the nobile officium".	 He stated at page 344 that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">199</span>
	      "where  the literal meaning of  the  enactment
	      goes   narrower	than  the  object   of	 the
	      legislator, the court may be required to apply
	      a	 rectifying  construction.  Nowadays  it  is
	      regarded	as  not in  accordance	with  public
	      policy  to allow a draftsman's  ineptitude  to
	      prevent  justice	being done.   This  was	 not
	      always the case."
</p><p id="p_346">Where  the language of a statute is clear  and	unambiguous,
there is no room for the application either of the  doctrine
of  casus omissus or of pressing into service external	aid,
for in such a case the words used by the Constitution or the
statute	 speak for themselves and it is not the function  of
the  court to add words or expressions merely to  suit	what
the   court  thinks  is	 the  supposed	intention   of	 the
legislature.   In American Jurisprudence 2d Series, Vol.  73
at page 397 in para 203 it is stated that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_92">	      "It is a general rule that the courts may not,
	      by  construction insert words or phrases in  a
	      statute  or supply a casus omissus  by  giving
	      force  and  effect  to  the  language  of	 the
	      statute when applied to a subject about  which
	      nothing  whatever is said, and which,  to	 all
	      appearances,  was	 not  in the  minds  of	 the
	      legislature  at the time of the  enactment  of
	      the law."
</blockquote><p id="p_347">Under such circumstances new provisions or ideas may not  be
interpolated in a statute or engrafted thereon.	 At page 434
in para 366 it is further stated that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_93">	      "	 While it has been held that it is  duty  of
	      the courts to interpret a statute as they find
	      it without reference to whether its provisions
	      are expedient or unexpedient, it has also been
	      recognised  that where a statute is  ambiguous
	      and  subject to more than one  interpretation,
	      the  expediency  of one  construction  or	 the
	      other  is properly considered.  Indeed,  where
	      the arguments are nicely balanced,  expediency
	      may  tip the scales in favour of a  particular
	      construction.   It  is not the function  of  a
	      court  in the interpretation of  statutes,  to
	      vindicate	 the  wisdom of the law.   The	mere
	      fact that the statute leads to unwise  results
	      is  not  sufficient to justify  the  court  in
	      rejecting	 the  plain meaning  of	 unambiguous
	      words  or in giving to a statute a meaning  of
	      which  its language is not susceptible, or  in
	      restricting  the scope of a statute.   By	 the
	      same token, an omission or failure to  provide
	      for  contingencies, which it may seem wise  to
	      have  provided  for  specifically,  does	 not
	      justify any judicial addition to the  language
	      of  the statute.	To the contrary, it  is	 the
	      duty  of the courts to interpret a statute  as
	      they find it without reference to whether	 its
	      provisions  are wise or unwise,  necessary  or
	      unnecessary, appropriate or inappropriate,  or
	      well or ill-conceived.  "
</blockquote><p id="p_348">239.	  Craies  on  Statute  Law, 7th Edn.,  at  page	 69,
states	that  the second consequence of the  rule  of  casus
omissus	 is that the statute may not be extended to  meet  a
case  for  which provision has clearly and  undoubtedly	 not
been made.  In Construction of Statutes by Crawford at	page
269  in	 paragraph  169 it is stated  that  omissions  in  a
statute	  cannot,  as  a  general  rule,  be   supplied	  by
construction.	Thus, if a particular case is  omitted	from
the  terms of a statute, even though such a case  is  within
the obvious purpose of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">200</span>
the  statute  and the omission appears to have been  due  to
accident  or  inadvertence,  the court	cannot	include	 the
omitted	 case  by supplying the omission.  This	 is  equally
true  where  the  omission was due to  the  failure  of	 the
legislature to foresee the missing case.  As is obvious,  to
permit the court to supply the omissions in statutes,  would
generally  constitute an encroachment upon the field of	 the
legislature.  In construing the Constitution we cannot	look
beyond	the  letter of the Constitution to  adopt  something
which  would  command itself to our minds as  being  implied
from  the context.  In State of Tasmania v. Commonwealth  of
Australia  and State of Victoria47 Connor, J.  dealing	with
the question observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_94">	      "It  appears to me that the only safe rule  is
	      to  look at the statute itself and  to  gather
	      from  it what is its intention.  If we  depart
	      from  that rule we are apt to run the risk  of
	      the  danger  described by	 Pollack,  C.J.,  in
	      Mille  v.	 Solomons.   'If',  he	says,	'the
	      meaning of the language be plain and clear, we
	      have   nothing  to  do  but  to  obey  it	  to
	      administer it as we find it; and, I think,  to
	      take  a  different course is  to	abandon	 the
	      office of Judge, and to assume the province of
	      legislation'.  Some passages were cited by  Mr
	      Glynn  from  Black on  the  Interpretation  of
	      Laws, which seem to imply that there might  be
	      a difference in the rules of interpretation to
	      be applied to the Constitution and those to be
	      applied  to any other Act of  Parliament,	 but
	      there   is   no  foundation   for	  any	such
	      distinction.   The intention of the  enactment
	      is  to  be gathered from its  words.   If	 the
	      words are plain, effect must be given to them;
	      if   they	 are  doubtful,	 the  intention	  of
	      legislature  is to be gathered from the  other
	      provisions   of	the  statute  aided   by   a
	      consideration  of	 surrounding  circumstances.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">	      In   all	cases  in  order  to  discover	 the
	      intention	   you	 may   have   recourse	  to
	      contemporaneous  circumstances to the  history
	      of  the  law,  and you  may  gather  from	 the
	      instrument   itself   the	  object   of	 the
	      legislature in passing it.  In considering the
	      history of the law, you may look into previous
	      legislation,  you	 must  have  regard  to	 the
	      historical  facts surrounding the bringing  of
	      law into existence.  In the case of a  Federal
	      Constitution the field of inquiry is naturally
	      more  extended  than in the case	of  a  State
	      Statute, but the principles to be applied	 are
	      the same.	 You may deduce the intention of the
	      legislature   from  a  consideration  of	 the
	      instrument itself in the light of these  facts
	      and  circumstances, but you cannot  go  beyond
	      it.   If that limitation is to be	 applied  in
	      the  interpretation  of  an  ordinary  Act  of
	      Parliament,   it	 should	 at  least   be	  as
	      stringently  applied in the interpretation  of
	      an instrument of this kind, which not only  is
	      a	 statutory enactment, but also embodies	 the
	      compact  by  which the people of	the  several

	      bodies,  which  are the very  essence  of	 the
	      democratic  foundation and functioning of	 our
	      Constitution.   That  limitation ought  to  be
	      observed irrespective of the fact whether	 the
	      preparation and publication of electoral rolls
	      are a part of the process of 'election' within
	      the   meaning   of  <a href="/doc/34511/" id="a_552">Article  329(b)</a>   of	 the
	      Constitution."
</p><p id="p_357">There are plethora of precedents in this behalf, but suffice
for  the  limited purpose to say that the  exercise  of	 the
power either under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_553">Article 226</a> or <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_554">Article 32</a> or <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_555">Article	 136</a>
staying	 the  elections	 to  the  dissolved  Assembly  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_556">Article 356</a> not only flies in the face of the constitutional
mandates  and the law laid down by this Court,	but  creates
uncertainty    and   constitutional   crises	as    stated
hereinbefore.	Enlightened  public opinion both  inside  or
outside	 Parliament,  informed public  objective  criticism,
objective  assessment of the ground realities would  inhibit
misuse of power and hinder highly irrational exercise of the
power.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">204</span>
</p><p id="p_359">246. The question which finally emerges is whether  issuance
of  the Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_557">Article 356</a> without	affording  a
particular  Chief Minister to test his majority	 support  of
his  party  in	the  Legislatures (sic)	 of  Janata  Dal  or
coalition  on the floor of the House is arbitrary and  bears
no reasonable nexus or irrational.  Having given our anxious
consideration  to the facts in Bommai case and in the  light
of the discussion made hereinbefore that the fluid situation
prevailing  during  the	 relevant  period  appears  to	have
persuaded  the President that he had constitutional duty  to
maintain  the purity of the democratic process and  required
to  stamp out horse-trading among the legislators which	 had
resulted   in  the  failure  of	 constitutional	  machinery,
satisfied  himself  that  necessitated to  issuance  of	 the
Proclamation   under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_558">Article  356.</a>   Though  the   majority
strength of the ruling party or coalition in the Legislative
Assembly may be tested on the floor of the House and may  be
a salutary principle as recommended by the conference of the
Governors, it would appear that in its working there emerged
several	 pitfalls and so it was not found enforceable  as  a
convention.   It is for the political parties or  the  Chief
Ministers' conference to take a decision in that behalf	 and
it  is not judicially manageable for the court to  give	 any
declaration  in	 this behalf.  In regard to  dissolution  of
U.P. Assembly, though there is no writ petition filed, since
the  Government machinery of that Government had  failed  to
prevent	 destruction  of Sri  Ram  Janmabhoomi-Babri  Masjid
disputed  structure  and  failed to  protect  the  religious
property,  be  it belong to Hindus or Muslims  and  in	that
surged	atmosphere when it was done, it cannot be  concluded
that the President acted unconstitutionally or that there is
no proximate nexus between the action and the demolition  to
exercise  the  power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_559">Article 356.</a>	  Equally  regarding
dissolution  of	 Legislative Assemblies of  Madhya  Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the reports of the Governors
do  disclose  that  some of the	 Ministers  and	 some  Chief
Ministers  actively associated or encouraged kar  sevaks  to
participate  in	 the  demolition  of  Ram  Janmabhoomi-Babri
Masjid disputed structure and also criticised the imposition
of ban on RSS.	The law and order situation or public  order
situation do not appear to have been brought under  control.
The  common thread of breach of secularism ran	through	 the
events	and  with prognosis action was taken.	Our  learned
Brother	  Jeevan  Reddy,  J.  elaborately   considered	 the
pleadings  of  the parties and arguments by  the  respective
counsel.   He  also deduced the conclusions.  The  need	 for
discussion once over is thereby redundant.  We	respectfully
agree  with him and in case of Meghalaya also.	We  conclude
that  the  satisfaction reached by the President  cannot  be
adjudicated with any judicially discoverable and  manageable
standards,  but one stark fact that emerged is that  due  to
sustained  campaign by the BJP and other  organizations	 Sri
Ram   Janmabhoomi-Babri	  Masjid  disputed   structure	 was
destroyed.   Consequential situation that has arisen due  to
which the President satisfied that Governments of the States
of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution  and  they breached the basic features  of	 the
Constitution, namely secularism.  Therefore the satisfaction
reached by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">205</span>
the  President	cannot be said to be  irrelevant  warranting
interference.	As regards Meghalaya is concerned, though  a
declaration  may  possibly be made on the  validity  of	 the
Presidential Proclamation, since the elections have  already
been held, its need became fait accompli.
</p><p id="p_360">CONCLUSIONS
</p><p id="p_361">247. Federalism envisaged in the Constitution of India is  a
basic feature in which	 the  Union  of India  is  permanent
within the territorial limits set in <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_560">Article 1</a>	  of	 the
Constitution  and  is  indestructible.	 The  State  is	 the
creature of the Constitution and the law made by Articles  2
to  4 with no territorial integrity, but a permanent  entity
with  its boundaries alterable by a law made by	 Parliament.
Neither	 the relative importance of the legislative  entries
in Schedule VII, Lists I and II of the Constitution, nor the
fiscal control by the Union per se are decisive to  conclude
that   the   Constitution  is	unitary.    The	  respective
legislative  powers are traceable to Articles 245 to 254  of
the Constitution.  The State qua the Constitution is federal
in structure and independent in its exercise of	 legislative
and  executive	power.	However, being the creature  of	 the
Constitution  the  State  has no right to  secede  or  claim
sovereignty.   Qua the Union, State is quasi-federal.	Both
are  coordinating institutions and ought to  exercise  their
respective   powers  with  adjustment,	 understanding	 and
accommodation to render socioeconomic and political  justice
to  the people, to preserve and elongate the  constitutional
goals including secularism.
</p><p id="p_362">248. The preamble of the Constitution is an integral part of
the  Constitution.  Democratic form of	Government,  federal
structure,  unity and integrity of the	nation,	 secularism,
socialism,  social  justice and judicial  review  are  basic
features of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_363">249. The  office  of  the Governor is a	 vital	link  and  a
channel	 of  impartial and objective  communication  of	 the
working	 of the Constitution by the State Government to	 the
President  of  India.	He  is	to  ensure  protection	 and
sustenance  of the constitutional process of the working  of
the Constitution in the State playing an impartial role.  As
head of the Executive he should truthfully with high  degree
of constitutional responsibility inform the President that a
situation  has arisen in which the constitutional  machinery
has failed and the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the  provisions  of the  Constitution  with  necessary
factual details in a non-partisan attitude.
</p><p id="p_364">250. The  Union of India shall protect the State  Government
and  as corollary under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_561">Article 356</a> it is enjoined that	 the
Government of every State should be carried on in accordance
with  the provisions of the Constitution.  On receipt  of  a
report from the Governor or otherwise the President (Council
of Ministers) on being satisfied that a situation has arisen
in  which the Government of a State cannot be carried on  in
accordance  with  the  provisions of  the  Constitution,  is
empowered  to  issue Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_562">Article	 356(1)</a>	 and
impose President's rule in the State in the manner laid down
in  sub-clauses	 (a)  to  (c)  of  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_563">Article  356(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_145">206</span>
<p id="p_365">251. The  exercise  of	the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_564">Article	 356</a>  is  an
extraordinary  one and needs to be used sparingly  when	 the
situation  contemplated by <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_565">Article 356</a> warrants to  maintain
democratic  form of Government and to prevent paralysing  of
the political process.	Single or individual act or acts  of
violation  of the Constitution for good, bad or	 indifferent
administration	does not necessarily constitute	 failure  of
the   constitutional  machinery	 or  characterises  that   a
situation  has arisen in which the Government of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.  The exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_566">Article	 356</a>
should under no circumstance be for a political gain to	 the
party  in power in the Union Government.  It should be	used
sparingly and with circumspection that the Government of the
State  function with responsibility in accordance  with	 the
provisions of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_366">252. Rule of law has been chosen as an instrument of  social
adjustment and resolution of conflicting social problems  to
integrate diverse sections of the society professing  multi-
religious  faiths,  creed, caste or region  fostering  among
them fraternity, transcending social, religious,  linguistic
or regional barriers.  Citizenship is either by birth or  by
domicile  and  not  as a member of  religion,  caste,  sect,
region	or  language.	Secularism  has	 both  positive	 and
negative  contents.   The  Constitution	 struck	 a   balance
between temporal parts confining it to the person professing
a  particular  religious faith or belief and allows  him  to
practice,  profess  and propagate his religion,	 subject  to
public	order,	morality and health.  The positive  part  of
secularism  has been entrusted to the State to	regulate  by
law  or by an executive order.	The State is  prohibited  to
patronise  any particular religion as State religion and  is
enjoined to observe neutrality.	 The State strikes a balance
to  ensure an atmosphere of full faith and confidence  among
its people to realise fill growth of personality and to make
him a rational being on secular lines, to improve individual
excellence,   regional	 growth,   progress   and   national
integrity.  Religion being susceptible to the individuals or
groups	 of   people  professing  a   particular   religion,
antagonistic  to  another  religion  or	 groups	 of  persons
professing  different religion, brings inevitable social  or
religious  frictions.  If religion is allowed  to  overplay,
social	disunity  is  bound to	erupt  leading	to  national
disintegration.	 Secularism is a part of the basic  features
of the Constitution.  Political parties, group of persons or
individuals  who would seek to influence  electoral  process
with a view to come to political power, should abide by	 the
Constitution and the laws including secularism, sovereignty,
integrity  of the nation.  They/he should not  mix  religion
with politics.	Religious tolerance and fraternity are basic
features and postulates of the Constitution as a scheme	 for
national  integration  and  sectional  or  religious  unity.
Programmes or principles evolved by political parties  based
on religion amounts to recognising religion as a part of the
political   governance	which  the  Constitution   expressly
prohibited.    It  violates  the  basic	 features   of	 the
Constitution.  Positive secularism negates such a policy and
any action in furtherance thereof would be violative of	 the
basic  features	 of  the Constitution.	Any act	 done  by  a
political party or the Government of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">207</span>
State  run by that party in furtherance of its programme  or
policy	would also be in violation of the  Constitution	 and
the  law.   When  the President receives  a  report  from  a
Governor   or  otherwise  had  such  information  that	 the
Government  of	the  State  is	not  being  carried  on	  in
accordance  with  the provisions of  the  Constitution,	 the
President is entitled to consider such report and reach	 his
satisfaction in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_367">253. A	person who challenges the Presidential	Proclamation
must  prove  strong prima facie case that  the	Presidential
Proclamation  is  unconstitutional  or invalid	and  not  in
accordance  with  law.	On the Court's satisfying  that	 the
strong	prima  facie case has been made out and if it  is  a
High   Court,  it  should  record  reasons  before   issuing
"discovery order nisi", summoning the records from the Union
of  India.   The Government is entitled to  claim  privilege
under  <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_567">Section 123</a> of the Indian Evidence Act and  also	 the
claim under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_568">Article 74(2)</a> of the Constitution.	The court is
to consider the records in camera before taking any  further
steps  in  the matter.	<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_569">Article 74(2)</a> is not a	barrier	 for
judicial  review.   It	only places  limitation	 to  examine
whether any advice and if so what advice was tendered by the
Council	 of  Ministers	to  the	 President.   <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_570">Article  74(2)</a>
receives   only	  this	limited	  protective   canopy	from
disclosure,  but  the  material on the basis  of  which	 the
advice	was tendered by the Council of Ministers is  subject
to judicial scrutiny.
</p><p id="p_368">254. The Union of India, when discovery order nisi is issued
by  this Court, would act in aid of the Court under  <a href="/doc/614338/" id="a_571">Article
142(2)</a>	and  is	 enjoined  to  produce	the  material,	 the
foundation  for action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_572">Article 356.</a>  As  held  earlier
before	calling upon the Union to produce the material,	 the
court  must first find strong prima facie case and when	 the
records are produced they are to be considered in camera.
</p><p id="p_369">255. Judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution.
This   Court/High  Courts  have	 constitutional	  duty	 and
responsibility	to exercise judicial review as	sentinel  on
the  qui  vive.	 Judicial review is not concerned  with	 the
merits	of  the decision, but with the manner in  which	 the
decision was taken.  The exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_573">Article
356</a>  is a constitutional exercise of the power.	 The  normal
subjective  satisfaction  of an administrative	decision  on
objective  basis  applied by the  courts  to  administrative
decisions  by  subordinate  officers  or  quasi-judicial  or
subordinate  legislation does not apply to the	decision  of
the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_574">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_370">256. Judicial	reveiw	must  be  distinguished	  from	 the
justiciability	by  the	 court.	 The two  concepts  are	 not
synonymous.   The power of judicial review is a	 constituent
power  and  cannot  be	abdicated  by  judicial	 process  of
interpretation.	  However,  justiciability of  the  decision
taken  by the President is one of exercise of the  power  by
the court hedged by self-imposed judicial restraint.  It  is
a  cardinal  principle	of our	Constitution  that  no	one,
howsoever lofty, can claim to be the sole judge of the power
given  under the Constitution.	Its actions are	 within	 the
confines of the powers given by the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">208</span>
<p id="p_371">257. This  Court  as  final  arbiter  in  interpreting	 the
Constitution,  declares what the law is.   Higher  judiciary
has  been assigned a delicate task to determine what  powers
the  Constitution  has	conferred  on  each  branch  of	 the
Government and whether the actions of that branch transgress
such limitations, it is the duty and responsibility of	this
Court/High   Courts  to	 lay  down  the	 law.	It  is	 the
constitutional duty to uphold the constitutional values	 and
to  enforce the constitutional limitations as  the  ultimate
interpreter  of	 the  Constitution.   The  judicial  review,
therefore,  extends to examine the constitutionality of	 the
Proclamation issued by the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_575">Article 356.</a>	  It
is a delicate task, though loaded with political  overtones,
to  be	exercised with circumspection and  great  care.	  In
deciding  finally  the validity of the	Proclamation,  there
cannot	be any hard and fast rules or fixed set of rules  or
principles  as	to  when  the  President's  satisfaction  is
justiciable and valid.
</p><p id="p_372">258. Justiciability  is	 not a legal concept  with  a  fixed
content,  nor is it susceptible of scientific  verification.
Its  use  is  the result of  many  pressures  or  variegated
reasons.  Justiciability may be looked at from the point  of
view  of  common sense limitation.  Judicial review  may  be
avoided on questions of purely political nature, though pure
legal  questions camouflaged by the political questions	 are
always	 justiciable.	The  courts  must  have	  judicially
manageable  standards  to decide a  particular	controversy.
Justiciability on a subjective satisfaction conferred in the
widest	terms to the political coordinate  executive  branch
created	 by the constitutional scheme itself is one  of	 the
considerations	to  be kept in view in	exercising  judicial
review.	 There is an initial presumption that the acts	have
been regularly performed by the President.
</p><p id="p_373">259. The  proviso  to <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_576">Article 74(1)</a> reinforces that  on	 the
advice	 tendered  by  the  Council  of	 Ministers  to	 the
President, the latter actively applies his mind and  reaches
the  satisfaction that a situation has arisen in  which	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with   the  provisions	of  the	 Constitution.	  The	word
"otherwise"  enlarges  the width and ambit  of	satisfaction
reached	 by the President.  In some cases such	satisfaction
lacks  judicially manageable standards for resolution.	 The
abuse  of  the power by	 high  constitutional  functionaries
cannot	be  assumed, but must be strictly proved.   It	also
cannot	be  assumed that the Presidential  Proclamation	 was
lightly issued.	 The exercise of discretionary	satisfaction
may  depend on diverse varied and variegated  circumstances.
The  Constitution  confided  exercise  of  the	power  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_577">Article	 356</a>  in  the highest executive	 of  the  land,	 the
President  of  India  aided and advised by  the	 Council  of
Ministers  at  its head by the Prime  Minister.	  The  Prime
Minister  and his Council of Ministers are collectively	 and
individually  responsible to Parliament and  accountable  to
the  people.   Confidence reposed on the  highest  executive
itself	is  a circumstance to be kept in view  in  adjudging
whether	 the  satisfaction  reached  by	 the  President	  is
vitiated by law.  It is impermissible to attribute bad faith
or  personal  mala  fides to the President in  the  face  of
constitutional prohibition of answerability by <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_578">Article	361.</a>
But if the proof of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">209</span>
 mala  fide abuse of power is available, appropriate  remedy
would be available in the Constitution under <a href="/doc/594857/" id="a_579">Article 61.</a>
</p><p id="p_374">260. The decision can be tested on the ground of legal	mala
fides,	or  high  irrationality	 in  the  exercise  of	 the
discretion  to issue Presidential Proclamation.	  Therefore,
the  satisfaction reached by the President for	issuing	 the
Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_580">Article 356</a> must be tested only on  those
grounds of unconstitutionality, but not on the grounds	that
the material which enabled him to reach the satisfaction was
not sufficient or inadequate.  The traditional parameters of
judicial  review, therefore, cannot be extended to the	area
of  exceptional	 and extraordinary  powers  exercised  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_581">Article	 356.</a>	The doctrine of	 proportionality  cannot  be
extended  to  the power exercised under	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_582">Article  356.</a>	 The
ultimate  appeal over the action of the President is to	 the
electorate and judicial self-restraint is called in aid,  in
which  event the faith of the people in the efficacy of	 the
judicial  review  would	 be strengthened  and  the  judicial
remedy becomes meaningful.
</p><p id="p_375">261. Under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_583">Article  356</a>  as soon  as  the  Proclamation  is
issued,	 under sub-clause (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_584">Article 356</a>, the  President
shall  seek  its  approval from both  Houses  of  Parliament
within	two months from the date of its issue unless  it  is
revoked	 in  the  meanwhile.   A  consistent  constitutional
convention   has  been	established  that  on  issuing	 the
Proclamation   the  President  on  his	assumption  of	 the
functions  of  the  Government	of  the	 State	directs	 the
Governor  to  exercise all the executive  functions  of	 the
Government  of	the  State with the aid and  advice  of	 the
appointed  Advisors.   He  declares that the  power  of	 the
Legislature  of the State shall be exercisable by  or  under
the  authority	of  Parliament	and  makes  incidental	 and
consequential  provisions  necessary to give effect  to	 the
object	of Proclamation by suspending whole or any  part  of
the operation of any provision of the Constitution  relating
to  any	 body  or  authority of	 the  State  which  includes
dissolution  of the Legislative Assembly and removal of	 the
State  Government.   Parliament	 exercises  the	 legislative
power  thereon under <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_585">Article 357</a> and in turn it	 confers  on
the  President the powers relating to entries in List II  of
the VIIth Schedule.  The Governor of the State with the	 aid
and advice of the advisors exercises the executive functions
on  behalf  of the President.  The convention  attained	 the
status	of  law.   This consistent law	has  been  operating
without	 any  constitutional hiatus.  Granting	of  stay  of
operation     of    Presidential    Proclamation     creates
constitutional	and administrative hiatus  and	incongruity.
The  Union and the State simultaneously cannot	operate	 the
legislative  and  executive  powers  in	 List  II  of  VIIth
Schedule   of	the  Constitution.    Thereby	simultaneous
bicameral  functions  by  the  Union and  the  State  is  an
anathema  to  the democratic  principle	 and  constitutional
scheme.	 It would lead to incongruity and incompatibility.
</p><p id="p_376">262. There  is no express provision in the  Constitution  to
revive	 the  Assembly	dissolved  under  the	Presidential
Proclamation  or to reinduct the removed Government  of	 the
State.	 In interpreting the Constitution on the working  of
the  democratic institutions set up under the  Constitution,
it  is impermissible to fill the gaps or to give  directions
to revive the dissolved
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">210</span>
Assembly  and  to reinduct the dismissed Government  of	 the
State  into office. Equally, stay cannot be granted  of	 the
operation of the Presidential Proclamation till both  Houses
of  Parliament	approve the Presidential  Proclamation.	 The
suspension without dissolution of theLegislative Assembly
of  the State also creates functional disharmony leading  to
constitutional crisis. The grant of stay of elections to the
Legislative    Assembly,   occasioned	pursuant   to	 the
Presidential   Proclamation,  also  creates   constitutional
crisis.	  Therefore,  the  courts  should  not	issue	such
directions   leaving   it  to  Parliament   to	 amend	 the
Constitution if need be.
</p><p id="p_377">263.The	 floor-test  may  be one  consideration	 which	the
Governor may keep in view.  But whether or not to resort  to
it would depend on prevailing situation.  The possibility of
horse-trading  is also to be kept in view having  regard  to
the  prevailing political situation.  It is not possible  to
formulate  or comprehend a set of rules for the exercise  of
the  power  by	the Governor  to  conduct  floor-test.	 The
Governor  should  be left free to deal	with  the  situation
according   to	his  best  judgment  keeping  in  view	 the
Constitution and the conventions of the parliamentary system
of  Government.	 Though Sarkaria Commission  and  Rajamannar
Commission, headed by two distinguished Judges of this land,
recommended  floor-test, it could only mean that that  is  a
consideration which must cross the mind of the Governor.  It
would  suffice to say that the Governor should be  alive  to
the situation but he would be the sole judge on the question
whether or not conditions are conducive to resort to  floor-
test.
</p><p id="p_378">264.The	 satisfaction reached by the President	in  issuing
Presidential  Proclamation  and dissolving  the	 Legislative
Assemblies of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh
cannot	be faulted as it was based on the fact of  violation
of the secular features of the Constitution which itself  is
a  ground to hold that a situation has arisen in  which	 the
Government  of the States concerned cannot be carried on  in
accordance   with  the	provisions  of	 the   Constitution.
Therefore,   the   satisfaction	 cannot	 be   said   to	  be
unwarranted.  The appeals of the Union from the judgment  of
the Madhya Pradesh High Court is allowed accordingly and the
judgment of the High Court is set aside.  The dissolution of
the  Meghalaya	Assembly  though  vulnerable  to  attack  as
unconstitutional,   it	 has  become  infructuous   due	  to
subsequent elections and the newly elected State Legislature
and the Government of the State of Meghalaya are functioning
thereafter.   Therefore, no futile writs could be issued  as
the  Court does not act in vain.  The appeal of	 Bommai	 and
the transferred petitions are accordingly dismissed, but  in
the circumstances without costs.

appear	to be inspired by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_589">Section 45</a> and Section 93  of	 the
Government  of	India Act, 1935.  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_590">Article 356</a>,	however,  is
qualitatively
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">211</span>
different, while the Pakistani provisions are more akin	  to
the  provisions	 of  1935  Act.	  Under	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_591">Article  356</a>,	 the
President  is  empowered  to remove  the  State	 Government,
dissolve the Legislative Assembly of the State and take over
the  functions of the Government of the State in case he  is
satisfied  that	 the  Government of  that  State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	In  the context of the	Indian	Constitution
[more  specifically after the amendment of <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_592">Article 74(1)</a>  by
the 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_593">(Amendment) Act</a> this really is the power vested  in
the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister at the
Centre.	 The action can be taken either on the report of the
Governor  or on the basis of information received  otherwise
or both.  An awesome power indeed.  The only check envisaged
by the Constitution  apart from the judicial review  is	 the
approval by both Houses of Parliament which in practice	 has
proved to be ineffective, as this judgment will demonstrate.
And  with  respect to judicial review of  the  action  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_594">Article	 356</a>,  serious	reservations are  expressed  by	 the
counsel	 for the Union of India and other  respondents.	  If
what  they say is accepted, there is a danger of this  power
eroding	 the  very  federal  structure	of  our	 State	 and
introducing  a	serious	 imbalance  in	our   constitutional
scheme.	   It  is,  therefore,	necessary  to	define	 the
parameters  of	this power and the parameters  'of  judicial
review	 in   these   matters  in  the	 interest   of	 our
constitutional system.	It is for this reason that we  heard
elaborate  arguments from all the parties before us  on	 the
meaning,  scope	 and  dimensions of  the  power	 under	this
article.   We  may say, we are fully aware of  the  delicate
nature	of  the	 problem.   We are  aware  that	 though	 the
questions  raised  herein are constitutional  in  character,
they  do have political overtones.  It is quite likely	that
our  views  will  not be found palatable by  some  but	that
probably   cannot   be	 helped.   Sworn   to	uphold	 the
Constitution, we must say what the article says and means.
</p><p id="p_380">266.It	is true that on account of elections  having  taken
place  subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  Proclamations
impugned herein, no effective relief can be granted in these

herein	that we should express ourselves on all	 the  issues
arising	 herein	 so that the principles enunciated  by	this

concerned.
</p><p id="p_381">		<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_595">ARTICLE 356:</a> THE BACKGROUND
</p><p id="p_382">267.India  became  a  British  colony  in  the	year  1858.
Roughly two-thirds of it was under direct British rule while
the remaining one-third was under the rulership of more than
500  Princes, who in turn were directly under the  thumb  of
the  British Crown.  The 1935 Act introduced, for the  first
time,  the concept of division of powers between the  Centre
and  the provinces.  Most of the powers were  retained	with
the  Centre.  The Provincial Governments were kept under  an
ever-watchful and all powerful Centre.	The Governors in the
provinces  and the Governor General at the Centre  exercised
real  and  substantial power, unlike the Governors  and	 the
President under the Constitution. From the British point  of
view,  it was an experiment, the first one, in self-rule  by
the Indians.  A few powers were entrusted to the elected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">212</span>
Governments  at the Centre or in the provinces;	 even  those
could  be resumed and taken back by the Governor General  or
Governor, as the case may be, whenever he was satisfied that
the Government at the Centre or of the province could not be
carried	 on  in accordance with the provisions of  the	Act.
Governor General and Governor, under the 1935 Act, meant the
imperial colonial power.  Evidently, the British  Parliament
was  not  prepared to trust the	 Indian	 political  parties.
Many of them were opposed to British rule and some of  their
leaders	 had  declared	openly that  they  would  enter	 the
Legislatures  and  the Government with a view to  break	 the
system from within.  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_596">Sections 45</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_597">93</a> were the products of
this mistrust.
</p><p id="p_383">268.But then Why was a provision like <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_598">Article 356</a> ever made
in  the Constitution?  What was the occasion  and  necessity
for  it?  For ascertaining this, we may have to turn to	 the
debates	 in  the Constituent Assembly.	The  draft  Articles
277-A  and 278 (corresponding to Articles 355 and 356)	were
taken  up for consideration on August 3, 1949.	It would  be
appropriate to read both Articles 355 and 356 as enacted  by
the Constituent Assembly :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_98">	      "355.   Duty  of the Union to  protect  States

</blockquote><p id="p_384">Dr B.R. Ambedkar was of the view that the Constitution	must
provide	 for  situation of breakdown of	 the  constitutional
machinery   in	the  States  analogous	to  the	  provisions
contained  in  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_599">Section 93</a> of the 1935 Act.  If	a  situation
arises, for whatever reason, where the Government of a State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution, he said, the President of India  must  be
empowered  to  remedy it.  For that purpose, he	 could	take
over  all or any of the functions of the Government as	well
as of the State Legislature.  He could also make such  other
provisions  as he may think necessary  including  suspension
of the provisions of the Constitution except those  relating
to High Court.	This power, he stated, must be understood in
the context of draft <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_600">Article 277-A (<a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_601">Article 355</a></a>), which cast
an obligation upon the Union to protect every State  against
external  aggression and internal disturbance and to  ensure
that  the  Government  of  every  State	 is  carried  on  in
accordance  with  the provisions of  the  Constitution.	  To
discharge this obligation, he said, the Centre must be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">214</span>
empowered to take over the Government of the State.  At	 the
same time, he said, the President is not expected to act  in
a  wanton or arbitrary manner but on the basis of  a  report
from  the Governor or on the basis of other material in	 his
possession, as the case may be.
</p><p id="p_385">269.Several members strongly opposed the incorporation of a
provision like the one contained in draft <a href="/doc/999886/" id="a_602">Article 278</a> on the
ground	inter  alia that it would be an	 invasion  upon	 the
field  reserved	 for  the States  and  that  permitting	 the
President  to take over the Government of the State even  on
the  basis  of the information	received  "otherwise"	i.e.
without there being a report of the Governor to that effect,
was  bound  to be abused.  A few members pleaded  that	this
power should be exercised only on the report of the Governor
and that the words "or otherwise" should be deleted from the
article.   All	these  objections  were	 overridden  by	  Dr
Ambedkar  with	the  argument  that  no	 provision  of	 any
Constitution, for that matter, is immune from being  abused.
He  then  made	this significant  statement  :	(Constituent
Assembly Debates, Vol.	IX, p. 177)
	      "In  fact I share the sentiments expressed  by
	      my  honourable friend Mr Gupte yesterday	that
	      the  proper thing we ought to expect  is	that
	      such  articles  will  never  be  called	into
	      operation	 and that they would remain  a	dead
	      letter.	If  at	all they  are  brought	into
	      operation,  I  hope  the	President,  who	  is
	      endowed  with these powers, will	take  proper
	      precautions  before  actually  suspending	 the
	      administration of the provinces."
</p><p id="p_386">	      He added:
</p><p id="p_387">	      "I hope the first thing he will do would be to
	      issue  a mere warning to a province  that	 has
	      erred,  that things were not happening in	 the
	      way  in which they were intended to happen  in
	      the Constitution."
</p><p id="p_388">270.<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_603">Article 356</a> was thus conceived as a mechanism to ensure
that the Government of the State is carried on in accordance
with  the provisions of the Constitution.   Democratic	rule
based on adult franchise was being introduced for the  first
time.  Almost 1/3rd of the country, under princely rule, had
never  known elections.	 Rule of law was a novelty in  those
areas.	 The  infant democracy required	 careful  nurturing.
Many  a	 hiccup	 was expected in the  days  to	come.	This
perhaps	 explains the need for a provision like the  one  in
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_604">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_389">271.<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_605">Article 356</a> finds place in Part XVIII which carries the
heading	 "Emergency  Provisions".  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_606">Article  352</a>,  the  first
article	 in  this Part, empowers the President of  India  to
proclaim emergency in the country or any part thereof if  he
is  satisfied  that  a grave emergency	exists	whereby	 the
security of India or any part thereof is threatened  whether
by war, external aggression or armed rebellion. (By the 44th
Amendment,  the words "armed rebellion" were substituted  in
the  place of the words "internal  disturbance").   Articles
353  and 354 set out the effects of such a Proclamation	 and
provide	 for certain incidental matters.  <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_607">Article  355</a>,	 set
out  hereinbefore, imposes a duty upon the Union to  protect
the  States against external aggression and armed  rebellion
and  also  to ensure that the Government of every  State  is
carried on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_154">215</span>
in  accordance	with  the provisions  of  the  Constitution.
Articles 355, 356 and 357 go together.	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_608">Article 356</a> provides
for  the  action to be taken by the President  where  he  is
satisfied   that  a  situation	has  arisen  in	 which	 the
Government  of	a State cannot be carried on  in  accordance
with  the  provisions  of  the	Constitution  by  making   a
Proclamation in that behalf, while <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_609">Article 357</a> sets out	 the
powers	 that  can  be	exercised  by  Parliament   when   a
Proclamation  under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_610">Article 356</a> is in  operation.   Articles
358  and  359 deal with suspending  of	certain	 fundamental
rights during the period the Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_611">Article	 352</a>
is in operation, while <a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_612">Article 360</a> empowers the President to
declare financial emergency in certain situations.
</p><p id="p_390">272.In	a  sense,  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_613">Article 356</a> is  an  emergency  provision
though,	 it is true, it is qualitatively different from	 the
emergency  contemplated by <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_614">Article 352</a>, or for that  matter,
from  the financial emergency contemplated by  <a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_615">Article	360.</a>
Undoubtedly, breakdown of the constitutional machinery in  a
State	does  gives  rise  to  a  situation  of	  emergency.
Emergency means a situation which is not normal, a situation
which calls for urgent remedial action.	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_616">Article 356</a> confers
a  power  to be exercised by the  President  in	 exceptional
circumstances  to discharge the obligation cast upon him  by
<a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_617">Article	 355.</a>  It is a measure to protect and  preserve	 the
Constitution, consistent with his oath.	 He is as much bound
to  exercise  this  power in  a	 situation  contemplated  by
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_618">Article	 356</a>  as  he is bound not to use  it  where  such  a
situation has not really arisen.
</p><p id="p_391">273.By the 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_619">(Amendment) Act</a> of the Constitution, clause
(5)  was added in <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_620">Article 356.</a>	It was deleted by  the	44th
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_621">(Amendment)  Act</a> which incorporated an altogether  different
provision  as clause (5).  It would be appropriate  to	take
the article as it now stands while trying to understand	 its
meaning, purpose and scope.  But before we do that, it would
be   appropriate  to  examine  the  nature  of	the   Indian
Federation as ordained by our Constitution.
THE FEDERAL NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION
</p><p id="p_392">274.The	  expression  "Federation"  or	"federal  form	 of
Government"  has no fixed meaning.  It broadly	indicates  a
division  of powers between a Central  (federal)  Government
and  the units (States) comprised therein.  No	two  federal
constitutions  are  alike.   Each of them,  be	it  of	USA,
Canada,	 Australia  or	of any other country,  has  its	 own
distinct  character.   Each of them is	the  culmination  of
certain historical process.  So is our Constitution.  It is,
therefore,   futile  to	 try  to  ascertain  and   fit	 our
Constitution   into  any  particular  mould.   It  must	  be
understood  in the light of our own historical	process	 and
the  constitutional evolution.	One thing is clear   it	 was
not  a case of independent States coming together to form  a
Federation as in the case of USA.
</p><p id="p_393">275.A  review of the provisions of the	Constitution  shows
unmistakably that while creating a federation, the  Founding
Fathers	 wished to establish a strong Centre.  In the  light
of the past history of this sub-continent, this was probably
a  natural and necessary decision.  In a land as  varied  as
India is, a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_155">216</span>
strong	Centre	is perhaps a necessity.	 This  bias  towards
Centre is reflected in the distribution of legislative heads
between the Centre and States.	All the more important heads
of  legislation	 are  placed  in  List	I.  Even  among	 the
legislative  heads  mentioned in List II, several  of  them,
e.g., Entries 2, 13, 17, 23, 24, 26, 27, 32, 33, 50, 57	 and
63 are either limited by or made subject to certain  entries
in  List  I  to	 some or the  other  extent.   Even  in	 the
Concurrent  List (List III), the parliamentary enactment  is
given  the  primacy, irrespective of the fact  whether	such
enactment  is earlier or later in point of time to  a  State
enactment on the same subject-matter.  Residuary powers	 are
with the Centre.  By the 42nd Amendment, quite a few of	 the
entries in List II were omitted and/or transferred to  other
lists.	Above all, <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_622">Article 3</a> empowers Parliament to form new
States	out of existing States either by merger or  division
as also to increase, diminish or alter the boundaries of the
States.	  In the process, existing States may disappear	 and
new  ones  may	come into existence.  As  a  result  of	 the
Reorganization of States Act, 1956, fourteen States and	 six
Union  Territories  came  into existence  in  the  place  of
twentyseven  States  and one area.  Even the  names  of	 the
States can be changed by Parliament unilaterally.  The	only
requirement,  in all this process, being the one  prescribed
in  the	 proviso to <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_623">Article 3</a>, viz.,  ascertainment  of	 the
views of the Legislatures of the affected States.  There  is
single citizenship, unlike USA.	 The judicial organ, one  of
the  three  organs of the State, is one and single  for	 the
entire country	again unlike USA, where you have the federal
judiciary  and State judiciary separately.  Articles 249  to
252  further demonstrate the primacy of Parliament.  If	 the
Rajya  Sabha passes a resolution by 2/3rd majority  that  in
the  national  interest, Parliament should  make  laws	with
respect	 to  any  matter in List II, Parliament	 can  do  so
(<a href="/doc/1883579/" id="a_624">Article  249</a>), no doubt, for a limited period.	 During	 the
operation  of  a Proclamation of emergency,  Parliament	 can
make  laws  with respect to any matter in List	II  (Article
</p><p id="p_394">250).	Similarly,  Parliament has power to  make  laws	 for
giving effect to International Agreements (<a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_625">Article 253</a>).  So
far  as the finances are concerned, the States again  appear
to have been placed in a less favourable position, an aspect
which has attracted a good amount of criticism at the  hands
of  the States and the proponents of the  States'  autonomy.
Several	 taxes	are collected by the Centre and	 made  over,
either	partly or fully, to the States.	 Suffice it  to	 say
that  Centre has been made far more powerful  vis-a-vis	 the
States.	 Correspondingly, several obligations too are placed
upon  the Centre including the one in <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_626">Article 355</a>  the	duty
to  protect  every  State against  external  aggression	 and
internal  disturbance.	 Indeed, this very  article  confers
greater	 power	upon the Centre in the name  of	 casting  an
obligation upon it, viz., "to ensure that the Government  of
every State is carried on in accordance with the  provisions
of  this Constitution".	 It is both a responsibility  and  a
power.
</p><p id="p_395">276.The	 fact  that under the scheme of	 our  Constitution,
greater	 power	is conferred upon the Centre  vis-a-vis	 the
States does not mean that States are mere appendages of	 the
Centre.	  Within  the sphere allotted to  them,	 States	 are
supreme.  The Centre cannot tamper with their powers.	More
particularly, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_156">217</span>
courts	should	not adopt an  approach,	 an  interpretation,
which  has  the	 effect of or tends to have  the  effect  of
whittling  down the powers reserved to the States.  It is  a
matter	of  common  knowledge that  over  the  last  several
decades,  the trend the world over is towards  strengthening
of  Central  Governments  be it the result  of	advances  in
technological/scientific fields or otherwise, and that	even
In   USA   the	 Centre	 has  become   far   more   powerful
notwithstanding	 the  obvious bias in that  Constitution  in
favour of the States.  All this must put the court on  guard
against	 any conscious whittling down of the powers  of	 the
States.	  Let it be said that the federalism in	 the  Indian
Constitution is not a matter of administrative	convenience,
but  one  of principle	the outcome of	our  own  historical
process	 and  a recognition of the ground  realities.	This
aspect has been dealt with elaborately by Shri M.C. Setalvad
in his Tagore Law Lectures "Union and State relations  under
the  Indian  Constitution"  (Eastern  Law  House,  Calcutta,
1974).	 The nature of the Indian federation with  reference
to   its   historical  background,   the   distribution	  of
legislative powers, financial and administrative  relations,
powers	of taxation, provisions relating to trade,  commerce
and industry, have all been dealt with analytically.  It  is
not possible  nor is it necessary  for the present  purposes
to   refer  to	them.	It  is	enough	to  note  that	 our
Constitution  has certainly a bias towards Centre  vis-a-vis
the States Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. State of
Rajasthan51.   It  is equally necessary	 to  emphasise	that
courts should be careful not to upset the delicately-crafted
constitutional scheme by a process of interpretation.

		 AN ANALYSIS OF <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_631">ARTICLE 356</a>
</p><p id="p_399">279.The	 heading  of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_632">Article 356</a>  characterises  it  as  a
provision providing for failure of constitutional  machinery
in  States.   Clause (1), however, does not  use  the  words
"failure   of  constitutional  machinery".   Even  so,	 the
significance   of  the	title  of  the	section	 cannot	  be
overlooked.   It  emphasises  the  level,  the	stage,	 the
situation in which the power is to be exercised.  Clause (1)
speaks	of the President being satisfied "that	a  situation
has  arisen in which the Government of the State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	this
Constitution".	 If so satisfied, he may,  by  Proclamation,
assume	and  exercise the several powers mentioned  in	sub-
clauses (a), (b) and (c).  An analysis of clause (1) of	 the
article	 yields	 the  following ingredients  :	(a)  if	 the
President  is satisfied; (b) on receipt of report  from	 the
Governor  of  State or otherwise; (c) that a  situation	 has
arisen	in  which  the Government of  the  State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution;  (d)  the President may by  Proclamation,	 (i)
assume	to  himself  all  or any of  the  functions  of	 the
Government  of the State or all or any of the powers of	 the
Governor or any other body or authority in the State  except
the  Legislature of the State; (ii) declare that the  powers
of  the	 Legislature  of the State  shall  be  exercised  by
Parliament  or	under  its authority; and  (iii)  make	such
incidental  or consequential provisions as appear to him  to
be  necessary or desirable for giving effect to the  objects
of  the Proclamation including provisions for suspending  in
whole  or  in part the operation of any provisions  of	this
Constitution relating to any body or authority in the State.
The proviso to clause (1) clarifies that nothing in the said
clause	shall authorise the President to assume	 to  himself
any  of the powers vested in or exercisable by a High  Court
or  to	suspend	 in  whole or  part  the  operation  of	 any
provisions  relating to High Courts.  Clause (2)  says	that
any  Proclamation under clause (1) can be revoked or  varied
by  a  subsequent Proclamation.	 Clause	 (3)  provides	that
every  Proclamation  issued  under  clause  (1)	 (except   a
Proclamation revoking a previous Proclamation) shall be laid
before	each  House of Parliament and "shall  ...  cease  to
operate	 at the expiration of two months unless	 before	 the
expiration   of	 that  period  it  has	been   approved	  by
resolutions  of both Houses of Parliament".  The proviso  to
clause	(3) provides for a situation where the Lok Sabha  is
dissolved  on the date of the Proclamation or  is  dissolved
within	two  months of such Proclamation.  Clause  (4)	says
that a Proclamation so approved by both Houses of Parliament
shall,	unless	revoked	 earlier, cease to  operate  on	 the
expiration of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">219</span>
  period  of six months. (By the 42nd Amendment,  the  words
'one  year' were substituted for the words 'six months'	 but
by  the	 44th Amendment, the words 'six	 months'  have	been
restored).   The  three provisos to clause (4)	provide	 for
certain	 situations  which  it is not necessary	 for  us  to
consider  for  the purpose of these cases.  Clause  (5),  as
inserted by the 38th Amendment ran as follows :
"(5)  Notwithstanding  anything in  this  Constitution,	 the
satisfaction of the President mentioned in clause (1)  shall
be  final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in	 any
court on any grounds."
</p><p id="p_400">By  the	 44th Amendment, however, this clause  was  repealed
altogether  and	 in its place a new  clause  (5)  introduced
which	limits	the  maximum  period,  for  which   such   a
Proclamation can be operative, to one year except in a	case
where  a Proclamation of emergency is in operation.   It  is
not necessary to consider clause (5) also for the purpose of
these cases.
</p><p id="p_401">280.The	 power	conferred by <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_633">Article 356</a> is  a	conditioned
power;	it is not an absolute power to be exercised  in	 the
discretion of the President.  The condition is the formation
of  satisfaction  subjective, no doubt	that a situation  of
the  type  contemplated	 by the	 clause	 has  arisen.	This
satisfaction may be formed on the basis of the report of the
Governor  or on the basis of other information	received  by
him  or	 both.	 The existence of  relevant  material  is  a
precondition  to the formation of satisfaction.	 The use  of
the  word  'may'  indicates not only  a	 discretion  but  an
obligation to consider the advisability and necessity of the
action.	 It also involves an obligation to consider which of
the several steps specified in sub-clauses (a), (b) and	 (c)
should be taken and to what extent?  The dissolution of	 the
Legislative Assembly assuming that it is permissible  is not
a  matter of course.  It should be resorted to only when  it
is necessary for achieving the purposes of the Proclamation.
The exercise of the power is made subject to approval of the
both  Houses of Parliament.  Clause (3) is both a  check  on
the power and a safeguard against abuse of power.
Clause	(1):  Clause  (1)  opens  with	the  words  "if	 the
President ... is satisfied".  These words are indicative  of
the   satisfaction  being  a  subjective  one.	 <a href="/doc/1748256/" id="a_634">In   Barium
Chemicals  Ltd. v. Company Law Board6</a>  a  decision  followed
uniformly  ever since it was pronounced	 Shelat, J.  pointed
out,  on  a  consideration of  several	English	 and  Indian
authorities that the expressions "is satisfied", "is of	 the
opinion",  "or	has reasons to believe"	 are  indicative  of
subjective  satisfaction, though it is true that the  nature
of  the	 power	has  to	 be  determined	 on  a	totality  of
consideration of all relevant provisions.  Indeed, there was
no controversy before us regarding the nature of this power.
Clause (1), it may be noted, uses the words "is	 satisfied",
which  indicates  a  more definite state  of  mind  than  is
indicated  by  the expressions "is of the opinion"  or	"has
reasons	 to  believe".	 Since it is a	case  of  subjective
satisfaction,  question	 of  observing	the  principles	  of
natural justice does not and cannot arise.  Having regard to
the nature of the power
6    1966 Supp SCR 31 1: AIR 1967 SC 295: (1966) 36 Comp Cas
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">639</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_160">220</span>
and  the situation in which it is supposed to be  exercised,
principles  of natural justice cannot be imported  into	 the
clause.	  It  is  evident that the satisfaction	 has  to  be
formed	by the President fairly, on a consideration  of	 the
report of the Governor and/or other material, if any, placed
before him.  of course, the President under our Constitution
being,	what  may  be  called,	a  constitutional  President
obliged	 to  act upon the aid and advice of the	 Council  of
Ministers which aid and advice is binding upon him by virtue
of  clause (1) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_635">Article 741</a>, the satisfaction referred  to
in <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_636">Article 356(1)</a> really means the satisfaction of the Union
Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at its head.
280-A.	 Clause (1) requires the President to  be  satisfied
that  a situation has arisen in which the Government of	 the
State  "cannot"	 be  carried  on  "in  accordance  with	 the
provisions   of	 this  Constitution".	The  word   "cannot"
emphasises the type of situation contemplated by the clause.
These  words read with the title of the article	 "provisions
in  case of failure of constitutional machinery	 in  States"
emphasise the nature of the situation contemplated.
</p><p id="p_402">281.The	 words "provisions of this Constitution" mean  what
they say.  The said words cannot be limited or confined to a
particular  chapter in the Constitution or to  a  particular
set   of  articles.   While  construing	  a   constitutional
provision,  such  a limitation ought not  to  be  ordinarily
inferred  unless the context does clearly so  require.	 The
provisions of the Constitution include the chapter  relating
to  Fundamental	 Rights, the chapter relating  to  Directive
Principles  of	State  Policy as also the  preamble  to	 the
Constitution.	Though,	 at one time, it  was  thought	that
preamble  does not form part of the Constitution, that	view
is  no longer extant.  It has been held by the	majority  of
Judges	in  <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_637">Kesavananda Bharati v. State  of  Kerala35</a>	that
preamble  does form part of the Constitution.  It cannot  be
otherwise.   The attempt to limit the said words to  certain
machinery provisions in the Constitution is misconceived and
cannot be given effect to.  It is difficult to believe	that
the  said words do not take in fundamental  provisions	like
the fundamental rights in Chapter III.	It must, however, be
remembered that it is not each and every non-compliance with
a  particular provision of the Constitution that  calls	 for
the  exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_638">Article 356(1).</a>   The	non-
compliance  or violation of the Constitution should be	such
as  to	lead  to  or given rise to  a  situation  where	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the  provisions  of the Constitution.   It  is  indeed
difficult  nor	is it advisable	 to  catalogue	the  various
situations  which  may arise and which	would  be  comprised
within	clause	(1).  It would be more appropriate  to	deal
with concrete cases as and when they arise.
</p><p id="p_403">282.The satisfaction of the President referred to in clause
(1) may be formed either on the receipt of the report(s)  of
the  Governor  or  otherwise.  The Governor of	a  State  is
appointed by the President under <a href="/doc/686327/" id="a_639">Article 155.</a>  He is  indeed
a part of the Government of the State.	The executive  power
of  the	 State	is vested in him and  is  exercised  by	 him
directly   or  through	officers  subordinate  to   him	  in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution
35 1954 SCR 1005: AIR 1954 SC 282
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_161">221</span>
 (<a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_640">Article 154</a>).	 All executive action of the Government of a
State is expressed to be taken in the name of the  Governor,
except	a few functions which he is required to exercise  in
his discretion.	 He has to exercise his powers with the	 aid
and  advice  of	 the Council of	 Ministers  with  the  Chief
Minister  at  its head (<a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_641">Article 163</a>).  He  takes  the  oath,
prescribed  by <a href="/doc/586056/" id="a_642">Article 159</a>, to preserve, protect and  defend
the  Constitution and the laws to the best of  his  ability.
It  is this obligation which requires him to report  to	 the
President the commissions and omissions of the Government of
his  State  which  according to him  are  creating  or	have
created a situation where the Government of the State cannot
be  carried  on	 in accordance with the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution.  In fact, it would be a case of his  reporting
against	 his  own Government but this may be a case  of	 his
wearing	 two hats, one as the head of the  State  Government
and the other as the holder of an independent constitutional
office whose duty it is to preserve, protect and defend	 the
Constitution (<a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_643">See Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab22</a>)	(SCC
p.  849 : SCR at p. 835).  Since he cannot himself take	 any
action	of  the nature contemplated by	<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_644">Article	 356(1</a>),  he
reports	 the  matter  to the President and  it	is  for	 the
President to be satisfied  whether on the basis of the	said
report or on the basis of any other information which he may
receive otherwise that situation of the nature	contemplated
by <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_645">Article 356(1)</a> has arisen.  It is then and only then that
he can issue the Proclamation.	Once the Proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_646">Article	 356(1)</a>	 is issued or simultaneously  with  it,	 the
President  can	take  any or all the  actions  specified  in
clauses (a), (b) and (c).
</p><p id="p_404">  Power	 of the President to dissolve  Legislative  Assembly
of the State :
</p><p id="p_405">283.We shall now examine whether clause (1) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_647">Article	356</a>
empowers the President to dissolve the Legislative  Assembly
of  the State.	There are two points of view  which  we	 may
set out before expressing our preference :
</p><p id="p_406">284.ONE VIEW, which is supported by the opinions of some of
the learned Judges in <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_648">State of Rajasthan v. Union of  India3</a>
is  that  the power of the dissolution is implicit  in	sub-
clause (a).  The reasoning runs thus : The President assumes
the functions of the Government of the State as well as	 the
powers	of  the	 Governor under	 the  said  sub-clause;	 the
Legislative Assembly can be dissolved by the Governor  under
<a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_649">Article	 174(2)(b);</a> of course, this may have to be  done  on
the  advice  of	 the Council of	 Ministers  with  the  Chief
Minister at its head; since the President assumes to himself
the  powers  and functions of both the	Government  and	 the
Governor,  he can dissolve the Legislative Assembly as	part
of the same Proclamation or by a subsequent order.
</p><p id="p_407">285.THE	 OTHER VIEW, which says that the President  has	 no
such power, runs along the following lines.  The clause does
not speak of dismissal of the Government or the	 dissolution
of  the Legislative Assembly. It says that if the  President
is satisfied "that a situation has arisen in which
22 (1974) 2 SCC 831: 1974 SCC (L &amp; S) 550: (1975) 1 SCR 814
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_162">222</span>
the  Government	 of  the  State	 cannot	 be  carried  on  in
accordance  with the provisions of this	 Constitution",	 the
President  may	(i)  assume to himself all  or	any  of	 the
functions  of  the Government of the State; (ii)  assume  to
himself all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by
the  Governor;	(iii) assume to himself all or	any  of	 the
functions  of any body or authority in the State other	than
the  Legislature of the State, (iv) declare that the  powers
of  the Legislature of the State shall be exercisable by  or
under  the  authority  of  Parliament  and  (v)	 make	such
incidental  or consequential provision, as may be  necessary
for  giving effect to the Proclamation including  suspending
in  whole  or part the operation of any	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution relating to any body or authority in the  State
except	the High Court.	 Now, when subclause (a)  speaks  of
the  President assuming to himself all or any of the  powers
vested in or exercisable by the Governor, it surely does not
mean  or  imply	 dismissal  or	removal	 of  the   Governor.
Similarly,  the assuming by the President of all or  any  of
the  functions	or powers of any body or  authority  in	 the
State  (other  than the Legislature of the State)  does	 not
mean the dismissal or dissolution of such body or authority.
For  the  same reason, it must be held that the	 words	"the
President may assume to himself all or any of the  functions
of the Government of the State" in sub-clause (a) do not  by
themselves mean the dismissal of the State Government.	 But
if  these words are read along with the main limb of  clause
(1) which speaks of a situation in which "the Government  of
the  State  cannot  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of	this  Constitution", it can  and  does	mean
dismissal  of the Government for the reason that  Government
of  the State is carried on by the Government of  the  State
alone,This  dismissal  is  not absolute in the	sense  of  a
physical death of a living being.  It only means putting the
Government out of the way.  Such dismissal does not preclude
the President from restoring the Government after the period
of Proclamation is over, or at any time earlier by  revoking
the Proclamation, if he is so advised.	Coming to sub-clause
</p><p id="p_408">(b),  when  it speaks of the powers of	Legislature  of	 the
State  being  made exercisable by Parliament, or  under	 its
authority, it cannot and does not mean or imply	 dissolution
of the Legislature of the State.  It is significant to	note
that  the sub-clause refers to Legislature of the State	 and
not Legislative Assembly.  In a given State, the Legislature
may  consist of Legislative Assembly as well as	 Legislative
Council.   In  such  a case, there can	be  no	question  of
dissolving the Legislative Council since it is a  continuing
body [<a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_650">Article 172(3)].</a>	Only the Legislative Assembly can be
dissolved [<a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_651">Article 174(2)(b)].</a>	In other words, there can be
no question of dissolution of the "Legislature of the State"
the expression employed in sub-clause (b).  The question may
then  arise, why was sub-clause (b) put in and what does  it
imply?	 The answer must be that when the Government of	 the
State  is dismissed or removed from office, the	 Legislative
Assembly  cannot  function  normally.  It  is  difficult  to
visualise  a  Legislative  Assembly,  or  for  that   matter
Legislature,  functioning  without a Council  of  Ministers,
i.e., Government.  Thus, where the Government of a State  is
dismissed or removed from the office, the Legislature of the
State becomes ipso facto unworkable.  It is for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_163">			     223</span>
this reason that sub-clause (b) provides that the powers  of
the  Legislature  of the State shall be	 exercisable  by  or
under  the authority of Parliament.  Indeed, the  very	fact
that  clause (b) has provided for only one  situation  (viz.
the  powers of the Legislature being vested  in	 Parliament)
means  and implies that any other step like  dissolution  of
the Legislative Assembly was not within the contemplation of
the  Constitution-makers.   Sub-clause	(c)  empowers	that
President   to	 make  such  incidental	  or   consequential
provisions  as may appear to be necessary or  desirable	 for
giving	effect	to the objects of  the	Proclamation.	Such
incidental  or	consequential provisions  may  also  include
"suspending in whole or part the operation of any provisions
of  this  Constitution relating to any	body  or  authority"
except,	 of course, the High Court.  The provisions  of	 the
Constitution  relating	to the Legislative Assembly  of	 the
State  may  be	suspended under sub-clause  (c)	 during	 the
period of Proclamation	generally referred to as keeping the
Legislative  Assembly under suspended animation	 to  prevent
the  majority  party (or any other party) calling  upon	 the
Governor  to  invite  it to form  the  Ministry	 and/or	 for
preventing  the	 Legislature  from  passing  resolutions  or
transacting  other  business which may	interfere  with	 the
President's rule in the State.	It is significant to  notice
in  this  connection that during  the  Constituent  Assembly
debates	 on  these  articles,  Dr  Ambedkar  only  spoke  of
suspension  of the powers of the Legislatures and not  their
dissolution.  (Vide Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol.	 IX,
page 134.)
</p><p id="p_409">286.According	to  this  line	of  reasoning  'since	the
Legislature  of the State can only be kept  under  suspended
animation  by  suspending  the relevant	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution   the Legislature of the State springs back  to
life with the expiry of the period of Proclamation.  This is
for  the  reason  that	with the expiry	 of  the  period  of
Proclamation  or on the revocation of the  Proclamation,  as
the  case  may be, the suspension of the provisions  of	 the
Constitution will also come to an end.
</p><p id="p_410">287.The proponents of this view criticize the other (first)
view on several grounds	 firstly, they say, it does not seem
to take into consideration the fact that dissolution of	 the
Legislative  Assembly is an extremely serious step; if	this
power  was supposed to be conferred on the  President  under
clause	(1)  of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_652">Article 356</a>, the  Constitution-makers  would
have  said  so	expressly and not left it  to  be  inferred.
Secondly,  it ignores the language of sub-clause (b).	Sub-
clause	(b)  speaks  of "powers of the	Legislature  of	 the
State" being exercised by Parliament or under its authority.
Sub-clause (b) does not speak of dissolution of "Legislature
of  the	 State", since that is an  impossibility   only	 the
Legislative   Assembly	 can  be  dissolved  and   not	 the
Legislative  Council  as explained hereinabove.	  There	 are
quite  a  few  States  where  the  Legislature	consists  of
Legislative   Assembly	as  well  as  Legislative   Council.
Thirdly, clause (1) speaks of failure of the Government	 and
not  of	 the Legislative Assembly, though it  is  true,	 the
Government  is drawn from and very often forms the  majority
party  in  the Legislative Assembly.   But  the	 Legislative
Assembly also consists of the opposition and other  parties,
groups and independent members, who may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_164">224</span>
themselves have been pointing out and remonstrating  against
the unconstitutional working of the Government.	 There	does
not  appear  to	 be  any good  reason  why  the	 Legislative
Assembly  should be dissolved for the acts and	defaults  of
the  Government.   It is true, say the	proponents  of	this
view,  if  the	President cannot  dissolve  the	 Legislative
Assembly,  it would spring back to life after the period  of
Proclamation  and elect the very same Government  which	 was
dismissed.   They answer it by saying firstly that this	 may
or  may	 not happen.  Secondly, they say, even if  the	same
Government is elected again, it is in no way contrary to the
spirit	of  the	 article.   The objection  was	not  to	 its
existence but to its working.  There is no reason to presume
that it will again carry on the Government otherwise than in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_411">288.Having  given  our anxious consideration  to  both	the
contending  viewpoints	 and  notwithstanding  the   obvious
appeal of the second point of view  we are inclined to agree
with the first view which says that clause (1) does  empower
the  President	to dissolve the Legislative  Assembly,	This
view  is  also	supported  by  the  decision  in  State	  of
Rajasthan3  besides the fact that over the  last  forty-four
years,	the  said power has never been questioned.   We	 are
inclined to hold that the power to dissolve the	 Legislative
Assembly is implicit in sub-clause (a) of clause (1)  though
there is no such thing as dissolution of the "Legislature of
the State" where it consists of two Houses.  It must also be
recognised  that  in  certain  situations,  dissolution	  of
Legislative  Assembly  may  be found  to  be  necessary	 for
achieving the purposes of the Proclamation.  Power there is.
Its exercise is a different matter.  The existence of  power
does  not  mean	 that dissolution  of  Legislative  Assembly
should either be treated as obligatory or should  invariably
be ordered whenever a Government of the State is  dismissed.
It should be a matter for the President to consider,  taking
into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances,
whether the Legislative Assembly should also be dissolved or
not.  If he thinks that it should be so dissolved, it  would
be appropriate, indeed highly desirable, that he states	 the
reasons for such extraordinary step in the order itself.
</p><p id="p_412">289.The	 question  then	 arises at  what  stage	 should	 he
exercise this power?  To answer this query, we must turn  to
clause (3).  Clause (3) says that every Proclamation  issued
under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_653">Article	356(1)</a> shall be laid before both  Houses  of
Parliament  and shall cease to operate at the expiry of	 two
months	unless before the expiration of that period  it	 has
been approved by resolutions passed by both Houses.  This is
conceived  both	 as  a	check  upon  the  power	 and  as   a
vindication of the principle of parliamentary supremacy over
the Executive.	The President's action	which is really	 the
action	of  the Union Council of Ministers   is	 subject  to
approval  of both Houses of Parliament.	 Unless approved  by
both  Houses of Parliament, the Proclamation lapses  at	 the
end  of	 two  months and earlier if  it	 is  disapproved  or
declined to be approved by both the Houses of Parliament, as
explained
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_165">225</span>
hereinafter.   Having  regard  to  the	incongruity  of	 the
Executive  (even  though  Union	 Executive)  dissolving	 the
Legislature  (even  if of a State), it would  be  consistent
with the scheme and spirit of the Constitution	particularly
in  the absence of a specific provision in the	Constitution
expressly  empowering the President to do so  to  hold	that
this power of dissolution can be exercised by the  President
only   after   both  Houses  of	  Parliament   approve	 the
Proclamation and not before such approval.  Once  Parliament
places	its  sea of approval on	 the  Proclamation,  further
steps  as may be found necessary to achieve the purposes  of
the Proclamation, i.e., dissolution of Legislative Assembly,
can  be ordered.  In other words, once	Parliament  approves
the  initial exercise of his power, i.e.,  his	satisfaction
that  a	 situation had arisen where the	 Government  of	 the
State  could  not  be  carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
Constitution,  the President can go ahead and  take  further
steps necessary for effectively achieving the objects of the
Proclamation.	Until  the approval, he can  only  keep	 the
Assembly  under suspended animation but shall  not  dissolve
it.
</p><p id="p_413">290.It must be made clear even at this stage that while	 no
writ petition shall beentertained by any court before the
actual	issuance of Proclamation under clause (1), it  shall
be open to a High Court or Supreme Court to entertain a writ
petition  questioning  the Proclamation if it  is  satisfied
that  the  writ	 petition  raises  arguable  questions	with
respect	 to  the validity of the  Proclamation.	  The  court
would  be  entitled to entertain such a writ  petition	even
before	the approval of the Proclamation by  Parliament	  as
also after such approval.  In an appropriate case and if the
situation  demands,  the High Court/Supreme Court  can	also
stay  the  dissolution	of the Assembly but not	 in  such  a
manner	as  to	allow the Assembly to  continue	 beyond	 its
original  term.	 But in every such case where such an  order
is passed the High Court/Supreme Court shall have to dispose
of the matter within two to three months.  Not disposing  of
the writ petition while granting such an interim order would
create	several	 complications	because	 the  life  of	 the
Proclamation  does  not	 exceed six months  even  after	 the
approval  by  Parliament and in any event  the	Proclamation
cannot	survive	 beyond	 one year except  in  the  situation
contemplated   by  clause  (5)	which  is,  of	course,	  an
exceptional situation.
</p><p id="p_414">Meaning of approval in clause (3)
In State of Rajasthan3 Chandrachud, Bhagwati and A.C. Gupta,
JJ.  have  expressed the view that the	Proclamation  issued
under  clause (1) remains in operation for a period  of	 two
months	in  any event.	It is held that even  if  Parliament
disapproves  or declines to approve the Proclamation  within
the said period of two months, the Proclamation continues to
be  valid for two months.  The approval of Parliament  under
clause	(3) is held to be relevant only for the	 purpose  of
continuance  of the Proclamation beyond two months.  It	 has
also  been held further that even if both the Houses do	 not
approve or disapprove the Proclamation, the Government which
has been dismissed or
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_166">226</span>
the  Assembly which may have been dissolved do	not  revive.
With utmost respect to the learned Judges, we find ourselves
unable	to agree with the said view insofar as it says	that
even  where both Houses of Parliament disapprove or  do	 not
approve	 the  Proclamation, the Government  which  has	been
dismissed  does	 not revive. (The State of  Rajasthan3	also
holds that such disapproval or non-approval does not  revive
the  Legislative Assembly which may have been dissolved	 but
we  need  not deal with this aspect since according  to	 the
view  expressed	 by us hereinabove, no such  dissolution  is
permissible before the approval of both the Houses).  Clause
(3),  it  may  be emphasised, uses the	words  "approved  by
resolutions  of	 both  Houses  of  Parliament".	  The	word
"approval"  means affirmation of the action by a  higher  or
superior  authority.   In  other words, the  action  of	 the
President has to be approved by Parliament.  The  expression
"approval" has an intrinsic meaning which cannot be ignored.
Disapproval  or	 non-approval  means  that  the	 Houses	  of
Parliament  are saying that the President's action  was	 not
justified or warranted and that it shall no longer continue.
In  such a case, the Proclamation lapses, i.e.,ceases to  be
in  operation  at  the	end of	two  months   the  necessary
consequence of which is the status quo ante revives.  To say
that  notwithstanding the disapproval or  non-approval,	 the
status	quo  ante does not revive is to rob the	 concept  of
approval  of its content and meaning.  Such a  view  renders
the  check  provided  by clause (3) ineffective	 and  of  no
significance  whatsoever.   The Executive would	 be  telling
Parliament: "I have dismissed the Government.  Now,  whether
you  approve or disapprove is of no consequence because	 the
Government  in no event can be revived.	 The deed  is  done.
You  better  approve  it because  you  have  practically  no
choice."  We do not think that such a course  is  consistent
with   the   principle	of   parliamentary   supremacy	 and
parliamentary control over the Executive, the basic  premise
of parliamentary supremacy.  It would indeed mean  supremacy
of  the	 Executive  over Parliament.   The  dismissal  of  a
Government under subclause (a) of clause (1) cannot also  be
equated	 to the physical death of a living being.  There  is
no irrevocability about it.  It is capable of being  revived
and  it revives.  Legislative Assembly which may  have	been
kept  in suspended animation also springs back to life.	  So
far  as	 the validity of the acts done,	 orders	 passed	 and
laws,  if  any, made during the period of operation  of	 the
Proclamation  is  concerned, they  would  remain  unaffected
inasmuch as the disapproval or non-approval does not  render
the Proclamation invalid with retrospective effect.  It	 may
be recalled that the power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_654">Article 356(1)</a> is the power
vested in the President subject no doubt to approval  within
two  months.  The non-approval means that  the	Proclamation
ceases to be in operationat  the expiry of two	months,
as held in State of Rajasthan3.
</p><p id="p_415">291.Now,  coming to the power of the court to  restore	the
Government to officein	case it finds the  Proclamation
to  be	unconstitutional,  it is,  in  our  opinion,  beyond
question.  Even in case the Proclamation is approved by
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_167">227</span>
  Parliament  it would be open to the court to	restore	 the
State  Government to its office in case it strikes down	 the
Proclamation  as unconstitutional.  If this power  were	 not
conceded  to  the court, the very power of  judicial  review
would	be  rendered  nugatory	and  the   entire   exercise
meaningless.   If the court cannot grant the relief  flowing
from  the invalidation of the Proclamation, it may  as	well
decline	 to  entertain	the challenge  to  the	Proclamation
altogether.    For,   there  is	 no  point  in	 the   court
entertaining  the challenge, examining it, calling upon	 the
Union  Government  to produce the material on the  basis  of
Which the requisite satisfaction was formed and yet not give
the  relief.   In our considered opinion, such a  course  is
inconceivable.
</p><p id="p_416">292.A  question may arise  what happens to the	acts  done,
orders	made  and laws enacted by Parliament  or  under	 its
authority   during  the	 period	 the  Proclamation  was	  in
operation  in  case  the  Proclamation	is  declared  to  be
unconstitutional  by  the court?  Would all of	them  become
unconstitutional  or void?  Firstly, there is no  reason  to
presume	 that  a court which strikes down  the	Proclamation
would not provide for this contingency.	 It would be  within
the power of the court to say that these acts and orders are
saved.	Indeed, it should say so in the interests of general
public	and to avoid all kinds of complications, leaving  it
to Government and the Legislature of the State concerned  to
rectify,  modify  or repeal them, if they  so  choose.	 The
theory	of  factum valet may also be available to  save	 the
acts,  orders and things done by the President or under	 his
authority during the said period.
</p><p id="p_417">293.It	was  suggested	by Shri	 Ram  Jethmalani  that	the
President  can "assume all or any of the functions"  of	 the
State	Government   without  dismissing   the	 Government.
Emphasis  is laid upon the words "all or any" in  sub-clause
(1).	In  particular,	 he  submitted,	 where	 the   State
Government is found remiss in performing one or some of	 the
functions,  that or those functions of the State  Government
can  be assumed by the President with a view to	 remedy	 the
situation.   After  rectifying the  situation,	the  counsel
submitted,  the President will give those functions back  to
the  State  Government and that in such	 a  situation  there
would  be no occasion or necessity for dismissing the  State
Government.  The learned counsel gave the analogy of a motor
car   if one or a few of the parts of a car  malfunction  or
cease to function, one need not throw away the car.  That or
those particular parts can be replaced or rectified and	 the
car would function normally again.  It is difficult to agree
with  the  said	 interpretation.  The  power  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_655">Article
356(1)</a>	can  be	 exercised  only  where	 the  President	  is
satisfied  that	 "the  Government of  the  State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution".	 The  title  to	 the  article  "failure	  of
constitutional	machinery in the States" also  throws  light
upon  the  nature of the situation contemplated by  it.	  It
means  a situation where the Government of the	State,	 and
not  one  or a few functions of the  Government	  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	Constitution.	 The
inability or unfitness aforesaid may arise either on account
of  the	 non-performance or malperformance of  one  or	more
functions of the Government or on account of abuse or misuse
of any of the powers, duties and obligations of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_168">228</span>
Government.  A Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_656">Article 356(1)</a> necessarily
contemplates  the  removal of the Government  of  the  State
since it is found unable or unfit to carry on the Government
of  the	 State	in accordance with  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution.  In our considered opinion, it is not possible
to  give  effect  to the argument of  Shri  Ram	 Jethmalani.
Acceptance  of such an argument would introduce the  concept
of   two  Governments  in  the	same  sphere   the   Central
Government exercising one or some of the powers of the State
Government  and	 the State Government performing  the  rest.
Apart  from its novelty, such a situation, in  our  opinion,
does not promote the object underlying <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_657">Article 356</a> nor is it
practicable.
</p><p id="p_418">294.Shri Jethmalani brought to our notice the British Joint
Parliamentary Report, para 109, in support of his contention
aforementioned.	  We are unable to see any relevance of	 the
said  para to the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_658">Article  356(1).</a>   Under
the Government of India Act, 1935, the Governor General	 and
the Governor were not constitutional heads of State as under
the  Constitution.  They exercised real power in  their	 own
right.	 Only  a few powers were entrusted  to	the  elected
Governments  and  even	those could be taken  away  (by	 the
Governor  General  at  the Centre and the  Governor  in	 the
provinces) as and when they were satisfied that a  situation
has  arisen  where the Government at the Centre	 or  of	 the
province  cannot  be  carried  on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions of the said Act.  Under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_659">Article 356</a>, the position
is  entirely  different.  The power can	 be  exercised	only
against the States and that too by the President and not  by
the  Governor.	 The  entire  constitutional  philosophy  is
different.  Therefore, merely because the same words "all or
any"  in Sections 93 and 45 of the Government of  India	 Act
occur  in  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_660">Article  356(1</a>),  the  same	meaning	 cannot	  be
attributed to them mechanically, ignoring all other  factors
assuming that the said words in Sections93 and 45 meant what
Shri Jethmalani says.
</p><p id="p_419"><a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_661">ARTICLE 356</a> IN ACTION
</p><p id="p_420">295.Since   the	 commencement  of  the	Constitution,	the
President  has invoked <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_662">Article 356</a> on as many as  ninety  or
more  occasions.  Quite a performance for a provision  which
was   supposed	to  remain  a  'dead-letter'.	Instead	  of
remaining  a 'dead-letter', it has proved to be the  'death-
letter'	 of  scores  of State  Governments  and	 Legislative
Assemblies.  The Sarkaria Commission which was appointed  to
look  into and report on Centre-State  relations  considered
inter alia the manner in which this power has been exercised
over the years and made certain recommendations designed  to
prevent	 its misuse.  Since the Commission was headed  by  a
distinguished  Judge of this Court and also because it	made
its  report after an elaborate and exhaustive study  of	 all
relevant  aspects,  its opinions are certainly	entitled  to
great  weight notwithstanding the fact that the	 report	 has
not been accepted so far by the Government of India.
</p><p id="p_421">296.In para 6.3.23, the Commission observed that though the
words  "a  Government of the State cannot be carried  on  in
accordance  with the provisions of the Constitution" are  of
wide amplitude, each and every breach
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_169">229</span>
 and infraction of constitutional provision, irrespective of
its  significance, extent and effect, cannot be	 treated  as
constituting  failure of constitutional machinery.   <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_663">Article
356</a>,  the Commission said, provides remedy for	a  situation
where	there	has  been  an  actual	breakdown   of	 the
constitutional machinery of the State.	Any abuse or  misuse
of  this  drastic power, said the  Commission,	damages	 the
fabric	of  the	 Constitution.	A  literal  construction  of
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_664">Article 356(1)</a> should be avoided, it opined.
</p><p id="p_422">297.In	para 6.4.01, the Commission noted that	failure	 of

set  out  some	of the instances leading to  it,  viz.,	 (a)
political  crisis;  (b)	 internal  subversion;	(c)   fiscal
breakdown;   and  (d)  non-compliance  with   constitutional
directions of the Union Executive.  The Commission, however,
hastened  to  add that the instances set out by it  are	 not
claimed	 to be comprehensive or perfect.  Then	it  examined
each of the said four heads separately.
</p><p id="p_423">298.In para 6.5.01, the Commission set out illustrations in

</p><p id="p_428">THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA AND THE CONCEPT OF SECULARISM:
</p><p id="p_429">302.<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_687">Article   356(1)</a>  speaks  of  a  situation	where	the
Government  of	a State cannot be carried on  in  accordance
with  the  provisions  of the Constitution.   We  have	said
hereinbefore   that  the  words	 "the  provisions  of	this
Constitution"  take  in	 all the  provisions  including	 the
preamble   to  the  Constitution.   The	 preamble   to	 the
Constitution speaks of a secular Indian Republic.  While the
respondents' counsel contended that secularism being a basic
feature	 of  the  Constitution, a State	 Government  can  be
dismissed if it is guilty of unsecular acts, the counsel for
petitioners, Shri Ram Jethmalani strongly refuted the  idea.
According  to  Shri  Jethmalani,  'secularism'	is  a  vague
concept,  not defined in the Constitution and hence,  cannot
furnish	 a  ground  for taking	action	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_688">Article	356.</a>
Without going into the specifics of the said contention,  we
shall examine first how far this concept is embedded in	 our
Constitution and in what sense.
</p><p id="p_430">303.Having   completed	 the   process	 of   framing	the
Constitution, the Constituent Assembly proceeded to finalise
its preamble.  Speaking on behalf of and in the name of	 the
people	of  India,  they  said, their  object  has  been  to
constitute India into a "Sovereign Democratic Republic", and
to  secure  to all its citizens social justice,	 liberty  of
belief,	 faith	and  worship, and  equality  of	 status	 and
opportunity.  They said, the goal was also to promote  among
all the people of India "fraternity assuring the dignity  of
the   individual......	 By  the  42nd	Amendment   to	 the
Constitution,  the  words "socialist,  secular"	 were  added
after the word "sovereign" and before the word "democratic".
No  other  provision  of the  Constitution  was	 amended  to
adumbrate these concepts.
</p><p id="p_431">304.Both  the  expressions  'socialist' and  'secular'	 by
themselves  are not capable of precise definition.  We	are,
however,  not  concerned  with	their  general	meaning	  or
content.   Our	object is to ascertain the  meaning  of	 the
expression "secular" in the context of our Constitution.  As
the   discussion  hereafter  would  demonstrate,  the	42nd
Amendment merely made explicit what was implicit in it.	 The
preamble  speaks  of "social justice", "liberty	 of  belief,
faith  and  worship"  and  of "equality	 of  status  and  of
opportunity".	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_689">Article 14 (under the sub-heading "Right  of
Equality")</a>  enjoins  the  State not to deny  to	 any  person
equality  before  the law or the equal	protection  of	laws
within the territory of India.	Articles 15 and 16 elucidate
this  doctrine of equality.  They say that the	State  shall
not  discriminate  against  any citizen on  ground  only  of
religion, race or caste, whether in the matter of employment
under the State or otherwise.  By <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_690">Article 25</a>, "all  persons"
are  declared equally entitled to freedom of conscience	 and
the   right  to	 freely	 profess,  practice  and   propagate
religion, subject, of course, to public order, morality	 and
health.	  Articles  26,	 27 and	 28  elucidate	the  freedom
guaranteed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_173">233</span>
 <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_691">Article  25.</a>  <a href="/doc/211413/" id="a_692">Article 27</a> declares that no person  shall  be
compelled  to  pay  any taxes, the  proceeds  of  which	 are
specifically  appropriated  in payment of expenses  for	 the
promotion  or  maintenance  of any  particular	religion  or
religious  denomination.   <a href="/doc/265235/" id="a_693">Article  28(1)</a>  decrees  that  no
religious  instruction shall be provided in any	 educational
institution  wholly maintained out of the State funds  while
<a href="/doc/630748/" id="a_694">Article	 28(3)</a> says that no person attending an	 educational
institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out  of
State funds shall be required to take part in any  religious
worship	 conducted in such institution, except with  his  or
his guardian's (in the case of a minor) consent.  Similarly,
clause	(2)  of	 <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_695">Article 30</a> enjoins upon the  State  not  to
discriminate   against	any  educational   institution,	  in
granting aid, on the ground that it is under the  management
of  a  minority,  religious or linguistic.   Clause  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_696">Article	 51</a> A [introduced by the 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_697">(Amendment) Act</a>]	says
that  "it  shall be the duty of every citizen of  India	  to
promote	 harmony and spirit of brotherhood amongst  all	 the
people	of  India  transcending	 religious,  linguistic	 and
regional or sectional diversities".  What do these articles,
read  together with the preamble signify?  While <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_698">Article  25</a>
of the Constitution guarantees to all its people freedom  of
religion,  Articles 14, 15 and 16 enjoin upon the  State  to
treat all its people equally irrespective of their religion,
caste, faith or belief.	 While the citizens of this  country
are  free to profess, practice and propagate such  religion,
faith  or  belief  as they choose, so far as  the  State  is
concerned,  i.e., from the point of view of the	 State,	 the
religion, faith or belief of a person is immaterial.  To it,
all  are equal and all are entitled to be  treated  equally.
How  is this equal treatment possible, if the State were  to
prefer	or  promote a particular religion,  race  or  caste,
which  necessarily means a less favourable treatment of	 all
other	religions,   races   and  castes.    How   are	 the
constitutional	promises  of  social  justice,	liberty	  of
belief,	 faith	or  worship and equality of  status  and  of
opportunity  to	 be attained unless the	 State	eschews	 the
religion, faith or belief of a person from its consideration
altogether  while dealing with him, his rights,	 his  duties
and  his  entitlements?	  Secularism is	 thus  more  than  a
passive	 attitude of religious tolerance.  It is a  positive
concept of equal treatment of all religions.  This  attitude
is  described by some as one of neutrality towards  religion
or  as one of benevolent neutrality.  This may be a  concept
evolved	 by  western liberal thought or it may be,  as	some
say,  an abiding faith with the Indian people at all  points
of time.  That is not material.	 What is material is that it
is  a  constitutional  goal  and  a  basic  feature  of	 the
Constitution as affirmed in Kesavananda Bharati36 and Indira
N. Gandhi v. Raj Narain37.  Any step inconsistent with	this
constitutional policy is, in plain words,  unconstitutional.
This  does not mean that the State has no say whatsoever  in
matters	 of  religion.	 Laws can  be  made  regulating	 the
secular	 affairs  of temples, mosques and  other  places  of
worships and maths. (<a href="/doc/312939/" id="a_699">See S. P. Mittal v. Union of India52</a>.)

The  power  of	Parliament to  reform  and  rationalise	 the
personal laws is unquestioned.	The command of <a href="/doc/1406604/" id="a_701">Article 44</a> is
yet  to	 be realised.  The correct perspective	appeared  to
have been placed by Shri K.M. Munshi during the	 Constituent
Assembly Debates.  He said :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_110">	      "Religion must be restricted to spheres  which
	      legitimately  appertain to religion,  and	 the

	      modified in such a manner that we may  evolve,
	      as   early   as	possible,   a	strong	 and
	      consolidated  nation.  Our first	problem	 and
	      the  most	 important  problem  is	 to  produce
	      national	unity in this country.	We think  we
	      have  got national unity.	 But there are	many
	      factors	and  important factors	which  still
	      offer   serious	dangers	 to   our   national
	      consolidation,  and it is very necessary	that
	      the  whole  of  our  life, so  far  as  it  is
	      restricted to secular spheres, must be unified
	      in  such a way that as early as  possible,  we
	      may be able to say.  'Well, we are not  merely
	      a	 nation	 because  we say  so,  but  also  in
	      effect,  by the way we live, by  our  personal
	      law,   we	 are  a	 strong	  and	consolidated
	      nation'."
</blockquote><p id="p_432">305.Shri M.C. Setalvad in his lecture on secularism  (Patel
Memorial Lectures  1965) points out that after affirming the
ideas  of religious liberty and adequate protection  to	 the
minorities at its Karachi Session (1931), the Congress Party
asserted   emphatically	 that  "the  State   shall   observe
neutrality  in regard to all religions".  He says that	this
resolution  is in a manner the key to the  understanding  of
the  attitude  adopted	by  those  who	framed	the   Indian
Constitution nearly twenty years later, embodying in it	 the
guarantee of religious neutrality.  He also points out	that
"the debates in the Constituent Assembly leave little  doubt
that  what  was	 intended by the Constitution  was  not	 the
secularisation	of  the State in the sense of  its  complete
dissociation  from  religion,  but  rather  an	attitude  of
religious neutrality, with equal treatment to all  religions
and religious minorities".  The same idea is put forward  by
Gajendragadkar, J., (in his inaugural address to the Seminar
on  "Secularism	 :  Its implications for  law  and  life  in
India") in the following words :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_111">	      " It is true that the Indian Constitution does
	      not  use	the word secularism' in any  of	 its
	      provisions,  but its material  provisions	 are
	      inspired	by the concept of secularism.	When
	      it promised all the citizens of India that the
	      aim  of  the  Constitution  is  to   establish
	      socioeconomic  justice, it placed	 before	 the
	      country  as  a whole, the ideal of  a  welfare
	      State.   And the concept of welfare is  purely
	      secular and not based on any considerations of
	      religion.	  The essential basis of the  Indian
	      Constitution  is that all citizens are  equal,
	      and this basic equality (guaranteed by Article
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_112">	      14) obviously proclaims that the religion of a
	      citizen  is entirely irrelevant in the  matter
	      of his fundamental rights.  The State does not
	      owe  loyalty  to any  particular	religion  as
	      such;  it is not irreligious or  antireligion;
	      it  gives equal freedom for all religions	 and
	      holds  that  the religion of the	citizen	 has
	      nothing to do in the matter of socioeconomic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_175">	      235</span>
	       problems.     That    is	   the	   essential

</blockquote><p id="p_434">307.In	short, in the affairs of the State (in	its  widest
connotation)  religion	is  irrelevant;	 it  is	 strictly  a
personal  affair.   In this sense and in  this	behalf,	 our
Constitution   is  broadly  in	agreement  with	  the	U.S.
Constitution,  the  First Amendment  whereof  declares	that
"Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment  of
religion  or  prohibiting  the free  exercise  thereof	..."
(generally  referred  to  as  the  "establishment  clause").
Perhaps,  this is an echo of doctrine of the  separation  of
Church and State; may be it is the modern political  thought
which seeks to separate religion from the State	 it  matters
very little.
</p><p id="p_435">308.In this view of the matter, it is absolutely  erroneous
to  say	 that secularism is a "vacuous word" or	 a  "phantom
concept".
</p><p id="p_436">309.It	is perhaps relevant to point out that our  Founding
Fathers read this concept into our Constitution not  because
it  was	 fashionable  to  do  so,  but	because	 it  was  an
imperative  in the Indian context.  It is true	as Shri	 Ram
Jethmalani was at pains to emphasise  that India was divided
on  the	 basis of religion and that  areas  having  majority
Muslim	population  were  constituted  into  a	new   entity
Pakistan  which immediately proceeded to proclaim itself  as
an  Islamic  Republic, but it is equally a  fact  that	even
after  partition, India contained a sizeable  population  of
minorities.  They
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_176">236</span>
comprised  not	less  than  10 to  12%	of  the	 population.
Inspired   by	the  Indian  tradition	of   tolerance	 and
fraternity, for whose sake, the greatest son of Modem India,
Mahatma Gandhi, laid down his life and seeking to redeem the
promise	 of religious neutrality held forth by the  Congress
Party,	the  Founding Fathers proceeded to create  a  State,
secular in its outlook and egalitarian in its action.	They
could  not  have  countenanced	the  idea  of  treating	 the
minorities  as second-class citizens.  On the contrary,	 the
dominant thinking appears to be that the majority community,
Hindus,	 must be secular and thereby help the minorities  to
become	secular.   For, it is the majority  community  alone
that  can  provide  the sense of security  to  others.	 The
significance  of the 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_706">(Amendment) Act</a> lies in  the	fact
that  it formalised the pre-existing situation.	 It put	 the
matter	 beyond	  any  doubt,  leaving	no  room   for	 any
controversy.   In such a situation, the debate	whether	 the
preamble  to the Constitution is included within  the  words
"the provisions of this Constitution" is really unnecessary.
Even  if we accept the reading of Shri Jethmalani,  preamble
is a key to the understanding of the relevant provisions  of
the  Constitution.  The 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_707">(Amendment) Act</a>  has  furnished
the key in unmistakable terms.
</p><p id="p_437">310.Given the above position, it is clear that if any party
or Organisation seeks to fight the elections on the basis of
a  plank  which	 has the proximate  effect  of	eroding	 the
secular philosophy of the Constitution it would certainly be
guilty	of following an unconstitutional course	 of  action.
Political  parties are formed and exist to capture or  share
State  power.  That is their aim.  They may be	associations
of   individuals  but  one  cannot  ignore  the	  functional
relevance.  An association of individuals may be devoted  to
propagation  of	 religion;  it would be	 a  religious  body.
Another may be devoted to promotion of culture; it would  be
a  cultural Organisation.  They are not aimed  at  acquiring
State power, whereas a political party does.  That is one of
its  main  objectives.	 This  is what	we  mean  by  saying
"functional relevance".	 One cannot conceive of a democratic
form of Government without the political parties.  They	 are
part  of  the political system	and  constitutional  scheme.
Nay,  they  are integral to the governance of  a  democratic
society.   If  the  Constitution requires the  State  to  be
secular in thought and action, the same requirement attaches
to  political  parties as well.	 The Constitution  does	 not
recognise,  it	does not permit, mixing religion  and  State
power.	Both must be kept apart.  That is the constitutional
injunction.   None  can	 say  otherwise	 so  long  as	this
Constitution  governs  this country.   Introducing  religion
into politics is to introduce an impermissible element	into
body politic and an imbalance in our constitutional  system.
If  a political party espousing a particular religion  comes
to  power, that religion tends to become, in  practice,	 the
official  religion.  All other religions come to  acquire  a
secondary  status, at any rate, a less favourable  position.
This would be plainly antithetical to Articles 14 to 16,  25
and the entire constitutional scheme adumbrated hereinabove.
Under  our  Constitution,  no  party  or  Organisation	 can
simultaneously be a political and a religious party.  It has
to  be	either.	 Same would be the position, if a  party  or
Organisation acts and/or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_177">237</span>
 behaves  by word of mouth, print or in any other manner  to
bring  about the said effect, it would equally be guilty  of
an  act of unconstitutionality.	 It would have no  right  to
function as a political party.	The fact that a party may be
entitled  to  go to people seeking a mandate for  a  drastic
amendment of the Constitution or its replacement by  another
Constitution is wholly irrelevant in the context.  We do not
know  how  the Constitution can be amended so as  to  remove
secularism  from the basic structure of the  Constitution**.
Nor do we know how the present Constitution can be  replaced
by   another;  it  is  enough  for  us	to  know  that	 the
Constitution  does  not provide for such a course   that  it
does not provide for its own demise.

on  the basis of religion, race, caste or community  of	 the
candidate  or  the  use of religious symbols  as  a  corrupt
practice.  Even a single instance of such a nature is enough
to  vitiate the election of the candidate.  Similarly,	sub-
section (3-A) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_709">Section 123</a> provides that "promotion of, or
attempt	 to  promote, feelings of enmity or  hatred  between
different  classes  of	citizens  of  India  on	 grounds  of
religion, race, caste, community or language" by a candidate
or  his agent, etc. for the furtherance of the prospects  of
the  election  of  that	 candidate  is	equally	 a   corrupt
practice.    <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_710">Section  29-A</a>  provides  for  registration	  of
associations  and  bodies  as  political  parties  with	 the
Election  Commission.  Every party contesting elections	 and
seeking to have a uniform symbol for all its candidates	 has
to  apply for registration.  While making such	application,
the  association  or  body  has	 to  affirm  its  faith	 and
allegiance  to "the principles of socialism, secularism	 and
democracy"  among  others.  Since  the	Election  Commission
appears to have made some other orders in this behalf  after
the  conclusion of arguments and because those	orders	have
not been placed before us or debated, we do not wish to say
anything more on this subject.
</p><p id="p_439"><a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_711">ARTICLE 74(2)</a>  ITS MEANING AND SCOPE
</p><p id="p_440">312.The Constitution of India has introduced  parliamentary
democracy  in  this country.   The  parliamentary  democracy
connotes  vesting of real power of governance in  the  Prime
Minister  and  Council of his Ministers who are	 very  often
drawn  from the majority party in Parliament.  Some  jurists
indeed	refer to it derisively as Prime-ministerial form  of
Government.  In such a democracy, the head of the State,  be
he the King or the President, remains a constitutional	head
of the State.  He acts in accordance with the aid and advice
tendered  to him by the Council of Ministers with the  Prime
Minister at its head.  This is what clause (1) of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_712">Article 74</a>
provided, even before it was amended by the 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_713">(Amendment)

Singh22.   The 42nd Amendment merely made explicit what	 was
already implicit in clause (1).	 The 44th Amendment inserted
a  proviso to clause (1) which too was in recognition of  an
existing reality.  It empowers the President to require	 the
Council	 of Ministers to reconsider the advice	tendered  by
them.	The advice tendered on such reconsideration is	made
binding upon the President.  Since clause (2) of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_715">Article  74</a>
has to be read and understood having regard to its  context,
it would be appropriate to read both the clauses of  <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_716">Article
74</a> as they stand now :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_122">	      "74.   Council of Ministers to aid and  advise
	      President.-  (1) There shall be a	 Council  of
	      Ministers with the Prime Minister at the	head
	      to aid and advise the President who shall,  in
	      the   exercise  of  his  functions,   act	  in
	      accordance with such advice :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_123">	      Provided	that the President may	require	 the

	      advice, either generally or otherwise, and the
	      President	 shall	act in accordance  with	 the
	      advice tendered after such reconsideration.
	      (2)The  question	whether any,  and  if  so
	      what, advice was tendered by Ministers to	 the
	      President	 shall not be inquired into  in	 any
	      Court." (emphasis added)
</blockquote><p id="p_441"> 313.  <a href="/doc/243691/" id="a_717">Article	53(1)</a>  of the Constitution  says  that	"the
executive  power  of  the  Union shall	be  vested.  in	 the
President  and shall be exercised by him either directly  or
through officers subordinate to him in accordance with	this
Constitution."	Clause (2), however, declares  that  without
prejudice  to clause (1), the supreme command of  the  Armed
Forces	of  the Union shall be vested in the  President	 and
that the exercise of such power shall be regulated by law.
</p><p id="p_442">314.Clause  (1) of <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_718">Article 77</a> provides that "all  executive
action	of the Government of India shall be expressed to  be
taken  in the name of the President".  Clause (2) then	says
that  all orders made and other instruments executed in	 the
name of the President shall be authenticated in such  manner
as  may	 be  specified	in  the rules  to  be  made  by	 the
President.   It	 further provides that the  validity  of  an
order  or  instrument which is authenticated  in  accordance
with  the said rules shall not be called in question on	 the
ground	that  it  is  not an order  or	instrument  made  or
executed  by  the President.  Rules have been  made  by	 the
President  as  contemplated  by	 this  clause  contained  in
Notification  No.  S.O.	 2297 dated November  11,  1958	 (as
amended	 from  time  to	 time).	  Several  officers  of	 the
Government  have been empowered to authenticate	 the  orders
and other instruments to be made and executed in the name of
the  President.	 Clause (3) requires the President  to	make
rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of
the  Government of India and for allocation among  Ministers
of the said business.  In other words, rules have to be made
by  the President under clause (3) for two  purposes,  viz.,
</p><p id="p_443">(a)  for the more convenient transaction of the business  of
the  Government	 of India and (b) for the  allocation  among
Ministers of the said business.	 Rules

of business have indeed been made as required by this clause
and  the  business  of the  Government	of  India  allocated
between several Ministers,
</p><p id="p_444">315.Yet	 another  article which requires to be	noticed	 in
this  connection  is <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_719">Article 361</a> which	declares  that	"the
President  shall  not  be answerable to any  court  for	 the
exercise  and  performance of the powers and duties  of	 his
office	or for any act done or purporting to be done by	 him
in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties".
No  criminal  proceedings  can be  instituted  or  continued
against	 the President in any court while he is	 in  office,
nor  is	 he  subject  to  any  process	for  his  arrest  or
imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_445">316.<a href="/doc/220543/" id="a_720">Article  78</a> specifies the duties of the Prime  Minister
as  regards the furnishing of information to  President	 and
certain	 other	matters.   Clause  (a)	obliges	 the   Prime
Minister  to communicate to the President all  decisions  of
the  Council of Ministers relating to the administration  of
the  affairs  of the Union and	proposals  for	legislation.
Clause	(b)  says  that Prime Minister	shall  furnish	such
information  as the President may call for with	 respect  to
the  matters  communicated  under clause  (a).	 Clause	 (c)
obliges the Prime Minister, if required by the President, to
submit	any  matter for reconsideration of  the	 Council  of
Ministers which has not been considered by it.
</p><p id="p_446">317.The	 President  is	clothed	 with  several	powers	and
functions  by  the  Constitution.  It is  not  necessary  to
detail	them  to expect to say that <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_721">Article 356</a>	 is  one  of
them.  When <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_722">Article 74(1)</a> speaks of the President acting "in
the  exercise of his functions", it refers to  those  powers
and  functions.	  Besides the  Constitution,  several  other
enactments  too confer and may hereinafter  confer,  certain
powers	and functions upon the President.  They too will  be
covered	 by  <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_723">Article  74(1).</a>  To wit,  the  President  shall
exercise those powers and discharge those functions only  on
the  aid  and advice of the Council of	Ministers  with	 the
Prime Minister at its head.
</p><p id="p_447">318.<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_724">Article   361</a>  is  the  manifestation  of  the   theory
prevalent  in English Law that "King can do no	wrong"	and,
for  that reason, beyond the process of the court.  Any	 and
every action taken by the President is really the action  of
his  Ministers	and subordinates.  It is they  who  have  to
answer for, defend and justify any and every action taken by
them  in  the  name  of the President,	if  such  action  is
questioned  in	a  court of law.  The  President  cannot  be
called upon to answer for or justify the action.  It is	 for
the Council of Ministers to do so.  Who comes forward to  do
so  is a matter for them to decide and for the court  to  be
satisfied  about  it.  Normally speaking,  the	Minister  or
other official or authority of the Ministry as is  entrusted
with the relevant business of the Government, has to do it.
</p><p id="p_448">319.<a href="/doc/243691/" id="a_725">Article 53(1)</a> insofar as says that the executive  power
of the Union, which vests in the President, can be exercised
by  him either directly or through officers  subordinate  to
him  in accordance with the Constitution stresses  the	very
idea.  Even where he acts directly, the President has to act
on  the	 aid and advice of the Council of Ministers  or	 the
Minister concerned, as the case may be. (Advice tendered  by
a Minister is deemed to be the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_180">240</span>
advice	tendered by the Council of Ministers in view of	 the
principle of joint responsibility of the Cabinet/Council  of
Ministers).  If such act is questioned in a court of law, it
is  for	 the  Minister	concerned  (according  to  rules  of
business) or an official of that Ministry to defend the Act.
Where the President acts through his subordinates, it is for
that subordinate to defend the action.
</p><p id="p_449">320.Articles 74 and 77 are in a sense complimentary to each
other, though they may operate in different fields.  <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_726">Article
74(1)</a> deals with the acts of the President done "in exercise
of  his	 functions",  whereas  <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_727">Article	77</a>  speaks  of	 the
executive  action of the Government of India which is  taken
in  the	 name  of the President of India.   Insofar  as	 the
executive action of the Government of India is concerned, it
has  to be taken by the Minister/official to whom  the	said
business  is allocated by the rules of business	 made  under
clause (3) of <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_728">Article 77</a> for the more convenient transaction
of  the	 business of the Government of	India.	 All  orders
issued	and  the  instruments  executed	 relatable  to	 the
executive  action  of  the Government of India	have  to  be
authenticated in the manner and by the officer empowered  in
that  behalf.  The President does not really come  into	 the
picture so far as <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_729">Article 77</a> is concerned.  All the business
of the Government of India is transacted by the Ministers or
other officials empowered in that behalf, of course, in	 the
name  of the President.	 Orders are issued, instruments	 are
executed  and  other  acts done	 by  various  Ministers	 and
officials,  none of which may reach the President or may  be
placed	before	him  for his  consideration.   There  is  no
occasion in such cases for any aid and advice being tendered
to  the	 President  by the  Council  of	 Ministers.   Though
expressed in the name of the President, they are the acts of
the Government of India.  They are distinct from the acts of
the   President	  "in  the  exercise   of   his	  functions"
contemplated by <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_730">Article 74.</a> of course, even while acting  in
exercise  of  his  functions, the President has	 to  act  in
accordance  with the aid and advice tendered by the  Council
of  Ministers  with the Prime Minister at its head.   He  is
thus  rendered	a constitutional  or a	titular	 head.	[The
proviso	 to clause (1) no doubt empowers him to require	 the
Council	 of  Ministers	to reconsider  such  advice,  either
generally  or  in any particular case, but if and  when	 the
Council	  of   Ministers   tenders  the	  advice   on	such
reconsideration,  he is bound by it.] Then comes clause	 (2)
of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_731">Article 74</a> which says that the question "whether any, and
if  so,	 what advice was tendered by the  Ministers  to	 the
President  shall  not be inquired into in any  court".	 The
idea behind clause (2) is this : The court is not to enquire
it is not concerned with  whether any advice was tendered by
any  Minister or Council of Ministers to the President,	 and
if  so, what was that advice.  That is a matter between	 the
President  and	his Council of Ministers.  What	 advice	 was
tendered,  whether it was required to be reconsidered,	what
advice was tendered after reconsideration, if any, what	 was
the opinion of the President, whether the advice was changed
pursuant to further discussion, if any, and how the ultimate
decision  was  arrived	at,  are  all  matters	between	 the
President and his Council of Ministers.	 They are beyond the
ken  of the court.  The court is not to go into it.   It  is
enough that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_181">241</span>
there is an order/act of the President in appropriate  form.
It  will take it as the order/act of the President.   It  is
concerned  only with the validity of the order and  legality
of  the	 proceeding  or action taken  by  the  President  in
exercise of his functions and not with what happened in	 the
inner  councils of the President and his Ministers.  No	 one
can challenge such decision or action on the ground that  it
is  not	 in  accordance	 with the  advice  tendered  by	 the
Ministers or that it is based on no advice.  If, in a  given
case, the President acts without, or contrary to, the advice
tendered   to  him,  it	 may  be  a  case   warranting	 his
impeachment, but so far as the court is concerned, it is the
act of the President. (We do not wish to express any opinion
as to what would be the position if in the unlikely event of
the  Council of Ministers itself questioning the  action  of
the President as being taken without, or contrary, to  their
advice).
</p><p id="p_450">321.Clause  (2)	 of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_732">Article 74</a>, understood  in	its  proper
perspective,  is  thus	confined to a  limited	aspect.	  It
protects  and  preserves the secrecy  of  the  deliberations
between	 the  President and his Council	 of  Ministers.	  In
fact,  clause  (2) is a reproduction of sub-section  (4)  of
Section	 10  of	 the Government of  India  Act,	 1935.	[The
Government  of	India  Act  did	 not  contain  a   provision
corresponding  to <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_733">Article 74(1)</a> as it stood before or  after
the  amendments	 aforementioned].  The scope of	 clause	 (2)
should not be extended beyond its legitimate field.  In	 any
event,	it  cannot be read or understood  as  conferring  an
immunity   upon	  the	Council	  of   Ministers   or	 the
Minister/Ministry  concerned to explain, defend and  justify
the orders and acts of the President done in exercise of his
functions*.   The  limited provision  contained	 in  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_734">Article
74(2)</a>	cannot	 override  the	basic  provisions   in	 the
Constitution  relating to judicial review.  If and when	 any
action	taken by the President in exercise of his  functions
is  questioned in a court of law, it is for the	 Council  of
Ministers to justify the same, since the action or order  of
the  President is presumed to have been taken in  accordance
with <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_735">Article 74(1).</a>  As to which Minister or which  official
of  which Ministry comes forward to defend the	order/action
is  for	 them to decide and for the court  to  be  satisfied
about it.  Where, of course, the act/order questioned is one
pertaining  to	the  executive power of	 the  Government  of
India, the position is much simpler.  It does not  represent
the act/order of the President done/taken in exercise of his
functions  and	hence there is no occasion for	any  aid  or
advice	by  the Ministers to him.  It is  the  act/order  of
Government  of	India, though expressed in the name  of	 the
President.  It is for the Minister or Ministry concerned, to
whom  the function is allocated under the rules of  business
to defend and justify such action/order.
</p><p id="p_451">*  The	orders and acts of the President of India  made	 and
taken  in exercise of his functions are generally  expressed
as  having been ordered or taken by the President  of  India
whereas	 the executive action of the Government of India  is
expressed to have been ordered or taken by the Government of
India  in  the	name  of  the  President  of  India.	This
difference in form is only indicative  and no( obligatory or
mandatory.

	      derived  from  unpublished  official   records
	      relating to any affairs of State, except	with
	      the  permission of the officer at the head  of

	      withhold such permission as he thinks fit."
</blockquote><p id="p_453">323.<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_739">Evidence Act</a> is a pre-Constitution enactment.   <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_740">Section

records	 relating  to  affairs	of  State  except  with	 the
permission of the concerned head of the department.  It does
not prevent the head of department permitting it or the head
of  the	 department himself giving evidence on	that  basis.
The  law  relating  to	<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_741">Section	 123</a>  has  been	 elaborately
discussed  in several decisions of this Court and is not  in
issue  herein.	Our only object has been to  emphasise	that
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_742">Article	 74(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_743">Section 123</a> cover different and  distinct
areas.	It may happen that while justifying the Government's
action in court, the Minister or the official concerned	 may
claim  a  privilege  under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_744">Section 123</a>.	 If  and  when	such
privilege  is claimed, it will be decided on its own  merits
in  accordance	with the provisions of that  section.	But,
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_745">Article	 74(2)</a> does not and cannot mean that the  Government
of India need not justify the action taken by the  President
in  the exercise of his functions because of  the  provision
contained  therein.   No such immunity was intended   or  is
provided   by  the  clause.   If the act  or  order  of	 the
President  is  questioned in a court of law, it is  for	 the
Council	 of  Ministers	to  justify  it	 by  disclosing	 the
material which formed the basis of the act/order.  The court
will not ask whether such material formed part of the advice
tendered  to  the  President or whether	 that  material	 was
placed	before the President.  The court will not  also	 ask
what   advice	was   tendered	to   the   President,	what
deliberations	or  discussions	 took  place   between	 the
President  and	his  Ministers	and  how  was  the  ultimate
decision  arrived at.  The court will only see what was	 the
material on the basis of which the requisite satisfaction is
formed	and  whether  it is relevant  to  the  action  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_746">Article 356(1).</a>	 The court will not go into the	 correctness
of the material or its adequacy.  Even if the court were  to
come  to  a different conclusion on the	 said  material,  it
would not interfere since the article speaks of satisfaction
of the President and not that of the court.
</p><p id="p_454">324.In our respectful opinion, the above obligation  cannot
be  evaded  by	seeking refuge	under  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_747">Article	74(2).</a>	 The
argument that the advice tendered to the President comprises
material  as well and, therefore, calling upon the Union  of
India  to disclose the material would amount  to  compelling
the  disclosure	 of  the  advice  is,  if  we  can  say	  so
respectfully, to indulge in sophistry.	The material  placed
before	the President by the Minister/Council  of  Ministers
does  not thereby become part of advice.  Advice is what  is
based upon the said material.  Material is not advice.	 The
material may be placed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_183">243</span>
 before	 the  President to acquaint him	 and if need  be  to
satisfy	 him  that the advice being tendered to him  is	 the
proper one.  But it cannot mean that such material, by	dint
of  being  placed  before the President in  support  of	 the
advice,	 becomes advice itself.	 One can understand  if	 the
advice	is tendered in writing; in such a case that  writing
is  the advice and is covered by the protection provided  by
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_748">Article	 74(2).</a>	 But it is difficult to appreciate how	does
the   supporting  material  become  part  of  advice.	 The
respondents cannot say that whatever the President sees	  or
whatever  is placed before the President becomes  prohibited
material  and  cannot  be seen or  summoned  by	 the  court.
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_749">Article	 74(2)</a>	must be interpreted and	 understood  in	 the
context of entire constitutional system.  Undue emphasis and
expansion   of	 its  Parameters   would   engulf   valuable
constitutional	guarantees.  For these reasons, we  find  it
difficult to agree with the reasoning in State of Rajasthan3
on this score, insofar as it runs contrary to our holding.
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_750">ARTICLE 356</a> AND JUDICIAL REVIEW
</p><p id="p_455">325.Judicial review of administrative and statutory  action
is  perhaps tile most important development in the field  of
public	law in the second half of this century.	  In  India,
the  principles governing this jurisdiction are	 exclusively
Judge-made.   A good amount of debate took place  before  us
with  respect  to  the applicability,  scope  and  reach  of
judicial  review  vis-a-vis the Proclamation issued  by	 the
President  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_751">Article 356</a> of the Constitution.  a  large
volume	of  case-law and legal literature  has	been  placed
before	us.  Though it may not be possible to refer  to	 all
that material, we shall refer to the relevant among them  at
the appropriate place.
</p><p id="p_456">326.One of the contentions raised by the Union of India	 in
Writ Petition No. 237 of 1993 (filed by Shri Sunderlal Patwa
and  others  in Madhya pradesh High  Court  questioning	 the
Proclamation)  and other writ petitions is that inasmuch  as
the  action  under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_752">Article 356</a> is taken	 on  the  subjective
satisfaction  of  the  President  and  further	because	 the
President  cannot  be sued in a court of law  by  virtue  of
<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_753">Article	 361</a>, the impugned Proclamation is not	justiciable.
This  argument	is, however, not pressed before us.   It  is
also  covered  that since Parliament has approved  the	said
Proclamation,  the  court sought not to entertain  the	writ
petition and/or examine the correctness or otherwise of	 the
Presidential Proclamation. (This contention has been further
aborated  and  pressed	before	us,  as	 we  shall   mention
hereinafter).	<a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_754">Article 4(2)</a> is relied upon to	submit	that
the  material  on which the President  based  the  requisite
satisfaction  cannot be compelled to be produced  in  court.
(This  contention has already been dealt with by us.) It  is
also  submitted that the report of the Governor which  forms
the basis of action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_755">Article 356</a> and the material	upon
which it is based cannot be called in question by virtue  of
<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_756">Article 361  (urged in a modified form).</a>
</p><p id="p_457">327.Shri  K. Parasaran, learned counsel appearing  for	the
Union  of  India conceded that the action of  the  President
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_757">Article 356</a> cannot be said to beyond judicial  review
and judicial scrutiny.	He, however, submitted that
(1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">244</span>
having	regard	to  the nature of  the	function,  the	high
constitutional status of the authority in whom the power  is
vested and the exigencies in which the said action is taken,
the  court  ought  not	to  go	into  the  question  of	 the
advisability  of  the  action or into the  adequacy  of	 the
material  on  which it is based.  The  Presidential  action,
counsel	 submitted,  is not susceptible to normal  rules  of
judicial  review, having regard to the political  nature  of
the   action  and  absence  of	any  judicially	  manageable
standards.   There  may	 be  several  imponderables  in	 the
situation  which  the court cannot weigh.   The	 President's
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_758">Article 356</a> cannot be equated to administrative
action	of  a  government official.  It	 is  exercise  of  a
constitutional	function  by the highest  dignitary  of	 the
nation, the President of India.	 May be, the learned counsel
submitted, in a case like Maghalaya (Transferred Case Nos  5
and 7 of 1992), the court may interfere where the invalidity
of  action is demonstrable with reference to the  orders  of
this Court, i.e., where the invalidity is writ large in	 its
face.	But, generally speaking, the court is ill fitted  to
judge the material on which the action is based to determine
whether	 the said material warranted the action taken.	 The
court  cannot  sit  in judgment over the  prognosis  of	 the
President  (for	 that  matter,	of  the	 Union	Council	  of
Ministers),that	 the situation in a given State was  one  in
which  the Government of that State could not be carried  on
in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.	This
is  an	instance, the learned counsel continued,  where	 the
Constitution  has  committed  a	 particular  power  to	 the
President  to  be  exercised in his  discretion	 in  certain
specified situations power flowing from the obligation	cast
by  <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_759">Article 355</a> upon the Union of India to ensure that	"the
Government  of every State is carried on in accordance	with
the provisions of this Constitution".  The President is oath
bound  to protect and preserve the Constitution.  Placed  as
he  is and having regard to the material which is  available
to  him alone  and also because he alone is best  fitted  to
determine  on the basis of material before him	whether	 the
situation  contemplated	 by <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_760">Article 356(1)</a> has	arisen	 the
matter	must  be left to his judgment and  good	 sense.	  He
alone  is  presumed  to possess	 the  astute  political-cum-
administrative	expertise necessary for a proper  and  sound
exercise  of the said power.  Judicial approach,  which	 the
courts	are trained to adopt, is not suited to the  function
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_761">Article	356.</a>  The court would be better	 advised  to
leave  the function to those to whom it is entrusted by	 the
Constitution.  The President of India has to be trusted.  of
course	President in <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_762">Article 356(1)</a> means the Union  Council
of  Ministers  by  virtue of <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_763">Article 74(1)</a>  but	 that  makes
little	difference  in	principle.  That is  the  system  of
Government  we have adopted.  There is no reason to  believe
that  the  highest authority like the  President  of  India,
i.e.,  the Union Council of Ministers  would not act  fairly
and  honestly or that they would not act in accordance	with
the  spirit and scheme of the Constitution.  Shri  Parasaran
further	 submitted that where a particular  Proclamation  is
questioned,  the burden of establishing its invalidity	lies
upon the petitioner.  It is for him to produce the  material
to  substantiate  his  contentions.  By	 virtue	 of  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_764">Article
74(2</a>), the court would not enquire into the advice  tendered
by the Minister
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_185">245</span>
to  the	 President leading to the issuance of  the  impugned
Proclamation.	The  advice  comprises	and  is	 based	upon
certain	 material and information.  The advice and  material
cannot	be separated.  If the court cannot enquire into	 the
advice,	 it  cannot  also call upon the Union  of  India  to
disclose  that	material.   The	 learned  counsel  submitted
further that there is a distinction between judicial  review
of   administrative   action   and   judicial	review	  of
constitutional action.	The decisions of this Court relating
to judicial review of administrative or statutory action and
discretion   cannot  be	 applied  to  judicial	 review	  of
constitutional action.	Appeal against such action, properly
and  truly  speaking,  must, and should always	be,  to	 the
ultimate political sovereign  the people.
</p><p id="p_458">328.Shri P.P. Rao, learned counsel for the State of  Madhya
Pradesh while adopting the contentions of Shri K.  Parasaran
concentrated   mainly  upon  the  secular  nature   of	 our
Constitution,  with the sequiter that  nonsecular  policies,
programmes and acts of political parties place such  parties
outside the pale of constitutionalism.	He submitted that by
adopting  such policies and programmes and by  indulging  in
non-secular  course of action, the Governments run  by	such
parties	 render themselves amenable to action under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_765">Article
356</a>  According	to  the	 learned  counsel,  BJP's   election
manifesto,  together  with the speeches and  acts  of  their
leaders	 and  cadres  make  it	a  non-secular	party	and,
therefore,  the	 dismissal  of their  Government  in  Madhya
Pradesh is perfectly justified.	 Shri Andhyarujina,  learned
Advocate General of Maharashtra submitted that the  doctrine
of  political question has not been given up  altogether  by
the  decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Baker v.  Carr42.
All  that  the	decision has done is to limit  the  area  of
operation of the said doctrine.	 The dismissal of the  State
Government or dissolution of a State Legislative Assembly is
essentially   a	  political  question,	the   validity	 and
correctness whereof cannot be adjudged with reference to any
known judicial standards and/or dicta.	Such matters be best
left  to the wisdom of the President and ultimately  of	 the
people.	 It is for the people to judge whether a  particular
dismissal or dissolution was just or not.
</p><p id="p_459">329.S/Shri   Soli  Sorabjee,  Ram  Jethmalani  and   Shanti
Bhushan,  learned counsel for the petitioners submitted,  on
the  other  hand,  that the action of  the  president  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_766">Article	  356</a>	is  not	 beyond	 judicial   scrutiny.	 The
Constitution does not create any such immunity and it  would
not be desirable to infer any such immunity by a process  of
reasoning  or as a matter of self-restraint by	this  Court.
The  power  has been used more often than not  for  purposes
other than those contemplated by <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_767">Article 356.</a>  The provision
has been abused Repeatedly over the years reducing the State
Governments and the State Legislatures to the status of mere
municipalities.	 If the court were to refuse to enquire into
the validity of such Proclamations, a serious imbalance will
set in in the constitutional scheme.  This Court is as	much
bound  to uphold, protect and preserve the  Constitution  as
the President of India.	 The Founding
42 7 L Ed 2d 663, 686: 369 US 186 (1962)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_186">246</span>
Fathers did not say or indicate anywhere that the  President
shall	exercise   the	 said	power	in   his    absolute
discretion/judgment.   On the contrary, the action  is	made
expressly  subject  to	approval  by  both  the	 Houses	  of
Parliament.   The  remedy of judicial review  guaranteed  by
Articles 32 and 226 extends and applies to this action as to
any  other action of the President under  the  Constitution.
Where Parliament wished to bar judicial review, it has	said
so  expressly,	e.g., Articles 31-B and 31 C.  There  is  no
distinction	between	   the	  judicial     review	  of
administrative/statutory  action  and  judicial	 review	  of
constitutional	action.	 The tests are the same.   No  other
tests  can possibly be suggested.  The power  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_768">Article
356</a>  is	 undoubtedly  the  power  to  be  exercised  on	 the
subjective  satisfaction of the President, which  means	 the
Council of Ministers.  The latter is undoubtedly a political
body  and the experience shows that where a different  party
is  in	power in a State, the Central  Government  has	been
resorting  to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_769">Article 356</a> to destabilise that party  and  to
further the prospects of their own party.  The circumstances
in  which  and	the grounds on which  the  action  based  on
subjective  satisfaction can be interfered with,  have	been
exhaustively  stated by this Court in Barium  Chemical56  as
far back as 1966 which decision has been followed  uniformly
by  this  Court	 over the last	three  decades.	  The  tests
evolved	 in the said decision are relevant even in the	case
of action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_770">Article 356.</a>  The power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_771">Article 356</a> is
a  conditioned	power;	it can be exercised  only  when	 the
President is satisfied that the Government of a State cannot
be  carried  on	 in accordance with the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	Even  in  the case  of	an  unqualified	 and
unconditional power like the one under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_772">Article 72 (power  to
grant  pardon</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_773">, etc.)</a> this Court has held that the action  of
the President is amenable to judicial review (<a href="/doc/1152284/" id="a_774">Kehar Singh v.
Union  of  India19</a>).  The satisfaction must  be	 based	upon
existing  material  and	 must  be  such	 as  would  lead   a
reasonable  man to be satisfied that the Government  of	 the
State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
of  the Constitution.  Even if the action is taken with	 the
best of intentions, it would be bad if the action is outside
the pale of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_775">Article 356.</a>  If the grounds are not relevant or
if   there   are  no  grounds	warranting   the   requisite
satisfaction, the action would be bad.	<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_776">Article 74(2)</a> has no
relevance in this behalf.  It is a sort of red herring drawn
across the trail by the respondents' counsel to confuse	 the
issue.	The petitioners are not interested in or anxious  to
know  what advice, if any, was tendered by the Ministers  to
the  President	leading	 to the	 issuance  of  the  impugned
Proclamation.	They  are  not interested  in  that  aspect.
Their  challenge is to the validity of the Proclamation	 and
since it is an action based upon subjective satisfaction and
also  because the Proclamation does not recite	the  grounds
upon which it has been issued, it is for the Union of  India
to  justify  their action before this Court.   This  is	 the
general	  principle  applicable	 to  cases   of	  subjective
satisfaction  and the Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_777">Article 356</a>  is  no
exception to this rule	say the counsel.
</p><p id="p_460">330.Since  it is not disputed by the counsel for the  Union
of  India and other respondents that the Proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_778">Article	 356</a>  is  amenable to judicial	review,	 it  is	 not
necessary for us to dilate on that aspect.  The power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_187">247</span>
 under	<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_779">Article 356(1)</a> is a conditional power.	In  exercise
of  the power of judicial review, the court is	entitled  to
examine whether the condition has been satisfied or not.  In
what circumstances the court would interfere is a  different
matter but the amenability of the action to judicial  review
is  beyond  dispute.   It would be  sufficient	to  quote  a
passage from State of Rajasthan3 (SCR pp. 80-8 1: SCC p.  66
1, para 149)
	      "So  long	 as  a question	 arises	 whether  an
	      authority	 under	the Constitution  has  acted
	      within the limits of its power or exceeded it,
	      it  can  certainly be decided  by	 the  court.
</p><p id="p_461">	      Indeed   it   would  be	its   constitutional
	      obligation  to  do so ... this  Court  is	 the

	      determining  what	 is the power  conferred  on
	      each  branch  of	Government,  whether  it  is
	      limited,	and if so, what are the	 limits	 and
	      whether any action of that branch transgresses
	      such  limits.  It is for this Court to  uphold
	      the  constitutional values and to enforce	 the
	      constitutional   limitations.   That  is	 the
	      essence of the rule of law."
</p><p id="p_462">	      The controversy really pertains to the  scope,
	      reach and extent of the judicial review.
</p><p id="p_463">	      331.Regarding   the  scope  and	reach	of
	      judicial	review, it must be said at the	very
	      outset that there is not, and there cannot be,
	      a uniform rule applicable to all cases.  It is
	      bound  to	 vary depending	 upon  the  subject-

	      factors.
</p><p id="p_465">	      332.This aspect has been emphasised by  this
	      Court in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_780">Indra Sawhney v. Union</a> ofIndia54 in
	      the following words : (SCC p. 753, para 842  :
	      JT p. 655)
	       "The  extent and scope of  judicial  scrutiny

	      character	 of  the  legal	 and  constitutional
	      provisions applicable and so on.	The acts and
	      orders  of the State made under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_781">Article  16(4)</a>
	      do not enjoy any particular kind of  immunity.
	      At the same time, we must say that court would
	      normally extend due deference to the  judgment
	      and  discretion of the Executive	 a  co-equal
	      wing    in  these	 matters.    The   political

	      appears  to echo our thought  correctly.	 The

	      noted  that  there  'is no  fixed	 rule  which
	      requires the same answer to be given in  every
	      case'.  Similar sentiments have been expressed
	      in the case of express procedural requirements
	      where  the  courts have to  wrestle  with	 the
	      distinction  between mandatory  and  directory
	      requirements, where the law has been described
	      'as  inextricable tangle of loose	 ends',	 and
	      where   the  variables   including  ideas	  of
	      'substantial  compliance'	 or  as	 to  whether
	      anyone has been prejudiced  are such that even
	      the   same   statutory   provision   may	  be
	      differently   interpreted	 according  to	 the

	      has  been eloquently recognized both  by	Lord
	      Hailsham	who,  against a background  of	'the
	      rapidly	  developing	jurisprudence	  of
	      administrative  law' spoke of a  'spectrum  of

</p><p id="p_467">334.Having  said this, we may now proceed to examine a	few
decisions  where Proclamations of emergency were  questioned
to  notice how the challenge was dealt with.  We  may  first
notice the decision of the Privy Council in <a href="/doc/617286/" id="a_782">Bhagat Singh  v.
Emperor55</a>.  Section 72 of the Government of India Act,	1919
empowered  the	Governor  General  to  make  and  promulgate
ordinance for the peace and good government of British India
in  case of emergency.	The ordinance so made, however,	 was
to be effective for a period of six months from the date  of
its  promulgation and was to be effective like an  enactment
made  by the Indian legislature and be subject to  the	very
same  restrictions  applying  to an enactment  made  by	 the
Indian legislature.  The section read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_125">	      "72.   The Governor General may, in  cases  of
	      emergency, make and promulgate ordinances	 for
	      the peace and good government of British India
	      or any part thereof, and any ordinance so made
	      shall,  for  the space of not  more  than	 six
	      months  from its promulgation, have  the	like
	      force  of law as an Act passed by	 the  Indian
	      legislature but the power of making ordinances
	      under  this  section is subject  to  the	like
	      restrictions  as	the  power  of	the   Indian
	      legislature  to make laws; and  any  ordinance
	      made under this section is subject to the like
	      disallowance  as an Act passed by	 the  Indian
	      legislature   and	  may	be   controlled	  or
	      superseded by any such Act."
</blockquote><p id="p_468">335.Exercising the said power, the Governor General  issued
an ordinance whereunder the appellant was convicted.  In the
appeal	to  the Board, the appellant contended	that,  as  a
matter of fact, there was no state of emergency and that the
Governor  General  acted illegally in proclaiming  that	 one
exists	and  issuing  the ordinance  on	 that  basis.	This
contention was rejected by the Board in the following words
55 AIR 1931 PC 11 1: 58 IA 169: 35 CWN 646
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_189">249</span>
	      "That  raises directly the question who is  to
	      be  the judge of whether a state of  emergency
	      exists.	A  state of emergency  is  something
	      that does not permit of any exact definition :
	      It  connotes  a state of matters	calling	 for
	      drastic  action which is to be judged as	such
	      by someone.  It is more than obvious that that
	      someone  must be the Governor General  and  he
	      alone.   Any other view would  render  utterly
	      inept the whole provision.  Emergency  demands
	      immediate action and that action is prescribed
	      to be taken by the Governor General.  It is he
	      alone who can promulgate the ordinance.
</p><p id="p_469">	      Yet,  if the view urged by the petitioners  is
	      right,  the judgment of the  Governor  General
	      could  be	 upset	either	(a)  by	 this  Board
	      declaring	  that	 once  the   ordinance	 was
	      challenged  in  proceedings by way  of  habeas
	      corpus the Crown ought to prove  affirmatively
	      before  a	 court	that a	state  of  emergency
	      existed,	or  (b) by a finding of	 this  Board
	      after  a	contentious and	 protracted  enquiry
	      that  no state of emergency existed, and	that
	      the ordinance with all that followed on it was
	      illegal.
</p><p id="p_470">	      In  fact,	 the  contention  is  so  completely
	      without  foundation on the fact of it that  it
	      would  be	 idle to allow an  appeal  to  argue
	      about it.
</p><p id="p_471">	      It  was next said that the ordinance  did	 not
	      conduce  to the peace and good  government  of
	      British India.  The same remarks applies.	 The
	      Governor	General is also the judge  of  that.
	      The  power given by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_783">Section 72</a> is an  absolute
	      power  without any limits	 prescribed,  except
	      only  that  it  cannot  do  what	the   Indian
	      legislature would be unable to do, although it
	      is  made clear that it is only to be  used  in
	      extreme  cases  of necessity  where  the	good
	      government of India demands it."
</p><p id="p_472">336.Thus, the approach of the Board was one of 'hands-off'.
The  Governor General was held to be the final judge of	 the
question  whether an emergency exists.	The power  conferred
by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_784">Section 72</a> was described as an absolute power without any
limits	prescribed, except that which apply to an  enactment
made  by the Indian legislature.  It was also observed	that
the  subject-matter is not a fit one for a court to  enquire
into.
</p><p id="p_473">337.We	may  point out that this extreme  position  is	not
adopted by Shri Parasaran, learned counsel appearing for the
Union  of India.  He did concede that judicial review  under
the   Constitution  is	not  excluded  in  the	 matter	  of
Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_785">Article 356(1)</a> though his submission	 was
that  it  should  be available in an  extremely	 narrow	 and
limited area since it is a power committed expressly to	 the
President by the Constitution and also because the issue  is
not  one  amenable  to judicial	 review	 by  applying  known
judicially  manageable	standards.   The  Supreme  Court  of
Pakistan  in  Federation  of Pakistan  v.  Mohd.   Saifullah
Khan56 described the approach (adopted in Bhagat Singh55) in
the following words (quoting Cornelius, J.)

	      "In  the	period	of  foreign  rule,  such  an

	      times  prevailed, but under  autonomous  rule,
	      where  those who exercise power in  the  State
	      are themselves citizens of the same State,  it
	      can hardly be tolerated."

totally inconsistent with the ethos of our Constitution,  as
would be evident from the discussion infra.
</p><p id="p_475">339.The	 view taken in Bhagat Singh55 was affirmed  by	the
Privy  Council in the year 1944 in King Emperor	 v.  Benoari
Lal Sarma57.  It was held that whether an emergency  existed
at  the	 time the ordinance was made and promulgated  was  a
matter of which the Governor General was the sole judge.  If
it were not so, it was observed, the Governor General  would
be  disabled  from  taking  action  necessary  to  meet	 the
emerging dangerous situation, according to his assessment of
the  situation.	  It is enough to say that this	 case  again
represents  what  we have called the extreme  view.   It  is
inappropriate in the context of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_786">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_476">340.The	 next  decision is again of the	 Privy	Council	 in
Stephen	  Kalong  Ningkan  v.  Govt.  of  Malaysia58.	 The
appellant  was the Chief Minister of Sarawak, an  Estate  in
the Federation of Malaysia.  On June 16, 1966, the  Governor
of Sarawak requested him to resign on the ground that he had
ceased to command the confidence of the Council Negri.	 The
appellant  refused  whereupon the Governor informed  him  on
June  17,  1966	 that he ceased to  hold  the  office.	 The
appellant  approached the High Court of Kuching against	 the
Governor's intimation.	On September 7, 1966, the High Court
upheld his plea and ruled that the Governor had no power  to
dismiss	 him.  On September 14, 1966.  His Majesty Yang	 di-
Pertuan	 Agong (Head of the State of Malaysia) proclaimed  a
state  of emergency throughout the territories of the  State
of Sarawak.  The Proclamation was made under <a href="/doc/1244239/" id="a_787">Article 150</a>  of
the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, which reads thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_126">	      "150.  (1)  If the Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  is
	      satisfied	  that	a  grave  emergency   exists
	      whereby  the security or the economic life  of
	      the  Federation  or  of any  part	 thereof  is
	      threatened,  he  may issue a  Proclamation  or
	      emergency."
</blockquote><p id="p_477">341.The article provided for such Proclamation being placed
for  approval before both the Houses of Parliament, who	 had
the power to disapprove the same.  Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1244239/" id="a_788">Article 150</a>
empowered  the	Federal Parliament, during  the	 period	 the
Proclamation  of  emergency was in operation, to  make	laws
with  respect  to  any matter which it	appeared  to  it  as
required  by  reason  of the emergency.	 Such  law,  it	 was
provided,   shall  be  operative  notwithstanding   anything
contained  either in the Constitution of the  Federation  or
the Constitution of the State of Sarawak, and will not be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_191">251</span>
 treated  as  amendment to the Constitution.  Any  such	 law
was,  however,	to  be	in force  only	for  the  period  of
emergency.  In exercise of the power conferred by clause (5)
of  <a href="/doc/1244239/" id="a_789">Article 150</a>, the Federation Parliament passed  Emergency
(Federal  Constitution	and Constitution  of  Sarawak)	Act,
1966.	<a href="/doc/758150/" id="a_790">Section	 5</a> of this Act	specifically  empowered	 the
Governor  to  dismiss the Chief Minister,  in  his  absolute
discretion,  if, at any time, the Council Negri	 passed	 the
resolution of no confidence in the Government by a  majority
and  yet the Chief Minister failed to resign.  On  September
23, 1966, the Council Negri met and passed the resolution of
no  confidence	in the Chief Minister (appellant).   On	 the
next day, the Governor dismissed the appellant under the new
Act.   He  impugned  the  action in  the  Federal  Court  of
Malaysia, wherein he sought for a declaration that the	1966
Act  aforesaid was ultra vires the Federal  Parliament.	  He
contended that the Proclamation of emergency was a fraud  on
the  Constitution and of no effect inasmuch as no  state  of
grave  emergency existed.  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_791">The Act</a> aforesaid founded  as  it
was  on the Proclamation of emergency, was equally void	 and
of no effect, he submitted.  He contended that the  evidence
showed that none of the usual signs and symptoms of "  grave
emergency"  existed in Sarawak at or before the time of	 the
Proclamation;  that  no disturbances, riots or	strikes	 had
occurred; that no extra troops or police had been placed  on
duty;  that no curfew or other restrictions on movement	 had
been  found  necessary and that the  '	confrontation'	with
Indonesia  had	already come to an end.	 The  Federation  of
Malaysia repudiated all the said contentions.  It  submitted
that  the Proclamation of emergency was conclusive  and	 not
assailable before the court.
</p><p id="p_478">342.The	 Privy	Council (Lord MacDermott speaking  for	the
Board) expressed the view in the first instance that it	 was
"unsettled and debatable" whether a Proclamation made by the
Supreme	 Head of the Federation of Malaysia under  statutory
powers could be challenged on some or other grounds but then
proceeded on the assumption that the matter is	justiciable.
On  that  assumption,  the Board,proceeded  to	examine	 the
further	 contentions  of the appellant.	 It found  that	 the
Proclamation  of emergency and the impugned Act were  really
designed to meet the constitutional deadlock that had arisen
on  account  of	 the absence  of  provision  empowering	 the
Governor  to  dismiss the Chief Minister  where	 the  latter
ceased	to  enjoy the confidence of the Council	 Negri.	  It
observed  : "It is not for their Lordships to  criticise  or
comment upon the wisdom or expediency of the steps taken  by
the Governor of Malaysia in dealing with the  constitutional
situation  which  had  occurred in Sarawak,  or	 to  enquire
whether	 that situation could itself have been avoided by  a
different approach." The Privy Council observed further that
"they  can  find, in the material presented, no	 ground	 for
holding	  that	 the  respondent    Government	 was   acting
erroneously or in any way mala fide in taking the view	that
there  was  a  constitutional crisis  in  Sarawak,  that  it
involved or threatened a breakdown of a State Government and
amounted to an emergency calling for immediate action.	 Nor
can  their  Lordships find any reason for  saying  that	 the
emergency thus considered to exist was not grave
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_192">252</span>
and  did not threaten the security of Sarawak.	 These	were
essential matters to be determined according to the judgment
of the respondent-ministers in the light of their  knowledge
and  experience	 ... and that he (the appellant)  failed  to
satisfy	 the  Board that the steps taken by  the  Government
including  the	Proclamation and the impugned Act,  were  in
fraudem	 legis	or otherwise unauthorised  by  the  relevant
legislation".  The appeal was accordingly dismissed.
</p><p id="p_479">343.Three strands of reasoning are evident in the decision.
Firstly,  the  Privy  Council assumed  that  the  issue	 was
justiciable.   On that basis, it examined the facts  of	 the
case  and  found  that	the  situation	did  amount  to	  an
emergency.   Secondly and more importantly, it examined	 and
found  that  there  was	 no  "reason  for  saying  that	 the
emergency thus considered to exist was not grave and did not
threaten the security of Sarawak", though at the same  time,
it  held  that	existence of emergency is  a  matter  to  be
determined by the Council of Ministers in the light of their
knowledge  and	experience and thirdly, that  the  appellant
failed to establish that the Proclamation of emergency was a
fraud on the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_480">344.We	may  now  notice the only decision  of	this  Court
dealing	 with <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_792">Article 356</a>, viz., State of  Rajasthan3.	 Two
circumstances  must  be	 kept in mind  while  examining	 the
decision, viz., (i) the writ petitions (and suits) filed  by
various States were not directed against Proclamation(s)  of
emergency, since no such Proclamations were issued prior  to
the  filing of those suits and writ petitions; and  (ii)  at
that time, clause (5) introduced by 38th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_793">(Amendment) Act</a> was
in force.  Clause (5) read as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_127">	      "5.    Notwithstanding   anything	  in	this
	      Constitution,   the   satisfaction   of	 the
	      President	 mentioned  in clause (1)  shall  be
	      final   and  conclusive  and  shall   not	  be
	      questioned in any court on any ground."  [This
	      clause   was  substituted	 by  an	  altogether
	      different clause by the 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_794">(Amendment) Act</a>.]
</blockquote><p id="p_481">345.The	 subject-matter	 of challenge in the  suits  (under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_795">Article	 131</a>) and writ petitions (under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_796">Article 32</a>) in	this
matter	was  a letter written by the then Home	Minister  to
Chief Ministers of certain States advising them to seek	 the
dissolution of respective Legislative Assemblies and seek  a
fresh  mandate from the people.	 The letter stated that	 the
elections to Lok Sabha held in March 1977 indicated that the
Congress  Party,  in  power in those States,  has  lost	 its
mandate	 totally and has become alienated with	the  people.
The letter, together with a statement made by the then Union
Law Minister, was treated as a threat to dismiss those State
Governments.  To ward off such a threat, they approached the
Supreme Court by way of suits and writ petitions.  They were
heard  expeditiously  and  dismissed  on  April	 29,   1977.
Reasoned  opinions  were  delivered  later,  by	 which	date
Proclamations  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_797">Article 356(1)</a> were  actually  issued.
One  of the questions related to the maintainability of	 the
suits, with which question, of course, we are not concerned.

</p><p id="p_482">346.Six	 opinions were delivered by the seven-Judge  Bench.
Though all of them agreed that the writ petitions and  suits
be  dismissed,	their reasoning is not uniform.	  It  would,
therefore,  be	appropriate to notice the  ratio  underlying
each  of  the  opinions insofar as it is  relevant  for	 our
purposes :
</p><p id="p_483">Beg, C.J.- The opinion of Beg, C.J. contains several strands
of thought.  They may be stated briefly thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_128">	      (i)The  language	of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_798">Article  356</a>	 and  the
	      practice	since  1950 shows that	the  Central
	      Government  can enforce its will	against	 the
	      State Governments with respect to the question
	      how the State Governments should function	 and
	      who should hold reins of power.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_129">	      (ii)By virtue of <a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_799">Article 356(5)</a> and  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_800">Article
	      74(2</a>),  it  is  impossible for  the  court  to
	      question	the satisfaction of  the  President.
	      It has to decide the case on the basis of only
	      those  facts as may have been admitted  by  or
	      placed by the President before the court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_130">	      (iii)The	language of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_801">Article 356(1)</a> is  very
	      wide.   It is desirable that  conventions	 are
	      developed	 channelising the exercise  of	this
	      power.  The court can interfere only when	 the
	      power  is	 used  in  a  grossly  perverse	 and
	      unreasonable manner so as to constitute patent
	      misuse  of  the provisions or to an  abuse  of
	      power.  The same idea is expressed at  another
	      place  saying that if "a	constitutionally  or
	      legally prohibited or extraneous or collateral
	      purpose  is  sought  to be  achieved"  by	 the
	      Proclamation, it would be liable to be  struck
	      down. The question whether the majority  party
	      in  the  Legislative Assembly of a  State	 has
	      become  totally estranged from the  electorate
	      is not a matter for the court to determine.

<p id="p_484">     We	  may  say  at	once  that  we	are  in	  respectful
disagreement   with   propositions  (i),   (ii)	  and	(iv)
altogether.  So far as proposition (iii) is concerned, it is
not far off the mark and in substance accords with our view,
as we shall presently show.
</p><p id="p_485">Y.   V.	 Chandrachud, J.- On the scope of  judicial  review,
the  learned Judge held that where the reasons disclosed  by
the  Union  of India are wholly extraneous,  the  court	 can
interfere  on the ground of mala fides.	 Judicial  scrutiny,
said  the  learned  Judge, is  available  "for	the  limited
purpose	 of  seeing whether the reasons	 bear  any  rational
nexus  with the action proposed".  The court cannot  sit  in
judgment   over	 the  satisfaction  of	the  President	 for
determining  whether  any  other view of  the  situation  is
reasonably  possible, opined the learned Judge.	 Turning  to
the  facts  of	the   case before  him,	 the  learned  Judge
observed that the grounds assigned by the Central Government
in its counter-affidavit cannot be said to be irrelevant to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_194">254</span>
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_804">Article 356.</a>  The court cannot go deeper into the matter nor
shall the court enquire whether there were any other reasons
besides those disclosed in the counter-affidavit.
P.N.  Bhagwati	and  A. C. Gupta, JJ.-	The  learned  Judges
enunciated the following propositions in their opinion :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_132">	      The  action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_805">Article 356</a> has to be  taken
	      on   the	 subjective  satisfaction   of	 the
	      President.  The satisfaction is not objective.
	      There  are  no  judicially  discoverable	 and
	      manageable  standards by which the  court	 can
	      examine the correctness of the satisfaction of
	      the President.  The satisfaction to be arrived
	      at is largely political in nature, based on an
	      assessment  of  various and varied  facts	 and
	      factors besides several imponderables and fast
	      changing	situations.  The court is not a	 fit
	      body   to	 enquire  into	or   determine	 the
	      correctness   of	the  said  satisfaction	  or
	      assessment, as it may be called.	However,  if
	      the  power is exercised mala fide or is  based
	      upon wholly extraneous or irrelevant  grounds,
	      the  court would have jurisdiction to  examine
	      it.   Even  clause (5) is not a bar  when	 the
	      contention  is that there was no	satisfaction
	      at all.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_133">	      The  scope  of judicial review of	 the  action
	      under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_806">Article 356</a>, the learned Judges held, is
	      confined	to a "narrow minimal area.   May  be
	      that in most cases, it would be difficult,  if
	      not  impossible, to challenge the exercise  of
	      power  under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_807">Article 356(1)</a> on  the  aforesaid
	      limited	ground,	  because  the	 facts	 and
	      circumstances  on	 which the  satisfaction  is
	      based, would not be known.  However, where  it
	      is possible, the existence of satisfaction can
	      always be challenged on the ground that it  is
	      mala  fide or based on wholly  extraneous	 and
	      irrelevant grounds".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_134">	      We may say with great respect that we find  it
	      difficult to agree with the above formulations
	      in  toto.	 We agree only with  the  statements
	      regarding	   the	 permissible   grounds	  of
	      interference by court and the effect of clause
	      (5),  as	it  then obtained.   We	 also  agree
	      broadly with the first proposition, though not
	      in the absolute terms indicated therein.
	      Goswami	and  Untwalia,	JJ.-  The   separate
	      opinions	 of   Goswami  and   Untwalia,	 JJ.
	      emphasise	  one  single  fact,  namely,	that
	      inasmuch	as the facts stated in the  counter-
	      affidavit filed by the Home Minister cannot be
	      said   to	  be  "mala  fide,   extraneous	  or
	      irrelevant",  the	 action impugned  cannot  be
	      assailed in the court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_135">	      Fazal Ali, J.- The learned Judge held that
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_136">	      (i)   the	 action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_808">Article 356</a> is  immune
	      from  judicial scrutiny unless the  action  is
	      "guided	by  extraneous	 consideration"	  or
	      "personal considerations".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_137">	      (ii)  the	 inference  drawn  by  the   Central
	      Government following the 1977 elections to the
	      Lok  Sabha cannot be said to be  unreasonable.
	      It cannot be said that the inference drawn had
	      no nexus with <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_809">Article 356.</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_486">347. It	 would thus be seen that there is a broad  consensus
among five of the seven Judges that the court can  interfere
if  it is satisfied that the power has been  exercised	mala
fide or on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_195">255</span>
<p id="p_487"> Some  learned Judges have stated the rule in  narrow  terms
and  some  others in a little less narrow terms	 but  not  a
single	learned Judge held that the Proclamation  is  immune
from judicial scrutiny.	 It must be remembered that at	that
time  clause  (5) was there barring judicial review  of	 the
Proclamation  and yet they said that court can interfere  on
the  ground  of mala fides or where it is  based  wholly  on
extraneous  or irrelevant grounds.  Surely, the deletion  of
clause (5) has not restricted the scope of judicial  review.
Indeed,	 it removed the cloud cast on the said	power.	 The
court  should, if anything, be more inclined to examine	 the
constitutionality of the Proclamation after such deletion.
</p><p id="p_488">348. It would be appropriate at this stage to examine a	 few
decisions   of	the  Pakistan  Supreme	Court,	 since	 the
Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 contains a provision somewhat
similar to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_810">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_489">349. <a href="/doc/1665174/" id="a_811">Article  58</a>  of  the  Constitution	 of  Pakistan,	1973

says that the President shall dissolve the National Assembly
if  so advised by the Prime Minister.  It  further  provides
that  in any event on the expiry of forty-eight hours  after
the Prime Minister has advised the dissolution, the National
Assembly  stands dissolved.  Clause (2) is relevant for	 our
purpose.  It reads thus :

Judges of the Pakistan Supreme Court.  Acting under  <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_814">Article
58(2)(b</a>),  the President of Pakistan dissolved the  National
Assembly  and dismissed the federal cabinet  with  immediate
effect by a notification dated May 29, 1988.  The order made
by the President
56 PLD (1 989) SC 166
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_196">256</span>
recited	 "that	the  objects  and  purposes  for  which	 the

alarming  extent,  resulting in tragic loss  of	 innumerable
valuable lives as well as property; that the life, property,
honour	and security of the citizens of Pakistan  have	been
rendered totally unsafe; and that the integrity and ideology
of  Pakistan have been seriously endangered".  The  validity
of the said order was challenged by a member of the National
Assembly  by way of writ petition in the Lahore High  Court,
which  allowed it but declined to grant the  further  relief
sought	for  by	 the petitioner, viz.,	restoration  of	 the
National  Assembly, [Provincial Assembly of Punjab was	also
dissolved by a similar order made by the Governor of  Punjab
under  <a href="/doc/43071/" id="a_815">Article	112(2)(b</a>), which too was questioned  in	 the
High Court and with the same result].  In the appeal  before
the  Supreme Court, it was contended that the action of	 the
President  was immune from judicial scrutiny inasmuch as  it
was an instance of exercise of his discretionary power.	 The
contention  was	 repelled  by  the  Supreme  Court  in	 the
following words :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_141">	      "The discretion conferred by <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_816">Article  58(2)(b)</a>
	      of  the Constitution on the President  cannot,

	      but is to be deemed to be a qualified one,  in
	      the  sense  that it is  circumscribed  by	 the

	      It  must further be noted that the reading  of
	      the  provisions  of Articles 48(2)  and  58(2)
	      shows that the President has to first form his
	      opinion, objectively, and then, it is open  to
	      him to exercise his discretion one way or	 the
	      other,  i.e., either to dissolve the  Assembly
	      or  to  decline to dissolve it. Even  if	some
	      immunity	 envisaged  by	<a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_817">Article	  48(2)</a>	  is
	      available	 to the action taken  under  <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_818">Article
	      58(2)</a> that can possibly be only in relation to
	      his  'opinion'.  An obligation is cast on	 the
	      President	 by  the  aforesaid   constitutional
	      provision	   that	  before   exercising	 his
	      discretion he has to form his 'opinion' that a
	      situation	 of  the kind envisaged	 in  <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_819">Article
	      58(2)(b)</a>	has  arisen which  necessitates	 the
	      grave   step   of	 dissolving   the   National
	      Assembly.	  In Abul Ala Mabsoodi v.  Govt.  of
	      West   Pakistan59	  Cornelius   C.J.,    while
	      interpreting   certain   provisions   of	 the
	      <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_820">Criminal	Law Amendment Act</a>,  1908,  construed
	      the word 'opinion' as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_142">	      '....it is a duty of Provincial Government  to
	      take into consideration all relevant facts and
	      circumstances.   That imports the exercise  of
	      an  honest  judgment as to  the  existence  of
	      conditions in which alone the opinion must  be
	      formed  honestly,	 that  the  restriction	  is
	      necessary.  In this process, the only  element
	      which  I find to possess a subjective  quality
	      as  against  objective determination,  is	 the
	      final  formation	of opinion that	 the  action
	      proposed	 is   necessary.    Even   this	  is
	      determined,   for	 the  most  part,   by	 the
	      existence	 of  circumstances  compelling	 the
	      conclusion.    The  scope	 for   exercise	  of
	      personal discretion is extremely limited.	 ...
	      As  I  have  pointed out, if  the	 section  be
	      construed	 in  a	comprehensive  manner,	 the
	      requirement
	      59 PLD (1 964) SC 673
	      257  of  an  honest  opinion  based  upon	 the
	      ascertainment  of	 certain matters  which	 are
	      entirely within the grasp and appreciation  of
	      the    government	  agency   is	clearly	   a
	      prerequisite to the exercise of the power.  In
	      the period of foreign rule, such an  argument,
	      i.e.,   that   the  opinion  of	the   person
	      exercising  authority is absolute may have  at
	      times  prevailed, but under  autonomous  rule,
	      where  those who exercise power in  the  State
	      are themselves citizens of the same States, it
	      can hardly be tolerated'.	 "
</blockquote><p id="p_492">352. It was further held that "though the President can make
his  own  assessment of the situation as to  the  course  of
action	to  be followed but his opinion must be	 founded  on
some material".
</p><p id="p_493">353. One  of the learned Judges (Shaifur Rehman,  J.)  dealt
with  the meaning and significance of the words	 "cannot  be
carried	 on" occurring in <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_821">Article 58(2)(b)</a> in the  following
words :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_143">	      "the   expression	 'cannot  be   carried	 on'
	      sandwiched   as  it  is  between	 'Federation
	      Government'   and	 'in  accordance  with	 the
	      provisions  of the Constitution',	 acquires  a
	      very potent, a very positive and very concrete
	      content.	 Nothing has been left to  surmises,
	      likes  or dislikes, opinion or view.  It	does
	      not  concern  itself  with  the  pace  of	 the
	      progress,	 the  shade of the  quality  or	 the
	      degree  of the performance or the	 quantum  of
	      the achievement.	It concerns itself with	 the
	      breakdown	 of the constitutional mechanism,  a
	      stalemate, a deadlock ensuring the  observance
	      of the provisions of the Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_494">354. The next decision of the Pakistan Supreme Court brought
to our notice is in Khaja Ahmed Tariq Rahim v. Federation of
Pakistan21.   On August 6, 1990, the President	of  Pakistan
dissolved   the	 National  Assembly  in	 exercise   of	 his
discretion,  by an order made under <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_822">Article 58(2)(b)</a> of	 the
Constitution of Pakistan.  The formal order referred to	 the
National Assembly being afflicted with internal	 dissensions
and frictions, persistent and scandalous 'horse-trading' for
political  gain	 and  furtherance  of  personal	  interests,
corrupt	 practices  and inducement in contravention  of	 the
Constitution   and   the  law  and  failure   to   discharge
substantive legislative functions other than the adoption of
the  finance bill all of which led the president to  believe
that  the National Assembly has lost the confidence  of	 the
people.	  The  validity	 of the order was  challenged  by  a
former federal minister in the Lahore High Court.  The	High
Court upheld the Presidential order whereupon the matter was
carried to the Supreme Court.  Both the parties agreed	that
the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Federation
of  Pakistan  v.  Mohd.	  Saifullah  Khan56  do	 govern	 the
controversy.
</p><p id="p_495">355. On	 facts, the Supreme Court found that though some  of
the  goods  given  may	not be	relevant,  there  are  other
relevant goods all of which read together "are sufficient to
justify the action taken".
</p><p id="p_496">1 PLD(1992)SC646,664
6 PLD (1989) SC 166
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_197">258</span>
</p><p id="p_497">356. The  next decision relied upon by Shri Sorabjee  is  in
Mian  Mohd.  Nawaz Sharif v. President of  Pakistan29.	 The
said  decision pertains to the most recent dismissal of	 the
Federal Government and dissolution of the National  Assembly
by  the President of Pakistan by his order dated  April	 18,
1993.
</p><p id="p_498">357. In	 this  decision,  several  propositions	 have	been
enunciated by the court.  Firstly, it is reiterated that "if
it  could be shown that no grounds existed on the  basis  of
which  an honest opinion could be formed 'that	a  situation
had arisen in which the Government of the Federation  cannot
be  carried  on	 in accordance with the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution  and an appeal to the electorate is  necessary'
the exercise of the power would be unconstitutional and open
to  correction	through judicial review".  It is  next	held
that  "<a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_823">Article	58(2)(b)</a> of the	 Constitution  empowers	 the
executive head to destroy the legislature and to remove	 the
chosen representatives.	 It is an exceptional power provided
for an exceptional situation and must receive, as it has  in
Federation  of	Pakistan v. Haji Md.  Saifullah	 Khan56	 the
narrowest interpretation".  It is also held that if there is
a  doubt whether the Prime Minister had lost the  confidence
of   the   National   Assembly	 "the	only   course	left
constitutionally open for the President for arriving at	 his
satisfaction  in  this	matter is to  'summon  the  National
Assembly and require the Prime Minister to obtain a vote  of
confidence  in	the National Assembly' ".  This	 observation
was, of course, made in the context of <a href="/doc/1221097/" id="a_824">Article 91(5</a>),  which
says:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_144">	      "(5)  The	 Prime Minister	 shall	hold  office
	      during the pleasure of the President, but	 the
	      President shall not exercise his powers  under
	      this  clause unless he is satisfied  that	 the
	      Prime Minister does not command the confidence
	      of the majority of the members of the National
	      Assembly,	 in which case he shall	 summon	 the
	      National	 Assembly  and	require	 the   Prime
	      Minister	to obtain a vote of confidence	from
	      the Assembly."
</blockquote><p id="p_499">358. The court then examined the Presidential Order and held
that none of the grounds therein bore any nexus to the order
passed	and  that  the grounds stated  were  extraneous	 and
irrelevant  and	 in clear departure  of	 the  constitutional
provisions.  Accordingly, it was held that the	Presidential
declaration  was unconstitutional and that as a natural	 and
logical	 corollary,  the Ministry which has  been  dismissed
along with the dissolved National Assembly must be  restored
and revived.
</p><p id="p_500">359.Before we refer to the principle of these decisions,  it
is  necessary  to  bear	 in mind the  nature  of  the  power
conferred  by the Constitution of Pakistan.   Under  <a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_825">Article
58(2)(b</a>),. the President, who acts alone and personally,  is
empowered  not	only to dismiss the Federal  Government	 but
also to dissolve the National Assembly if, in his opinion, a
situation  has	arisen	in  which  the	Government  of	 the
Federation  cannot  be	carried on in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of	the  Constitution  and	an  appeal  to	 the
electorate  is	necessary.   This is,  of  course,  not	 the
position under our
29 PLD(1993)SC473
56 PLD (1989) SC 166
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_198">259</span>
 Constitution.	Under our Constitution, the President has to
act  and  does	act in accordance with the  aid	 and  advice
tendered  to him by the Council of Ministers with the  Prime
Minister  at  its  head.   There  is  no  occasion  for	 the
President  to  act  in	his  personal  capacity	 or  without
reference   to	the  Council  of  Ministers.	The   second
distinguishing	 feature   is  that   under   the   Pakistan
Constitution  the  President  is empowered  to	dismiss	 the
Federal	 Government  just as the Governor of a	province  is
empowered  to  dismiss the  Provincial	Government,  whereas
under  our Constitution, there is no question  of  President
dismissing  the Union Government; it is really a case  where
the  Union Government dismisses the State Government if	 the
situation contemplated by <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_826">Article 356(1)</a> arises.  The strong
remarks made by the Pakistan Supreme Court must no doubt  be
understood  in	the context of the  aforesaid  character  of
<a href="/doc/1316212/" id="a_827">Article 58(2)(b).</a>  Yet the relevance of the approach adopted
by the Pakistan Supreme Court is not without significance.
</p><p id="p_501">360. We	 may  at  this stage refer to the  decision  of	 the
Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1152284/" id="a_828">Kehar Singh v. Union  of
India19</a>.   <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_829">Article 72</a> of the Constitution confers  upon	 the
President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or
remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the
sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  The  power
extends to cases where the sentence is a sentence of  death.
The  article does not provide any guidance in which  matters
should the President exercise which power and in which cases
to refuse.  In other words, the power appears ex facie to be
absolute.   Kehar Singh was convicted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_830">Section 302</a>	 IPC
in  connection	with  the assassination of  the	 then  Prime
Minister of India, Smt Indira Gandhi and sentenced to death.
The  sentence  was  confirmed by this Court  on	 appeal.   A
subsequent  writ  petition and review filed by him  in	this
Court  failed.	Kehar Singh's son then presented a  petition
to the President of India for grant of pardon under  Article
</p><p id="p_502">72.  He requested a personal hearing.  Personal hearing	 was
refused and in a letter addressed to Kehar Singh's  counsel,
the  Secretary	to the President expressed  the	 President's
opinion that the President cannot go into the merits of	 the
case finally decided by the Highest Court of the land.	 The
petition  was  accordingly rejected.  The rejection  of	 the
petition  was  questioned by way of writ  petition  in	this
Court.	This Court expressed the view that under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_831">Article  72</a>
it  is open to the President to scrutinise the	evidence  on
record of a criminal case and come to a different conclusion
from  that  recorded by the Court both on  the	question  of
guilt as well as sentence.  This power, it was held, is	 not
in conflict with nor in supersession of judicial power.	  It
is  an	altogether  different  power,  an  executive   power
exercised on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.
it  was	 also stated that any number of	 considerations	 may
enter  the  decision  of the President and that	 it  is	 not
possible to lay any guidelines governing the exercise of the
said power.  What is relevant for our purpose is the holding
regarding  the extent of judicial review of the exercise  of
power under the said article.  It was held that the exercise
of power under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_832">Article 72</a> falls
9 (1989) 1 SCC 204: 1989 SCC (Cri) 86: 1988 Supp 3 SCR 1102
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_199">260</span>
squarely  within the judicial domain and can be examined  by
the court by way of judicial review.  While the court cannot
go into the merits, the limitations of such review are those
enunciated in <a href="/doc/1222748/" id="a_833">Maru Ram v. Union</a> of India6O (SCC p. 154:	 SCR
at p. 1249).  The Court held' :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_145">	      "The  function of determining whether the	 act
	      of  a constitutional or statutory	 functionary
	      falls within the constitutional or legislative
	      conferment  of power, or is vitiated by  self-
	      denial  on  an erroneous appreciation  of	 the
	      full  amplitude of the power is a	 matter	 for
	      the court."
</blockquote><p id="p_503"> This was so held in spite of the seemingly absolute  nature
of  the	 power conferred by <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_834">Article 72</a> upon  the  President.
The  argument of the learned Attorney General of India	that
the  exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_835">Article 72</a> was not	 justiciable
was accordingly rejected.
</p><p id="p_504">361. Counsel  appearing	 on  both the  sides  placed  strong
reliance upon the decision of the House of Lords in CCSU  v.
Minister for the Civil Service8 as laying down correctly the
principles  to be followed in the matter of judicial  review
of administrative action whether governed by a statute or by
'common law'.  The petitioners say that this approach  ought
to be adopted even in the case of constitutional action like
the one under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_836">Article 356.</a>  The respondents demur to it.  It
is,  therefore,	 necessary  to examine what  does  the	said
decision lay down precisely.
</p><p id="p_505">362. The Government Communications Headquarters is a  branch
of  the public services under the Foreign  and	Commonwealth
Office.	  Its main functions are to ensure the	security  of
the United Kingdom military and official communications	 and
to  provide signals intelligence for the Government.   Since
1947,  i.e., from the time of its establishment,  the  staff
employed therein were permitted to belong to national  trade
unions and most of them did so.	 There were several disputes
between	 the staff and the Government over the years all  of
which  were  settled by negotiations with  the	Unions.	  On
January	 25, 1984, however, the Secretary of the  State	 for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs announced suddenly that the
staff of the Government Communications Headquarters will  no
longer	be permitted to belong to national trade unions	 and
that  they  would  be  permitted to  belong  to	 only  to  a
departmental  staff  association approved by  the  Director.
The  said  decision was given effect to	 by  certain  orders
issued	on  December 22, 1993.	The  Unions  questioned	 the
validity of the said instructions.
</p><p id="p_506">363. The  conditions  of  service of the  staff	 working  in
Government Communications Headquarters were to be  regulated
by  the Minister for the Civil Service, empowered as he	 was
by <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_837">Article 4</a> of the 1982 Order in Council.  The said  Order-
in-Council was not issued under powers conferred by any	 Act
of Parliament.	It was issued by the Sovereign by virtue  of
her prerogative.  According to the definition given by Dicey
in   "Introduction   to	 the  study  of	 the  Law   of	 the
Constitution"  which has been accepted and
60 (1981)1 SCC 107:1981 SCC(Cri) 112:(1981) 1 SCR 1196
+	Ed.:<a href="/doc/1152284/" id="a_838">In	     Kehar	Singh	    v.Union	  of

 followed at all points of time in U.K.	 "prerogative is the
name  for  the	remaining portion of  the  Crown's  original
authority,  and	 is therefore, as already pointed  out,	 the
name  for  the residue of discretionary power  left  at	 any
moment	in the hands of the Crown, whether such power be  in
fact  exercised	 by the King himself or by  his	 Ministers".
The  very same idea has been stated by Lord Diplock  in	 the
following words :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_146">	      "For a decision to be susceptible to  judicial
	      review, the decisionmaker must be empowered by
	      public law (and not merely, as in arbitration,
	      by agreement between private parties) to	make
	      decisions that, if validly made, will lead  to
	      administrative   action  or  abstention	from
	      action  by  an authority endowed by  law	with
	      executive	 powers, which have one or other  of
	      the  consequences mentioned in  the  preceding
	      paragraph.    The	 ultimate  source   of	 the
	      decision-making	power	is   nearly   always
	      nowadays a statute or subordinate	 legislation
	      made under the statute; but in the absence  of
	      any  statute regulating the subject-matter  of
	      the  decision,  the source  of  the  decision-
	      making  power  may  still be  the	 common	 law
	      itself, i.e., that part of the common law that
	      is   given  by  lawyers  the  label   of	 the
	      prerogative."
</blockquote><p id="p_507">364. The  contention  on  behalf of the	 Minister  was	that
action taken by him in exercise of the prerogative power  is
not  amenable to judicial review.  The said  contention	 was
rejected.   So	far as the merits are  concerned,  the	only
contention  urged  by the Unions related to "the  manner  in
which  the  decision which led to these	 instructions  being
given, was taken, that is to say, without prior consultation
of  any	 kind with the appellant or, indeed,  others".	 The
right  of prior consultation was founded upon the theory  of
legitimate  expectation.   All	the Law	 Lords	agreed	that
having	 regard	  to  the  practice  in	 vogue	 since	 the
establishment  of the said establishment, the  Unions  could
claim  a  legitimate  expectation  to  be  consulted  before
effecting  any	change in the conditions of  their  service.
But,  they  held,  the said  legitimate	 expectation  cannot
prevail	 over the considerations of national security  which
prompted  the Minister to issue the  impugned  instructions.
It is on this ground alone that the House of Lords dismissed
the appeal preferred by the Unions.
</p><p id="p_508">365.So far as India is concerned, there is no such thing  as
'prerogative'.	 There	is  the	 executive  power   of	 the
Government  of	India  and  there  are	the   constitutional
functions  of  the President.  It is not  suggested  by	 the
counsel	 for the respondents that all the orders passed	 and
every  action  taken by the President or the  Government  of
India  is beyond judicial review.  All that is suggested  is
that some of the powers of the President and the  Government
of India are immune.  Shri Parasaran relies upon the opinion
of  Lord Roskill where certain prerogative powers  are	held
not fit subject-matters for judicial scrutiny.	They are the
powers relating to entering of treaties with foreign  power,
defence	 of the realm, grant of pardon/mercy, conferring  of
honours,  dissolution  of  Parliament  and  appointment	  of
Ministers.   We	 agree	that  broadly  speaking	 the   above
matters,  because of their very nature, are outside the	 ken
of  courts  and the courts would not,  ordinarily  speaking,
interfere  in matters relating to above subjects.  But	that
is different from saying that all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_201">262</span>
the  President's  action  are immune.	In  fact,  the	main
holding in this decision is that action taken in exercise of
the  prerogative  power is not immune from  judicial  review
apart from the clear enunciation of the grounds of  judicial
review.	  It  is  also	held, of  course,  that	 in  matters
involving government policy, the ground of irrationality may
not be an appropriate one.
</p><p id="p_509">366. We	 may now examine the principles enunciated  by	this
Court in Barium Chemicals6 which is the leading decision  of
this  Court on the subject of subjective  satisfaction.	  It
exhaustively lays down the parameters of judicial review  in
such  matters.	 Barium	 Chemicals6 was	 concerned  with  an

6 1966 Supp SCR 311:AIR 1967 SC 295:(1966) 36 Comp Cas 639
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_202">263</span>
 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_842">Section   237(b)</a>   could  be  taken   on   the	  subjective
satisfaction  of the Central Government was not in  dispute.
The  controversy, however, centered round the  next  aspect.
According   to	the  appellant,	 though	 the   opinion	 was
subjective, the existence of circumstances set out in clause
</p><p id="p_511">(b)  was  a  condition precedent to the	 formation  of	such
opinion and, therefore, even if the impugned orders were  to
contain	 a recital of the existence of those  circumstances,
the  court can go behind that recital and determine  whether
they  did in fact exist.  On the other hand, the  contention
for the Company Law Board was that clause (b) was  incapable
of  such  dichotomy  and  that	not  only  the	opinion	 was
subjective but that the entire clause was made dependent  on
such  opinion.	 It was urged that the words  "opinion"	 and
"suggesting" were clear indications that the entire function
was subjective, that the opinion which the authority has  to
form  is  that circumstances suggesting what is set  out  in
sub-clauses (i) and (ii) exist and, therefore, the existence
of  those circumstances is by itself a matter of  subjective
opinion.  The legislature having entrusted that function  to
the authority, it was urged, the court cannot go behind	 its
opinion	 and  ascertain whether the  relevant  circumstances
exist or not.
</p><p id="p_512">368. After considering a large number of decisions,  Shelat,
J. held (SCR p. 362)
	      "... the words, 'reason to believe' or 'in the
	      opinion	of'  do	 not  always  lead  to	 the
	      construction that the process of	entertaining
	      'reason  to  believe' or 'the opinion'  is  an
	      altogether  subjective  process  not   lending
	      itself even to a limited scrutiny by the court
	      that  such 'a reason to believe' or  'opinion'
	      was not formed on relevant facts or within the
	      limits  of,  as Lord Radcliffe and  Lord	Reid
	      called,  the restraints of the statute  as  an
	      alternative  safeguard  to  rules	 of  natural
	      justice where the function is administrative."
	      The  learned  Judge then examined	 the  object
	      underlying <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_843">Section 237</a> and held (SCR pp.	362-
</p><p id="p_513">	      63)
	      "There  is  no  doubt that  the  formation  of
	      opinion by the Central Government is a  purely
	      subjective  process.   There can	also  be  no
	      doubt that since the legislature has  provided
	      for  the opinion of the Government and not  of
	      the court such an opinion is not subject to  a
	      challenge	  on   the   ground   of   property,
	      reasonableness   or  sufficiency.	   But	 the
	      Authority	 is  required to arrive at  such  an
	      opinion from circumstances suggesting what  is
	      set out in sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iii).  If
	      these circumstances were not to exist, can the
	      Government still say that in its opinion	they
	      exist or can the Government say the same thing
	      where the circumstances relevant to the clause
	      do  not exist?  The legislature no  doubt	 has
	      used     the     expression     "circumstances
	      suggesting".  But, that expression means	that
	      the  circumstances need not be such  as  would
	      conclusively establish an intent to defraud or
	      a fraudulent or illegal purpose.	The proof of
	      such  an	intent	or purpose is  still  to  be
	      adduced  through	an investigation.   But	 the
	      expression  "circumstances suggesting"  cannot
	      support the construction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_203">	      264</span>
	      that even the existence of circumstances is  a
	      matter of subjective opinion.  That expression
	      points out that there must exist circumstances
	      from which the Authority forms an opinion that
	      they are suggestive of the crucial matters set
	      out  in the three sub-clauses.  It is hard  to
	      contemplate  that the legislature	 could	have
	      left  to	the  subjective	 process  both	 the
	      formation of opinion and also the existence of
	      circumstances  on which it is to	be  founded.
	      It  is  also not reasonable to  say  that	 the
	      clause permitted the Authority to say that  it
	      has formed the opinion on circumstances  which
	      in its opinion exist and which in its  opinion
	      suggest  an intent to defraud or a  fraudulent
	      or   unlawful   purpose.	  It   is    equally
	      unreasonable  to	think that  the	 legislature
	      could have abandoned even the small  safeguard
	      of  requiring  the opinion to  be	 founded  on
	      existent	 circumstances	which  suggest	 the
	      things  for  which  an  investigation  can  be
	      ordered  and  left the opinion  and  even	 the
	      existence of circumstances from which it is to
	      be  formed to a subjective process. ...  There
	      must, therefore, exist circumstances which  in
	      the opinion of the Authority suggest what	 has
	      been  set	 out in sub-clauses  (i),  (ii)	 and
</p><p id="p_514">	      (iii).  If it is shown that the  circumstances
	      do not exist or that they are such that it  is
	      impossible  for  any one to  form	 an  opinion
	      therefrom suggestive of the aforesaid  things,
	      the opinion is challengeable on the ground  of
	      nonapplication of mind or perversity or on the
	      ground  that  it	was  formed  on	  collateral
	      grounds  and  was	 beyond	 the  scope  of	 the
	      statute."
</p><p id="p_515">	      369.  Hidayatullah,  J. observed thus  in	 his
	      separate opinion : (SCR p. 336)
	      Since  the existence of 'circumstances'  is  a
	      condition	 fundamental  to the  making  of  an
	      opinion,	the existence of the  circumstances,
	      if questioned, has to be proved at least prima
	      facie.   It is not sufficient to	assert	that
	      the  circumstances exist and give no  clue  to
	      what  they are because the circumstances	must
	      be  such as to lead to conclusions of  certain
	      definiteness.  The conclusions must relate  to
	      an intent to defraud, a fraudulent or unlawful
	      purpose,	 fraud	 or   misconduct   or	 the
	      withholding  of  information of  a  particular
	      kind."
</p><p id="p_516">	      The  learned Judge proceeded further to say  :
	      (SCR pp. 336-37)
	      "We  have to see whether the Chairman  in	 his
	      affidavit	  has	shown	the   existence	  of
	      circumstances   leading  to   such   tentative
	      conclusions.  If he has, his action cannot  be
	      questioned  because  the inference  is  to  be
	      drawn  subjectively  and even  if	 this  Court
	      would not have drawn a similar inference	that
	      fact   would  be	irrelevant.   But   if	 the
	      circumstances  pointed  out are such  that  no
	      inference of the kind stated in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_844">Section 237(b)</a>
	      can at all be drawn the action would be  ultra
	      vires the Act and void."
</p><p id="p_517">The  principles enunciated in this case are not	 only  self-
evident, they have been followed uniformly since.  We do not
think it necessary to restate these principles	they are too
well-known.

<p id="p_518">370. Counsel  brought to our notice a decision of  the	High
Court  of Australia in the Queen v. Toohey ex parte  Northem
Land Council61.	 Under the Aboriginal Land Rights  (Northern
Territory) Act, 1976, provision was made for the aboriginals
to claim return of the land traditionally occupied by  them.
The application was to be made to the commissioner under the
Act.   Toohey,	J.  was acting	as  the	 commissioner.	 The
application  was  made	by  the	 Prosecutor,  Northern	Land
Council.   According to the Land Rights Act, no	 such  claim
could  be laid if the land claimed was comprised in a  town.
The  expression 'town' was defined to have the same  meaning
as 'in the law relating to Planning and Development of Town.
In  1979,  Planning Act was enacted superseding	 an  earlier
Act.   In  Section 4(1) of the Planning	 Act,  'town'  meant
inter alia "lands specified by the regulations to be an area
which  has to be treated as a town".   Planning	 regulations
were  made  by the Administrator of the	 Northern  Territory
under  the  Planning  Act  specifying  inter  alia  the	 Cox
peninsula  as part of 'Darwin town'.  The Cox peninsula	 was
separated from Darwin town-proper by an arm of the sea.	 The
land  route  for reaching the peninsula	 from  Darwin  town-
proper	was  a	difficult and  long  one.   The	 Prosecutor,
Northern  Land	Council	 challenged  the  validity  of	 the
planning regulation on the ground that the inclusion of	 Cox
peninsula in the Darwin town is not really for the  purposes
germane	 to  the  Planning  Act	 and  the  regulations	made
thereunder  but for an altogether extraneous  purpose.	 The
question was whether such a plea can be investigated by	 the
courts.	  The  contention  of the other side  was  that	 the
Administrator	was  the  Crown's  Representative   in	 the
Territory  and,	 therefore, the power exercised by  him	 was
immune	from any examination by the courts.   This  argument
was  met  by  the Prosecutor of the  Northern  Land  Council
saying	that  the Administrator is only the servant  of	 the
Crown  and  not its representative and hence,  possesses  no
immunity  and on the further ground that even if he  is	 the
Representative	of  the Crown, there was no  such  immunity.
The  majority  (Murphy, J. dissenting)	held  that  judicial
review	of the regulations was not barred.   The  conclusion
may best be set out in the words of Stephen, J.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_154">	      "Conclusion on examinability.

	      Australian   authority,	the   validity	  of
	      Regulation  5 was open to be attacked  in	 the
	      manner attempted by the Council.	Such a	view
	      appears to me to be in accord with  principle.
	      It  involves no intrusion by the	courts	into
	      the sphere either of the legislature or of the
	      executive.    It	 ensures   that,   just	  as

	      by   it  of  power  granted  to  it   by	 the

	      Party   case,  the  opinion  of  the   Queen's
	      representative  'is really the opinion of	 the
	      Government  of the day'.	That this is  so  in
	      the Northern Territory appears from Section 33
	      of  the Northern Territory  (Self	 Government)
	      Act, 1978.

	      follows that if it be shown that a  regulation

whether taken by a Minister or a Representative of the Crown
is  subject  to	 judicial  review even	if  done  under	 the
statute.  In this case, it may be noted, the regulations  in
question  were	made  under  a	statute,  no  doubt  by	 the
Administrator  who was supposed to be the Representative  of
the  Crown in the Territory.  This factor, the	court  held,
did  not preclude the court from reviewing the	validity  of
the regulations made by him.
</p><p id="p_520">372. Having  noticed various decisions projecting  different
points of view, we may now proceed to examine what should be
the  scope and reach of judicial review when a	Proclamation
under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_846">Article 356(1)</a> is questioned.  While  answering	this
question,  we  should be, and we are, aware that  the  power
conferred  by  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_847">Article 356(1)</a> upon the President  is  of  an
exceptional character designed to ensure that the Government
of  the	 States	 are  carried  on  in  accordance  with	 the
Constitution.  We are equally aware that any misuse or abuse
of this power is bound to play havoc with our constitutional
system.	  Having  regard to the form of Government  we	have
adopted,  the power is really that of the Union	 Council  of
Ministers with the Prime Minister at its head.	In a  sense,
it  is	not really a power but an obligation cast  upon	 the
President in the interest of preservation of  constitutional
Government  in the States.  It is not a power  conceived  to
preserve or promote the interests of the political party  in
power at the Centre for the time being nor is it supposed to
be  a weapon with which to strike your	political  opponent.
The  very  enormity of this power  undoing the will  of	 the
people	of  a  State  by  dismissing  the  duly	 constituted
Government  and	 dissolving  the  duly	elected	 Legislative
Assembly  must itself act as a warning against its  frequent
use  or	 misuse, as the case may be.  Every misuse  of	this
power  has  its	 consequences  which  may  not	be   evident
immediately but surface in a vicious form a few years later.
Sow a wind and you will reap the whirlwind.  Wisdom lies  in
moderation and not in excess.
</p><p id="p_521">373. Whenever	a   Proclamation  under	  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_848">Article   356</a>	  is
questioned,   the  court  will	no  doubt  start  with	 the
presumption  that it was validly issued but it will not	 and
it  should  not hesitate to interfere if the  invalidity  or
unconstitutionality of the Proclamation is clearly made out.
Refusal to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_206">267</span>
 interfere in such a case would amount to abdication of	 the
duty cast upon the court  Supreme Court and High Courts	  by
the Constitution.  Now, what are the grounds upon which	 the
court can interfere and strike down the Proclamation?  While
discussing the decisions hereinabove, we have indicated	 the
unacceptability of the approach adopted by the Privy Council
in <a href="/doc/617286/" id="a_849">Bhagat Singh v. Emperor55</a> and King Emperor v. Benoari Lal
Sharma57.  That was in the years 1931 and 1944, long  before
the  concept  of judicial review had  acquired	its  present
efficacy.   As	stated by the Pakistan Supreme	Court,	that
view  is totally unsuited to a democratic polity.  Even	 the
Privy Council has not stuck to that view, as is evident from
its  decision  in  the case  from  Malaysia  Stephen  Kalong
Ningkan	 v.  Govt. of Malaysia58.  In this case,  the  Privy
Council proceeded on the assumption that such a Proclamation
is amenable to judicial review.	 On facts and  circumstances
of this case, it found the action justified.  Now, coming to
the approach adopted by the Pakistan Supreme Court, it	must
be  said  as indicated hereinbefore  that it is coloured  by
the  nature  of the power conferred upon  the  President  by
Section	 58(2)(b) of the Pakistani Constitution.  The  power
to dismiss the Federal Government and the National  Assembly
is  vested in the President and President alone.  He has  to
exercise that power in his personal discretion and judgment.
One man against the entire system, so to speak	even  though
that  man  too	is elected by  the  representatives  of	 the
people.	  That	is not true of our Constitution.   Here	 the
President acts on the aid and advice of the Union Council of
Ministers and not in his personal capacity.  Moreover, there
is  the	 check	of approval  by	 Parliament  which  contains
members from that State (against the  Government/Legislative
Assembly  of which State, action is taken) as well.  So	 far
as  the approach adopted by this Court in Barium  Chemicals6
is  concerned,	it  is	a  decision  concerning	  subjective
satisfaction  of  an authority created by  a  statute.	 The
principles evolved then cannot ipso facto be extended to the
exercise  of  a	 constitutional	 power	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_850">Article	356.</a>
Having regard to the fact that this is a high constitutional
power exercised by the highest constitutional functionary of
the  Nation,  it may not be appropriate to adopt  the  tests
applicable  in	the  case of action taken  by  statutory  or
administrative	authorities   nor  at  any  rate,  in  their
entirety.  We would rather adopt the formulation evolved  by
this  Court  in State of Rajasthan' as	we  shall  presently
elaborate.  We also recognise, as did the House of Lords  in
CCSU  v.  Minister  for the Civil Service8  that  there	 are
certain	 areas including those elaborated therein where	 the
court  would  leave  the  matter  almost  entirely  to	 the
President/Union	 Government.   The court would	desist	from
entering  those arenas, because of the very nature of  those
functions.   They  are not the matters which  the  court  is
equipped to deal with.

The court has never interfered in those matters because they
do  not	 admit	of judicial review  by	their  very  nature.
Matters	 concerning  foreign policy,  relations	 with  other
countries, defence policy, power to enter into treaties with
foreign powers, issues relating to war and peace are some of
the  matters where the court would decline to entertain	 any
petition  for judicial review.	But the same cannot be	said
of  the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_851">Article 356.</a>  It is another matter	that
in  a  given  case  the court  may  not	 interfere.   It  is
necessary  to  affirm that the	Proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_852">Article
356(1)</a>	is  not	 immune from  judicial	review,	 though	 the
parameters  thereof  may  vary	from  an  ordinary  case  of
subjective satisfaction.
</p><p id="p_523">374. Without trying to be exhaustive, it can be stated	that
if a Proclamation is found to be mala fide or is found to be
based wholly on extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds, it  is
liable	to  be struck down, as indicated by  a	majority  of
learned	 Judges	 in the State of Rajasthan3.   This  holding
must be read along with our opinion on the meaning and scope
of  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_853">Article 74(2)</a> and the further circumstance	that  clause
(5) which expressly barred the jurisdiction of the courts to
examine the validity of the Proclamation has been deleted by
the 44th Amendment to the Constitution.	 In other words, the
truth or correctness of the material cannot be questioned by
the court nor will it go into the adequacy of the  material.
It  will  also not substitute its opinion for  that  of	 the
President.  Even if some of the material on which the action
is  taken is found to be irrelevant, the court	would  still
not  interfere	so long as there is some  relevant  material
sustaining  the action.	 The ground of mala fides  takes  in
inter alia situations where the Proclamation is found to  be
a clear case of abuse of power, or what is sometimes  called
fraud  on  power   cases where this  power  is	invoked	 for
achieving   oblique   ends.   This  is	indeed	 merely	  an
elaboration  of	 the  said  ground.   The  Meghalaya   case,
discussed hereinafter, demonstrates that the types of  cases
calling	  for  interference  cannot  either  be	 closed	  or
specified exhaustively.	 It is a case, as will be elaborated
a little later, where the Governor recommended the dismissal
of  the Government and dissolution of the Assembly in  clear
disregard of the orders of this Court.	Instead of  carrying
out  the  orders  of this Court, as he	ought  to  have,  he
recommended  the dismissal of the Government on	 the  ground
that  it  has  lost the majority support, when	in  fact  he
should	have held following this Court's orders that it	 did
not.  His action can be termed as a clear case of mala fides
as well.  That a Proclamation was issued acting upon such  a
report is no less objectionable.
</p><p id="p_524">375. It	 is  necessary to reiterate that the court  must  be
conscious  while examining the validity of the	Proclamation
that  it  is a power vested in	the  highest  constitutional
functionary  of	 the  Nation.  The court  will	not  lightly
presume	 abuse	or misuse.  The court would, as	 it  should,
tread  wearily,	 making	 allowance for	the  fact  that	 the
President  and the Union Council of Ministers are  the	best
judges	of the situation, that they alone are in  possession
of information and material  sensitive in nature sometimes
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_209">269</span>
and that the Constitution has trusted their judgment in	 the
matter.	  But all this does not mean that the President	 and
the Union Council of Ministers are the final arbiters in the
matter	or that their opinion is conclusive.  The very	fact
that  the  Founding  Fathers  have  chosen  to	provide	 for
approval  of  the Proclamation by Parliament  is,  itself  a
proof  of the fact that the opinion or satisfaction  of	 the
President (which always means the Union Council of Ministers
with  the  Prime  Minister  at its head)  is  not  final  or
conclusive.  It is well-known that in the parliamentary form
of Government, where the party in power commands a  majority
in Parliament more often than not, approval of Parliament by
a simple majority is not difficult to obtain.  Probably,  it
is  for this reason that the check created by clause (3)  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_854">Article 356</a> has not proved to be as effective in practice as
it  ought  to have been.  The very fact that even  in  cases
like  Meghalaya	 and Karnataka, both  Houses  of  Parliament
approved  the  Proclamations shows the	enervation  of	this
check.	Even the proponents of the finality of the  decision
of  the President in this matter could not but concede	that
the  said check has not proved to be an effective one.	 Nor
could  they say with any conviction that judicial review  is
excluded in this behalf.  If judicial review is not excluded
in matters of pardon and remission of sentence under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_855">Article
72</a>   a	seemingly absolute and unconditional  power   it  is
difficult to see on what principle can it be said   that  it
is excluded in the case of a conditional power like the	 one
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_856">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_525">376. We recognise that judicial process has certain inherent
limitations.  It is suited more for adjudication of disputes
rather	than  for administering the country.   The  task  of
governance  is the job of the Executive.  The  Executive  is
supposed  to know how to administer the country,  while	 the
function  of  the Judiciary is limited to  ensure  that	 the
Government is carried on in accordance with the Constitution
and  the laws.	Judiciary accords, as it should, due  weight
to the opinion of the Executive in such matters but that  is
not   to  say,	it  defers  to	the  opinion  of   Executive
altogether.    What  ultimately	 determines  the  scope	  of
judicial review is the facts and circumstances of the  given
case.	A  case	 may  be a clear  one	like  Meghalaya	 and
Karnataka  cases   where the court can	find  unhesitatingly
that the Proclamation is bad.  There may also be cases	like
those  relating	 to Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan  and  Himachal
Pradesh	  where	 the  situation	 is  so	 complex,  full	  of
imponderables  and a fast-evolving one that the court  finds
it not a matter which admits of judicial prognosis, that  it
is  a matter which should be left to the judgment of and  to
be  handled  by the Executive and may be in  the    ultimate
analysis  by  the  people  themselves.	 The  best  way	  of
demonstrating  what we say is by dealing with  the  concrete
cases before us.
</p><p id="p_526">377. Shri Parasaran, learned counsel for the Union of  India
urged that inasmuch as the Proclamation under clause (1) has
been  approved by both Houses of Parliament as	contemplated
by  clause  (3), the Proclamation assumes the  character  of
Legislation  and that it can be struck down only on  grounds
on which a Legislation can be struck down.  We cannot agree.
Every  act  of Parliament does not amount to  and  does	 not
result in Legislation,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_210">270</span>
though	 Legislation  is  its  main  function.	  Parliament
performs many other functions, e.g., election of Speaker and
Deputy	Speaker,  vote of confidence/no	 confidence  in	 the
Ministry,  motion  of  thanks to  the  President  after	 the
address	 by the President and so on.  One of such  functions
is the approval of the Proclamation under clause (3).	Such
approval  can  by  no  stretch	of  imagination	 be   called
'Legislation'.	It is not processed or passed as a Bill	 nor
is it presented to the President for his assent.  Its  legal
character  is  wholly  different.  It  is  a  constitutional
function,  a check upon the exercise of power  under  clause
(1).   It  is  a  safeguard conceived  in  the	interest  of
ensuring  proper exercise of power under clause (1).  It  is
another	 matter	 that in practice the check has	 not  proved
effective.   But  that may not be so in future	or  for	 all
times  to  come.   Be that as it may, it  is  certainly	 not
Legislation nor Legislative in character.
</p><p id="p_527">378. Shri   Shanti   Bhushan,  learned	 counsel   for	 the
petitioners  urged  that the deletion of clause (5)  by	 the
44th  Amendment,  which clause was introduced  by  the	38th
Amendment,  necessarily implies that the exercise  of  power
under  clause  (1) is amenable to judicial review in  a	 far
more  extensive	 manner.  Clause (5), as introduced  by	 the
38th Amendment, read as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_157">	      "(5)   Notwithstanding   anything	  in	this
	      Constitution,   the   satisfaction   of	 the
	      President	 mentioned  in clause (1)  shall  be
	      final   and  conclusive  and  shall   not	  be
	      questioned in any court on any ground."
</blockquote><p id="p_528">379. The effect of this clause was considered by this  Court
in  State of Rajasthan3.  It was held that the	said  clause
does  not  preclude  the court from  examining	whether	 the
exercise  of  power is mala fide or is based  on  extraneous
grounds	 or whether it is based on no satisfaction  at	all.
It was held that the said clause does not prevent the  court
from  examining the Proclamation on the	 aforesaid  grounds.
We,  however,  agree  that the deletion of  this  clause  is
certainly  significant	in the sense that  the	express	 bar
created in the way of judicial review has since been removed
consciously and deliberately in exercise of the	 constituent
power  of  Parliament. (<a href="/doc/875590/" id="a_857">See A.K. Roy v. Union  of  India25</a>).
The cloud cast by the clause on the power of judicial review
has been lifted.
</p><p id="p_529">380. It	 was  urged  by	 Shri  Parasaran,  learned   counsel
appearing  for	the  Union  of India  that  where  a  person
challenges  the validity of the Proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_858">Article
356(1</a>),	 the burden lies upon him to establish its  validity
and that it is not part of the duty of the Union of India to
assist the petitioner in establishing his case.	 Reliance is
placed on certain observations in Stephen Kalong Ningkong58.
He submitted that it would not be a correct practice for the
court  to  call	 upon  the Union of  India  to	justify	 and
establish the validity of the Proclamation merely because  a
person	chooses to question it. We do not think	 that  there
ought to be any room for confusion on this
3    (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1

58   (1970) AC 379
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_211">271</span>
score	nor  can  the observations of  Hidayatullah,  J.  in
Barium	Chemicals6 quoted elsewhere be understood as  saying
so.   We agree that merely because a person  challenges	 the
validity  of  the  Proclamation, the court would  not  as  a
matter of course call upon the Union of India to produce the
material/information  on  the basis of which  the  President
formed	the  requisite	satisfaction.	The  court  must  be
satisfied,  prima facie, on the basis of the averments	made
by the petitioner and the material, if any, produced by	 him
that  it  is a fit case where the Union of India  should  be
called upon to produce the material/information on the basis
of  which the President formed the  requisite  satisfaction.
It  is	then that the Union of India comes under a  duty  to
disclose the same.  Since the material/information on  which
the  satisfaction was formed is available to, and known	 to,
only the Union of India, it is for it to tell the court what
that material/information was.	They are matters within	 the
special	 knowledge of the Union of India.  In such  a  case,
only  the Union of India can be called upon to	satisfy	 the
court  that there was relevant	material/information  before
the President on the basis of which he had acted.  It may be
that, in a given case, the material/information may be	such
that  the Union of India may feel it necessary to claim	 the
privilege  provided  by <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_859">Section 123</a> of the  Indian  Evidence
Act.  As and when such claim is made, it is obvious, it will
be dealt with according to law.
</p><p id="p_530">381. While  on	this question, we may mention that if  in  a
given  case  the  Proclamation contains	 the  reasons,	with
adequate specificity, for which the Proclamation was issued,
the  court may have to be satisfied before calling upon	 the
Union of India to produce the material/information that	 the
reasons given in the Proclamation are prima facie irrelevant
to  the formation of the requisite satisfaction and/or	that
it is a fit case where the Union of India must yet be called
upon to place the material/information on the basis of which
it  had	 formed the satisfaction.  The Union  of  India	 may
perhaps	 be well advised to follow the practice	 of  stating
the  reasons  and  the	grounds	 upon  which  the  requisite
satisfaction is founded.

</blockquote><p id="p_533">383. In	 our opinion, the contention urged is  unacceptable.
<a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_863">Article 256</a> merely states that the executive power of  every
State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the
laws  made by Parliament whether existing or to be  made  in
future.	  It is stated therein that the executive  power  of
the  Union  shall extend to giving of such directions  to  a
State  as  may	appear	to the Government  of  India  to  be
necessary for the said purpose.	 This article is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_213">273</span>
 confined   to	 proper	 and  due  implementation   of	 the
parliamentary  enactments and the power to  give  directions
for that purpose.  <a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_864">Article 257</a> says that executive power  of
every  State  shall  be so exercised as	 not  to  impede  or
prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the  Union;
for ensuring the same, the Union Government is empowered  to
give  appropriate  directions.	 Clauses (2),  (3)  and	 (4)
illustrate and elaborate the power contained in clause	(1).
<a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_865">Article	 365</a>,  which  incidentally does not  occur  in	Part
XVIII,	but  in Part XIX (Miscellaneous)  merely  says	that
where any State has failed to comply with or give effect  to

exhaustive of the situation where the President may form the
said  satisfaction.  Suffice it to say that  the  directions

hold  that the requisite type of situation [contemplated  by

arisen.	  <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_869">Article 365</a> says it is permissible for him to	 say
so in such a case.  The discretion is still
there and has to be exercised fairly.

			 KARNATAKA
</p><p id="p_535">384. By	 a Proclamation dated April 21, 1989  the  President
dismissed   the	 Government  of	 Karnataka,  dissolved	 the
Legislative Assembly, took over the powers of the Government
and the Governor, vested the powers of the State Legislature
in  Parliament	and  made  other  incidental  and  ancillary
provisions suspending several provisions of the Constitution
with  respect  to  that State.	The  Proclamation  does	 not
contain any reasons except barely reciting the	satisfaction
of  the President.  The satisfaction is stated to have	been
formed on a consideration of the report of the Governor	 and
other information received by him.  Shri S.R. Bommai was the
Chief Minister then.
</p><p id="p_536">385. The  Janata Legislature Party emerged as  the  majority
party  in the State Legislature following elections  to	 the
Assembly in March 1985.	 Shri Ramakrishna Hegde was  elected
the leader of the Janata Legislature Party and was sworn  in
as  the Chief Minister in March 1985.  In August 1988,	Shri
Hegde resigned and Shri Bommai was elected as the leader and
sworn  in  as  the Chief Minister on August  30,  1988.	  In
September  1988,  Janata  Party	 and  Lok  Dal	(B)   merged
resulting in the formation of Janata Dal.  The Janata  Party
in  Karnataka Legislature was renamed Janata Dal.  On  April
15, 1989 the Ministry was expanded by Shri Bommai  including
thirteen more
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_214">274</span>
members.   On April 17, 1989, a legislator, Shri Kalyan	 Rao
Molakery, defected from the party and presented a letter  to
the  Governor  withdrawing  his support to  the	 Janata	 Dal
Government.   On  the  next day, he  met  the  Governor	 and
presented nineteen letters purported to have been signed  by
seventeen Janata Dal legislators, one associate	 independent
legislator and one BJP legislator withdrawing their  support
to the Government.  The Governor is said to have called	 the
Secretary   of	the  Legislature  Department  and  got	 the
authenticity of the signatures on the letters verified.	  He
did   not,  of	course,	 inform	 Shri  Bommai  about   these
developments.  On April 19, 1989, the Governor sent a report
to  the	 President stating that there  were  dissensions  in
Janata	Party  which led to the resignation  of	 Shri  Hegde
earlier	 and  that even after the formation of	Janata	Dal,
there have been dissensions and defections.  He referred  to
the  letters  received	by him from  defecting	members	 and
opined	that  on  that account, the ruling  party  has	been
reduced	 to  minority in the Assembly.	He stated  that	 the
Council of Ministers headed by Shri Bommai does not  command
a  majority  in the House and that, therefore,	"it  is	 not
appropriate  under  the	 Constitution  to  have	 the   State
administered  by  an  Executive	 consisting  of	 Council  of
Ministers who do not command the majority in the House".  He
opined	that  no other party is in a position  to  form	 the
Government and recommended action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_870">Article 356(1).</a>
</p><p id="p_537">386. On	 April 20, 1989, seven legislators out of those	 who
were  said  to have submitted the letters  to  the  Governor
submitted  letters  to the Governor complaining	 that  their
signatures    were    obtained	 on   those    letters	  by
misrepresentation  and by misleading them.  They  reaffirmed
their support to the Bommai Ministry.  On the same day,	 the
State  Cabinet	met  and decided  to  convene  the  Assembly
Session	 on April 27, 1989.  The Chief Minister and the	 Law
Minister  met the Governor on that day itself  and  informed
him about the summoning of the Assembly Session.  They	also
brought	 to the Governor's notice the recommendation of	 the
Sarkaria  Commission  that the support and strength  of	 the
Chief  Minister	 should	 be  tested  on	 the  floor  of	 the
Assembly.  Shri Bommai offered to prove his majority on	 the
floor  of  the House.  He even expressed  his  readiness  to
prepone the Assembly Session if so desired by the  Governor.
He also sent a telex message to that effect to the President
of  India.  In spite of all this, the Governor sent  another
report to the President of India on April 20, 1989 referring
to  the	 letter of seven members withdrawing  their  earlier
letters	 and  opining that the said letters  were  evidently
obtained  by  Shri Bommai by pressurising  those  MLAs.	  He
reported  that "horse-trading is going on and atmosphere  is
getting	 vitiated".   He reiterated his	 opinion  that	Shri
Bommai has lost the confidence of the majority in the  State
Assembly and requested that action be taken on his  previous
letter.	  On  that  very  day,	the  President	issued	 the
Proclamation.  It says that the said action was taken on the
basis  of  "the	 report from the Governor of  the  State  of
Karnataka and  other information received".
</p><p id="p_538">387. Both the Houses of Parliament duly met and approved the
said  Proclamation as contemplated by clause (3) of  Article
</p><p id="p_539">356.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_215">275</span>
</p><p id="p_540">388. The validity of the Proclamation was challenged by Shri
Bommai and certain other members of the Council of Ministers
by  way	 of  a	writ petition (W.P. 7899  of  1989)  in	 the
Karnataka  High	 Court.	  The  Union  of  India	 (the  first
respondent in the writ petition) submitted that the decision
of  the	 President  of	India based on	the  report  of	 the
Governor and other information brought to his notice is	 not
justiciable  and cannot be challenged in the writ  petition.
While  making a report, it was submitted, the Governor	does
not  act on the aid and advice of his Council  of  Ministers
but in his individual capacity.	 The report of the  Governor
cannot	be  challenged	in  view  of  <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_871">Article  361</a>  of	 the
Constitution  nor  can he or the President be  compelled  to
disclose  the information or material upon which  they	have
acted.	 <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_872">Article  74(2)</a> was said to be a bar  to  the  court
enquiring  into the said information, material	and  advice.
It  was also submitted that the Proclamation has since	been
approved  by both Houses of Parliament under clause  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_873">Article	 356.</a>	The State of Karnataka	submitted  that	 the
Governor  had  taken into consideration all  the  facts	 and
circumstances  prevailing in the State while submitting	 his
report	and  that the Proclamation issued on that  basis  is
unobjectionable.
</p><p id="p_541">389. A Special Bench of three Judges of High Court heard the
writ  petition	and  dismissed the  same  on  the  following
reasoning :
</p><p id="p_542">(1)  The  Proclamation	under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_874">Article 356(1)</a> is	 not  immune
from  judicial scrutiny.  The court can examine whether	 the
satisfaction  has been formed on wholly extraneous  material
or  whether there is a rational nexus between  the  material
and the satisfaction.
</p><p id="p_543">(2)  In	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_875">Article 356</a>, the President means the Union  Council
of  Ministers.	 The  satisfaction referred  to	 therein  is
subjective satisfaction.  This satisfaction has no doubt  to
be   formed  on	 a  consideration  of  all  the	 facts	 and
circumstances.
</p><p id="p_544">(3)  The  two  reports	of  the	 Governor  conveyed  to	 the
President  essential and relevant facts which were  relevant
for  the  purpose of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_876">Article 356.</a>  The facts stated  in	 the
Governor's  report cannot be stated to be irrelevant.	They
are perfectly relevant.
</p><p id="p_545">(4)  Where  the	 Governor's "personal bona  fides"  are	 not
questioned,  his  satisfaction that no other party is  in  a
position  to form the Government has to be accepted as	true
and  is	 based	upon  a reasonable  assessment	of  all	 the
relevant facts.
</p><p id="p_546">(5)  Recourse  to  floor  test was  neither  compulsory	 nor
obligatory.   It  was  not a prerequisite to  sending  up  a
report recommending action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_877">Article 356(1).</a>
(6)  The  introduction of Xth Schedule to  the	Constitution
has  not  affected in any manner the content  of  the  power
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_878">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_547">(7)  Since  the	 Proclamation  has  to	be  issued  on	 the
satisfaction   of  the	Union  Council	of  Ministers,	 the
Governor's  report cannot be faulted on the ground of  legal
mala fides.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_216">276</span>
<p id="p_548">(8)  Applying  the test indicated in the <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_879">State of  Rajasthan
v.  Union  of India3</a> the court must hold, on  the  basis  of
material disclosed, that the subjective satisfaction arrived
at  by	the President is conclusive and cannot	be  faulted.
The Proclamation, therefore, is unobjectionable.
</p><p id="p_549">390. We	 find ourselves unable to agree with the High  Court
except	on points (1) and (2).	To begin with, we  must	 say
that question of 'personal bona fides' of Governor is really
irrelevant.
</p><p id="p_550">391. We	 must also say that the observation under point	 (7)
is equally misplaced.  It is true that action under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_880">Article
356</a>  is	 taken	on the basis of satisfaction  of  the  Union
Council	 of  Ministers but on that score it cannot  be	said
that 'legal mala fides' of the Governor is irrelevant.	When
the  article speaks of the satisfaction being formed on	 the
basis of the Govern's report, the legal mala fides, if	any,
of  the	 Governor  cannot be said  to  be  irrelevant.	 The
Governor's report may not be conclusive but its relevance is
undeniable.  Action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_881">Article 356</a> can be based only	 and
exclusively  upon  such	 report.  Governor is  a  very	high
constitutional	functionary.  He is supposed to	 act  fairly
and  honestly  consistent  with his oath.   He	is  actually
reporting against his own Government.  It is for this reason
that  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_882">Article 356</a> places such implicit faith on his  report.
If, however, in a given case his report is vitiated by legal
mala fides, it is bound to vitiate the President's action as
well.	Regarding the other points made in the	judgment  of
the  High Court, we must say that the High Court went  wrong
in law in approving and upholding the Governor's report	 and
the  action  of	 the  President	 under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_883">Article	 356.</a>	 The
Governor"s  report is vitiated by more than  one  assumption
totally	 unsustainable	in law.	 The Constitution  does	 not
create	an obligation that the political party	forming	 the
ministry   should  necessarily	have  a	 majority   in	 the
Legislature.  Minority Governments are not unknown.  What is
necessary   is	that  that  Government	should	 enjoy	 the
confidence  of	the House.  This aspect does not  appear  to
have  been kept in mind by the Governor.  Secondly and	more
importantly,  whether the Council of Ministers has lost	 the
confidence of the House is not a matter to be determined  by
the  Governor  or for that matter anywhere else	 except	 the
floor  of the House.  The principle of democracy  underlying
our  Constitution necessarily means that any  such  question
should	be decided on the floor of the House.  The House  is
the  place where the democracy is in action.  It is not	 for
the Governor to determine the said question on his own or on
his  own  verification.	  This is not a	 matter	 within	 his
subjective satisfaction.  It is an objective fact capable of
being  established  on	the  floor  of	the  House.   It  is
gratifying  to	note that Shri R. Venkataraman,	 the  former
President  of  India has affirmed this view  in	 his  Rajaji
Memorial Lecture (Hindustan Times dated February 24, 1994).
</p><p id="p_551">392. Exceptional and rare situations may arise where because
of   all   pervading  atmosphere  of   violence	  or   other
extraordinary  reasons,	 it  may not  be  possible  for	 the
members of the Assembly to express their opinion freely.
3 (1977) 3 SCC 592: AIR 1977 SC 1361: (1978) 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_217">277</span>
But  no	 such situation had arisen here.  No  one  suggested
that  any  such	 violent atmosphere  was  obtaining  at	 the
relevant time.
</p><p id="p_552">393. In	 this connection, it would be appropriate to  notice
the unanimous report of the committee of Governors appointed
by  the President of India.  The five Governors	 unanimously
recommended  that  "the test of confidence in  the  Ministry
should normally be left to a vote in the Assembly. ... Where
the Governor is satisfied by whatever process or means, that
the  Ministry no longer enjoys majority support,  he  should
ask  the Chief Minister to face the Assembly and  prove	 his
majority  within the shortest possible time.  If  the  Chief
Minister  shirks  this primary responsibility and  fails  to
comply,	 the  Governor would be in duty	 bound	to  initiate
steps  to form an alternative Ministry.	 A Chief  Minister's
refusal	 to test his strength on the floor of  the  Assembly
can  well  be  interpreted as prima facie proof	 of  his  no
longer enjoying the confidence of the legislature.  If then,
an  alternative	 Ministry  can	be  formed,  which,  in	 the
Governor's  view,  is  able to command	a  majority  in	 the
Assembly,  he must dismiss the Ministry in power and  instal
the  alternative Ministry in office.  On the other hand,  if
no such Ministry is possible, the Governor will be left with
no  alternative but to make a report to the President  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_884">Article 356.</a> ... As a general proposition, it may be  stated
that, as far as possible, the verdict as to majority support
claimed	 by  a Chief Minister and his Council  of  Ministers
should be left to the Legislature, and that it is only if  a
responsible  Government cannot be maintained  without  doing
violence   to  correct	constitutional	practice  that	 the
Governor    should   resort   to   <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_885">Article   356</a>   of	 the
Constitution.  ...  What is important to  remember  is	that
recourse  to  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_886">Article 356</a> should be the last  resort  for  a
Governor to seek... the guiding principle being, as  already
stated,	 that  the  constitutional machinery  in  the  State
should, as far as possible, be maintained". (quoted from the
book  President's Rule in the States, edited by Shri  Rajeev
Dhavan	and published under the auspices of the	 Indian	 Law
Institute,  New Delhi).	 It is a pity that the	Governor  of
Karnataka  did	not keep the above salutary  guidelines	 and
principles in mind while making his report.
</p><p id="p_553">394. Dr G.S. Dhillon, Speaker, Lok Sabha (in his address  to
the  conference	 of the Presiding  Officers  of	 legislative
bodies	in India) too affirmed in clear words that  "whether
the  Ministry continued to command majority support  in	 the
Legislature, the doubt should as far as possible be left  to
be  resolved  on  the floor of the House  and  the  Governor
should not take upon himself unenviable task of deciding the
question himself outside the Legislature".
</p><p id="p_554">395. The  High Court, in our opinion, erred in holding	that
the floor test is not obligatory.  If only one keeps in mind
the democratic principle underlying the Constitution and the
fact that it is the Legislative Assembly that represents the
will of the people  and not the Governor  the position would
be  clear  beyond  any	doubt.	In  this  case,	 it  may  be
remembered that the Council of Ministers not only decided on
April 20, 1989 to convene the Assembly on 27th of that	very
month, i.e., within 7 days, but also offered to prepone	 the
Assembly  if the Governor so desired.  It pains us  to	note
that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_218">278</span>
Governor did not choose to act upon the said offer.  Indeed,
it  was	 his duty to summon the Assembly and call  upon	 the
Chief  Minister to establish that he enjoyed the  confidence
of  the	 House.	  Not only did he not do  it  but  when	 the
Council of Ministers offered to do the same, he demurred and
chose instead to submit the report to the President.  In the
circumstances, it cannot be said that the Governor's  report
contained,  or	was based upon,	 relevant  material.   There
could be no question of the Governor making an assessment of
his  own.   The	 loss  of confidence of	 the  House  was  an
objective fact, which could have been demonstrated, one	 way
or  the other, on the floor of the House.  In  our  opinion,
wherever a doubt arises whether the Council of Ministers has
lost the confidence of the House, the only way of testing it
is  on	the floor of the House except  in  an  extraordinary
situation  where  because  of  all-pervasive  violence,	 the
Governor  comes to the conclusion  and records the  same  in
his  report  that for the reasons mentioned by him,  a	free
vote is not possible in the House.
</p><p id="p_555">396.  We  make	it clear that what we  have  said  above  is
confined to a  situation where the incumbent Chief  Minister
is  alleged  to	 have  lost  the  majority  support  or	 the
confidence of the House.  It is not relevant to a  situation
arising	 after a general election where the Governor has  to
invite	the leader of the party commanding majority  in	 the
House  or  the	single	largest	 party/group  to  form	 the
Government.   We  need express no opinion regarding  such  a
situation.
</p><p id="p_556">397. We	 are equally of the opinion that the High Court	 was
in error in holding that enactment/addition of Xth  Schedule
to  the Constitution has not made any difference.  The	very
object	of  the Xth Schedule is to  prevent  and  discourage
'floor-crossing'  and  defections,  which at  one  time	 had
assumed alarming proportions.  Whatever may be his  personal
predilections, a legislator elected on the ticket of a party
is bound to support that party in case of a division or vote
of confidence in the House, unless he is prepared to  forego
his membership of the House.  The Xth Schedule was  designed
precisely to counteract 'horse-trading'.  Except in the case
of  a  split, a legislator has to support his  party  willy-
nilly.	  This	is  the	 difference  between  the   position
obtaining prior to and after the Xth Schedule.	Prior to the
said  amendment, a legislator could shift his  loyalty	from
one  party  to	the  other  any	 number	 of  times   without
imperiling his membership of the House	it was as if he	 had
a property in the office.
</p><p id="p_557">398. Though  the Proclamation recites that  the	 President's
satisfaction was based also on "other information received",
the  counter-affidavit	of  the	 Union	of  India  does	 not
indicate  or state that any other  information/material	 was
available to the President or the Union Council of Ministers
other  than the report of the Governor	much  less  disclose
it.   In the circumstances, we must hold that there  was  no
other information before the President except the report  of
the  Governor  and  that the  word  "and  other	 information
received  by me" were put in the Proclamation  mechanically.
The Governor's report and the 'facts' stated therein  appear
to  be	the  only basis of  dismissing	the  Government	 and
dissolving the Assembly under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_887">Article 356(1).</a>  The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_219">279</span>
Proclamation  must, therefore, be held to be not   warranted
by  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_888">Article 356.</a>  It is outside its purview.  It  cannot  be
said, in the circumstances, that the President (or the Union
Council of Ministers) was 'satisfied' that the Government of
the  State  cannot  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of the Constitution.  The action was  mala	fide
and  unconstitutional.	 The  Proclamation  is	 accordingly
liable	to be struck down and we would have struck  it	down
herewith but for the fact that the elections have since been
held  to  the Legislative Assembly of the State	 and  a	 new
House  has come into being.  The issuance of a writ at	this
juncture  would be a futile one.  But for the said fact,  we
could  certainly  have considered  restoring  the  dismissed
Government   to	 office	 and  reactivating   the   dissolved
Assembly.   In	any event, the judgment	 of  Karnataka	High
Court is set aside.
</p><p id="p_558">			 MEGHALAYA
(Transferred Case.Nos. 5 and 7 of 1992)
</p><p id="p_559">399. In	 March	1990,  Hill Peoples'  Union,  to  which	 the
petitioner, Gonald Stone Massar, belonged and several  other
State political parties and certain independent MLAs  joined
together  to  form  a 'Front',	known  as  Meghalaya  United
Parliamentary  Party (MUPP).  This Front had a	majority  in
the  Assembly and formed the Government headed by Shri	B.B.
Lyngdoh.   On July 25, 1991, the then Speaker of the  House,
Shri  P.R. Kyndiah Arthree was elected as the leader of	 the
opposition  group  known as United  Meghalaya  Parliamentary
Forum  (UMPF), which was led by the Congress Party to  which
Shri  Kyndiah  belonged.   He claimed  the  support  of	 the
majority of members in the House and requested the  Governor
to  invite  him	 to  form  the	Government.   Thereupon	 the
Governor requested Shri Lyngdoh to prove his majority on the
floor of the House.  On August 7, 1991, a special session of
the Assembly was convened to pass a motion of confidence  in
the  Ministry.	 On the motion being moved,  thirty  members
supported  it  and twenty-seven voted  against	it.   Before
announcing  the result, however, the Speaker announced	that
he had received a complaint against five independent MLAs in
the  ruling  coalition alleging disqualification  under	 the
Anti-defection	Law  and that he  was  forthwith  suspending
their  right  to vote.	This resulted in an  uproar  in	 the
Assembly.   The session had to be adjourned.  On August	 11,
1991,  the Speaker sent identical show-cause notices to	 the
said  five  independent MLAs on the basis of  the  complaint
filed by one Shri H.S. Shylla.	On August 16, the five	MLAs
sent their replies denying that they have joined any of	 the
parties	 as  alleged.  They affirmed that they	continue  to
remain independents.  On August 17, 1991 the Speaker  passed
an order disqualifying all the 5 MLAs on the basis that four
of  them were Ministers in the Lyngdoh Ministry and  one  of
them  (Shri  Chamberlain Marak) was  the  Deputy  Government
Chief Whip.  The disqualification, it may be noted, was	 not
on the ground alleged in the show-cause notice.
</p><p id="p_560">400. Meanwhile, on the Governor's advice, the Chief Minister
summoned  the session of the Assembly for September 9,	1991
for  passing a vote of confidence.  The Speaker	 refused  to
send the notices of the session to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_220">280</span>
the   five   MLAs  disqualified	 by  him.   He	 also	made
arrangements  to. ensure that the said five members are	 not
allowed	 to enter the Assembly.	 On September 6, 1991,	four
of the said five MLAs approached this Court and obtained  an
interim	 order	staying the operation of the orders  of	 the
Speaker	 dated	August	7, 1991 and August  17,	 1991.	(one
member,	 Shri Ch.  Marak, did not obtain any  such  orders).
On  coming to know of the order of this Court,	the  Speaker
issued a press statement saying that he does not accept	 any
interference  by  any court with his order dated  August  7,
1991   disqualifying   five  members.	He   issued   strict
instructions  to the security guards not to allow  the	said
five  members  to  enter the  Assembly	premises.   In	this
explosive  situation,  the Governor adjourned  the  Assembly
indefinitely  by an order dated September 8, 1991.  After  a
brief  interval	 and  on the advice  of	 the  Governor,	 the
Assembly  was  again summoned to meet on  October  8,  1991.
Meanwhile,  a contempt petition was filed by the  said	four
MLAs  in  this Court against the Speaker.   They  complained
that  his action in preventing them from entering  into	 the
Assembly premises and from acting as members of the Assembly
was in violation of the orders of this Court dated September
6,  1991.   On October 3, 1991, this  Court  passed  another
order affirming that all authorities of the State  including
the Governor must ensure that the orders of this Court dated
September  6, 1991 are implemented.  Accordingly,  the	said
four  independent MLAs were issued invitation to attend	 the
session	 on  October 8, 1991.  The agenda  relating  to	 the
business of the House showed two items for consideration  on
that  day (1) a motion of confidence in the  Government	 and
(2) a motion of no confidence in the Speaker.
</p><p id="p_561">401.On	October	 8,  1991, 56 MLAs apart  from	the  Speaker
attended the session. The four MLAs who were disqualified by
the Speaker but who had obtained orders from this Court also
attended  but  not Shri Ch.  Marak who did  not	 obtain	 any
orders	from any court.	 After the motion of  confidence  in
the Government was put to vote, the Speaker declared that 26
voted for the motion and 26 against.  In counting the  votes
casts in favour of the motion, he excluded the votes of	 the
said four independent MLAs again.  Holding that there was  a
tie,  he cast his vote against the motion and  declared	 the
motion	lost.	He  then  adjourned  the  House	 sine	die,
evidently  with	 a view to ward off the	 passing  of  motion
against himself.  The thirty, MLAs (including the said	four
independent  MLAS) however, continued to stay in the  House.
They  elected a Speaker from among themselves and  continued
the  business of the Assembly.	The new Speaker found  on  a
scrutiny of the records relating to voting on the motion  of
confidence that actually 30 members have signed in favour of
the  motion and 26 against.  Accordingly, he  declared	that
the  motion  of confidence in the  Government  was  carried.
They also passed the motion of no confidence in the Speaker,
Shri  Kyndiah.	 The 26 members who had	 voted	against	 the
motion	had,  of course, left the House by that	 time.	 The
said  30  MLAs	thereafter sent a  letter  to  the  Governor
affirming  that they had voted in favour of  the  Government
and  also  in favour of the motion of no confidence  in	 the
Speaker.  In' spite of all this, the Chief Minister received
a  letter dated October 9, 1991 from the  Governor  advising
him to resign in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_221">281</span>
view  of  the proceedings of the Assembly dated	 October  8,
1991.  The Governor observed in his letter that the  dispute
about the Speaker not taking cognizance of the orders of the
Supreme	 Court	was  a matter between the  Speaker  and	 the
Supreme	 Court	and in that view of the	 matter,  the  Chief
Minister  should resign.  Immediately, thereupon, the  Chief
Minister  apprised his advocate in the Supreme Court of	 the
said letter of the Governor.  The counsel brought the matter
to the notice of this Court and at 4.00 p.m. on the same day
(October  9, 1991), this Court passed the following order  :
"Since	the  matter is extremely urgent, we deem it  fit  to
pass this further order asking the Governor while taking any
decision on the question whether the Government has lost the
motion of confidence and lost its majority in the House,  to
take into account, the two earlier orders dated September 6,
1991 and October 3, 1991 of this Court and also to take into
account	 how  the aforesaid four appellants had	 cast  their
vote." No heed was paid to this order and on October 11, 199
1,  the	 President  of India  issued  a	 Proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_889">Article	 356</a>  of  the Constitution  declaring  that  he	 was
satisfied  on  the basis of a report from  the	Governor  of
Meghalaya  and	other  information received by	him  that  a
situation  has arisen in which the Government of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.  He accordingly dismissed the  Government
and  dissolved the Assembly.  Before proceeding further,  it
may be mentioned that by an order dated October 12, 1991,  a
Constitution Bench of this Court set aside the order of	 the
Speaker dated August 17, 1989.
</p><p id="p_562">402. Both  Houses  of Parliament duly met and  approved	 the
Proclamation.
</p><p id="p_563">403. It	 is  a matter of deep regret that  the	Governor  of
Meghalaya  did not think it his constitutional duty to	give
effect	to  the	 orders	 of this Court,	 not  even  after  a
specific  direction to that effect.  He could not have	been
unaware of the obligation created by <a href="/doc/1799967/" id="a_890">Article 144</a>, viz.,	 the
duty  of  all  authorities,  civil  and	 judicial,  in	 the
territory  of India to act in aid of the Supreme  Court	 and
its  orders.   By  order  dated	 October  9,  1991,  he	 was
specifically  requested to take into account the  orders  of
this  Court while deciding whether the Government  has	lost
the confidence of the House and yet he ignored the same	 and
reported  to  the President that the Ministry has  lost	 the
confidence  of the House.  We are intrigued by	the  strange
logic  of the Governor that obedience to the orders of	this
Court  relating	 to the disqualification of members  of	 the
House is a matter between the Speaker and the Supreme Court.
Evidently,  he invoked this strange logic to enable  him  to
say   as he wanted to say or as he was asked to say, as	 the
case  may be  that the Speaker's decision that the  Ministry
has lost the confidence of the House, is valid and effective
at any rate, so far as he is concerned.	 The Governor  ought
to  have noted that this Court had stayed the  operation  of
the orders of the Speaker disqualifying the four independent
members,  which meant that the said four MLAs were  entitled
to  participate	 in the proceedings of the Assembly  and  to
vote.	They  did vote in favour of  the  motion  expressing
confidence  in	the Government.	 The Speaker  was,  however,
bent upon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_222">282</span>
unseating the Government by means fair or foul and with that
view  was  openly  flouting the orders of  this	 Court.	  He
managed	 to  declare  that  the	 Government  has  lost	 the
confidence  of the House by excluding the votes of the	said
four members in clear violation of the orders of this Court.
It  is surprising that the Governor chose to  turn  Nelson's
eye  upon  the	misdeeds of the Speaker and  also  chose  to
refuse	to take note of the proceedings of the	majority  of
members	 taken	under  the  Speakership	 of  another  member
elected	 by them.  It is equally curious that  the  Governor
chose  to  report  that a situation  has  arisen  where	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the provisions of the Constitution.  The violation  of
the  provisions of the Constitution was by Shri Kyndiah	 and
not  by	 the  Ministry in office and  yet  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_891">Article  356</a>	 was
resorted  to by the President to dismiss the  Government  on
the  basis  of such a report.  That even such  an  ex  facie
unconstitutional Proclamation was approved by both Houses of
Parliament   shows  up	the  inadequacy	 of  the   safeguard
envisaged  in clause (3)  by which provision much store	 was
laid by the counsel appearing for the Union of India as well
as those supporting the impugned Proclamations.
</p><p id="p_564">404. In	 this  case too, the Proclamation recites  that	 the
requisite  satisfaction was arrived at on the basis  of	 the
report of the Governor and the other information received by
the  President but no such information or material has	been
brought to our notice.	We must conclude that there was none
and  that  the recital to that effect is a  mere  mechanical
one.
</p><p id="p_565">405. We	 must  say in fairness to  Shri	 Parasaran,  learned
counsel	 appearing  for the Union of India that he  did	 not
seek to defend the Proclamation in this case.
</p><p id="p_566">406. Accordingly,    we	   hold	   the	  Proclamation	  as
unconstitutional.   But for the fact that since the date  of
Proclamation, fresh elections have been held to the Assembly
and  a	new  House has come into existence,  we	 would	have
certainly  issued the writ and directed the  restoration  of
the  Lyngdoh Ministry to officeand restored the Assembly  as
well.
</p><p id="p_567">			  NAGALAND
</p><p id="p_568">407. Elections	to  the	 Nagaland  Assembly  were  held	  in
November  1987.	 The strength of the Assembly was  60.	 The
position emerging from the election was : Congress (1)	 35,
Naga National Democratic Party	13 and Independents  7.	 The
Congress  (1) Party formed the Government with Shri  Hokishe
Sema  as  the  Chief  Minister.	 In  August  1988,  a  split
occurred  in the ruling party whose strength was 34 at	that
time, one member having died.  The particulars of the  split
in the party are the following : On July 28, 1988, 13 of the
34 MLAs informed the Speaker of the Assembly that they	have
dissociated from the ruling party and have formed a separate
party  called "Congress Ruling Party".	They  requested	 the
Speaker	 for  allotment of separate seats for  them  in	 the
Assembly, the session of which was to commence on August 28,
1988.	On July 30, 1988 the Speaker held that a  split	 had
occurred  within  the  meaning of the Xth  Schedule  of	 the
Constitution in the ruling party.  Shri Vamuzo was one among
the said 13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_223">283</span>
MLAs. He informed the Governor on July 31, 1988 that he	 has
secured the support of 35 of the 59 members of the  Assembly
and was in a position to form the Ministry in the State.  At
this  stage,  the  Chief  Secretary  to	 the  Government  of
Nagaland  wrote	 to  Shri  Vamuzo on  August  3,  1988	that
according  to the information received by him, the group  of
13  MLAs  aforesaid were wrongfully confined by	 him.	Shri
Vamuzo	denied the same and invited the Chief  Secretary  to
come  and verify the truth of the allegation from  the	said
members	 themselves.   The members stated before  the  Chief
Secretary  that they were free agents and were not  confined
by anyone.  On August 6, 1988 the Governor of Nagaland	sent
a  report to the President of India about the  formation  of
Congress  Ruling  Party.  He reported that in  the  past  25
years, 11 Governments have been formed and that 13 MLAs	 who
had dissociated themselves from the Congress (1) Party	were
allured with money.  He characterized the said weaning	away
of the 13 members as "incredible lack of political  morality
and  complete disregard to the wishes to the  electorate  on
the part of the breakaway Congressmen".	 He also stated that
the  said  13 persons were kept in forcible  confinement  by
Shri  Vamuzo and another person and that the story of  split
in the party is not true.  He characterized the	 recognition
accorded  to the said group of 13 members by the Speaker  as
hasty.	 He  also  spoke of  political	'horse-trading'	 and
machinations.  He referred to the insurgency in Nagaland and
that indeed some of the members of the Assembly were  having
contacts  with the insurgent groups.  He reported  that	 the
stability  of the State may suffer due to the  said  episode
and  further  that  if the present affairs  are	 allowed  to
continue, a serious development may ensue.
</p><p id="p_569">408. The Chief Minster, Shri Hokishe Sema, probably  finding
that  he  has  lost  the  majority  support  in	 the  House,
submitted  his resignation to the Governor  and	 recommended
the imposition of the President's rule.	 On August 7,  1988,
the  President	issued the Proclamation	 under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_892">Article	 356</a>
assuming  the  functions of the Government of the  State  of
Nagaland.   The	 Government was dismissed and  the  Assembly
dissolved.  The action was challenged by Shri Vamuzo by	 way
of a writ petition in the Guwahati High Court being C.R. No.
1414  of  1988.	 The writ petition was heard by	 a  Division
Bench comprising the Chief Justice and Hansaria, J. Both the
learned Judges agreed that the validity of the	Proclamation
can be examined by the court and that the Proclamation under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_893">Article	 356</a> is not immune from judicial scrutiny.   But  on
the  question of the effect and operation of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_894">Article  74(2</a>),
they  differed.	 The learned Chief Justice held	 "the  Union
cannot be compelled to tender any information to this  Court
covered	 by <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_895">Article 74</a> of the Constitution relevant  to	 the
dissolution of the Nagaland Assembly.  I am also of the view
that  the  Union of India can legally  claim  all  documents
relevant  to  the dissolution of the  Nagaland	Assembly  as
privileged  documents and a 'class' documents under  <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_896">Section
123</a> of the Evidence Act.  Therefore, the objection that	 the
courts	do not have powers to call for the information	from
the  President	of  India in view of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_897">Article  74(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  is sustained.  Since the Nagaland	 Legislative
Assembly is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_224">284</span>
dissolved by the two Houses of Parliament, no relief can  be
granted in the circumstances of this case".  Accordingly, he
proposed  to  dismiss  the  writ  petition.   Hansaria,	 J.,
however, took a contrary view.	The learned Judge held	that
the  material which formed part of 'other  information'	 but
has  not been produced before the court, does not form	part
of  the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers  to	 the
President.   The  court is, therefore, entitled to  see	 the
said  material and for that purpose the Union of India	must
be  given  ten	days'  time for	 producing  the	 same.	 If,
however,  they	decline to do so, the court  would  have  no
alternative  but  to act upon the present material  and	 the
Union of India will have to take the consequences of such  a
course.	 The learned Judge did not propose to dispose of the
writ  petition but to wait for ten days and  then  pronounce
the  final  orders.   In  view of  the	said  difference  of
opinion,  the  matter  was referred to a  third	 Judge,	 but
before	the third Judge could hear the matter, the Union  of
India moved this Court for grant of special leave.   Special
leave  was  granted and the proceedings in  the	 High  Court
stayed.
</p><p id="p_570">409. We have discussed the effect and scope of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_898">Article 74(2)</a>
elsewhere.   In	 the light of the same, the  view  taken  by
Hansaria, J. (as he then was) must be held to be the correct
one  and  not the view taken by the learned  Chief  Justice.
This special leave petition is accordingly disposed of	with
the above direction.  Inasmuch as fresh elections have since
been  held, the High Court may consider the advisability  of
proceeding with the matter at this point of time.
 MADHYA PRADESH, RAJASTHAN AND HIMACHAL PRADESH
</p><p id="p_571">410. In the elections held in February 1990, the BJP emerged
as  the majority party in the Assemblies of  Uttar  Pradesh,
Madhya	Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh	 and  formed
the Government therein.
</p><p id="p_572">411. On	 December 6, 1992, the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri  Masjid
structure  (disputed  structure) was demolished by  the	 kar
sevaks who had gathered there in response to appeals by	 the
BJP,   VHP,   Bajrang  Dal,  Shiv  Sena	  and	some   other
organisations.
</p><p id="p_573">412. Following	the  demolition at Ayodhya  on	December  6,
1992,  the  Government of Uttar Pradesh	 resigned.   It	 was
dismissed  by  the President and  the  Legislative  Assembly
dissolved by a Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_899">Article 356</a> issued on	 the
same  day.   The Proclamation does not refer either  to	 the
report	of the Governor nor does it say that  the  President
had received any information otherwise.	 Be that as it	may,
the  validity  of the said Proclamation not being  in  issue
before us, we need not express any opinion in that behalf.
</p><p id="p_574">413. The  demolition  of  the disputed	mosque	had  serious
repercussions	all  over  the	country	 as  also  in	some
neighbouring countries.	 A number of temples were reportedly
demolished  there.   Serious disturbance to  law  and  order
occurred  in  various  parts of	 the  country  resulting  in
considerable loss of lives and property.  By an order  dated
December 10, 1992 issued under <a href="/doc/1125563/" id="a_900">Section 3(1)</a> of the  Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (37 of 1967),
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_225">285</span>
the  Government	 of India banned  several  alleged  communal
organisations including RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal.
</p><p id="p_575">				 MADHYA PRADESH
</p><p id="p_576">414. On	 December  8, 1992, the Governor of  Madhya  Pradesh
sent  a	 report	 to  the President  setting  out  the  "fast
deteriorating  law and order situation in the State  in	 the
wake of widespread acts of violence, arson and looting".  He
observed  in  his  report that "the lack  of  faith  in	 the
ability	 of the State Government to stem the tide  primarily
because	 of  the  political leadership's  overt	 and  covert
support	 to  the associate communal  organisations  seem  to
point  out  that there is breakdown  of	 the  administrative
machinery  of the State".  He .Followed it up  with  another
report	on December 10, 1992 wherein he mentioned about	 the
violence spreading to hitherto peaceful areas.	On  December
13,  1992, he sent his third report enclosing the  photocopy
of  a  letter received from the Executive  Director,  Bharat
Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Bhopal dated December	 11,
1992.	The  said letter, said the Governor,  indicated	 the
"abject	 faiure	 of the law and order machinery	 to  provide
safety and security to life and property in the areas in and
around	BHEL  factory".	  The  letter  also  spoke  of	"the
pressure  brought on the administration to  accommodate	 the
so-called  kar	sevaks in BHEL area".  The  Governor  termed
them as extremely serious developments that deserve a  high-
level probe.  The third report further stated that "with the
reported  statement  of the Chief Minister Shri	 Sunder	 Lal
Patwa  that  the  decision of banning the RSS  and  VHP	 was
unfortunate, the State Government's credibility to sincerely
implement  the Center's direction in the matter is  under  a
cloud  ...  there is a question mark as to how	BJP  leaders
like  Shri Patwa who swore by the values and  traditions  of
the RSS will be able to implement the ban both in letter and
spirit. The VHP's decision to observe December 13 as  'Black
Day'  all  over the country to protest	against	 the  above-
mentioned  ban	and  its decision to  observe  protest	week
against	 these	'heinous laws' from December 14	 to  20	 are
moves  fraught	with  danger, particularly  in	the  present
context".  The Governor recommended that  "considering	this
and looked in the background of the RSS, etc., contemplating
on  a  fresh strategy to chalk out its future plan  and	 the
possibility of the leaders of the banned organisations going
underground  taking  advantage of the soft reaction  of	 the
Administration	have  reasons  to be  convinced	 that  there
should not be any further delay in imposition of President's
rule according to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_901">Article 356</a> of the Constitution of India".
</p><p id="p_577">     HIMACHAL PRADESH
</p><p id="p_578">     415. The Governor of Himachal Pradesh sent a report  on
December  15, 1992 wherein he stated inter alia : "There  is
no  dispute  on the point that the Chief  Minister  and	 his
cabinet had instigated the kar sevaks from Himachal  Pradesh
to participate in the kar seva on December 6, 1992. Some  of
the  Ministers expressed their desire even openly,  provided
the  party high command permitted to do so. Consequently,  a
large	number	of  kar	 sevaks	 including  some  BJP	MLAs
participated in the kar seva from Himachal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_226">286</span>
Pradesh.   A  member of the Vidhan Sabha  publicly  admitted
that  he  had participated in the demolition  of  the  Babri
Masjid	(Indian Express dated December 15, 1992,  Chandigarh
Edition).   Though Shri Shanta Kumar met me on December	 13,
1992  and had informed me that he desired to  implement	 the
ban  orders imposed by the Government of India on  RSS,	 VHP
and three other organisations and that he has already issued
directions  in	this  regard but since	the  Chief  Minister
himself	 is  a	member of RSS, therefore, he  is  not  in  a
position   to  implement  these	 directions   honestly	 and
effectively.   Most  of the people of the  State  also	feel
alike.	...  As a matter of fact, when	the  Chief  Minister
himself and some of the colleagues are members of the banned
RSS,  then  it	is  not	 possible  for	the   administrative
machinery  to  implement the ban honestly,  especially	when
some  of  the Ministers are openly criticising	the  ban  on
these  communal organisations." He,  therefore,	 recommended
imposition of the President's rule.
</p><p id="p_579">RAJASTHAN
</p><p id="p_580">416. The  report of the Governor of Rajasthan,	recommending
imposition  of	the President's rule, stated  the  following
facts  : The Government of Rajasthan has played 'an  obvious
role' in the Ayodhya episode.  The BJP has control over RSS,
VHP and Bajrang Dal which are now banned by the Centre.	 The
said  ban is not being implemented at all.  Indeed,  one  of
the Ministers had resigned and along with 22 MLAs and 15,500
BJP  workers had participated in the kar seva at Ayodhya  on
December  12,  1992.  They were given a royal send  off	 and
when they returned, they were given a similar royal  welcome
by  the influential people in the political  set-up  running
the  Government.   The law and order has been very  bad	 for
more  than  a week, the dominant character being  the  anti-
minority  on  whom largely atrocities have  been  committed.
The administration could not function effectively under	 the
present	 political  set-up.  He expressed  the	apprehension
that   it  would  be  extremely	 difficult  to	expect	 the
administration	to function objectively, effectively and  in
accordance  with  the rule of law and that a  situation	 has
arisen	in  which  the Government of  the  State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_581">417. On	 December  15,	1992,  the  President  issued  three
Proclamations dismissing all the three Governments in Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh and dissolving their
Legislative  Assemblies.   The action was  purported  to  be
taken on the basis of the reports of the Governors concerned
as well as on the basis of other information received.	 The
validity of the Proclamations was challenged immediately  by
filing	writ petitions in the appropriate High Courts.	 The
Madhya	Pradesh	 High  Court  allowed  the  same  which	  is
challenged by the Union of India in Civil Appeal Nos.  1692,
1692-A	to 1692-C of 1993.  The writ petitions	relating  to
Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh were withdrawn to this  Court
and  are  numbered  as Transferred Case No. 9  of  1993	 and
Transferred Case No. 8 of 1993 respectively.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_227">287</span>
<p id="p_582">418. The  petitioners  challenged the Proclamation  as	mala
fide, vitiated by extraneous considerations and an  instance
of  political vendetta.	 It is submitted that  incidents  of
disturbance  to	 law and order cannot attract  action  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_902">Article	 356.</a>  In any event, in Himachal Pradesh, there	 was
not  a	single	instance.  All the  three  Governments	were
faithfully implementing all the Central and State laws.	 The
impugned  Proclamations, it is submitted, are the result  of
internal differences among the leaders of the Congress Party
and are not supportable in law.
</p><p id="p_583">419. It	 is  submitted	by  the	 learned  counsel  for	 the
petitioners  that the imposition of the President's rule  in
the States of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh
was  mala  fide, based on no satisfaction and was  purely  a
political act.	Mere fact that communal disturbances  and/or
instances  of arson and looting took place is no ground	 for
imposing the President's rule.	Indeed, such incidents	took
place  in  several  Congress (1)ruled  States  as  well	  in
particular,  in the State of Maharashtra  on a	much  larger
scale  and  yet	 no  action  was  taken	 to  displace  those
Governments  whereas  action  was  taken  only	against	 BJP
Governments.   It  is pointed out that so  far	as  Himachal
Pradesh is concerned, there were no communal disturbances at
all.   There  was no law and order problem worth  the  name.
Even  the  Governor's  report  did not	speak  of  any	such
incidents.  The Governments of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and
Himachal  Pradesh, it is argued, cannot be held	 responsible
for what happened at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.  For	that
incident,  the	Government  of Uttar  Pradesh  had  resigned
owning	responsibility therefor and it was dismissed.	That
is not under challenge.	 But the Governments of these  three
States	were in no way connected with the said incident	 and
could  not  have  been	dismissed on  account  of  the	said
incident.   It	is also pointed out that  according  to	 the
report	of  the	 Governor of  Himachal	Pradesh,  the  Chief
Minister met him and indicated clearly that he was  desirous
of  and was implementing the ban and that some arrests	were
also made.  In such a situation, there was no reason for the
Governor  to believe, or to report, that the Chief  Minister
is  not	 sincere or keen to implement the ban  on  the	said
organisations.	 As  a matter of fact,	the  Tribunal  under
<a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_903">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a>, 1967, has declared the
ban on RSS as illegal and accordingly the ban has since been
revoked.  The non-implementation of an illegal ban cannot be
made  the basis of action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_904">Article 356.</a>  Assuming	that
there  was such an inaction or refusal, it cannot be made  a
ground	 for  dismissing  the  State  Government   and	 for
dissolving the Assembly.  The Union Government has also	 not
disclosed what other material/information they had  received
on  the	 basis of which the President had  acted,  though  a
recital	 to that effect has been made in the  Proclamations.
The  action  taken by the President cannot be  justified  by
producing the material gathered later.	The respondents must
disclose the information that was before the President	when
he  issued the impugned Proclamations.	The White Paper	 now
placed before the Court was not in existence on December 15,
1992.	The manifestos issued by the BJP from time  to	time
cannot constitute the information referred to in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_228">288</span>
Proclamations  not, in any event, legally relevant material.
The  counter filed by the Union of India in  Madhya  Pradesh
High Court in M.P. No. 237 of 1993 (<a href="/doc/488734/" id="a_905">Sunderlal Patwa v. Union
of  India62</a>)  does  not	 refer	to  or	disclose  the  other
information received by the President.	Even in the counters
filed  in  writ	 petitions  questioning	 the   Proclamations
relating to Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan, no such material
is  disclosed.	It was the duty of the Union  Government  to
have  disclosed to the Court the  material/information	upon
which the requisite satisfaction was formed, more so because
the  Proclamations  themselves	do not	refer  to  any	such
material.   Since  they	 have failed to do  so,	 an  adverse
inference  should be drawn against them.  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_906">Article 74(2</a>),  it
is argued, does not and cannot relieve the Union of India of
this  obligation.  The power and remedy of judicial  review,
it is argued, cannot be rendered ineffective with  reference
to <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_907">Article 74(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_584">420. A counter-affidavit was filed by the Union of India  in
the  writ  petition filed in the Madhya Pradesh	 High  Court
questioning  the  Proclamation with respect to	that  State.
Apart  from the legal contentions, the following  facts	 are
stated therein :
</p><p id="p_585">421. The  reports of the Governor disclosed that  the  State
Government had miserably failed to protect the citizens	 and
property of the State against internal disturbance.  On	 the
basis  of  the	said  reports,	the  President	formed	 the
requisite satisfaction.
</p><p id="p_586">422. The  circumstances in the State of M.P. were  different
from  several other States where too serious disturbance  to
law  and order took place.  There is no	 comparison  between
both situations.  "Besides Bhopal, overall situation in	 the
State of M.P. was such that there were sufficient and cogent
reasons	 to  be satisfied that the Government in  the  State
could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of
the  Constitution.  It is denied that there was no  law	 and
order  situation in the State".	 The Governor's reports	 are
based  upon  relevant material and are made  bona  fide	 and
after due verification.
</p><p id="p_587">423. The allegations made against Shri Arjun Singh, Minister
for  Human Resource Development are baseless.  The  decision
was  a collective decision of the Council of Ministers.	  No
comparison with regard to the State of affairs in the  State
of  Madhya Pradesh can be made with those of  other  States.
The  Governor  of Madhya Pradesh having	 reported  that	 the
constitutional	machinery in the State had broken down,	 the
Proclamation   of   President's	 rule	is   justified	 and
constitutional.
</p><p id="p_588">424.  In  the counter-affidavit filed in the  writ  petition
(Transferred  Case  No.	 8 of 1993)  relating  to  Himachal-
Pradesh, the very same objections as are put forward in	 the
counter-affidavit filed in the Madhya Pradesh case have been
reiterated.  In the para-wise replies, it is stated that the
events	of  December 6, 1992 were not the handiwork  of	 few
persons	 but  that "the public attitude	 and  statements  of
various	 groups and political parties including BJP  led  to
the  destruction  of the structure in  question	 and  caused
great  damage to the very secular fabric of the country	 and
created communal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_229">62 M.P. No. 237 of 1993</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_230">289</span>
 discord  and  disharmony  all over  the  country  including
Himachal  Pradesh".  It is stated that the repercussions  of
the  event  cannot  be judged by  comparing  the  number  of
persons killed in different States.  It is asserted that the
Council	 of  Ministers and the President "had  a  wealth  of
material  available  to them in the present case  which	 are
relevant to the satisfaction formed under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_908">Article 356.</a>	They
were also aware of the serious damage to communal amity	 and
harmony which has been caused in the State of Madhya Pradesh
among	others.	   They	 were	extremely   concerned	with
repercussions  which events at Ayodhya might still  have  in
the States and the ways and means to bring back normalcy not
only in the law and order situation but also communal  amity
and  harmony which had so badly damaged as a result  of	 the
activities,  attitude and stand of inter alia the  party  in
power  in the State".  It is also stated that, according  to
the  definite  information available to	 the  Government  of
India, members of the RSS were not only present on the	spot
at  Ayodhya but actually participated in the demolition	 and
that  they  were  responsible  for  promotion  of   communal
disharmony.   It is for this reason that it was banned.	  It
is also asserted that the action was taken by the  President
not only on the basis of the report of the Governor but also
on the basis of other information received by him.
</p><p id="p_589">425. In	 the  counter-affidavit filed in the  writ  petition
relating to Rajasthan (Transferred Case No. 9 of 1993) it is
stated	that  after  the demolition  of	 December  6,  1992,
violence started in various parts of the country leading  to
loss  of life and property.  It is asserted that it  is	 not
possible to assess the law and order situation in  different
States only on the basis of casualty figures.  The situation
in each State has to be assessed differently.  The  averment
of the petitioner that the State Government implemented	 the
ban on RSS properly is denied.	There is no requirement that
the  report  of	 the Governor should  be  addressed  to	 the
President.  It can also be addressed to the Prime  Minister.
Besides	 the report of the Governor, other  information	 was
also  available	 on  which  the	 President  had	 formed	 his
satisfaction.	The correctness, adequacy or sufficiency  of
the  material  contained  in the Governor's  report  is	 not
justiciable  and  cannot  be gone into by  the	court.	 The
allegations of mala fide, capricious and arbitrary  exercise
of power are denied.  No irrelevant material was taken	into
consideration by the President and hence, it is averred, the
satisfaction of the President is not judicially reviewable.
</p><p id="p_590">426. The  learned  counsel  for Union  of  India  and  other
counsel supporting the impugned Proclamations put their case
thus  : the main plank and the primary programme of BJP	 was
the construction of a Ram temple at the very site where	 the
Babri  Masjid stood.  The party openly proclaimed that	they
will  remove  relocate, as they called it  the Babri  Masjid
structure  since  according  to them the  Babri	 Masjid	 was
superimposed  on  an existing Ram temple by  Emperor  Babur.
The  party came to power in all the four States on the	said
plank and since then had been working towards the said goal.
It  is the one single goal of all the leaders of BJP,  their
Ministers,  Legislators and all cadres.	 For  this  purpose,
they have been repeatedly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_231">290</span>
gathering  kar sevaks from all corners at Ayodhya from	time
to  time.   In the days immediately  preceding	December  6,
1992,  their leaders have been inciting and exhorting  their
followers to demolish the Babri Masjid and to build a temple
there.	 The Ministers in Madhya Pradesh,  Himachal  Pradesh
and Rajasthan took active part in organising and despatching
kar  sevaks to Ayodhya.	 When the kar sevaks  returned	from
Ayodhya after demolishing the Masjid, they were welcomed  as
heroes	by  those very persons.	 Many of the  Ministers	 and
Chief  Ministers  were members of RSS  and  were  protesting
against	 the  ban  on it.  They	 could	not,  therefore,  be
trusted	  to   enforce	 the   ban,   notwithstanding	 the
protestations to the contrary by some of them.
</p><p id="p_591">427. The manifesto issued by the BJP on the eve of  May/June
1991 midterm poll states that the BJP "seeks the restoration
of  Ram	 Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya only by way  of	 a  symbolic
righting of historic wrongs, so that the old unhappy chapter
of   acrimony	could  be  ended,  and	a   Grand   National
Reconciliation	effected".  At another place under the	head
"Sri  Ram  Mandir at Janmasthan",  the	following  statement
occurs	:  "BJP	 firmly believes that  construction  of	 Ram
Mandir	at Janmasthan is a symbol of the vindication of	 our
cultural heritage and national self-respect.  For BJP it  is
purely	a  national issue and it will not allow	 any  vested
interests  to  give  it a  sectarian  and  communal  colour.
Hence,	the  party is committed to build Sri Ram  Mandir  at
Janmasthan  by relocating superimposed Babri structure	with
due respect." Standing by themselves, it is true, the  above
statements  may	 not  mean  that  the  programme   envisaged
unlawful  or forcible demolition of the disputed  structure.
The said statements are also capable of being understood  as
meaning that the party proposed to vindicate their stand  in
courts	that  the  disputed structure was in  fact  the	 Ram
Janmasthan  which  was forcibly converted into a  mosque  by
Emperor	 Babur and that only thereafter they  will  relocate
the said structure and build Ram temple at that site.	But,
says  the  counsel, if we read the above statements  in	 the
light  of the speeches and acts of the leaders of  the	BJP,
referred  to in the White Paper issued by the Government  of
India,	there would hardly be any room for  such  beneficial
interpretation.	 The "White Paper on Ayodhya" issued by	 the
Government  of	India  in  February  1993,  establishes	 the
complicity  of	the  Bhartiya Janata Party as  such  in	 the
demolition of the disputed structure and its aftermath.
</p><p id="p_592">428. According	to the statement of the Union Home  Minister
made  in  Rajya	 Sabha on December  21,	 1992,	the  counsel
pointed out, "all these kar sevaks, when they returned, were
received by the Chief Ministers and Ministers".
</p><p id="p_593">429. The  counsel  for the respondents argued  further	that
what  happened on December 6, 1992 did not happen in a	day.
It was the culmination of a sustained campaign carried on by
the  BJP  and other allied organisations over the  last	 few
years.	  They	had  been  actively  campaigning   for	 the
construction  of Ram Temple at the disputed site.  They	 had
been  speaking	of relocating the disputed  structure  which
only  meant that they wanted the disputed structure  removed
and  a	Ram  temple constructed in  that  very	place.	 The
several	 speeches  of the leaders of BJP  and  other  allied
parties, referred to in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_232">291</span>
 the  White  Paper,  do clearly	 establish  the	 said  fact.
Indeed,	 in  the manifesto issued by the BJP  in  connection
with  the  1993 General Elections, there is not	 a  word  of
regret	as  to what happened on December 6,  1992.   On	 the
contrary,  the following statement occurs under the  heading
"Ayodhya"
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_164">				 "Ayodhya
	      In their actions and utterances, the forces of
	      pseudo-secularism	  convey  the	unmistakable
	      impression of a deep repugnance for all things
	      Hindu.   Indeed,	in their minds	'Hindu'	 has
	      come  to be associated with  'communal'.	 The
	      controversy over the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in
	      Ayodhya  is  a powerful illustration  of	this
	      phenomenon.  For them 'Sahmat' is secular	 and
	      'Saffron' communal.  Although the facts of the
	      dispute are well-known, certain features merit
	      repetition.   First,  it was  always  apparent
	      that  a vast majority of Hindus  were  totally
	      committed	 to  the  construction	of  a  grand
	      temple  for Lord Rama at the site	 where	puja
	      has been performed uninterruptedly since	1948
	      and  where besides, no namaz has been  offered
	      since 1936.  The structure built by the Moghul
	      Emperor  Babur was viewed by the Hindus  as  a
	      symbol of national humiliation.
	      Second, the election of 1991 in Uttar  Pradesh
	      centred  on  the Ayodhya dispute.	  It  was  a
	      virtual referendum on Ram Janmabhoomi and	 the
	      BJP   with  its  promise	to  facilitate	 the
	      construction   of	 the  Ram  Temple  won	 the
	      election.	  However,  this  mandate  did	 not
	      prevent the Congress and other  pseudo-secular
	      parties	from   wilfully	  obstructing	 the
	      initiatives  of the Uttar Pradesh	 Government.
	      Everything, from administrative subterfuge  to
	      judicial	delay, was used by the opponents  of
	      the temple to prevent the BJP Government	from
	      fulfilling its promise to the electorate.
	      On  December 6, 1992 kar sevaks from all	over
	      India  assembled	in  Ayodhya  to	 begin	 the
	      reconstruction of the Rama Temple at the	site
	      adjoining	 the garbha griha.  Matters took  an
	      unexpected   turn	  when,	  angered   by	 the
	      obstructive  tactics  of	the  Narasimha	 Rao
	      Government,  inordinate  judicial	 delays	 and
	      pseudo-secularist taunts, the kar sevaks	took
	      matters  into their own hands, demolished	 the
	      disputed structure and constructed a makeshift
	      temple for Lord Rama at the garbha griha.
	      Owning  responsibility  for its  inability  to
	      prevent  the  demolition, the  BJP  Government
	      headed  by  Shri Kalyan  Singh  submitted	 its
	      resignation.  A disoriented Central Government
	      was   not	 content  with	the  imposition	  of
	      President's   rule  in  Uttar   Pradesh.	  In
	      violation	 of  democratic	 norms,	 the  Centre
	      dismissed	 the BJP Governments  in  Rajasthan,
	      Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.  Further,
	      it  banned  the Rashtriya	 Swayamsevak  Sangh,
	      Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal.
	      Worst of all, in collusion with other rootless
	      forces  the  Government  unleashed  a  vicious
	      propaganda  offensive aimed at belittling	 the
	      Hindus.	The  kar sevaks were  denigrated  as
	      fascists, lumpens and vandals, and December 6,
	      was   described	as   a	 'national   shame'.
	      Recently, the CBI has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_233">	      292</span>
	      filed charge-sheets against leaders of the BJP
	      and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad with the purpose
	      of projecting them as criminals.
	      This  relentless	onslaught  of  the   pseudo-
	      secular forces against the people of India had
	      very  serious consequences.  For a  start,  it
	      created  a  wide emotional  gulf	between	 the
	      rulers and the people.  Ayodhya was a  popular
	      indictment of the spurious politics of double-
	      standards.   Far from recognising it as  such,
	      the  Congress and other anti-BJP parties	used
	      it  as a pretext for furthering the  cause  of
	      unprincipled minorityism.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_165">	      It  is  this  minorityism	 that  prevents	 the
	      Congress, Janata Dal, Samajvadi Party and	 the
	      Communist	 Parties  from coming  out  with  an
	      unambiguous declaration of intent on  Ayodhya.
	      Thus   BJP   is  the  only  party	  which	  is
	      categorical in its assurance to facilitate the
	      construction of the Rama Temple at the site of
	      the  erstwhile Babri structure.  That is	what
	      the people desire."
</blockquote><p id="p_594">430. The counsel further pointed out the significance of the
total  inaction	 on the part of the top leaders of  the	 BJP
present	 near the disputed structure at Ayodhya on  December
6,  1992.   They  took	no  steps  whatsoever  to  stop	 the
demolition.   The  kar sevaks had gathered  there  at  their
instance.   They  had appealed to the kar sevaks  to  gather
there from all comers of the country.  Some of these leaders
had been speaking of demolition of the disputed structure to
enable	the construction of Ram Temple at that	very  place.
Even assuming that the assault on the disputed structure was
a  sudden move on the part of some kar sevaks, it is not  as
if  the	 demolition took place in a couple of  minutes.	  It
must  have certainly taken a few hours.	 If the BJP  leaders
present there really wanted to prevent it, they should	have
appealed  to  the  people  and ought  to  have	taken  other
effective  steps to prevent the kar sevaks from	 demolishing
the structure.	There is no allegation anywhere in the	writ
petition or other material placed before the court that they
ever  did so.  If one reads the aforesaid statements in	 the
manifestos of 1991 and 1993 in the light of the above facts,
it would be clear, says the counsel, that the demolition  of
the  disputed  structure was the outcome  of  the  speeches,
programme  and the several campaigns including	Rath  Yatras
undertaken  by	the  leaders  of the  BJP.   It	 is  neither
possible  nor  realistic to dissociate	the  Governments  of
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh from the acts
and  deeds  of	their  party.  It  is  one  party  with	 one
programme.  Kar sevaks were sent by and welcomed back by the
Ministers and legislators (belonging to BJP) of these  three
States	as  well.  Thereby they expressed  and	demonstrated
their  approval of the deed done by the kar sevaks.   It  is
stated	in the report of the Himachal Pradesh Governor	that
the Chief Minister himself was a member of the RSS.  In	 the
report of the Governor of Madhya Pradesh also, it is  stated
that  the  Chief Minister and other Ministers swore  by	 the
values and traditions of the RSS.  The reports also indicate
that  these Governments actively participated in  organising
and despatching the kar sevaks to Ayodhya and welcomed	them
and praised when they came back after doing the deed.  Thus,
a  common thread runs through all the four  BJP	 Governments
and  binds them together, say the counsel.  All	 these	four
Governments had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_234">293</span>
 launched  upon	 a course of action in tandem with  top	 BJP
leaders,  which	 led to the demolition.	 Their	actions	 and
deeds  were contrary to the provisions of the  Constitution.
The  manifestos	 of the party on the basis  of	which  these
Governments  came to power coupled with their  speeches	 and
actions	 clearly  demonstrate a commonness,  an	 inseparable
unity	of   action  between  the  party  and	these	four
Governments.   The  very manifestos and their  programme  of
action	were such as to hurt the religious feelings  of	 the
Muslim community.  They negated the secular concept, a basic
feature of our Constitution.  The demolition of the disputed
structure was no ordinary event.  The disputed structure had
become	the focal point, the bone of contention between	 two
religious  communities.	 The process which resulted  in	 the
demolition  and the manner of in which it  was	perpetrated,
dealt  a serious blow to the communal harmony and  peace  in
the country.  It had adverse international repercussions  as
well.  A number of Hindu temples were demolished in Pakistan
and Bangladesh in reprisal of the demolition at Ayodhya.  It
was difficult in this situation to ask the minorities in the
four  States  to have any faith in the neutrality  of  these
four administrations.  It was absolutely necessary, say	 the
counsel,  to  recreate	the feeling of	security  among	 the
Muslims.   They	 required to be assured of  the	 safety	 and
security of their person and property.	It was not  possible
with the BJP Governments in power.  They had to go.
</p><p id="p_595">431.The	 learned  counsel  for	the  respondents   submitted
further	 that the RSS was banned on December 10, 1992.	 The
Chief Ministers of Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh	were
said  to  be  the members of the RSS  and  adhering  to	 its
tenets.	  In  such circumstances, the  respective  Governors
were of the opinion that the said Chief Ministers cannot  be
expected to, or relied upon to, implement the ban sincerely.
It  cannot  be	said  to be  an	 unreasonable  or  unfounded
opinion.   It  was  also  necessary to	create	a  sense  of
confidence  in the people in general and in the	 minorities,
in particular, that the Governments would be acting promptly
and  sternly  to  prevent  communal  incidents.	   Following
December 6 incident, there were reports of destruction of  a
large  number of temples in the adjoining countries.   These
reports, it was apprehended, may add fuel to the fire.	 The
situation  was deteriorating.  What happened on	 December  6
was  no	 ordinary event.  It had touched the psyche  of	 the
minority  community.  The entire nation was put in  turmoil.
Allowing a party which had consciously and actively  brought
about such a situation to continue in office in these  three
States	would  not  have helped in restoring  the  faith  of
people in general and of the minorities in particular in the
resolve of the Central Government to abide by and  implement
the  constitutional  values of equality,  peace	 and  public
order.	 It is no answer to say that disturbance took  place
on  a much larger scale in certain States ruled by  Congress
(1) Party (in particular in Maharashtra) and that no  action
was   taken   against  those   Governments.    Stating	 the
proposition  in such simplistic terms is neither  acceptable
nor  realistic.	  One  should look at the  totality  of	 the
picture, say the counsel, and not to the isolated  incidents
which took place either before or after the demolition.	  It
is not even a question of punishing the Governments for what
happened on December 6, 1992.  The real question
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_235">294</span>
was  who created this turmoil in the life of the nation	 and
who  put the nation's soul in torment.	The  immediate	need
was  the  restoration  of the faith of	the  people  in	 the
impartiality   of   the	 administration,  in   the   secular
credentials  of the nation and to ensure not only  that	 the
ban  on	 the alleged communal organisations  is	 effectively
implemented but also to ensure that the administration	acts
promptly  and impartially in maintaining the law and  order.
The  Central Government, submitted the counsel,	 acted	with
this  perception and it cannot be said either that the	said
action was outside the purview of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_909">Article 356</a> or that it was
mala  fide  or	that  there was no  material  on  which	 the
President  could be reasonably satisfied that the  dismissal
of these State Governments was indeed called for,  submitted
the   learned	counsel	 for  Union  of	 India	 and   other
respondents.
</p><p id="p_596">432. With a view to demonstrate his submission that judicial
approach and judicial processes are not appropriate to judge
the various situations calling for action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_910">Article 356</a>,
Shri  Parasaran	 gave  the following scenario  :  The  Union
Council	 of Ministers was apprehensive of the safety of	 the
disputed  structure  once  the BJP came to  power  in  Uttar
Pradesh.   It was repeatedly reminding the State  Government
in that behalf.	 All the time, the State Government and	 its
Chief  Minister	 were  assuring	 the  Union  of	 India,	 the
National  Integration  Council and even the  Supreme  Court,
through statements, affidavits and representations that	 the
State Government was committed to the safety of the disputed
structure and that it would ensure that no harm comes to it.
The  Central Government was sceptical of  these	 assurances.
But suppose it had taken action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_911">Article 356</a>, dismissed
the Government of Uttar Pradesh some time prior to  December
6,  1992  on the ground that it did not have  any  faith  in
those assurances, the court could well have found fault with
the  action.   The court would have said that there  was  no
basis  for  their  apprehension when  the  State  Government
itself	represented  by the Chief Minister  and	 other	high
officials  was	repeatedly assuring everyone  including	 the
Supreme	 Court that they will protect the structure.   There
was no reason not to believe them and that the action  taken
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_912">Article 356</a> is, therefore, unjustified,	being  based
upon  mere  suspicion.	 But,  in  the	event,	the  Central
Government  did not take action and the	 disputed  structure
was demolished with enormous consequences and repercussions.
This  only  shows, says Shri Parasaran, that  these  matters
cannot	be  weighed  in	 golden	 scales	 and  that  judicial
approach and assumptions are ill-suited to such situations.
</p><p id="p_597">433. Having  given our earnest consideration to the  matter,
we  are	 of the opinion that the situation  which  arose  in
these States consequent upon the demolition of the  disputed
structure  is one which cannot be assessed properly  by	 the
court.	Shri Parasaran is right in his submission that	what
happened on December 6, 1992 was no ordinary event, that  it
was  the outcome of a sustained campaign carried out over  a
number	of years throughout the country and that it was	 the
result of the speeches, acts and deeds of several leaders of
BJP   and  other  organisations.   The	event  had   serious
repercussions  not  only within the country but	 outside  as
well.  It put
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_236">295</span>
 in  doubt the very secular credentials of this	 nation	 and
its  Government	 and those credentials had to  be  redeemed.
The  situation	had  many  dimensions,	social,	  religious,
political and international.  Rarely do such occasions arise
in the life of a nation.  The situation was an extraordinary
one;  its repercussions could not be foretold at that  time.
Nobody	could  say with definiteness what would	 happen	 and
where?	 The situation was not only unpredictable, it was  a
fast-evolving  one.  The communal situation was	 tense.	  It
could explode anywhere at any time.  On the material  placed
before us, including the reports of the Governors, we cannot
say  that the President had no relevant material before	 him
on  the basis of which he could form the  satisfaction	that
the  BJP  Governments  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan	 and
Himachal  Pradesh  cannot  dissociate  themselves  from	 the
action	and  its consequences and  that	 these	Governments,
controlled  by one and the same party, whose leading  lights
were actively campaigning for the demolition of the disputed
structure, cannot be dissociated from the acts and deeds  of
the  leaders of BJP.  In the then prevailing situation,	 the
Union	of  India  thought  it	necessary  to  ban   certain
organisations including RSS and here were Governments  which
were  headed  by  persons  who	"swore	by  the	 values	 and
traditions  of	the RSS" and were giving "overt	 and  covert
support to the associate communal Organisation" (vide report
of  the	 Governor  of  Madhya  Pradesh).   The	Governor  of
Himachal  Pradesh reported that "the Chief Minister  himself
is  a  member of RSS".	The Governor of	 Rajasthan  reported
that  the ban on RSS and other organisations was  not  being
implemented  because of the intimate connection between	 the
members	 of the Government and those organisations ++.	 The
three Governors also spoke of the part played by the members
of  the	 Government in sending and welcoming  back  the	 kar
sevaks.	   They	 also  expressed  the  opinion	that   these
Governments  cannot  be expected, in the  circumstances,  to
function  objectively  and impartially in dealing  with	 the
emerging law and order situation, which had all the  ominous
makings	 of a communal conflagration.  If the President	 was
satisfied  that	 the faith of these BJP Governments  in	 the
concept	 of secularism was suspect in view of the  acts	 and
conduct of the party controlling these Governments and	that
in  the	 volatile situation that developed pursuant  to	 the
demolition, the Government of these States cannot be carried
on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, we
are not able to say that there was no relevant material upon
which he could be so satisfied.	 The several facts stated in
the counter-affidavits and the material placed before us  by
the  Union  of	India cannot be said  to  be  irrelevant  or
extraneous to the purpose for which the power under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_913">Article
356</a>  is to be exercised.  As pointed out by us supra  (under
the  heading  'Judicial	 Review')  we  cannot  question	 the
correctness  of the material produced and that even if	part
of it is not relevant to the action, we cannot interfere  so
long  as  there	 is some relevant material  to	sustain	 the
action.	   If	the  President	was   satisfied	  that	 the
Governments, which have already acted contrary to one of the
basic features of the
++ The fact that the ban was held to be unsustainable  later
on by the appropriate Tribunal is not relevant while judging
the   situation	  obtaining  in	 the  days   following	 the
demolition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_237">296</span>
<p id="p_598">Constitution,  viz., secularism, cannot be trusted to do  so
in  future, it is not possible to say that in the  situation
then obtaining, he was not justified in believing so.	This
is  precisely the type of situation, which the court  cannot
judge  for  lack of judicially	manageable  standards.	 The
court would be well advised to leave such complex issues  to
the  President	and the Union Council of Ministers  to	deal
with.	It  was	 a situation  full  of	many  imponderables,
nuances, implications and intricacies.	There were too	many
ifs and buts which are not susceptible of judicial scrutiny.
It  is not correct to depict the said Proclamations  as	 the
outcome	 of  political vendetta by the	political  party  in
power  at  the Centre against the other political  party  in
power  in  some	 States.   Probably  in	 such  matters,	 the
ultimate arbiter is the people.	 The appeal should be to the
people	 and  to  people  alone.   The	challenge   to	 the
Proclamation  relating to these three States is,  therefore,
liable to fail.
</p><p id="p_599">434. We may summarise our conclusions now:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_166">	      (1)   <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_914">Article 356</a> of the Constitution  confers
	      a	 power	upon the President to  be  exercised

	      has  arisen  where the Government of  a  State
	      cannot  be carried on in accordance  with	 the
	      provisions  of  the Constitution.	  Under	 our
	      Constitution, the power is really that of	 the
	      Union  Council  of Ministers  with  the  Prime
	      Minister	 at  its  head.	  The	satisfaction
	      contemplated  by the article is subjective  in

	      the  President is a conditioned power.  It  is
	      not  an  absolute	 power.	  The  existence  of
	      material	which may comprise of or include the
	      report(s) of the Governor	 is a pre-condition.
	      The  satisfaction must be formed	on  relevant
	      material.	 The recommendations of the Sarkaria
	      Commission  with	respect to the	exercise  of
	      power  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_916">Article  356</a>  do  merit  serious
	      consideration at the hands of all concerned.
	      (3)   Though  the power of dissolving  of	 the

	      implicit in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_917">Article 356</a>, it must
	      be   held,  having  regard  to   the   overall
	      constitutional scheme that the President shall
	      exercise	it  only after the  Proclamation  is
	      approved	by both Houses of  Parliament  under
	      clause   (3)  and	 not  before.	Until	such
	      approval,	 the President can only suspend	 the
	      Legislative   Assembly   by   suspending	 the
	      provisions  of  Constitution relating  to	 the
	      Legislative  Assembly under sub-clause (c)  of
	      clause  (1).  The dissolution  of	 Legislative
	      Assembly is not a matter of course.  It should

	      adequacy.	  Its  enquiry	is  limited  to	 see
	      whether  the  material  was  relevant  to	 the
	      action.  Even if part of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_239">	      298</span>
	      the  material is irrelevant, the court  cannot
	      interfere	 so long as there is  some  material
	      which is relevant to the action taken.
	      (8)   If	 the   court   strikes	 down	 the
	      Proclamation, it has the power to restore	 the
	      dismissed Government to office and revive	 and
	      reactivate  the Legislative Assembly  wherever
	      it  may  have  been dissolved  or	 kept  under
	      suspension.  In such a case, the court has the
	      power to declare that acts done, orders passed
	      and   laws   made	 during	  the	period	 the
	      Proclamation   was  in  force   shall   remain
	      unaffected  and  be treated  as  valid.	Such
	      declaration,  however, shall not preclude	 the
	      Government/Legislative   Assembly	  or   other
	      competent	 authority  to	review,	 repeal	  or
	      modify such acts, orders and laws.
	      (9)   The Constitution of India has created  a
	      federation  but with a bias in favour  of	 the
	      Centre.	Within	the sphere allotted  to	 the
	      States, they are supreme.

	      of   the	Constitution.	While	freedom	  of
	      religion	is  guaranteed	to  all	 persons  in
	      India,  from the point of view of	 the  State,
	      the  religion, faith or belief of a person  is
	      immaterial.   To the State, all are equal	 and
	      are  entitled  to	 be  treated  equally.	  In
	      matters  of State, religion has no place.	  No
	      political	  party	 can  simultaneously  be   a
	      religious party.	Politics and religion cannot
	      be mixed.	 Any State Government which  pursues
	      unsecular	 policies  or  unsecular  course  of
	      action  acts  contrary to	 the  constitutional
	      mandate and renders itself amenable to  action
