HEADNOTE:
    The	 petitioner who was detained under  the	  Preventive
Detention Act (Act IV of 1950) applied under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_5">Art. 32</a> of	 the
Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus and for his release
from detention, on the ground that the said Act	 contravened
the  provisions of Arts. 13, 19, 21 and 22 of the  Constitu-
tion and was consequently ultra rites and that his detention
was therefore illegal:
     Held,  per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA	 and
DAS  JJ.  (FAZL ALI and MAHAJAN	 JJ.  dissentinq)--that	 the
preventive  Detention Act, 1950, with the exception of	Sec.
14  thereof  did not contravene any of the Articles  of	 the
Constitution  and even though Sec. 14 was ultra rites  inas-
much  as it contravened the provisions of <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_6">Art. 9.9</a><a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_7">,  (5)</a>  of
the  Constitution,  as this section was severable  from	 the
remaining sections of the Act, the invalidity of Sec. 14 did
not  affect  the  validity of the Act as a  whole,  and	 the
detention of the petitioner was not illegal.
     FAZL  ALl and MAHAJAN JJ.--Section 12, of the  Act	 was
also  ultra vires, and since it contravened the very  provi-
sion in the
89
Constitution  under which the Parliament derived its  compe-
tence to enact the law, the detention was illegal.
    Held, by the Full Court (KANIA CJ., FAZL ALI,  PATANJALI
SASTRI,	 MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.)--Section 14 of	 the
Preventive  Detention Act, 1950, contravenes the  provisions
of  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_8">Art. 9.9.</a> (5) of  the  Constitution in so  far   as	  it
prohibits a person detained from disclosing to the Court the
grounds	 on  which a detention order has been  made  or	 the
representation	made by him against the order of  detention,
and is to that extent ultra vires and void.
    Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and
DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI J. dissenting).--<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_9">Article 19</a> of the Consti-
tution has no application to a law which relates directly to
preventive detention even though as a result of an order  of
detention the rights referred to in sub-cls. (a) to (e)	 and
(g) in general, and sub-cl. (d) in particular, of cl. (1) of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_10">Art. 19</a> may be restricted or abridged; and the constitution-
al  validity  of  a law relating to  such  detention  cannot
therefore, be judged in the light of the test prescribed  in
el. (5) of the said Article.
    DAS	 J.--<a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_11">Article 19 (1)</a> postulates a legal	capacity  to
exercise the rights guaranteed by it and if a citizen  loses
the freedom
    of his person by reason of lawful detention as a  result
of a conviction for an offence or otherwise he cannot  claim
the  right s under- sub-cls. (a) to (e) and (g) of  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_12">Art.  19
(1);</a>  likewise if a citizen's property is  compulsorily	 ac-
quired	under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_13">Art. 31</a>, he cannot claim the right under	sub-
el.  (f) of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_14">Art. 19 (1)</a> with respect to that  property.	  In
short the rights under sub-cls. (a) to (e) and (g) end where
lawful	detention  begins and therefore the  validity  of  a
preventive detention Act cannot be judged by Arc. 19 (5).
MAHAJAN	 J.---Whatever be the precise scope of <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_15">Art.  19	 (1)
(d)</a> and <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_16">Art.19(5)</a> the provisions of <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_17">Art. 19(5)</a> do not  apply
to  a  law relating to preventive  detention,  inasmuch	  as
'there	is  a special self-contained provision	in  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_18">Art.  22</a>
regulating it.
    FAZL ALI.J.--Preventive detention is a direct  infringe-
ment  of the right guaranteed in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_19">Art. 19 (1) (d</a>), even if  a
narrow construction is placed on the said sub-clause,  and a
law	relating     to	    preventive	   detention	  is
therefore  subject  to such limited judicial  review  as  is
permitted by <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_20">Art. 19 (5).</a>
     Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.
(FAZL ALl J. dissenting).--The concept of the right "to move
freely	 throughout  the  territory  of	 India" referred  to
in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_21">Art. 19 (1) (d</a>), of the Constitution is entirely  differ-
ent  from  the concept of the right  to	 "personal  liberty"
referred  to in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_22">Art. 21</a>, and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_23">Art. 19</a> should not,  therefore,
be  read  as controlled by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_24">Art.  21.</a>	 The
view that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_25">Art. 19</a> guarantees substantive rights and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_26">Art.  21</a>
prescribes  the procedure is incorrect. DAs  J.--<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_27">Article  19</a>
protects some of the important attributes of personal liber-
ty as independent rights and the expression "personal liber-
ty" is used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_28">Art. 21</a> as a compendious term
90
including   within   Rs	 meaning all  varieties	  of  rights
which go to make up the personal liberties of men.
  FAZL	ALl J.--Even if it be assumed that <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_29">Art. 19  (1)	 (d)</a>
does not refer to " personal liberty" and that it bears	 the
restricted meaning attributed to it,that is to say, R signi-
fies merely the right to move from one locality to  another,
preventive  detention  must be held to affect  this  limited
right  of movement directly and substantially.	One  of	 the
objects	 of  preventive detention is to	 restrain  a  person
detained from moving from place to place so that he may	 not
spread	disaffection or indulge in dangerous  activities  in
the places he visits.  The same consideration applies to the
cases  of  persons  who are interned  or  externed.   Hence,
externment, interment and certain other forms of restriction
on  movement  have always been treated	as  kindred  matters
belonging  to the same group or family, and the	 rule  which
applies to one must necessarily apply to the others.
    Per KANIA C. J ,, PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS 35.  (MAHAJAN
3. dissenting).--<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_30">Article 22</a> does not form a complete code of
constitutional safeguards relating to preventive  detention.
To the extent that provision is made in <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_31">Art. 9.9</a>, it  cannot
be controlled by <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_32">Art. 9</a><a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_33">,1;</a> but on points of procedure  which
expressly or by necessary implication are not dealt with  by
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_34">Art.  22</a>,  <a href="/doc/1507561/" id="a_35">Art. 9.1</a> will apply.	 DAS  J.--Art.	21  protects
substantive  rights by requiring a procedure and  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_36">Art.	9.9.</a>
lays  down  the	 minimum rules of procedure  that  even	 the
Parliament cannot abrogate or overlook. MAHAJAN J.--Art. 99.
contains a self-contained code of constitutional  safeguards
relating  to preventive detention and cannot be examined  or
controlled  by	the provisions of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_37">Art. 21.</a>   The  principles
underlying  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_38">Art. 21</a> are however kept in view in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_39">Art. 22</a>	 and
there  is no conflict between these articles.  MUKHERJEA  J.
--Even	assuming that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_40">Art. 22</a> is not a	self-contained	code
relating  to  preventive detention and that  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_41">Art.  21</a>  would
apply,	it is .not permissible to supplement <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_42">Art. 22</a> by	 the
application  of rules of natural justice. FAZL ALI  J.--Art.
22.  does not form an exhaustive code by itself relating  to
preventive  detention.	Parliament can make  further  provi-
sions  and if it has done so <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_43">Art. 19 (5)</a> may be	 applied  to
see  if	 those provisions have transgressed  the  bounds  of
reasonableness.
   Per	KANIA C.J., MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI J.	dis-
senting).--In <a href="/doc/1507561/" id="a_44">Art. 9.1</a> the word	 'law" has been used in	 the
sense  of State-made law and not as an equivalent of law  in
the  abstract or general sense embodying the  principles  of
natural	 justice; and "procedure established by	 law"  means
procedure  established by law made by the State, that is  to
say, the Union Parliament or the Legislatures of the States.
It is not proper to construe this expression in the light of
the meaning given to.the expression "due process of law"  in
the  American Constitution by the Supreme Court of  America.
FATANJALI  SASTRI cl.-- "Law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_45">Art. 21</a> does not  mean	 the
jus naturale of civil law but means
91
positive or State-made law.  "Procedure established by	law"
does not however mean any procedure which may be  prescribed
by  a  competent legislature, but the  ordinary	 well-estab-
lished	criminal procedure, i.e., those settled. usages	 and
normal modes of procedure sanctioned by the Criminal  Proce-
dure Code, which is  the  general  law	of  criminal  proce-
dure   in  this country. The only alternative to  this	con-
struction, if a constitutional transgression is to be avoid-
ed  is	to interpret the reference to "law"  as	 implying  a
constitutional	'amendment pro tanto, for it is only  a	 law
enacted	 by the procedure provided for such  amendment	that
could modify or override a fundamental right without contra-
vening <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_46">Art. 13 (2).</a>
    FAZL, ALI J.--There is nothing revolutionary in the view
that  "procedure established by law "must include  the	four
principles of elementary justice which inhere in and are  at
the  root  of all civilized systems of law, and	 which	have
been stated by the American Courts and jurists as consisting
in  (1) notice, (2) opportunity to be heard,  (3)  impartial
tribunal  and  (4) orderly course of procedure.	 These	four
principles  are really different aspects of the same  right,
namely, the right to be heard before one is condemned. Hence
the  words  "procedure established by law  ",  whatever	 its
exact  meaning	be, must necessarily include  the  principle
that  no  person shall be condemned without  hearing  by  an
impartial tribunal.
    Per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN	 and
DAS  JJ.--Section 3 of the Preventive Detention	 Act,  1950,
does  not  delegate any legislative power  to  an  executive
officer	 but merely confers on such officer a discretion  to
enforce	 the law made by the legislature, and is not  there-
fore invalid on this ground.  The fact that the section does
not  provide an objective standard for	determining  whether
the  requirements of law have been complied with, is  not  a
ground for holding that it is invalid. FAZL ALI J.---Section
3 is however a reasonable provision only for the first step,
i.e., for arrest and initial detention and must be  followed
by  some  procedure  for testing  the  so-called  subjective
satisfaction, which can be done only by providing a suitable
machinery  for examining the grounds on which the  order  of
detention is made and considering the representations of the
persons detained in relation to those grounds.
    Per KANIA C. J., MAHAJAN and DAS JJ.---Section 7 of	 the
said  Act is not invalid merely because it does not  provide
for  an oral hearing or an opportunity to lead evidence	 but
only gives right to make a representation.  Right to an oral
hearing	 and  right  to give evidence  are  not	 necessarily
implied in the right to make a representation given by	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_47">Art.
22.</a>
    Per KANIA C.J., and MAHAJAN J.--The provision  contained
in Sec. 11 that a person may be detained for such period  as
the
12-A
92
State  thinks fit does not contravene <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_48">Art. 22 (7)</a> and it  is
not therefore invalid.
    Per	 KANIA. C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA  and	 DAS
JJ.  (FAZL ALI and MAHAJAN JJ. dissenting).--<a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_49">Article 22	 (7)</a>
means that Parliament may prescribe either the circumstances
under  which, or the class or classes of cases in  which,  a
person may be detained for a period longer than three months
without reference to an advisory board. It is not  necessary
that  the  Parliament should prescribe	both.	The  matters
referred  to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-see. (1) of	Sec.
12 constitute a sufficient description of such circumstances
or classes of cases and Section 12 is not therefore open  to
the objection that it does not comply with <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_50">Art. 22 (7)</a>	 DAS
J.--Parliament	has in act and substance prescribed both  in
clauses (a) and (b) of sub-sec. (1) of Sec. 12.
     FAZL ALI and MAJAN JJ.--<a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_51">Article 22 (7)</a> Means that	both
the  circumstances and the class or classes of cases  (which
are  two different expressions with different  meanings	 and
connotations) should be prescribed, and the prescription  of
one  without the other will not be enough.  The	 enumeration
of  the subjects for reasons connected with which a  law  of
preventive detention could be made contained in els. (a) and
(b) of sub-see. (1) of Sec.12 does not amount to prescribing
the  circumstances under which, or the class or	 classes  of
cases in which, a person can be detained for more than three
months.
    Per	 KANIA	C.J.--While it is not proper  to  take	into
consideration the individual opinions of members of  Parlia-
ment  or Convention to construe the meaning of a  particular
clause,	 when a question is raised whether a certain  phrase
or  expression	was up for consideration at all	 or  not,  a
reference  to  the  debates may	 be  permitted.	  PATANJAYLI
SASTRI J.--In construing the provisions of an Act,  speeches
made  in the course of the debates on the bill	should	 not
be  taken  into consideration.	MUKHERJEA J.--In  construing
the  Constitution it is better to leave out of	account	 the
debates in the Constituent Assembly, but a higher value	 may
be placed on the report of the Drafting Committee.

<p id="p_26">    1950. May 19.  The following Judgments were delivered.
    KANIA  C. J--This is a petition by the  applicant  under
<a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_56">article	 32 (1)</a> of the Constitution of India for a  writ  of
habeas corpus against his detention in the Madras Jail.	  In
the  petition he has given various dates showing how he	 has
been under detention since December, 1947.  Under the  ordi-
nary Criminal Law he was sentenced to terms of	imprisonment
but  those convictions were set aside.	While he  was  tires
under detention under one of the orders of the Madras  State
Government, on the 1st of March, 1950, he was served with an
order  made under <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_57">section 3</a> (1) of the Preventive  Detention
Act,   IV of 1950.  He challenges the legality of the  order
as  it	is  contended that Act IV of  1950  contravenes	 the
provisions  of articles 13, 19 and 21 and the provisions  of
that  Act are not in accordance with <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_58">article 22</a> of the	Con-
stitution.  He has also challenged the validity of the order
on  the ground that it is issued mala fide.  The  burden  of
proving that allegation is on the applicant.  Because of the
penal  provisions  of  <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_59">section 14</a> of the  impugned  Act	 the
applicant  has not disclosed the grounds, supplied  to	him,
for  his  detention and the question of mala  fides  of	 the
order therefore cannot be gone into under this petition.
    The	 question  of  the validity of Act IV  of  1950	 was
argued before us at great length.  This is the first case in
which  the different articles of the Constitution  of  India
contained in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights has come	 for
discussion before us.  The Court is indebted to the  learned
counsel for the applicant and the Attorney-General for their
assistance in interpreting the true meaning of the  relevant
clauses of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_27">    In	order  to  appreciate the rival	 contentions  it  is
useful	first  to  bear in mind the general  scheme  of	 the
Constitution.	Under  <a href="/doc/1597349/" id="a_60">article 53</a> of  the  Constitution	 the
executive power of the Union is vested in the President	 and
is to be exercised by him in accordance with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">96</span>
Constitution either directly or through officers subordinate
to  him.   The legislative powers of the Union	are  divided
between the Parliament and Legislatures of the States.	 The
ambit  and limitations on their respective powers are  found
in  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_61">article 246</a> read with <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_62">article 245</a>, Schedule	 VII,  Lists
1,2  and 3 of the Constitution. For the Union of  India	 the
Supreme Court is established and its powers and jurisdiction
are  set out in articles 124 to 147.  This follows the	pat-
tern  of  the Government of India Act, 1935, which  was	 the
previous  Constitution of the Government of  India.   Unlike
the  American Constitution, there is no article vesting	 the
judicial  power of the Union of India in the Supreme  Court.
The  material points substantially altering the edifice	 are
first  in  the	Preamble which declares	 india	a  Sovereign
Democratic  Republic to secure to all its citizens  justice,
liberty and equality and to promote among them all,  frater-
nity.  Part III of the Constitution is an important  innova-
tion.  It is headed "Fundamental Rights."  In that Part	 the
word  "State" includes both the Government of the Union	 and
the Government of the States. By <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_63">article 13</a> it is  expressly
provided  that all laws in force in the territory of  India,
immediately before the commencement of the Constitution,  in
so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of	this
Part, to the extent of such inconsistency, are void.  There-
fore, all laws in operation in India on the day the  Consti-
tution	came  into  force, unless otherwise  saved,  to	 the
extent they are inconsistent with this Chapter on  Fundamen-
tal Rights, become automatically void. Under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_64">article 13	 (2)</a>
provision  is  made for legislation after  the	Constitution
comes  into operation. It is there provided that  the  State
shall  not  make any law which takes away  or  abridges	 the
rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contraven-
tion  of this clause shall to the extent of  the  contraven-
tion,  be  void.  Therefore, as regards	 future	 legislation
also the Fundamental Rights in Part III have to be respected
and, unless otherwise saved by the provisions of the Consti-
tution, they will be void to the extent they contravene	 the
provisions of Part III.	 Under <a href="/doc/369702/" id="a_65">article 245 (1)</a> the  legisla-
tive powers conferred under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">97</span>
<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_66">article 246</a> are also made "subject to the provisions of this
Constitution,"	which  of course includes Part	III  dealing
with the Fundamental Rights.  The term law in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_67">article 13</a>, is
expressed  to  be wide enough to include  Acts,	 Ordinances,
Orders,	 Bye-laws,  Rules, Regulations and  even  custom  or
usage  having, in the territory of India, the force of	law.
The rest of this Part is divided in seven divisions.  "Right
to Equality" is found in articles 14-18, "Eight to  Freedom"
in articles 19-22, "Right against Exploitation" in  articles
23 and 24, "Right to Freedom of Religion" in articles 25-28,
"Cultural  and	Educational Rights" in articles 29  and	 30,
"Right	to Property" in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_68">article 31</a> and "Right  to  Constitu-
tional	Remedies"  in articles 32-35.  In this case  we	 are
directly concerned only with the articles under the  caption
"Right	to  Freedom" (19-22) and <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_69">article 32</a>  which  gives  a
remedy	to enforce, the rights conferred by this Part.	 The
rest  of  the articles may have to be referred	to  only  to
assist	in the interpretation of the  above-mentioned  arti-
cles.
</p><p id="p_28">    It	is  obvious that by the insertion of this  Part	 the
powers	of  the Legislature and the Executive, both  of	 the
Union  and the States,	are further curtailed and the  right
to  enforce  the Fundamental Rights found in Part III  by  a
direct application to the Supreme Court is removed from	 the
legislative  control.  The wording of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_70">article 32</a> shows	that
the  Supreme Court can be moved to grant a suitable  relief,
mentioned  in <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_71">article 32 (2</a>), only in respect of the  Funda-
mental Rights mentioned in Part III of the Constitution.
    The petitioner is detained under a preventive  detention
order,	made under Act IV of 1950, which has been passed  by
the  Parliament	 of India.  In the Seventh Schedule  of	 the
Constitution,	List I contains entries specifying items  in
respect	 of which the Parliament has  exclusive	 legislative
powers.	  Entry 9 is in these terms:  "preventive  detention
for  reasons connected with Defence, Foreign Affairs or	 the
Security  of  India; persons subjected to  such	 detention."
List  III of that Schedule enumerates topics on	 which	both
the Union and the States have concurrent legislative
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">98</span>
powers.	 Entry 3 of that List is in these terms: "Preventive
detention  for	reasons	 connected with the  security  of  a
State, the maintenance of public order or the maintenance of
supplies  and services essential to the	 community;  persons
subjected to such detention." It is not disputed that Act IV
of  1950 is covered by these two Entries in List I and	List
III  of the Seventh Schedule.  The contention of  the  peti-
tioner	is  that the impugned legislation  abridges  or	 in-
fringes	 the rights given by articles 19-21 and is also	 not
in accordance with the permissive legislation on  preventive
detention  allowed  under  articles 22 (4) and	(7)  and  in
particular  is an infringement of the provisions of  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_72">article
22  (5).</a>   It is therefore necessary to consider  in  detail
each of these articles and the arguments advanced in respect
thereof.
</p><p id="p_29">    <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_73">Article  19</a> is for the protection of certain  rights  of
freedom to citizens.  It runs as follows :--
</p><p id="p_30">   "19. (1)--All citizens shall have the right-(a) to  free-
dom of speech and expression;
</p><p id="p_31">(b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;
</p><p id="p_32">   (c)	to form associations or unions;
</p><p id="p_33">   (d)	to move freely throughout the territory of
	India;
</p><p id="p_34">   (e)	to reside and settle in any part of the
	territory of India;
</p><p id="p_35">   (f)	to acquire, hold and dispose of property;
	and
</p><p id="p_36">   (g)	to practise any profession, or to carry on
	any occupation, trade or business.
</p><p id="p_37">    "(2)  Nothing  in  sub-clause (a) of  clause  (1)  shall
affect	the  operation of any existing law in so far  as  it
relates to, or prevent the State from making any law  relat-
ing to, libel, slander, defamation, contempt of court or any
matter	which offends against decency or morality  or  which
undermines  the	 security  of, or tends	 to  overthrow,	 the
State.
</p><p id="p_38">    (3)	 Nothing in sub-clause (b) of the said clause  shall
affect	the  operation of any existing law in so far  as  it
imposts, or prevent the State from making any law  imposing,
in the interests of public order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">99</span>
reasonable  restrictions on the exercise of the	 right	con-
ferred by the said sub-clause.
</p><p id="p_39">    (4)	 Nothing in sub-clause (c) of the said clause  shall
affect	the  operation of any existing law in so far  as  it
imposes, or prevent the State from making any law  imposing,
in  the	 interests of public order or  morality,  reasonable
restrictions  on the exercise of the right conferred by	 the
said sub-clause.
</p><p id="p_40">    (5) Nothing in sub-clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the	said
clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in  so
far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any	 law
imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any  of
the  rights conferred by the said sub-clauses either in	 the
interests of the general public or for the protection of the
interests of any Scheduled Tribe.
</p><p id="p_41">    (6)	 Nothing in sub-clause (g) of the said clause  shall

clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in  so
far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe,
or  prevent  the State from making any	law  prescribing  or
empowering  any authority to prescribe, the professional  or
technical  qualifications necessary for practising any	pro-
fession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business."
</p><p id="p_42">    Clause (2) specifies the limits up to which the abridge-
ment- of the right contained in 19 (1) (a) may be permitted.
it is an exception.  Similarly clause (3) sets out the limit
of  abridgement	 of the right in 19 (1) (b) and	 clause	 (4)
specifies such limits in respect of the right in 19 (1) (c).
Clause	(5) is in respect of the rights mentioned in 19	 (1)
</p><p id="p_43">(d), (e) and (f) and clause (6) is in respect of the  rights
contained  in  19 (1) (g). It cannot be	 disputed  that	 the
articles collected under the caption "Right to Freedom" have
to  be considered together to appreciate the extent  of	 the
Fundamental  Rights.  In the first place it is necessary  to
notice that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">100</span>
there is a distinction between rights given to citizens	 and
persons.   This is clear on a perusal of the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_74">article 19</a> on the one hand and articles 20, 21 and 22 on the
other.	In order to determine whether a right is abridged or
infringed  it is first necessary to determine the extent  of
the  right  given by the articles and the  limitations	pre-
scribed	 in the articles themselves permitting its  curtail-
ment.	The inclusion of <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_75">article 13 (1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_76">(2)</a> in the	Con-
stitution appears to be a matter of abundant caution.	Even
in  their  absence,  if any of the  fundamental	 rights	 was
infiringed  by	any  legislative enactment,  the  Court	 has
always the power to declare the enactment, to the extent  it
transgresses the limits, invalid.  The existence of  <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_77">article
13 (1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_78">(2)</a> in the Constitution therefore is not material
for the decision of the question what fundamental right is
given  and to what extent it is permitted to be abridged  by
the Constitution itself.
</p><p id="p_44">    As the preventive detention order results in the  deten-
tion  of  the applicant in a cell it was  contended  on	 his
behalf that the rights specified in <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_79">article 19 (1) (a</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_80">), (b</a>),
</p><p id="p_45">(c),  (d), (e) and (g) have been infringed.  It	 was  argued
that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to
speech	as  and where he desired and the same  argument	 was
urged  in  respect of the rest of the  rights  mentioned  in
sub-clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g). Although this  argu-
ment  is  advanced  in a case which  deals  with  preventive
detention,  if correct, it-should be applicable in the	case
of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of
imprisonment under the relevant section<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_81"> of the Indian  Penal
Code</a>.  So considered, the argument must clearly be rejected.
In spite of the saving clauses (2)to(6) permitting  abridge-
ment  of  the rights connected with each of  them,  punitive
detention  under several sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_82"> of the Penal	Code</a>,  e.g.,
for theft, cheating, forgery and even ordinary assault, will
be  illegal.   'Unless such conclusion	necessarily  follows
from  the  article,  it is obvious  that  such	construction
should	be avoided.  In my opinion, such result	 is  clearly
not the outcome of the Constitution.  The article has to  be
read without any pre-conceived notions.	 So read, it clearly
means
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">101</span>
that  the  legislation to be examined must  be	directly  in
respect	 of one of the rights mentioned in  the	 subclauses.
If  there is a legislation directly attempting to control  a
citizen's  freedom of speech or expression, or his right  to
assemble  peaceably  and without arms,	etc.,  the  question
whether	 that  legislation is saved by the  relevant  saving
clause of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_83">article 19</a> will arise.  If, however, the  legisla-
tion  is not directly in respect of any of  these  subjects,
but as a result of the operation of other legislation,	 for
instance,   for punitive or preventive detention, his  right
under  any of these subclauses is abridged, the question  of
the  application  of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_84">article 19</a> does not  arise.   The	true
approach is only to consider the directness of the  legisla-
tion and not what will be the result of the detention other-
wise  valid,  on the mode of the detenue's  life.   On	that
short  ground,	in my opinion, this argument about  the	 in-
fringement of the rights mentioned in <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_85">article 19 (1)</a>  gener-
ally must fail.	 Any other construction put on the  article,
it seems to me. will be unreasonable.
</p><p id="p_46">    It	was  next urged that while this	 interpretation	 may
meet  the contention in respect of rights under	 <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_86">article  19
(1)  (a</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_87">), (b</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_88">), (c</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_89">), (e)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_90">(g</a>), the right given by  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_91">article
19  (1)	 (d)</a> is left untouched.	 That  sub-clause  expressly
gives the right "to move freely throughout the territory  of
India."	 It was argued that by the confinement of the  peti-
tioner	under  the preventive detention order his  right  to
move  freely throughout the territory of India	is  directly
abridged  and  therefore the State must	 show that  the	 im-
pugned	legislation imposes only reasonable restrictions  on
the  exercise of that right in the interests of the  general
public or for the protection of the interests of any  Sched-
uled  Tribe,  under <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_92">article 19 (5).</a>  The Court is  thus	 en-
joined	to  inquire whether the	 restrictions	imposed	  on
the  detained person are reasonable in the interests of	 the
general	 public.  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_93">Article 14</a> of the Constitution  gives	 the
right to equality in these terms:
</p><p id="p_47">    "The State shall not deny to any person equality  before
the  law  or  the equal protection of the  laws	 within	 the
territory of India."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">102</span>
<p id="p_48">    It	was argued that the words "within the  territory  of
India"	are unnecessary in that article because the  Parlia-
ment  is  supreme  to make laws operative  only	 within	 the
territory  of India.  Without those words also	the  article
will bear the same meaning. Similarly, it was urged that the
words  "territory  of India" in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_94">article 19 (1)	(d)</a>  may  be
treated as superfluous, and preventive detention would	thus
be an abridgement of the right to move freely.	In my  opin-
ion,  this rule of construction itself is  faulty.   Because
certain	 words may be considered superfluous (assuming	them
to  be. so in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_95">article 14</a> for the present discussion)  it  is
quite improper to assume that they are superfluous  wherever
found  in the rest of the Constitution. On the contrary,  in
my  opinion,  reading sub-clause (d) as	 a whole  the  words
"territory of  India" are  very important. What is sought to
be protected by that sub-clause is the right to freedom	  of
movement,  i.e., without restriction, throughout the  terri-
tory of India.	Read with their natural grammatical..  mean-
ing  the  sub-clause only means that  if   restrictions	 are
sought	to be put upon movement of a citizen from  State  to
State or even within a State  such restrictions will have to
be tested  by the permissive limits prescribed in clause (5)
of  that  Article.  Sub-clause (d) has nothing	to  do	with
detention,  preventive or punitive. The	  Constitution	men-
tions a right to freedom of movement throughout the territo-
ry  of	India, Every word of that clause must be  given	 its
true  and  legitimate meaning and in the construction  of  a
Statute,  particularly	a Constitution, it is  improper.  to
omit  any  word which  has a reasonable and proper place  in
it or to  refrain from giving effect to its meaning.	This
position  is made quite clear when clause (5) is read  along
with this sub-clause. It permits the imposition of  reasona-
ble.  restrictions on the exercise of such right  either  in
the  interest of general public or the	protection   of	 the
interest of any Scheduled Tribe. It is difficult to conceive
of  a  reasonable restriction necessary in the interests  of
the  general public for confining a person in a	 cell.	Such
restriction  may  be appropriate to prevent  a	person	from
going from one Province to another or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">103</span>
one  area  to  another, having regard  to  local  conditions
prevailing  in particular areas.  The point however is	made
abundantly  clear by the alternative, viz., for the  protec-
tion  of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. What  protec-
tion  of  the interests of a Scheduled	Tribe  requires	 the
confinement  of a man in a cell ?  On the other	 hand,	pre-
venting the movement of a person from one part of the terri-
tory  of  India to another and the  question  of  reasonable
restriction imposed to protect the interests of a  Scheduled
Tribe  is  clearly  intelligible and often  noticed  in	 the
course	of  the administration of  the	country.   Scheduled
Tribes	have certain rights, privileges and  also  disabili-
ties.  They have their own civilization, customs and mode of
life and prevention of contact with persons or groups with a
particular Scheduled Tribe  may be   considered	 undesirable
during a certain time or in certain conditions.	 The  legis-
lative	history	 of India shows that Scheduled	Tribes	have
been  given  a	separate place on  these  grounds.   Reading
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_96">article	  19</a> as a whole, therefore, it seems to me  that  it
has no application to a legislation dealing with  preventive
or punitive detention as its direct object.  I may point out
that  the  acceptance of the petitioner's  argument  on	 the
interpretation of this clause will result in the Court being
called	upon  to decide upon the reasonableness	 of  several
provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_97"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> and several other  penal
legislations  as  abridging this right.	 Even  under  clause
(5), the Court is permitted to apply the test of reasonable-
ness  of the restrictions or limits not generally, but	only
to the extent they are either in the interests of the gener-
al public, e.g., in case of an epidemic, riot, etc., or	 for
the protection of the interests of any	Scheduled Tribe.  In
my  opinion, this is not the intention of the  Constitution.
Therefore  the	contention urged in respect  of	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_98">article  19</a>
fails.
</p><p id="p_49">    It	was argued that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_99">article 19</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_100">article 21</a> should  be
read  together as implementing each other. <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_101">Article  19</a>	gave
substantive  rights to citizens while <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_102">article 21</a>  prescribed
that  no  person can be deprived of his	 life  and  personal
liberty except by procedure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">104</span>
established  by	 law.  Even so, on a  true  construction  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_103">article 19</a>, it seems to me that both preventive and punitive
detention are outside the scope of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_104">article 19.</a>
    In	order to appreciate the true scope of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_105">article 19</a>  it
is useful to read it by itself and then to  consider how far
the other articles in Part HI affect or control its meaning.
It  is	the  first  article  under  the	 caption  "Right  to
Freedom	 ."  It gives the rights mentioned in 19 (1) (a)  to
</p><p id="p_50">(g)  to all citizens of India.	These rights read  by  them-
selves	and apart from the controls found in clauses (2)  to
(6)  of	 the  same article, specify  the  different  general
rights	which a free citizen  in a democratic country  ordi-
narily has.  Having specified those rights, each of them  is
considered  separately from the point of view of  a  similar
right  in  the	other citizens, and also after	taking	into
consideration  the  principle that individual  liberty	must
give  way, to the extent it is necessary, when the  good  or
safety	 of   the people generally is  concerned.  Thus	 the
right  to  freedom of speech and expression is given by	  19
(1) (a). But clause (2)	 provides that such right shall	 not
prevent	 the  operation	 of a law which	 relates  to  libel,
slander,  defamation, contempt of Court or any matter  which
offends against decency or morality or which undermines	 the
security  of, or tends to overthrow, the State.	 Clause	 (2)
thus  only emphasizes that while the individual citizen	 has
a free	right of  speech or expression, he cannot be permit-
ted  to use the same to the detriment of a similar right  in
another citizen or to the detriment of the State.  Thus, all
laws of libel, slander, contempt of Court or laws in respect
of  matters  which offend against decency  or  morality	 are
reaffirmed to be operative in spite of this individual right
of  the citizen to freedom of speech and expression.   Simi-
larly;	that  right is also subject to	laws  which  prevent
undermining the security of the State or against  activities
which  tend  to overthrow the State. A similar	analysis  of
clauses	 f3) and (4) shows similar restrictions	 imposed  on
similar	 grounds.  In the same way clause (5)  also  permits
reasonable  restrictions  in the exercise of  the  right  to
freedom	 of movement throughout the territory of India,	 the
right to reside and settle in any part of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">105</span>
territory of India or the right to acquire, hold and dispose
of  property, being imposed by law provided such  reasonable
restrictions on the exercise of such right are in the inter-
est  of the general' public.  The Constitution further	pro-
vides  by the same clause that similar	reasonable  restric-
tions  could be put on the exercise of those rights for	 the
protection  of the interest of a Scheduled Tribe.   This  is
obviously  to prevent an argument being advanced that  while
such  restriction  could be put in the interest	 of  general
public, the  Constitution  did not provide  for the  imposi-
tion  of  such	restriction to protect the  interests  of  a
smaller group of people only. Reading <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_106">article 19</a> in that way
as a whole the only concept appears to be that the specified
rights	of  a free citizen arc thus controlled by  what	 the
framers of the Constitution thought were necessary  restric-
tions in the interest of the rest of the citizens.
    Reading <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_107">article 19</a> in that way it appears to me that the
concept of the right to move freely throughout	the territo-
ry of India is an entirely  different concept from the right
to "personal liberty" contemplated by  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_108">article 21.</a>  "Person-
al  liberty"  covers many more rights in one sense and has a
restricted  meaning in another sense.  For  instance,  while
the right to move or reside may be covered by the expression
,'personal  liberty"  the right to freedom of  speech  (men-
tioned in <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_109">article 19 (1) (a))</a> or the right to acquire,	hold
or  dispose of property (mentioned in 19 (1) (f)) cannot  be
considered  a  part of the personal liberty  of	 a  citizen.
They  form part of the liberty of a citizen but the  limita-
tion imposed by the word "personal"leads me to believe	that
those  rights  are not covered by  the	expression  personal
liberty.   So read there is no conflict between articles  19
and 21. The contents and subject matters of articles  19 and
21  are thus not the same and they proceed to deal with	 the
rights	covered	 by  their respective  words  from   totally
different  angles.  As already mentioned in respect of	each
of  the	 rights specified in sub-clauses of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_110">article  19	 (1)</a>
specific  limitations in respect of each is provided,  while
the expression "personal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">106</span>
liberty" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_111">article 21</a> is generally controlled by the gener-
al expression "procedure established by law." The  Constitu-
tion,	in   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_112">article  19</a>,  and	also  in other	articles  in
Part III, thus attempts to strike a balance between individ-
ual  liberty  and the general interest of the  society.	 The
restraints  provided by the Constitution on the	 legislative
powers or the executive authority of the State thus  operate
as guarantees of life and personal liberty of the  individu-
als.
</p><p id="p_51">    Deprivation	 (total	 loss) of  personal  liberty,  which
inter alia includes the right to eat or sleep when one likes
or to work or not to work as and when one pleases and sever-
al  such  rights sought to be protected	 by  the  expression
"personal  liberty" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_113">article 21</a>, is quite  different	from
restriction  (which is only a partial control) of the  right
to  move  freely  (which is relatively a minor	right  of  a
citizen) as safeguarded by <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_114">article 19 (1) (d).</a>	 Deprivation
of personal liberty has not the same meaning as	 restriction
of free	 movement in the territory of  India.	This is made
clear when the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_115"> of the Criminal Procedure Code</a>  in
Chapter VIII relating to security of peace or maintenance of
public	order  are read.  Therefore <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_116">article  19	 (5)</a>  cannot
apply to a  substantive law  depriving a citizen of personal
liberty.  I am unable to accept the contention that the word
"deprivation"  includes within its scope "restriction"	when
interpreting  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_117">article 21.</a>  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_118">Article 22</a> envisages the  law  of
preventive   detention.	  So  does <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_119">article  9.46</a>  read	with
Schedule  Seven,  List I, Entry 9, and List  III,  Entry  3.
Therefore,  when  the subject of preventive   detention	  is
specifically   dealt   with in the  Chapter  on	 Fundamental
Rights I do not think it is proper  to	consider  a legisla-
tion ' permitting preventive detention as in conflict	with
the   rights  mentioned in <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_120">article 19 (1).</a>  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_121">Article  19	 (1)</a>
does  not  purport  to cover all aspects of  liberty  or  of
personal  liberty.  In that article only certain  phases  of
liberty are dealt with.	 "Personal  liberty" would primarily
mean  liberty of the physical body.  The rights given  under
<a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_122">article 19 (1)</a> do not directly come under that	description.
They are rights which accompany the freedom  or	 liberty  of
the person.   By their very
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">107</span>
nature	they are freedoms of a person assumed to be in	full
possession  of	his  personal  liberty.	 If <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_123">article  19</a>	  is
considered   to	   be	 the	only  article	safeguarding
personal   liberty   several well-recognised rights, as	 for
instance,  the	right to eat or drink, the  right  to  work,
play, swim and numerous other rights and activities and even
the  right to life will not be deemed  protected  under	 the
Constitution.  I  do not think that is	the  intention.	  It
seems to me improper to read <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_124">article 19</a> as dealing with	 the
same  subject  as <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_125">article 21.</a>  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_126">Article 19</a> gives	 the  rights
specified therein only to the citizens of India while  arti-
cle  21 is applicable to all persons.  The word	 citizen  is
expressly  defined  in the Constitution to indicate  only  a
certain section of the inhabitants of India.  Moreover,	 the
protection  given by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_127">article  21</a> is very general.  It is  of
"law"--whatever that expression is interpreted to mean.	 The
legislative  restrictions  on the law-making powers  of	 the
legislature are not here prescribed in detail as in the case
of the rights specified in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_128">article 19.</a> In my opinion  there-
fore article should be read as a separate complete article.
    <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_129">Article  21</a> which is also in Part III under the  caption
"Right to Freedom" runs as follows :-
</p><p id="p_52">    "No	 person	 shall be deprived of his life	or  personal
liberty	 except	  according  to	  procedure  established  by
law."
</p><p id="p_53">    This article has been strongly relied upon by the  peti-
tioner in support of his contention that the impugned Act is
ultra vires the Parliament as it abridges the right given by
this   article	to every person.  It was argued	 that  under
the Constitution of the United States of America the  corre-
sponding  provision is found in the 5th and 14th  Amendments
where the provision,  inter alia,  is "that no person  shall
be deprived of his life or liberty or property except by due
process	 of law."  It was contended for the petitioner	that
the  Indian Constitution gives the same protection to  every
person	in  India, except that in the  'United	States	"due
process	 of law" has been .construed by its  Supreme   Court
to  cover both
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">108</span>
substantive  and  procedural law, while in  India  only	 the
protection of procedural law is guaranteed.  It was contend-
ed that the omission of the word "due" made no difference to
the  interpretation  of the words in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_130">article  21.</a>  The	word
"established"' was not equivalent to "prescribed".  It had a
wider  meaning.	  The word "law" did not  mean	enacted	 law
because that will be no 'legislative protection at all.	  If
so construed, any Act passed by the Parliament or the  State
Legislature,  which  was otherwise  within  its	 legislative
power,	 can  destroy or abridge this right.   On  the	same
line of reasoning, it was argued that if that was the inten-
tion  there was no necessity to put this as   a	 fundamental
right  in  Part III at all. As to the meaning  of  the	word
"law" it was  argued  that  it	meant principles of  natural
justice.    It	meant  "jus",  i.e.,   law in  the  abstract
sense of the principles of natural justice, as mentioned  in
standard works of Jurisprudence, and not "lex", i.e., enact-
ed law.	  Against the contention that such construction will
leave the meaning vague, it was argued that four  principles
of  natural  justice recognised in all	civilized  countries
were  covered,	in any event, by the word "law".  They	are:
(1) An objective test, i.e., a certain, definite and  ascer-
tainable  rule of human conduct for the violation  of  which
one  can  be detained;	(2)  Notice of the grounds  of	such
detention; (3) An impartial tribunal, administrative,  judi-
cial or advisory, to decide whether the detention is  justi-
fied;  and  (4) Orderly course of  procedure,  including  an
opportunity  to	 be  heard orally (not merely  by  making  a
written	 representation) with a right to lead  evidence	 and
call witnesses.
</p><p id="p_54">    In	my opinion, this line of approach is not proper	 and
indeed is misleading.  As regards the American	Constitution
its  general  structure is noticed in these  words  in	"The
Government  of the United States" by Munro (5th Edition)  at
page  53:  "The architects of 1787 built only the  basement.
Their descendants have kept adding walls and windows,  wings
and gables, pillars and porches to make a rambling structure
which is not yet finished.   Or, to change the metaphor,  it
has a fabric which, to use the words of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">109</span>
James  Russell Lowell, is still being 'woven on the  roaring
loom  of  time'.  That is what the framers of  the  original
Constitution intended it to be.	 Never was it in their	mind
to work out a final scheme for the government of the country
and  stereotype it for all time. They sought merely to	pro-
vide  a starting point."  The same aspect is  emphasized  in
Professor  Willis's book on Constitutional Law and  Cooley's
Constitutional Limitations.    In contrast  to	the American
Constitution,  the  Indian Constitution is a  very  detailed
one.  The Constitution itself provides in minute details the
legislative powers of the Parliament and the State  Legisla-
tures.	  The same feature is noticeable in the case of	 the
judiciary,  finance,  trade, commerce and services.   It  is
thus quite detailed and the whole of it has to be read	with
the  same sanctity, without giving undue weight to Part	 III
or <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_131">article 246</a>, except to the extent one is legitimately and
clearly limited by the other.
</p><p id="p_55">   Four	 marked points of distinction between the clause  in
the American Constitution and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_132">article 21</a> of the Constitution
of India may be noticed at this stage. The first is that  in
U.S A. Constitution  the word "liberty"	 is used simpliciter
while in India it is restricted to personal liberty.  (2) In
U.S.A. Constitution the same protection is given to  proper-
ty,  while  in	India the fundamental right  in	 respect  of
property  is contained in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_133">article 31.</a>  (3) The	 word  "due"
is  omitted  altogether and the expression "due	 process  of
law"  is not used deliberately.	 (4) The word  "established"
is used and is limited to "Procedure" in Our <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_134">article 21.</a>
   The	whole argument of the petitioner is rounded  on	 the
meaning	 of the word "law" given to it by the Supreme  Court
of America.  It seems unnecessary to embark on a  discussion
of  the powers and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of	 the
'U.S.A. and how they came to enlarge or abridge the  meaning
of  law	 in the expression "due process	 of  law".   Without
going  into  details, I think there is no  justification  to
adopt  the meaning of the word "law" as interpreted  by	 the
Supreme Court of U.S.A. in the expression "due
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">110</span>
process	 of  law" merely because the word "law" is  used  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_135">article	 21.</a>  The discussion of the meaning of "due  process
of  law" found in Willis on Constitutional Law and  in	Coo-
ley's Constitutional Limitations shows the diverse  meanings
given  to that expression at different times and under	dif-
ferent	 circumstances	by the Supreme Court of	 U.S.A.,  so
much so that the conclusion reached by these authors is that
the  expression. means reasonable law according to the	view
of  the	 majority of the judges of the Supreme	Court  at  a
particular  time  holding office.   It also  shows  how	 the
meaning of the expression was widened or abridged in certain
decades.  Moreover, to control the meaning so given to	that
expression  from time to time the doctrine of police  powers
was brought into  play. That doctrine, shortly put, is	that
legislation meant for the good of the people generally,	 and
in  which the individual has to surrender his freedom  to  a
certain	 extent because it is for the benefit of the  people
at large, has not to be tested by the touchstone of the "due
process of law" formula.
</p><p id="p_56">    Our	 attention was drawn to the  debates and  report  of
the  drafting  committee of the	   Constituent	Assembly  in
respect	 of  the wording of this clause. The report  may  be
read not to control the	 meaning of the article, but may  be
seen  in case of    ambiguity. In The Municipal	 Council  of
Sydney v. The Commonwealth(1), it was thought that individu-
al  opinion  of members of the Convention expressed  in	 the
debate	cannot be referred to for the purpose of  construing
the Constitution.  The same opinion was expressed in  United
States	v.  Wong Kim Ark(2). The result appears to  be	that
while it is not proper to take into consideration the  indi-
vidual	opinions of Members of	Parliament or Convention  to
construe the meaning of the particular clause, when a  ques-
tion is raised whether a certain phrase or expression was up
for consideration at all or not, a reference to the  debates
may  be' permitted.  In the present case  the  debates	were
referred to to show that the expression "due process of law"
was known to exist in the American Constitution
(1)  (1904) 1 Com. L.R. 208.		  (2) (169) U.S	 649
at 699.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">111</span>
<p id="p_57">and  after a discussion was not adopted by  the	 Constituent
Assembly  in our Constitution. <a href="/doc/427436/" id="a_136">In Administrator	 General  of
Bengal v. Premlal Mullick</a>(1), a reference to the proceedings
of the Legislature which resulted in the passing of the	 Act
was  not considered legitimate aid in the construction of  a
particular  section.  The same reasons were held  as  cogent
for  excluding a reference to such debates in construing  an
Indian	Statute.  Resort may be had to these sources   with-
great  caution	and only when latent ambiguities are  to  be
resolved.   See Craies' Statute Law (4th Edition) page	122,
Maxwell on  Interpretation of Statutes (9th Edition)pp.	 28-
29 and Crawford on Statutory Construction  (1940 Edition) p.
379,  <a href="/doc/1123514/" id="a_137">article  214.</a> A perusal of the report of the  drafting
committee  to  which our attention was drawn  shows  clearly
that  the Constituent  Assembly	 had before it the  American
article	 and  the expression "due process of law"  but	they
deliberately dropped the use of that	expression from	 our
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_58">     No	 extrinsic aid is needed to interpret	the words  of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_138">article 21</a>, which in my opinion, are not  ambiguous.Normally
read,	and without  thinking of  other Constitutions,	 the
expression    "procedure   established	by  law"  must	mean
procedure  prescribed  by the law of the  State.    If	 the
Indian	Constitution  wanted  to  preserve to  every  person
the protection given by the due process clause of the Ameri-
can  Constitution there was nothing to prevent the  Assembly
from  adopting	the phrase, or if they wanted to  limit	 the
same  to procedure only, to adopt that expression with	only
the  word  "procedural"	 prefixed to  "law."   However,	 the
correct question is what is the right given by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_139">article 21  ?</a>
The  only right is that no person shall be deprived  of	 his
life or liberty except according to procedure established by
law. One may like that right to cover a larger area, but  to
give  such a right is not the function of the Court;  it  is
the function of the Constitution. To read the word "law"  as
meaning rules of natural justice will land one in
  (1) (1895)L.R. 221. A. 107. 15
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">	 15</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">112</span>
difficulties  because the rules of natural justice,  as	 re-
gards  procedure, are nowhere defined and in my opinion	 the
Constitution cannot be read as laying down a vague standard.
This  is  particularly	so when in omitting  to	 adopt	"due
process	 of  law"  it was  considered  that  the  expression
"procedure  established by law" made the standard  specific.
It  can not be specific except by reading the expression  as
meaning	 procedure prescribed by the legislature.  The	word
"law"  as used in this Part has different shades of  meaning
but  in no other article it appears to bear  the  indefinite
meaning of natural justice.  If so, there appears no  reason
why in this article it should receive this peculiar meaning.
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_140">Article	 31</a>  which is also in Part III and  relates  to	 the
fundamental  rights  in respect of property runs as  follows
:-
</p><p id="p_59">    "No	 person	 shall be deprived of his property  save  by
authority of law."
</p><p id="p_60">    It is obvious that in that clause "law" must mean enact-
ed law.	 The object of dealing with property under a differ-
ent article appears more to provide the exceptions found  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_141">article 31 (2)</a> to (6), rather than to give the word "law"  a
different  meaning  than the one given in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_142">article  21.</a>	 The
world "established" according to the Oxford Dictionary means
"to fix, settle, institute or ordain by enactment or  agree-
ment."	 The  word "established" itself suggests  an  agency
which  fixes the limits.  According to the  dictionary	this
agency can be either the legislature or an agreement between
the  parties.  There is therefore no justification  to	give
the meaning of "jus" to "law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_143">article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_61">    The	 phrase "procedure established by law" seems  to  be
borrowed from <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_144">article 31</a> of the Japanese Constitution.	 But
other	articles of that  Constitution which expressly	pre-
serve other personal liberties in different clauses have  to
be  read together to determine the meaning of "law"  in	 the
expression  "procedure established by law."  These  articles
of the Japanese Constitution  have  not	 been	incorporated
in  the Constitution of India in the same language.   It  is
not  shown that the word "law" means "jus" in  the  Japanese
Constitution.  In the Japanese Constitution these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">113</span>

given  by  the	 interpretation	 of   the  words  "procedure

the expression "due process of law" in the American  Consti-
tution	is  interpreted	 to mean "just,"  according  to	 the
opinion	 of  the Supreme Court of U.S.A. That  word  imparts
jurisdiction  to the Courts to pronounce what is "due"	from
otherwise, according to law.  The deliberate omission of the
word "due" from	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_146">article  21</a> lends strength  to the  conten-
tion that the justiciable aspect of "law", i.e., to consider
whether it is reasonable or not by the Court, does not	form
part  of the Indian Constitution.  The omission of the	word
"due",	the limitation imposed by the word  "procedure"	 and
the insertion of the word "established" thus brings out more
clearly the idea of legislative prescription in the  expres-
sion used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_147">article 21.</a>  By adopting the phrase  "procedure
established   by law" the Constitution gave the	 legislature
the final word to determine the law.
</p><p id="p_62">    Our	 attention  was drawn to The King  v.  The  Military
Governor of the Hair Park Camp ('), where articles 6 and  70
of  the Irish Constitution  are	 discussed. Under <a href="/doc/19636/" id="a_148">article  6</a>
it is provided that the liberty of the person is  inviolable
and  no person shall be deprived of such except "in  accord-
ance  with law"	 ......In <a href="/doc/1811608/" id="a_149">article 70</a> it is provided that  no
one shall be tried "save in due course of law" and  extraor-
dinary Courts were not permitted to  be	 established  except
the Military  Courts to try military offences.	The  expres-
sion  "in accordance with law" was interpreted to  mean	 not
rules  of   natural justice but as the law in force  at	 the
time.	The Irish Court gave the expression "due  course  of
law"  the meaning given to it according to the	English	 law
and not the American law.  It was observed by Lord Atkin  in
Eshugbayi Eleko v. Officer Administering the  Government  of
Nigeria	 C), that in  accordance  with	British	   Jurispru-
dence	no  member of the executive can interfere  with	 the
liberty or property of a British subject except when he	 can
support the legality of his act before a Court of justice.

that  in  the whole set-up of Part III of  our	Constitution

    A  detailed discussion of the true limits of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_152">article  21</a>

articles  in  Part  III deal  with  different  and  separate
rights.	  Under	 the caption  "Right  to  Freedom"  articles
19--22	are grouped but each with a separate marginal  note.
It is obvious that <a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_154">article 22 (1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_155">(2)</a> prescribe  limita-

they  infringe the personal liberty of the individual,	will
be legal, because that becomes the established legal  proce-

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_160">article	 21</a>  at	 all and is covered wholly  by	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_161">article	 22.</a>
According  to  him,  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_162">article 22</a> is a complete  code.   I  am
unable	to  accept that contention.  It is obvious  that  in
respect	 of  arrest  and detention <a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_163">article 22  (1)</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_164">(2)</a>
provide	 safeguards.  These safeguards are excluded  in	 the
case  of preventive detention by <a href="/doc/825787/" id="a_165">article 22 (3</a>),  but  safe-
guards	in  connection with such detention are	provided  by
clauses	 (4)  to (7) of the same article.  It  is  therefore
clear  that  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_166">article 21</a> has to be read	as  supplemented  by
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_167">article 22.</a> Reading in that way the proper mode of construc-
tion will be that to the extent the procedure is  prescribed
by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_168">article 22</a> the same is to be observed; otherwise  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_169">article
21</a>  will  apply.  But if certain procedural  safeguards	 are
expressly  stated  as  not required, or	 specific  rules  on
certain	 points of procedure are prescribed,  it  seems	 im-
proper	to interpret these points as not covered by  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_170">article
22</a> and left open for consideration under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_171">article 21.</a> To	 the
extent	 the  points  are  dealt  with,	  and  included	  or
excluded,, <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_172">article 22</a> is a complete code.  On the points  of
procedure  which expressly or by necessary  implication	 are
not  dealt with by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_173">article 22</a>, the operation of	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_174">article  21</a>
will remain unaffected.	 It is thus necessary first to	look
at  <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_175">article 22 (4)</a> to (7) and next at the provisions  0	 the
impugned  Act to determine if the Act or any of	 its  provi-
sions  are ultra vires.	 It may be noticed that neither	 the
American  nor the Japanese Constitution	 contain  provisions
permitting  preventive	detention,. much  less	laying	down
limitations  on	 such right of detention, in  normal  timeS,
i.e., without a declaration of emergency.  Preventive deten-
tion  in  normal times,. i.e., without the existence  of  an
emergency  like	 war,. is recognised as a  normal  topic  of
legislation  in List I. Entry 9, and List III, Entry  3,  of
the  Seventh Schedule.	Even in the Chapter  on	 Fundamental
Rights	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_176">article 22</a> envisages legislation in respect of	pre-
ventive detention in normal times. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_177">article
22  (4)</a>	 to (7) by their very wording leave  unaffected	 the
large  powers  of legislation on this  point  and  emphasize
particularly  by <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_178">article 22 (7)</a> the power of the  Parliament
to  deprive a person of a right to have his case  considered
by an advisory	board.	Part III and.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">117</span>
<p id="p_81"><a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_179">article	 22</a> in particular are the only restrictions on	that
power and but for those provisions the power to legislate on
this subject would have been quite unrestricted.  Parliament
could have made a law without any safeguard or any procedure
for  preventive detention. Such an autocratic  supremacy  of
the legislature is certainly cut down by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_180">article 21.</a>  There-
fore, if the legislature prescribes a procedure by a validly
enacted	 law  and such procedure in the case  of  preventive
detention does not come in conflict with the express  provi-
sions of Part III or <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_181">article 22 (4)</a> to (7),  the  Preventive
Detention  Act must be held valid notwithstanding  that	 the
Court  may  not fully approve of  the  procedure  prescribed
under such Act.
</p><p id="p_82">    <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_182">Article  22 (4)</a> opens with a double negative.  Put in  a
positive  form	it will mean that a law which  provides	 for
preventive  detention for a period longer than three  months
shall  contain .a provision establishing an advisory  board,
(consisting of persons with the qualifications mentioned  in
sub-clause (a)), and which has to report before the  expira-
tion of three months if in its opinion there was  sufficient
cause for such detention. This clause, if it stood by itself
and  without  the remaining provisions of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_183">article  22</a>,	will
apply  both  to the Parliament and the	State  Legislatures.
The proviso to this clause further enjoins that even  though
the  advisory  board may be of the opinion  that  there	 was
sufficient cause for such detention, i.e., detention  beyond
the period of three months, still the detention is not to be
permitted  beyond the maximum period, if any, prescribed  by
Parliament under <a href="/doc/504536/" id="a_184">article 22 (7) (b).</a> Again the whole of this
sub-clause  is	made inoperative by <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_185">article 22	(4)  (b)</a>  in
respect of an Act of preventive detention passed by  Parlia-
ment  under clauses (7) (a) .and (b).  Inasmuch as  the	 im-
pugned	Act is an Act of the Parliament purported to  be  so
made, clause 22 (4) has no operation and may for the present
discussion  be kept aside. <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_186">Article 22</a> prescribes  that	when
any person under a preventive detention law is detained, the
authority making the order shall, as soon as may be,  commu-
nicate	to such person the grounds on which . the order	 has
been made and shall afford him the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">118</span>
earliest opportunity of making a representation against	 the
order.	This  clause is of general operation in	 respect  of
every  detention order made under any law permitting  deten-
tion.  <a href="/doc/1782826/" id="a_187">Article 22 (6)</a> permits the authority making the order
to withhold disclosure of facts which such authority consid-
ers  against  the public interest to disclose.	 It  may  be
noticed that this clause only permits the non-disclosure  of
facts,	and reading clauses (5) and (6) together a  distinc-
tion  is  drawn	 between facts	and  grounds  of  detention.
<a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_188">Article 22 (4)</a> and <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_189">(7)</a> deal not with the period of detention
only  but with other requirements in the case of  preventive
detention  also.  They provide for the establishment  of  an
advisory  board, and the necessity of furnishing grounds  to
the detenue and also to give him a right to make a represen-
tation.	 Reading <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_190">article 22</a> clauses (4) and (7) together  it
appears	 to  be implied that preventive detention  for	less
than three months, without  an advisory board, is  permitted
under  the  Chapter  on Fundamental  Rights,  provided	such
legislation  is	 within the legislative	 competence  of	 the
Parliament or the State Legislature, as the case may be.
    <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_191">Article  22	 (5)</a> permits the detained person to  make  a
representation.	 The Constitution is silent as to the person
to  whom it has to be made, or how it has to be dealt  with.
But that is the procedure laid down by the Constitution.  It
does not therefore mean that if a law made by the Parliament
in  respect of preventive detention does not make  provision
on those two points it is invalid.  Silence on these  points
does  not  make	 the impugned Act in  contravention  of	 the
Constitution  because  the first question is  what  are	 the
rights	given by the Constitution in the case of  preventive
detention. The contention that the representation should  be
to  an	outside	 body has no support in law.   Even  in	 the
Liversidge  case  the representation had to be made  to	 the
Secretary  of  State and not to another	 body.	 After	such
representation	was  made,  another advisory  board  had  to
consider it, but it was not necessary to make the  represen-
tation	itself	to a third party.  <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_192">Article 22  (4)</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_193">(7)</a>
permit the non-establishment of an advisory board  expressly
in a  parliamentary  legislation-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">119</span>
<p id="p_83">providing  for preventive  detention  beyond  three  months.
If  so, how can it be urged that the nonestablishment of  an
advisory.  board  is  a fundamental right  violated  by	 the
procedure prescribed in the Act passed by the Parliament?
</p><p id="p_84">    The important clause to be considered is <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_194">article 22 (7).</a>
Sub-clause  (a) is important-for this case.  In the case  of
an Act of preventive detention passed by the Parliament this
clause contained in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights,	thus
permits	 detention beyond a period of three months  and	 ex-
cludes	the necessity of consulting an advisory	 board,	  if
the opening words of the sub-clause are complied with.	Sub-
clause	(b)  is	 permissive.  It is not	 obligatory  on	 the
Parliament  to prescribe any maximum period. It	 was  argued
that this gives the Parliament a right to allow a person  to
be detained indefinitely.  If that construction is  correct,
it springs out of the words of sub-clause (7) itself and the
Court cannot help in the matter.  Subclause (c) permits	 the
Parliament  to lay down the procedure to be followed by	 the
advisory board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of  clause
(4).  I am unable to accept the contention that	 <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_195">article  22
(4)  (a)</a>  is the rule and <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_196">article 22 (7)</a> the  exception.   I
read  them as two alternatives provided by the	Constitution
for making laws on preventive detention.
</p><p id="p_85">    Bearing  in mind the provisions of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_197">article 22</a> read	with
<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_198">article 246</a> and Schedule VII, List I, Entry 9, and List III,
Entry  3, it is thus clear that the Parliament is  empowered
to  enact  a  law of preventive detention  (a)	for  reasons
connected  with	 defence,  (b) for  reasons  connected	with
foreign affairs, (c) for reasons connected with the security
of  India; and (under List III), (d) for  reasons  connected
with the security of a State, (e) for reasons connected with
the maintenance of public order, or (f) for reasons connect-
ed  with the maintenance of supplies and services  essential
to the community.  Counsel for the petitioner has challenged
the  validity of several provisions of the Act.	 In  respect
of the construction of a Constitution Lord Wright
in James v. The Commonwealth   of Australia(1),
    (1) (1936) A. 0. 578 at 614.

<p id="p_86">observed  that "a Constitution must not be construed in	 any
narrow	 and  pedantic	sense."	 Mr.  Justice	Higgins	  in
Attorney-General  of New South Wales v.	 Brewery  Employees'
Union (1), observed: "Although we are to interpret words  of
the Constitution on the same principles of interpretation as
we  apply  to  any ordinary law, these	very  principles  of
interpretation compel us to take into account the nature and
scope of the Act that we are interpreting--to remember	that
it is a Constitution, a mechanism under which laws are to be
made  and not a mere Act which declares what the law  is  to
be."  In In re The Central Provinces and <a href="/doc/560085/" id="a_199">Berar Act</a>   XIV  of
1938  ("'),  Sir  Maurice Gwyer C.J.  after  adopting  these
observations  said:  "especially is this true of  a  Federal
Constitution  with  its	 nice balance  of  jurisdictions.  I
conceive  that	a broad and liberal  spirit  should  inspire
those  whose duty it is to interpret it; but I do not  imply
by  this that they are free to stretch or pervert  the	lan-
guage of the enactment in the interest of any legal or	con-
stitutional  theory  or even for the  purpose  of  supplying
omissions   or	of correcting supposed errors."	  There	  is
considerable authority for the statement that the Courts are
not  at	 liberty  to declare an Act void  because  in  their
opinion	 it is opposed to a spirit supposed to	pervade	 the
Constitution  but not expressed in words.  Where the  funda-
mental law has not limited, either in terms or by  necessary
implication, the general powers conferred upon the  Legisla-
ture we cannot declare a limitation under the notion of hav-
ing discovered something in the spirit	of  the Constitution
which  is not even mentioned in the instrument. It is diffi-
cult upon any general principles to limit the omnipotence of
the  sovereign legislative power by judicial  interposition,
except so far as the express words of a written Constitution
give  that  authority.	It is also stated, if the  words  be
positive and without ambiguity, there is no authority for  a
Court  to vacate or repeal a Statute on that  ground  alone.
But it is only in express constitutional provisions limiting
legislative  power and controlling the temporary will  of  a
majority by a permanent and

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">121</span>
<p id="p_87">paramount law settled by the deliberate wisdom of the nation
that one can find a safe and. solid ground for the authority
of Courts of justice to declare void ,any legislative enact-
ment.	Any assumption of authority beyond this would be  to
place in the hands of the judiciary powers too great and too
'indefinite  either for its own security. or the  protection
of private rights.
</p><p id="p_88">    It	was first  argued that by  <a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_200">section 3</a> the  Parliament
had delegated its legislative power to the executive officer
in detaining a person on his being satisfied of its necessi-
ty.   It  was  urged that the satisfaction must	 be  of	 the
legislative  body.   This contention of	 delegation  of	 the
legislative  power  in such cases has  been  considered	 and
rejected  in numerous cases by our Federal Court and by	 the
English	 Courts.   It is unnecessary to refer to  all  those
cases.	 A reading of the various speeches in Liversidge  v.
Anderson  clearly negatives this contention.  <a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_201">Section  3</a>  of
the  impugned Act is no delegation of legislative  power  to
make  laws.   It only confers discretion on the	 officer  to
enforce the law made by the legislature.  <a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_202">Section 3</a> is	also
impugned on the ground that it does not provide an objective
standard which the Court can utilize for determining whether
the  requirements  of law have been complied  with.   It  is
clear that no such objective standard of conduct can be pre-
scribed, except as laying down conduct tending to achieve or
to  avoid  a particular object.	  For  preventive  detention
action must be taken on good suspicion.	 It is a  subjective
test  based on the cumulative effect of	 different  actions,
perhaps	 spread over a considerable period. As	observed  by
Lord  Finlay  in The King v. Halliday (2), a  Court  is	 the
least  appropriate  tribunal  to  investigate  the  question
whether	 circumstances	of suspicion  exist  warranting	 the
restraint  on a person.	 The contention is urged in  respect
of preventive detention and not punitive detention.   Before
a person can be held liable for an offence it	 is  obvious
that  he should be in a position to know     what he may  do
or not do, and an omission to do or not to do will result in
the State

<p id="p_89">considering  him  guilty according to the  penal  enactment.
When  it  comes however to preventive  detention,  the	very
purpose is to prevent the individual not merely from  acting
in  a particular way but, as the sub-heads summarized  above
show,  from achieving a particular object.  It will  not  be
humanly possible to tabulate exhaustively all actions  which
may  lead  to a particular object.  It	has  therefore	been
considered that a punitive detention Act which	sufficiently
prescribes the objects which the legislature considers	have
not to be worked up to is. a sufficient standard to  prevent
the legislation being vague.  In my opinion, therefore,	 the
argument of the petitioner against <a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_203">section 3</a> of the impugned
Act fails.  It was also contended that <a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_204">section 3</a>  prescribes
no limit of time for detention and therefore the legislation
is  ultra vires. The answer is found in <a href="/doc/504536/" id="a_205">article 22 (7)	(b).</a>
A  perusal  of the provisions of the impugned  Act  moreover
shows that in <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_206">section 12</a> provision is made for detention for
a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year
in  respect  of	 clauses (a) and (b) of	 that  section.	  It
appears therefore that in respect of the rest of the clauses
mentioned  in <a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_207">section 3</a> (1)(a)the detention is	not  contem-
plated	to be for a period longer than three months, and  in
such cases a reference to the advisory board under <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_208">section 9</a>
is contemplated.
</p><p id="p_90">    <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_209">Section  7</a> of the Act which is next challenged, runs  on
the same lines as <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_210">article 22 (5)</a> and. (6) and in my  opinion
infringes  no provision of the Constitution. It	 was  argued
that  this  gave only the right of making  a  representation
without being heard 'orally or without affording an opportu-
nity  to  lead	evidence and therefore was  not	 an  orderly
course	of  procedure, as required by the rules	 of  natural
justice.   The Parliament by the Act has expressly  given  a
right  to the person detained under a  preventive  detention
order  to  receive the grounds for detention  and  also	 has
given  him  a right to make a representation.  <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_211">The  Act</a>	 has
thus complied with the requirements of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_212">article 22 (s).</a>	That
clause,	 which prescribes what procedure has to be  followed
as a matter of fundamental right, is silent about the person
detained having a right to be heard
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">123</span>
orally or by a lawyer.	The Constituent Assembly had  before
them the provisions of clause (1) of the same article.	 The
Assembly  having  dealt with the requirements  of  receiving
grounds	 and giving an opportunity to make a  representation
has  deliberately  refrained from providing a  right  to  be
heard orally.  If so, I do not read the clause as guarantee-
ing such right under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_213">article 22 (5).</a>  An "orderly course  of
procedure" is not limited to procedure which has been  sanc-
tioned	by  settled usage.  New forms of  procedure  are  as
much, held even by the Supreme Court of America, due process
of  law	 as old forms, provided they give a  person  a	fair
opportunity to present his case.  It was contended that	 the
right to make a representation in <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_214">article 22 (5)</a> must  carry
with  it  a right to be heard by  an  independent  tribunal;
otherwise  the making of a representation has  no  substance
because it is not an effective remedy.	I am unable to	read
clause	(5) of .<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_215">article 22</a> as giving a fundamental right  to
be  heard  by  an independent  tribunal.   The	Constitution
deliberately  stops at giving the right	 of  representation.
This is natural because under <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_216">article 22 (7</a>), in terms,	 the
Constitution  permits the making of a law by  Parliament  in
which  a reference to an advisory board may be omitted.	  To
consider  the right to make a representation as	 necessarily
including  a right to be heard by an  independent  judicial,
administrative or advisory tribunal will thus be directly in
conflict with the express words of <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_217">article 22 (7).</a>
    Even according to the Supreme Court of U.S.A. a right to
a  judicial trial is not absolute.  In the United States  v.
Ju Toy (1), a question arose about the exclusion from  entry
into the States, of a Chinese who claimed to be a citizen of
the  United States.  At page 263 the majority judgment	con-
tains  the  following  passage :--" If for  the	 purpose  of
argument,  we  assume that the Fifth  Amendment	 applies  to
him,   and that to deny entrance to a citizen is to  deprive
him  ,of liberty, we nevertheless are of opinion  that	with
regard	to him due process of law does not require  judicial
trial: That is the result of the cases which we have  cited,
and the almost necessary result of the
  (1) (198) U.S. 253 at 263.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">124</span>
<p id="p_91">power  of  the Congress to pass exclusion  laws.   That	 the
decision may be entrusted to an executive officer, and	that
his  decision  is due process of law, was affirmed  and	 ex-
plained	 in several cases.  It is unnecessary to repeat	 the
often-quoted remarks of Mr. Justice Curtis, speaking for the
whole  Court, in Den Exden Murray v. Hoboken  Land  and	 Im-
provement  Company (1), to. show that the requirement  of  a
judicial trial does not prevail in every case."
</p><p id="p_92">    Again, I am not prepared to accept the' contention	that
a right to be heard orally  is an essential right of  proce-
dure  even according to the rules of natural  justice.	 The
right  to  make	 a defence may be admitted,  but  there	  is
nothing to support the contention that an oral interview  is
compulsory.   In the Local Government Board v. Arlidge	(2),
the  respondent applied to the Board constituted  under	 the
<a href="/doc/189509469/" id="a_218">Housing	 Act</a> to state a special case for the opinion of	 the
High  Court, contending that the order was  invalid  because
(1) the report of the Inspector had been treated as a confi-
dential document and had not been disclosed to the  respond-
ent,  and  (2)	because the Board had declined to  give	 the
respondent  an	opportunity  of being heard  orally  by	 the
person	or persons by whom the appeal was  finally  decided.
The  Board rejected the application.  Both the	points	were
urged  before  the  House of Lords  on	  appeal.   Viscount
Haldane L.C. in his speech rejected the contention about the
necessity  of an oral hearing by observing "But it does	 not
follow	that  the procedure of every  tribunal	must  be.the
same.	In  the	 case of a Court of law	 tradition  in	this
country	 has prescribed certain principles to which, in	 the
main,  the procedure must conform.  But what that  procedure
is to be in detail must depend on the nature of a tribunal."
In  rejecting  the contention about the	 disclosure  of	 the
report	of  the Inspector, the Lord Chancellor	stated:	 "It
might or might not have been useful to disclose this report,
but  I do not think that the Board was bound to do  so.	 any
more  than  it	would have been bound to  disclose  all	 the
minutes made on the papers in the office before
(1) 18 HO.W. 272 at 280.		(2) (1915) A.C. 120.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">125</span>
<p id="p_93">a  decision was come to	 ......	 What appears to me to	have
been  the  fallacy of the judgment of the  majority  in	 the
Court  of appeal is that it begs the question at the  begin-
ning  by setting up the test of the procedure of a Court  of
justice	 instead of the other standard which was  laid	down
for  such cases in Board of Education v. Rice (1). I do	 not
think  the  Board was bound to hear  the  respondent  orally
provided it gave him the opportunities he actually had."  In
spite of the fact that in England the Parliament is  supreme
I am unable to accept the view that the Parliament in making
laws,  legislates against the well-recognised principles  of
natural justice accepted as such in all civilized countries.
The  same view is accepted in the United States	 in  Federal
Communications Commission v. WJR The Goodwill Station (2).
    A  right  to lead evidence against	facts  suspected  to
exist is also not essential in the case of preventive deten-
tion.	<a href="/doc/1782826/" id="a_219">Article 22 (6)</a> permits the non-disclosure of  facts.
That is one of the clauses of the Constitution dealing	with
fundamental rights.  If even the non-disclosure of facts  is
permitted,  I  fail to see how there can exist	a  right  to
contest	 facts	by  evidence and the  noninclusion  of	such
procedural right could make this Act invalid.
    <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_220">Section  10</a>	 (3) was challenged on the  ground  that  it
excludes  the  right to appear in person or  by	 any  lawyer
before the advisory board and it was argued that this was an
infringement of a fundamental right. It must be noticed that
<a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_221">article	 22  (1)</a> which gives a detained person	a  right  to
consult	 or  be defended by his own  legal  practitioner  is
specifically  excluded	by  <a href="/doc/825787/" id="a_222">article 22 (3)</a> in  the  case  of
legislation  dealing with preventive detention.	  Moreover,.
the Parliament is expressly given power under <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_223">article 22 (7)</a>
</p><p id="p_94">(c)  to lay down the procedure in an inquiry by an  advisory
board. This is also a part of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_224">article 22</a> itself.  If so, how
can  the omission to give a right to audience be  considered
</p><p id="p_95">-against  the  constitutional rights ?	It was	pointed	 out
that <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_225">section 10</a> (3) prevents even the disclosure of a
(1) (1911) A.C. 179.	    (2) 337 U.S. 265 at 276.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">126</span>
<p id="p_96">portion of the report and opinion of the advisory board.. It
was argued that if so how can the detained person put  forth
his  case  before a Court and challenge	 the  conclusions  ?
This  argument	was similarly advanced in  Local  Government
Board  v. Arlidge (1) and rejected, as mentioned above.	  In
my opinion, the answer is in the provision found in  <a href="/doc/308208/" id="a_226">article
22 (7) (c)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_97">    It	was argued that <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_227">section 11</a> of the impugned  Act	 was
invalid as it permitted the continuance of the detention for
such  period as the Central Government or the State  Govern-
ment thought fit.  This may mean an indefinite period. In my
opinion this argument has nos substance because the Act	 has
to  be read as a whole., The whole life of the Act is for  a
year  and therefore the argument that the detention  may  be
for  an indefinite period is unsound.  Again, by  virtue  of
<a href="/doc/504536/" id="a_228">article 22 (7)(b</a>), the Parliament is not obliged to fix	 the
maximum	 term  of such detention.  It has not so  fixed	 it,
except	under <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_229">section 12</a>, and therefore it cannot be  stated
that <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_230">section 11</a> is in contravention of <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_231">article 22 (7).</a>
    <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_232">Section  12</a>	 of the impugned Act is	 challenged  on	 the
ground that it does not conform to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_233">article
22 (7).</a>	 It is argued that <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_234">article 22 (7)</a> permits preventive
detention  beyond  three months, when  the  Parliament	pre-
scribes "the circumstances in which, and the class or class-
es  of	cases in which," a person may be detained.   It	 was
argued that both these conditions must be fulfilled.  In  my
opinion, this argument is unsound, because the words used in
<a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_235">article	 22 (7)</a> themselves are against such  interpretation.
The  use of the word "which" twice in the first part of	 the
sub-clause,  read with the comma put after each, shows	that
the  legislature wanted these to be read as disjunctive	 and
not  conjunctive.   Such argument might have  been  possible
(though	 not  necessarily accepted) if' the article  in	 the
Constitution was "the circumstances. and the class or class-
es of cases in which  ......  "I have. no doubt that by	 the
clause, as worded, the legislature-
</p><p id="p_98">  (1) (1915) A.C. 120.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">127</span>
<p id="p_99">intended that the power of preventive detention beyond three
months	may  be	 exercised either if  the  circumstances  in
which,	or the class or classes of cases in which, a  person
is  suspected or apprehended to be doing  the  objectionable
things mentioned in the section.  This contention  therefore
fails.
</p><p id="p_100">    It was next contended that by <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_236">section 12</a> the  Parliament
had  provided that a person might be detained for  a  period
longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the
date  of his detention, without obtaining the opinion of  an
advisory  board, with a view to prevent him from  acting  in
any  manner prejudicial to (a) the defence of  India,  rela-
tions of India with foreign powers or the security of India;
or  (b)the security of a State or the maintenance of  public
order.	It must be noticed that the contingency provided  in
<a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_237">section	 3</a> (1) (a) (iii), viz., the maintenance of  supplies
and  services essential to the community is omitted in	sec-
tion  12.  Relying on the wording of these two	sub-sections
in  <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_238">section 12</a>, it was argued that in the impugned  Act	 the
wording of Schedule VII List I, Entry 9, and List III, Entry
3,  except  the last part, are only copied.   This  did	 not
comply	with the requirement to specify either	the  circum-
stances or the class or classes of cases as is necessary  to
be  done under <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_239">article 22 (7)</a> of the Constitution.   Circum-
stances	 ordinarily mean events or situation  extraneous  to
the  actions of the individual concerned, while a  class  of
cases  mean determinable groups based on the actions of	 the
individuals  with a common aim or idea. Determinable may  be
according  to the nature of the object also.  It is  obvious
that the classification can be by grouping the activities of
people	or  by specifying the objectives to be	attained  or
avoided.  The argument advanced on behalf of the  petitioner
on this point does not' appeal to me because it assumes that
the  words  of Schedule VII List I, Entry 9, and  List	III,
Entry  3  are never capable of being considered	 as  circum-
stances or classes of cases.  In my opinion, that assumption
is  not	 justified, particularly when we have to  take	into
consideration cases of preventive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">17</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">128</span>
detention  and	not of conviction  and	punitive  detention.
Each of the expressions used in those entries is capable  of
complying  with the requirement of mentioning  circumstances
or  classes  of cases. The classification of  cases,  having
regard	to an object, may itself amount to a description  of
the  circumstances.   It is not disputed that  each  of	 the
entries in the Legislative Lists in the Seventh Schedule has
a specific connotation well understood and ascertainable  in
law.  If so, there appears no reason why the same expression
when used in <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_240">section 12</a> (1) (a) and (b) of the impugned	 Act
should	not be held to have such specific meaning  and	thus
comply with the requirement of prescribing circumstances  or
classes of cases.  This argument therefore must be rejected.
    <a href="/doc/61783825/" id="a_241">Section 13(2)</a> was attacked on the ground that even if  a
detention  order was revoked, another detention order  under
<a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_242">section 3</a> might be made against the same person on the	same
grounds.    This clause appears to be inserted to prevent  a
man being released if a detention order was held invalid  on
some  technical ground.	 There is nothing in the Chapter  on
Fundamental  Rights and in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_243">article 21</a> or 22 to	prevent	 the
inclusion  of such a clause in a parliamentary	legislation,
permitting preventive detention.  <a href="/doc/17858/" id="a_244">Article 20 (2)</a> may be read
as a contrast on this point.
</p><p id="p_101">    Dealing with the four fundamental principles of  natural
justice	 in procedure claimed by the petitioner, it is	thus
clear that in respect of preventive detention no question of
an objective standard of human conduct can be laid down.  It
is  conceded that no notice before detention can be  claimed
by  the	 very nature of such detention.	 The  argument	that
after  detention intimation of the grounds should  be  given
has  been recognised in <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_245">article 22 (5)</a> and  incorporated  in
the	impugned   Act.	 As regards an	impartial  tribunal,
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_246">article	 22</a> and	 <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_247">(7)</a>  read  together give  the	  Parliament
ample  discretion.   When  in  specified  circumstances	 and
classes	 of cases the preventive  detention  exceeds   three
months,	 the absence of an advisory board is expressly	per-
mitted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">129</span>
by  <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_248">article 22 (7).</a> Under <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_249">article 22 (4)</a> it appears  implied
that  a provision for such tribunal is not necessary if	 the
detention  is  for less than three months.   As	 regards  an
opportunity to be heard, there is no absolute natural  right
recognised  in respect of oral representation.	It has	been
held  to depend on the nature of the tribunal. The right  to
make  a	 representation is affirmed by the  Constitution  in
<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_250">article	 22 (5)</a> and finds a place in the impugned Act.	 The
right to an orderly course of procedure to the extent it  is
guaranteed  by <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_251">article 22 (4)</a> read with <a href="/doc/308208/" id="a_252">article 22 (7)	(c</a>),
and  by	 <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_253">article  22  (7) (a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_254">(b</a>), has  also  been	thus
provided   in  the  Act.   It seems to me therefore that the
petitioner's contentions even on these points fail.
    <a href="/doc/175873348/" id="a_255">Section  14</a> was strongly attacked on the ground that  it
violated  all  principles of natural justice  and  even	 in-
fringed	 the right given by <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_256">article 22 (5)</a> of the  Constitu-
tion.  It runs as follows:
</p><p id="p_102">    "14.  (1) No Court shall, except for the purposes  of  a
prosecution for an offence punishable under subsection	(2),
allow any statement to be made, or any evidence to be given,
before	it of the substance of any communication made  under
<a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_257">section 7</a> of the grounds on which a detention order has been
made against any person or of any representation made by him
against such order; and, notwithstanding anything  contained
in any other law, no Court shall be entitled to require	 any
public	officer	 to produce before it, or  to  disclose	 the
substance of, any such communication or representation made,
or the proceedings of an Advisory Board or that part of	 the
report of an Advisory Board which is confidential.
    (2)	 It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment
for  a term which may extend to one year, or with  fine,  or
with both, for any person to disclose or publish without the
previous  authorisation	 of the Central	 Government  or	 the
State Government, as the case may be, any contents or matter
purporting  to	be  contents of any  such  communication  or
representation as is referred to in sub-section (1):
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">130</span>
<p id="p_103">    Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to
a  disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person  who  is
the subject of a detention order."
</p><p id="p_104">    By	that section the Court is prevented (except for	 the
purpose	 of punishment for such disclosure) from  being	 in-
formed, either by a statement or by leading evidence, of the
substance  of  the grounds conveyed to the  detained  person
under  <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_258">section	7</a>  on which the order was made,	 or  of	 any
representation	made  by him against such  order.   It	also
prevents  the Court from calling upon any public officer  to
disclose the substance of those grounds or from the  produc-
tion  of  the proceedings or report  of	 the.advisory  board
which  may  be declared confidential.  It is clear  that  if
this  provision is permitted to stand the Court can have  no
material  before  it to determine whether the  detention  is
proper or not.	I do not mean whether the grounds are suffi-
cient or not.  It even prevents the Court from	ascertaining
whether the alleged grounds of detention have anything to do
with  the  circumstances or class or classes of	 cases	men-
tioned	in <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_259">section 12</a> (1) (a) or (b). In  Machindar  Shivaji
Mahar  v.  The King (1),  the Federal Court. held  that	 the
Court	can  examine  the grounds given	 by  the  Government
to  see	 if  they  are relevant	 to  the  object  which	 the
legislation  has in view.  The provisions of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_260">article 22	 (5)</a>
do  not exclude that right of the Court.  <a href="/doc/175873348/" id="a_261">Section 14</a> of	 the
impugned  Act appears to be a drastic provision.  which	 re-
quires	considerable support to sustain it in  a  preventive
detention Act.	The learned Attorney-General urged that	 the
whole  object of the section was to prevent  ventilation  in
public	of the grounds and the representations, and that  it
was  a	rule  of evidence only which  the  Parliament  could
prescribe.   I	do not agree. This argument is	clearly	 not
sustainable on the words of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_262">article 22</a> clauses (5) and	(6).
The  Government	 has the right under <a href="/doc/1782826/" id="a_263">article  22  (6)</a>not  to
disclose facts which it considers undesirable to disclose in
the  public interest. It does not permit the  Government  to
refrain from disclosing grounds which fall under clause (5).
(1) [1949-50] F.C.R. 827.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">131</span>
<p id="p_105">Therefore,  it	cannot successfully be	contended  that	 the
disclosure  of	grounds may be withheld from  the  Court  in
public	interest,  as  a rule of  evidence.   Moreover,	 the
position  is made clear by the words of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_264">article 22 (5).</a>	  It
provides  that the detaining authority shall communicate  to
such detained person the grounds on which the order has been
made.  It is there fore ,essential that the grounds must  be
connected  with the order of preventive detention.  If	they
are not so .connected the requirements of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_265">article 22 (5)</a> are
not ,complied with and the detention  order will be invalid.
Therefore, it is open to a detained person to contend before
a  Court that the grounds on which the order' has been	made
have no connection at all with the order, or have no connec-
tion  with  the circumstances or class or classes  of  cases
under which a preventive detention order could be  supported
under <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_266">section 12</a>. To urge this argument the aggrieved  party
must have a right to intimate to the Court the grounds given
for  the  alleged detention and the representation  made  by
him.  For instance, a person is served with a paper on which
there are written three stanzas of a poem or three alphabets
written	 in  three different ways. For the validity  of	 the
detention  order it is necessary that the grounds should  be
those  on  which the order has been made.  If  the  detained
person	is  not in a position to put before the	 Court	this
paper, the Court will be prevented from considering  whether
the  requirements  of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_267">article 22 (5)</a> are complied  with	 and
that  is  a right which is guaranteed to every	person.	  It
seems  to  me therefore that the provisions .of	 <a href="/doc/175873348/" id="a_268">section  14</a>
abridge the right given under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_269">article 22 (5)</a> and are  there-
fore ultra vires.
</p><p id="p_106">    It next remains to be considered how far the  invalidity
of  this section affects the rest of the impugned  Act.	 The
impugned Act minus this section can remain unaffected.	 The
omission  of this section will not change the nature or	 the
structure  or the object of the legislation.  Therefore	 the
decision that <a href="/doc/175873348/" id="a_270">section 14</a> is ultra vires does not affect	 the
validity  of the rest of the Act.  In my  opinion  therefore
Act IV of 1950, except .<a href="/doc/175873348/" id="a_271">section 14</a>, is not ultra vires.	  It
does not infringe any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">132</span>
provisions  of	Part III of the Constitution  and  the	con-
tention of the applicant against the validity of that	 Act
except	to  the extent of <a href="/doc/175873348/" id="a_272">section 14</a>, fails.   The  petition

whether	 'the  Preventive  Detention Act, 1950	(Act  IV  of
1950),	is wholly or in part invalid and whether  the  peti-
tioner who has been detained under that Act is entitled to a
writ  in the nature of habeas corpus on the ground that	 his
detention is illegal.  The question being a pure question of
law  can  he decided without referring to a  long  chain  of
facts which are narrated in the petitioner's application  to
this  Court  and  which have a more direct  bearing  on	 the
alleged mala fides of the authorities who have detained	 him
than on the validity of the Act.
</p><p id="p_108">    <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_273">The Act</a> which is impugned was enacted by the  Parliament
on the 26th February, 1950, and will cease to have effect on
the 1st April, 1951, save as respects. things done or  omit-

</p><p id="p_120">    <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_291">Section  14</a>,  which is also a material section  for	 the

</p><p id="p_124">    The	 point which has been pressed before us is that	 the
Act is invalid, as it takes away or abridges certain  funda-
mental	rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution  of
India, and in support of this general proposition,  reliance
is placed on <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_293">article 13 (2)</a> which runs as follows :-
</p><p id="p_125">    "The State	shall not make any  law which takes away  or
abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law	made
in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of	 the
contravention, be void."
</p><p id="p_126">    The rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution
are classified under seven broad  heads, as follows :--

<p id="p_127">  Most	of the articles which are said to have	been  disre-
garded	occur under the heading	 "Right to  freedom,"  these
articles  being	 articles 19 (1) (d), 21  and  22.   Another
article which is also said to have been violated is  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_294">article
32</a>, under which the present application for a writ of habeas
corpus purports to have been made.
</p><p id="p_128">    <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_295">Article 19 (1)</a>is divided into seven sub-clauses
and runs as follows:-
</p><p id="p_129">  "All citizens shall have the right-

</p><p id="p_136">     (g) to practise any profession, or to carry on
any occupation, trade or business."
</p><p id="p_137">    Clauses (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this	article pro-
vide that nothing in clause (1) shall affect the   operation
of  any	 existing law in regard to the	rights	 under	that
clause, under certain conditions which are  mentioned there-
in.   Clause (5), with which we are  directly concerned	 and
which will serve as a specimen	to show the nature of  these
provisions, is to the  following effect :--
</p><p id="p_138">    "Nothing  in  sub-clauses (d), (e) and  (f)of  the	said
clause shall affect the operation of any existing  law in so
far as it imposes, or prevent the State from  making any law
imposing, reasonable restrictions on  the exercise of any of
the rights conferred by the said  sub-clauses either in	 the
interests  of the general public  or for the protection	 'of
the  interests of any Scheduled Tribe."
</p><p id="p_139">    The	 contentions  advanced on behalf of  the  petitioner
with  reference	 to this article are :--(1)  that  the	 Act
under  which  he has been detained deprives him	  who  is  a
citizen	 of  the  Republic of India of the  right   to	move
freely throughout the territory of India,  which is  guaran-
teed under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_296">article 19 (1) (d</a>), and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_297">(2)</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">137</span>
that  under  clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_298">article 19</a>, it is  open  to	this
Court  to judge whether the restrictions imposed by the	 Act
on the exercise of the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_299">article 19 (1) (d)</a>
are  reasonable	 or  otherwise.	 Before	 dealing  with	this
argument,  it is necessary to understand the meaning of	 the
words used in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_300">article 19 (1)(d)</a> and to have a clear  compre-
hension as to the true nature of the right conferred  there-
under.	  The contention put forward on behalf of the  peti-
tioner is that freedom of movement is the essence of person-
al liberty and any restraint on freedom of movement must  be
held  to  amount to abridgment or  deprivation	of  personal
liberty, as the case may be, according to the nature of	 the
restraint.  After very careful consideration, I have come to
the conclusion that this contention is well-founded in	law.
Blackstone in his "Commentaries on the Laws of England" (4th
Edition,  volume 1, page 134) states that "personal  liberty
consists in the power of locomotion, of changing .'situation
or moving one's person to whatsoever place one's own  incli-
nation	may  direct,   without	 imprisonment  or  restraint
unless by due course of law."  The authority of this  state-
ment  has  never  been questioned, and it  has	been  bodily
incorporated  by  H.J. Stephen in his "Commentaries  on	 the
Laws  of England" and has been reproduced by Cooley  in	 his
well-known  treatise  on "Constitutional  Limitations"	(8th
Edition,  volume 1, page 710), which was extensively  quoted
by both parties in the course of their arguments.   The view
that freedom of movement is the essence of personal  liberty
will  also  be	confirmed by reference to any  book  on	 the
criminal  law of England dealing with the offence  of  false
imprisonment  or  any commentary on<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_301"> the	 Indian	 Penal	Code</a>
dealing with the offences of wrongful restraint or  confine-
ment. Russell in his book on "Crimes and Misdemeanours" (8th
Edition,  volume 1, page 861), dealing with the	 offence  of
false imprisonment states as follows :--
</p><p id="p_140">    "False  imprisonment is unlawful and total restraint  of
the personal liberty of another, whether by constraining him
or compelling him to go to a particular place or by  confin-
ing him in a prison or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">138</span>
police station or private place, or by detaining him against
his  will  in  a public place	...........   the  essential
element	 in  the offence is the unlawful  detention  of	 the
person	or  the	 unlawful restraint on	his  liberty.	Such
interference  with  the liberty of  another's  movements  is
unlawful, unless it may be justified  ......  "
</p><p id="p_141">    Again, Dr. Gour in dealing with the offence of  wrongful
restraint  in his book on "The Penal Law of  British  India"
(5th Edition, page 1144) observes as follows :--
</p><p id="p_142">    "Following	the  principle that every  man's  person  is
sacred	and that it is free, law visits with  its  penalties
those  who abridge his personal liberty, though he may	have
no  design upon his person.  But the fact that	he  controls
its movements for ever so short a time is an offence against
the King's peace, for no one has the right to molest another
in his free movements."
</p><p id="p_143">    Dealing  with the offence of wrongful  confinement,	 the
same learned author observes as follows at page 1148 of	 his
book :--
</p><p id="p_144">    "'Wrongful	confinement'  is  a species  of	 '  wrongful
restraint'  as	defined in the last  section.	In  wrongful
restraint,  there  is  only a partial  suspension  of  one's
liberty	 of locomotion, while in wrongful confinement  there
is  a  total suspension of liberty 'beyond  certain  circum-
scribing limits'."
</p><p id="p_145">    Both these authors speak of restraint on personal liber-
ty  and interference with the liberty of one's movements  or
suspension  of	liberty	 or  locomotion	 as  interchangeable
terms.	In Bird v. Jones (1), Coleridge J. said that "it  is
one  part  of  the definition of freedom to be	able  to  go
whithersoever  one  pleases."  A similar  opinion  has	been
expressed by several authors including Sir Alfred Denning in
his book entitled "Freedom under the Law." There can  there-
fore  be  no doubt that freedom of movement is in  the	last
analysis  the  essence of personal liberty, and	 just  as  a
man's wealth is generally measured in this country in  terms
of  rupees, annas and pies, one's personal  liberty  depends
upon  the  extent  of his freedom of movement.	 But  it  is
contended on behalf of the State that freedom of move-

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">139</span>
<p id="p_146">ment to which reference has been made in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_302">article 19 (1)	 (d)</a>
is not the freedom of movement to which Blackstone and other
authors have referred, but is a different species of freedom
which is qualified by the words "throughout the territory of
India."	  How  the  use of the	expression  "throughout	 the
territory  of India" can qualify the meaning of the rest  of
the words used in the article is a matter beyond my  compre-
hension. In my opinion, the words "throughout the  territory
of  India" were used to stretch the ambit of the freedom  of
movement  to the utmost extent to which it could be  guaran-
teed by our Constitution.  The Constitution could not  guar-
antee freedom of movement outside the territorial limits  of
India,	and so has used those words to show that  a  citizen
was  entitled  to  move from one corner of  the	 country  to
another freely and without any obstruction.  "Throughout" is
an  amplifying and not a limiting expression, and I am	sur-
prised to find that the expression "throughout the territory
of India," which was used to give the widest possible  scope
to the freedom of movement, is sought to be construed as  an
expression limiting the scope and nature of the freedom.  In
my  opinion, the words "throughout the territory of  India,"
having	regard to the context in which they have  been	used
here,	have  the  same force and meaning as the  expression
"to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct"	used
by Blackstone, or the expression "freedom to be ,able to  go
whithersoever  one pleases" used by Coleridge J. in Bird  v.
Jones  (1).  I am certain that neither of these	 authorities
contemplated  that the freedom of movement which  is  vouch-
safed to a British citizen, is guaranteed beyond the  terri-
torial limits of British territories.
</p><p id="p_147">    The	 question as to whether preventive detention  is  an
encroachment  on the right guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_303">article 19 (1)	 (d)</a>
has  been considered by the Nagpur, Patna and Calcutta	High
Courts.	  The  view which has .been  ultimately	 adopted  by
these  High  Courts is that preventive detention  is  not  a
violation  of  the right guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_304">article 19  (1)	(d</a>),

<p id="p_148">High Court, where the matter has been elaborately discussed,
at  least  five Judges have held that it does,	and  in	 the
ultimate  analysis the number of Judges. who have  held	 the
contrary view appears to be the same.  Having regard to	 the
fact  that the view expressed by so many learned  Judges  is
opposed	 to  the view I am inclined to take, I	consider  it
necessary  to  deal briefly with the main  objections  which
have been raised in support of the narrow meaning sought  to
be attached  to	 the  words  in	 <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_305">article  19 (1)(d).</a>  I have
already	 dealt with one	 of them which is based on  the	 ex-
pression "throughout the territory of India."  A. nd I shall
now proceed to deal with the, others seriatim.
    I.	 It will be recalled that clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_306">article	 19</a>,
which  I have already quoted in full, provides	among  other
things	that  nothing  in clause (1) (d)  shall	 affect	 the
operation of any law, present or future, imposing reasonable
restrictions  on  the exercise of the right  of	 freedom  of
movement  either in the interests of the general  public  or
for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled  Tribe.
It  has been argued that the use of the words "interests  of
any  Scheduled	Tribe" in this clause shows that  the  right
guaranteed  by	<a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_307">article	 19 (1) (d)</a> is a  limited  right  of
movement,  such as the right to visit  different  localities
and  to go from one place to another and is  different	from
the  expression "freedom of movement" which has been  stated
by  Blackstone to be another name for personal liberty.	  It
is  pointed out that the restrictions in contemplation	here
are  mainly  restrictions preventing  undesirable  outsiders
from  visiting	Scheduled  Areas  and  exploiting  Scheduled
Tribes, and if the words "freedom of movement" had been used
in  the	 larger sense, such a small matter  would  not	have
found a place in clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_308">article 19..</a>
</p><p id="p_149">    I  must frankly confess that I am unable  to  appreciate
this argument and to hold that a mere reference to Scheduled
Tribes affects the plain meaning of the words used in clause
(1) (d) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_309">article 19.</a>	The words used in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_310">article 19 (1) (d)</a>
are  very wide and mean that a person can go at his will  in
any  direction	to any locality and to	any  distance.	 Re-

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">141</span>
<p id="p_150">so  wide in scope and extent may assume a variety  of  forms
and  may include internment or externment of a	person,	 his
confinement to a particular locality or within the walls  of
a  prison, his being prevented from visiting or	 staying  in
any  particular area, etc. The framers of  the	Constitution
wanted to save all restrictive legislation affecting freedom
of  movement  made in the interests of	the  general  public
(which	 expression   means  the  same	thing	as   "public
interests") and I think that the law in regard to preventive
detention  is fully covered by the expression  "restrictions
imposed in the public interests."  But they also  remembered
that there were restrictive laws made in the interests of an
important  community  and that similar laws may have  to  be
made  in  future  and hence they added the  words  "for	 the
protection  of	the interests of any  Scheduled	 Tribe."   A
reference to the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and	 the
corresponding  provisions  of the Government of	 India	Act,
1935,  as  well as to certain laws made	 for  Chota  Nagpur,
Santhai Pargangs and .other localities will show that  great
importance has been attached in this country to. the protec-
tion  and  preservation	 of the	 members  of  the  scheduled
tribes .and maintenance of order in tribal areas, and  this,
in  my	opinion, is sufficient to account  for	the  special
mention	 of the scheduled tribes in clause (5).	 It may,  at
first sight, appear to be a relatively small matter, but  in
their  anxiety to cover the whole field of restrictive	laws
made whether in the public interest or in the interests of a
particular community and not to leave the smallest loophole,
the framers of the Constitution apparently decided to  draft
the clause in the present form.	 As far as I am aware, there
are no restrictive laws made in the interests of any  commu-
nity  other  than the scheduled tribes, and I  think  clause
(5)is sufficiently comprehensive to include the smallest  as
well  as the most complete restrictions on freedom of  move-
ment.	I am also satisfied that the mere mention of  sched-
uled  tribes in clause (5) cannot change, the plain  meaning
of the words of the main provision which we find in  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_311">article

cial manner, the prohibition of such person from entering or
residing  or  remaining in any area, and the  compelling  of
such  person to reside and remain in any area, or to  do  or
abstain from doing anything."
</p><p id="p_153">    The points to be noted in connection with the  ordinance
are :--
</p><p id="p_154">    (1)	 that it is an ordinance specifically providing	 for
apprehension and detention;
</p><p id="p_155">    (2) that notwithstanding the fact that there is a gener-
al  reference in it to acts prejudicial to public safety  or
interests  and maintenance of public order there is  also  a
specific reference to maintenance of peaceful conditions  in
tribal areas;
</p><p id="p_156">    (3) that tribal areas and scheduled tribes are,  kindred
subjects as would appear from the Fifth Schedule appended to
the Constitution; and
     (4)  that maintenance of peaceful conditions in  tribal
areas may be as much in the public interest as in the inter-
ests of persons living in those areas.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">143</span>
<p id="p_157">    This  ordinance shows at least this much that  sometimes
the  law  of preventive detention can also be  made  in	 the
interests of scheduled tribes or scheduled areas and  conse-
quently	 the mere mention of scheduled tribes in clause	 (5)
does  not  necessarily exclude laws relating  to  preventive
detention from the scope of <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_312">article 19 (5)</a> The same  remarks
apply to the ordinance called "The Restriction and Detention
Ordinance,  1944" (Ordinance No. III of 1944)  which  empow-
ered the Central Government or the Provincial Government  to
detain and make orders restricting the movements of  certain
persons	 in  the interest of public safety,  maintenance  of
public	order as well as maintenance of peaceful  conditions
in tribal areas, etc.
    II.	  It is also argued that since preventive  detention
amounts to a total deprivation of freedom of movement, it is
not  a violation of the right granted under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_313">article  19	 (1)</a>
</p><p id="p_158">(d)  in	 regard	 to which the  word  "restriction"  and	 not
"deprivation"  has  been used in clause (5).  This  argument
also  does not appeal to me. There are really two  questions
which  fall to be decided in this case, viz., (a) Does	pre-
ventive detention take away the right guaranteed by  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_314">article
19  (1) (d)?</a>; and (b) if so, what are the  consequences,  if
any ?
</p><p id="p_159">    It seems obvious to me that preventive detention amounts
to a complete deprivation of the right guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_315">article
(19)  (d).</a>  The meaning of the word "restriction" is  to  be
considered with reference to the second question and I think
that  it will be highly technical to argue that	 deprivation
of  a  right cannot be said to involve	restriction  on	 the
exercise of the right.	In my opinion, having regard to	 the
context in which the word "restriction" has been used, there
is  no antithesis between that word and the  word  "depriva-
tion."	As I have already stated, restraint on the right  to
move can assume a variety of forms and restriction would  be
the most appropriate expression to be' used in clause (5) so
as  to cover all those forms ranging from total	 to  various
kinds  of partial deprivation freedom of movement.   I	will
however have to advert to this subject later and will try to
show that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">19</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">144</span>
construction I have suggested is supported by good  authori-
ty.
</p><p id="p_160">    III.  It appears that some of the Judges who had to deal
with  the  question  which we have before  us  were  greatly
influenced  by the argument that if the deprivation of	per-
sonal  liberty amounts to deprivation of the  right  granted
under  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_316">article	19 (1) (d</a>), any conviction  for	 an  offence
under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_317"> the Indian Penal Code</a> involving a sentence of  impris-
onment	will be subject to judicial review on the ground  of
reasonableness of the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_318"> of the Code</a> under which the
conviction  is	recorded.  Meredith C.J. of the	 Patna	High
Court has given expression to his concern for the  situation
which will thereby arise, in these words :--
</p><p id="p_161">    "It	 will be seen that the claim made is  very  sweeping
indeed.	  It would mean that every law under which a  person
may be imprisoned, including all the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_319"> of the Penal
Code</a>, is open to examination by the Courts on the ground  of
reasonableness.	  It  makes the Courts supreme	arbiters  in
regard	to any such legislation, and they can  reject  it-or
accept	it  in	accordance with their ideas  of	 whether  it
appeals	 to  their reason. But ideas  of  reasonableness  or
otherwise  are apt to vary widely.  Take for  example,	laws
relating  to prohibition or take such a matter	as  adultery
which  the  Indian law regards as a  crime  punishable	with
imprisonment but the English law does not.  It is  difficult
to believe the	framers of the Constitution ever intended to
place	so   enormous	a  power  in  the   hands   of	 the
Courts	................"[Rattan Roy v. The State of Biharl.
    The obvious and strictly legal reply to this argument is
that  the consideration, which has so greatly  weighed	with
the  learned  Chief Justice, is not enough to cut  down	 the
plain meaning of the general words used in <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_320">article 19 (5)</a> of
the  Constitution.  As has been pointed out in a  number  of
cases,	"in construing enacted words, we are  not  concerned
with  the policy involved or with the results  injurious  or
otherwise which may follow by giving effect to the language

</p><p id="p_162">-used" [King Emperor v. Benoari Lal Sharma and others (1)I
    Apart  from this aspect of the matter, I agree with	 one
of  the	 learned Judges Of the Calcutta High  Court  in	 his
remark	that "no calamitous or untoward result	will  follow
even   if   the	 provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_321">  of	 the   Penal   Code</a>   become
justiciable."  I  am certain that no Court  would  interfere
with a Code which has been the law of the land for nearly  a
century and the provisions of which are not in conflict with
the  basic principles of any system of law.  It seems to  me
that this Court should not be deterred from giving effect to
a  fundamental right granted under the Constitution,  merely
because of a vague and unfounded fear that something  catas-
trophic may happen.
</p><p id="p_163">    I have so far proceeded on the assumption that the basis
of the objection raised by Meredith C.J. is correct in	law,
but,  in my opinion, it is not.	 Crime has been	 defined  to
consist	 in  those acts or omissions involving breach  of  a
duty  to which a sanction is attached by law by way of	pun-
ishment	 or pecuniary penalty in the public interests.	(See
Russell's  "Crimes and Misdemeanours ").  <a href="/doc/915147/" id="a_322">Section 2</a>  of	 the
Indian	Penal Code, 1860, provides that "every person  shall
be  liable to punishment under this Code' and not  otherwise
for every act or omission contrary to the provisions  there-
of, of which he shall be guilty within British India ."	 The<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_323">
Indian	Penal Code</a> does not primarily or necessarily  impose
restrictions  on  the  freedom of movement, and	 it  is	 not
correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the
right to move freely.  Its primary object is to punish crime
and not to restrict movement.  The punishment may consist in
imprisonment  or a pecuniary penalty.  If it consists  in  a
pecuniary, penalty, it obviously involves no restriction  on
movement;  but	if it consists in imprisonment, there  is  a
restriction  on	 movement.  This restraint  is	imposed	 not
under  a law imposing restrictions on movement but  under  a
law defining crime and making it punishable. The  punishment
is  correlated	directly with the violation  of	 some  other
person's  right and not with  the right	 of
(1) [1945] F.C.R. 161 at p. 177.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">146</span>
<p id="p_164">movement possessed by the offender himself.  In my  opinion,
therefore,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_324">  the Indian Penal Code</a> does not come	 within	 the
ambit  of the words  "law imposing restriction on the  right
to move freely ".
</p><p id="p_165">    In the course of the arguments, the expression "punitive
detention"  was frequently used and the tendency was to	 put
it  on	the  same footing as preventive	 detention  for	 the
purpose of certain arguments. Punitive detention is  however
essentially  different from preventive detention.  A  person
is  punitively detained only after a trial for committing  a
crime  and after his guilt has been established in a  compe-
tent  Court of justice.	 A person so convicted can take	 his
case to the State High Court and sometimes bring it to	this
Court  also;  and he can in the course	of  the	 proceedings
connected  with	 his trial take all pleas available  to	 him
including  the plea of want of jurisdiction of the Court  of
trial and the invalidity of the law under which he has	been
prosecuted.   The final judgment in the criminal trial	will
thus constitute a serious obstacle in his way if he  chooses
to  assert  even after his conviction that his	right  under
<a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_325">article	 19 (1) (d)</a> has been violated.	But a person who  is
preventively  detained	has  not to face  such	an  obstacle
whatever other obstacle may be in his way.
</p><p id="p_166">    IV.	  It was pointed out that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_326">article 19</a> being  confined
to  citizens,  the anomalous situation will follow  that  in
cases of preventive detention, a citizen will be placed in a
better position than a non-citizen, because if a citizen  is
detained his detention will be open to some kind of judicial
review	under <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_327">article 19 (5</a>), but if a non-citizen has	been
detained his case will not be open to such review.  In	this
view,  it is said that the whole Act relating to  preventive
detention, may be declared to be void if it is unreasonable,
though	it concerns citizens as well as persons	 other	than
citizens.  I  must frankly state that I am not at  all	per-
turbed	by  this  argument.  It is a patent  fact  that	 the
Constitution has confined all the rights mentioned in  arti-
cle  19 (1) to citizens.  It is equally clear that  restric-
tions on those rights are to a limited extent at least	open
to judicial review-  The very same question which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">147</span>
raised in regard to <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_328">article 19 (1)(d)</a> will arise with regard
to  most of the other sub-clauses.  A citizen has the  right
to assemble peaceably and without arms, to form associations
or unions and so on.  If there is any law imposing unreason-
able restrictions on  any  of these rights,  that law	will
not be good law so far as citizens are concerned, but it may
be good law so far as non-citizens are concerned.  I do	 not
see why a similar situation arising with regard to the right
granted	 under sub-clause (d) should be stated to be  anoma-
lous.  So far as the right of free movement is concerned,  a
non-citizen has been granted certain protections in articles
21  and	 22.  If a ,citizen has been granted  certain  other
additional protections under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_329">article 19 (1) (d</a>), there is no
anomaly involved in the discrimination.	 I think that it  is
conceivable that a certain law may be declared to be void as
against	 a  citizen but not against a  non-citizen.  Such  a
result however should not affect our mind if it is found  to
have been clearly within the contemplation of the framers of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_167">    V.	It was contended that the rights declared by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_330">article
19</a>  are the rights of a free citizen and if he	has  already
been  deprived of his liberty in the circumstances  referred
to  in articles 20, 21 and 22, then it would be idle to	 say
that  he still enjoys the right referred to in	<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_331">article	 19.</a>
After  giving my fullest consideration to this	argument,  I
have not been able to appreciate how it arises in this case.
There  is nothing in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_332">article 19</a> go suggest that	 it  applies
only to those cases which do not fall under articles 20,  21
and  22. Confining ourselves to preventive detention, it  is
enough	to point out that a person who is  preventively	 de-
tained	must have been, before he lost his liberty,  a	free
man.  Why  can't he say to those who detained  him:   "As  a
citizen	 I  have  the right to move freely  and	 you  cannot
curtail	 or take away my right beyond the limits imposed  by
clause	(5)of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_333">article 19."</a>  This is the only question  which
arises	in  the case and it should not be  obscured  by	 any
abstruse or metaphysical considerations. It is true that  if
you put a man under detention, he cannot move and  therefore
he is not in a position to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">148</span>
exercise the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_334">article 19 (1) (d).</a>	 but
this is only the physical aspect of the matter and a  person
who  is	 bed-ridden  on account of disease  suffers  from  a
similar disability.  In law, however,. physical duress	does
not  deprive a person of the right to freedom  of  movement.
If he has been detained under some provision of law imposing
restrictions  on the freedom of movement, then the  question
will  arise whether the restrictions are reasonable.  If  he
has  been detained under no provision of law or	 under	some
law which is invalid, he must be set at liberty.
    To	my mind, the scheme of the Chapter dealing with	 the
fundamental  rights does not contemplate what is  attributed
to it, namely, that each article is a code by itself and  is
independent of the others.  In my opinion, it cannot be said
that articles 19, 20, 21 and 22 do not to some extent  over-
lap each other.	 The case of a person who is convicted of an
offence	 will come under articles 20 and 21 and	 also  under
<a href="/doc/88674/" id="a_335">article	 221</a> so far as his arrest and detention	 in  custody
before trial are concerned.  Preventive detention, which  is
dealt  with  in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_336">article 22</a>, also amounts to  deprivation  of
personal liberty which is referred to in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_337">article 21</a>, and  is
a  violation of the right of freedom of movement dealt	with
in  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_338">article 19 (1) (d).</a>	 That there are other  instances  of
overlapping  of articles in the Constitution may  be  illus-
trated	by  reference to <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_339">article 19 (1) (f)</a> and	 <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_340">article  31</a>
both  of which deal with the right to property and  to	some
extent	overlap	 each other.  It appears that  some  learned
High  Court Judges, who had to deal with the  very  question
before	us, were greatly impressed by the statement  in	 the
report of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly
on  <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_341">article  15 (corresponding to the present  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_342">article	21</a></a>),
that the word "liberty" should be qualified by the insertion
of  the	 word "personal" before it for otherwise it  may  be
construed  very widely so as to include the  freedoms  dealt
with  in  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_343">article 13 (corresponding to the  present  article</a>
</p><p id="p_168">19).  I am not however prepared to hold that this  statement
is decisive on the question of the construction of the words
used in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_344">article 19 (1) (d)</a> which are quite plain and can  be
construed without any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">149</span>
extraneous help.  Whether the report of the Drafting Commit-
tee and the debates on the floor of the House should be used
at all in construing the words of a statute, which are words
of ordinary and common use and are not used in any technical
or peculiar sense, is a debatable question; and whether they
can be used in aid of a construction which is a strain	upon
the language used in the clause to be interpreted is a still
more doubtful matter.  But, apart from these legal consider-
ations, it is, I think, open to us to analyse the  statement
and  see whether it goes beyond adding a somewhat  plausible
reason--a  superficially  plausible  reason--for  a   slight
verbal change in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_345">article 21.</a>  It seems clear that the  addi-
tion  of the word "personal" before "liberty" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_346">article  21</a>
cannot	change the meaning of the words used in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_347">article	 19</a>,
nor  can it put a matter which is inseparably bound up	with
personal  liberty  beyond its place.  Personal	liberty	 and
personal freedom, in spite of the use of the word  "personal
,"  are,  as we find in several books, sometimes used  in  a
wide sense and embrace freedom of speech, freedom of  .asso-
ciation,  etc.	These rights are some of the  most  valuable
phases or elements of liberty and they do not cease to be so
by the addition of the word "personal." A general  statement
by  the	 Drafting Committee referring to freedom  in  plural
cannot take the place of an authoritative exposition of	 the
meaning	 of the words used in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_348">article 19 (1)(d</a>),  which	 has
not  been  specifically referred to and cannot	be  such  an
overriding  consideration as to compel us to put  a  meaning
opposed	 to reason and authority. The words used in  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_349">article
19  (1) (d)</a> must be construed as they stand, and we have  to
decide	upon  the words themselves whether in the  .case  of
preventive  detention the right under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_350">article 19 (1) (d)</a>  is
or  is	not  infringed.	 But, as I shall  point	 out  later,
however literally we may construe the words used in  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_351">article
19 (1) (d)</a> and however restricted may be the meaning we	 may
attribute  to those words, there can be no escape  from	 the
conclusion  that preventive detention is a direct  infringe-
ment of the right guaranteed in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_352">article 19 (1) (d).</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">150</span>
<p id="p_169">    Having  dealt with the principal objections, I  wish  to
revert	once again to the main topic. The expressions  "per-
sonal  liberty" and" personal freedom" have, as we  find  in
several books, a wider meaning and also a narrower  meaning.
In  the	 wider sense,  they include not only  immunity	from
arrest and detention but also freedom of speech, freedom  of
association, etc.  In the narrower sense, they mean immunity
from  arrest and detention.  I have shown that the  juristic
conception of "personal liberty ," when these words are used
in  the sense of immunity from arrest, is. that it  consists
in freedom of movement and locomotion.	I have also  pointed
out that this conception is at the root of the criminal	 law
of  England and of this country, so far as the	offences  of
false  imprisonment and wrongful confinement are  concerned.
The  gravamen of these offences is restraint on	 freedom  of
movement. With these facts in view, I have tried to find out
whether	 there is any freedom of movement known	 in  England
apart from    personal liberty used in the sense of immunity
from  arrest and detention, but I find no trace of any	such
freedom.  In Halsbury's Laws of England (2nd Edition, volume
6,  page 391), the freedoms mentioned are the right to	per-
sonal  freedom (or immunity from detention or  confinement),
the  right to property, the right to freedom of speech,	 the
right  of  public meeting, the right  of  association,	etc.
Similar classifications will be found in Dicey's  "Introduc-
tion  to  the  Study of the Law	 of  the  Constitution"	 and
Keith's	 "Constitutional Law" and other books  on  constitu-
tional	subjects, but there is no reference anywhere to	 any
freedom	 or right of movement in the sense in which  we	 are
asked  to. construe the words used in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_353">article 19  (1)  (d)..</a>
In  the	 Constitutions of America, Ireland  and	 many  other
countries where freedom is prized, there is no reference  to
freedom	 or  right of movement as  something  distinct	from
personal  liberty used in the sense of immunity from  arrest
and  confinement.  The obvious explanation is that in  legal
conception no freedom or right of movement exists apart from
what  personal	liberty connotes and  therefore	 a  separate
treatment  of this freedom was not necessary. It is only  in
the Constitution of the Free
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">151</span>
City  of Danzig, which covers an area of 701  square  miles,
that  we find these words in <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_354">article 75 :--  "</a>All  nationals
shall enjoy freedom of movement within the City."  There  is
however	 no authoritative opinion available to	support	 the
view  that this freedom is anything different from  what  is
otherwise called personal liberty.  The problem of construc-
tion in regard to this particular right in the	Constitution
of  Danzig is the same as in our Constitution.	 Such  being
the  general  position, I am confirmed in my view  that	 the
juristic  conception  that personal liberty and	 freedom  of
movement  connote  the same thing is the  correct  and	true
conception, and the words used in <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_355">article 10 (1) (d)</a> must be
construed  according  to  this	universally  accepted  legal
conception.
</p><p id="p_170">    This conclusion is further supported by reference to the
war legislation in England and in India, upon which the	 law
of  preventive	detention, which has been in force  in	this
country since the war, is based. In the first world war, the
British Parliament passed the Defence of the Realm  Consoli-
dation	Act, in 1914, and a number of regulations were	made
under  it including regulation	14-B,  which permitted	 the
Secretary  of State to subject any person "to  such  obliga-
tions  and restrictions as hereinafter mentioned in view  of
his  hostile origin or associations."  Lord Atkin in  refer-
ring  to  this	regulation said in Liversidge  v.  Sir	John
Anderson  (1), "that the regulation undisputedly gave  to  a
Secretary of State unrestricted power to detain a  suspected
person."  Apparently, Lord Atkin meant that the	 restriction
referred to in the Act included preventive detention.  Under
this  regulation,  one	Arthur Zadig was  interned,  and  he
applied	 to  the King's Bench for a writ  of  habeas  corpus
which was refused. The matter ultimately came up before	 the
House  of Lords in Rex v. Halliday (2), and the noble  Lords
in  dealing with the case proceeded on the  assumption	that
there was no difference between internment and incarceration
or  imprisonment.  Lord Shaw in narrating the facts  of	 the
case stated :--
</p><p id="p_171">(1) [1942] A.C. 238.		     (2) [1917] A.C. 260.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">20</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">152</span>
<p id="p_172">      His person was seized, he has been interned  ......
The appellant lost his liberty and was interned	 ......"
</p><p id="p_173">    He then proceeded to state that there was no  difference
between internment and imprisonment and quoted the following
passage from Blackstone :--
</p><p id="p_174">    "The  confinement  of  the person, in any  wise,  is  an
imprisonment.  So that the keeping a man against his will in
a  private  house, putting him in the stocks,  arresting  or
forcibly detaining him in the street, is an imprisonment."
</p><p id="p_175">    Proceeding	on  this  footing (which I find	 to  be	 the
common	basis in all other speeches delivered in  the  case,
though	Lord  Shaw had given a	dissenting  judgment),	Lord
Finlay while dealing with the provisions of the	 regulations
observed :--
</p><p id="p_176">    "One  of  the most obvious means of	 taking	 precautions
against	 dangers  such as are enumerated is to	impose	some
restriction on the freedom of movement of persons whom there
may  be any reason to suspect of being disposed to help	 the
enemy "(1).
</p><p id="p_177">    Again,  Lord Atkinson while dealing with the  merits  of
the case made the following observations :--
</p><p id="p_178">    "If	 the  legislature chooses to enact that	 he  can  be
deprived  of  his liberty and incarcerated or  interned	 for
certain	 things for which he could not have been  heretofore
incarcerated or interned, that enactment and the orders made
under  it  if intra vires do not infringe  upon	 the  Habeas
Corpus	Acts  or  take away any	 right	conferred  by  Magna
Charta	......	,, (2).
</p><p id="p_179">    This passage read with the previous passage quoted by me
will  show that both internment and incarceration  were	 re-
garded as "restrictions on the freedom of movement "and that
deprivation  of liberty and restriction on freedom of  move-
ment  were used as alternative expressions bearing the	same
meaning.
</p><p id="p_180">    The	 same conclusion is to be drawn by reference to	 the
regulations  made in the last world war under the  Emergency
Powers	(Defence)Act,  1939. The regulation  which  directly
dealt-with detention orders was 18-B. This regulation and  a
number of other regulations have been placed in Part I under
the heading" Restrictions
(1) [1917] A.C. 269.		     (2) [1917] A.C. 272.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">153</span>
<p id="p_181">On  movements and activities of persons ."  The	 classifica-
tion is important, because it meets two principal  arguments
advanced in this case.	 It shows firstly that detention  is
a form of restriction and secondly that it is a	 restriction
on  movement.	I have noticed that" movement"	is  used  in
plural,	 and  the  heading also refers	to  restrictions  on
activities,  but, having regard to the	subjects  classified
under  this  head, movement undoubtedly refers	to  physical
movement and includes such movements as entering a  particu-
lar  locality, going from one place to another, etc.,  i.e.,
the very things to which <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_356">article 19 (1) (d)</a> is said to	have
reference.  In Liversidge's case, in construing	 the  provi-
sions  of  the	Act of 1939, Viscount  Maugham	observed  as
follows :--
</p><p id="p_182">    "The  language  of the Act of 1939 (above  cited)  shows
beyond doubt that Defence Regulations may be made which must
deprive	 the subject "whose detention appears to the  Secre-
tary  of  State to be expedient in the interests  of  public
safety" of all his liberty of movement while the regulations
remain in force"(1).
</p><p id="p_183">    Thus  Viscount Maugham also considered detention  to  be
synonymous with deprivation of liberty of movement.
    The	 classification that we find in the Defence  of	 the
Realm  Regulations  was with a	little	verbal	modification
adopted in the Defence of India Rules, and we find that here
also  rule 26,	which dealt with preventive  detention,	 has
been placed  under the heading "Restriction of movements and
activities  of persons."  A somewhat similar  classification
has  also  been adopted in a series of <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_357">Provincial  Act</a>s	 and
Ordinances  relating to maintenance of order [see section  2
of the Bihar Maintenance of Public Order. Act, 1949, section
16  of the West Bengal Security Act, 1948, section 4 of	 the
East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, section 2 of the Madras
Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1947, section 3 of the U.P.
Maintenance of Public Order Temporary Act, 1947, and section
2  of  the Bombay Public Security Measures  Act,  1947.	  In
these Acts and Ordinances, preventive detention and  certain
(1) [1942] A.C. 219.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">154</span>
<p id="p_184">other  forms of restriction on movement such as	 internment,
externment,  etc. have been classed together and dealt	with
more  or less on the same footing, and sometimes  they	have
been dealt with in different clauses of the same section. In
one of the Acts, the same advisory board is to deal with the
case of a detenue as well as that of an externed person, and
there  are also similar provisions giving them the right  to
represent their case to the Government.
</p><p id="p_185">    I  will  now assume for the sake of	 argument  that	 the
freedom of movement to which reference is made in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_358">article 19
(1) (d)</a> has nothing to do with personal liberty and that the
words which occur in the article bear the restricted meaning
attributed to them by the learned Attorney-General and	some
of  my colleagues. It seems to me that even on this  assump-
tion, it is difficult to arrive at any conclusion other than
what  I have already arrived at. There can be no doubt	that
preventive detention does take away even this limited  free-
dom of movement directly and substantially, and, if so, I do
not see how it can be argued that the right under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_359">article 19
(1)  (d)</a> is not infringed if the alternative  interpretation
is accepted.  We have only to ask ourselves:  Does a  person
who  is	 detained retain even a fraction of his	 freedom  of
movement in howsoever restricted sense the term may be	used
and does he not lose his right to move freely from one place
to  another  or visit any locality he likes as	a  necessary
result	of his detention ? I think I should refer here	once
more  to the fact that in the Defence of the  Realm  Regula-
tions  and Defence of India Rules, preventive  detention  is
classed	 under	the heading "Restriction  of  movements	 and
activities."   "Movement" is here used in plural and  refers
to that very type of movement which is said to be  protected
by  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_360">article  19 (1) (d</a>), moving from one State or  place  to
another,  visiting  different localities, etc.	One  of	 the
objects	 of 'preventive detention is to restrain the  person
detained from moving from place to. place so that he may not
spread	disaffection or indulge in dangerous  activities  in
the'  places he visits.	 The same consideration	 applies  to
the cases of persons who are  interned or externed.   Hence,
externment,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">155</span>
internment  and certain other forms of restriction on  move-
ment  have always been treated as kindred matters  belonging
to  the same group or family and the rule which	 applies  to
one must necessarily apply to the other.  It is difficult to
hold that the case of externment can possibly be dealt	with
on  a different footing from the case of  preventive  deten-
tion.	I am however interested to find that the  Patna	 and
Bombay	High Courts have held that a person who is  externed
can successfully assert that the right granted to him  under
<a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_361">article 19 (1) (d)</a> has been violated. This view has not been
seriously  challenged  before us, and, if it is	 correct,  I
really do not see how it can be held that preventive  deten-
tion  is also not a direct invasion of the right  guaranteed
in  <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_362">article 19 (1) (d).</a>	 Perhaps, one may pause here to	 ask
what  kind of laws were in contemplation of the	 framers  of
the  Constitution  when they referred to laws  imposing	 re-
strictions in the public interest in <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_363">article 19 (5).</a> I think
the war laws and the <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_364">Provincial Act</a>s and Ordinances to which
I  have	 already referred must have been among	them,  these
being laws which expressly purport to impose restrictions on
movements.  If	so,  we should not overlook  the  fact	that
preventive  detention was an inseparable part of these	laws
and  was  treated as a form of restriction on  movement	 and
classified  as such. It seems to me that when the matter  is
seriously considered, it would be found that the interpreta-
tion of the learned Attorney-General attracts the  operation
of  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_365">article  13 (2)</a> no less strongly and directly  than	 the
interpretation	I  have suggested, and I prefer	 the  latter
only because I consider that it is legally unsound to  treat
what  is  inseparably  bound up with and  is  the  essential
element	 in  the  legal concept 1of personal  liberty  as  a
wholly	separate  and  unconnected entity. But,	 as  I	have
already indicated, it will be enough for the purpose of this
case  if we forget all about personal liberty  and  remember
only  that detention is, as is self-evident and as has	been
pointed	 out by Viscount Maugham and other  eminent  judges,
another	 name for depriving a person of all his "liberty  of
movement."
</p><p id="p_186">    It was pointed out in the course of the arguments
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">156</span>
that  preventive detention not only takes away the right  in
<a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_366">article 19 (1) (d)</a> but also takes away all the other  rights
guaranteed  by	<a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_367">article 19 (1</a>), except the  right  to  hold,
acquire	 and dispose of property.  Where exactly this  argu-
ment  is intended to lead us to, I cannot fully	 understand,
but  it	 seems to me that it involves  an  obvious  fallacy,
because	 it overlooks the difference in the modes  in  which
preventive  detention operates on the right referred  to  in
sub-clause (d) and other sub-clauses of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_368">article 19 (1).</a>	 The
difference  is that while preventive detention	operates  on
freedom	 of movement directly and inevitably, its  operation
on  the other rights is indirect and consequential  and	 is,
often  only notional.  One who is preventively	detained  is
straightaway  deprived of his right of movement as a  direct
result of his detention, but he loses the other rights	only
in  consequence of his losing freedom of movement.   Beside%
while freedom of movement is lost by him in all reality	 and
substance, some of the other rights may not be lost until he
wishes to exercise them or is interested in exercising them.
A person who is detained may not be interested in freedom of
association  or may not pursue any  profession,	 occupation,
trade  or business.  In such a case, the rights referred  to
are lost only in theory and not as a matter of substance.  I
wish  only  to add that when I said that I was not  able  to
understand the full force of the argument which I have tried
to  deal  with, what I had, in mind was that  if  preventive
detention  sweeps  away	 or affects almost  all	 the  rights
guaranteed  in	article. 19 (1), the  matter  deserves	very
serious	 consideration and we cannot lightly lay  down	that
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_369">article 13 (2)</a> does not come into operation.
    Being  fully  alive	 to the fact that it  is  a  serious
matter to be asked to declare a law enacted by Parliament to
be unconstitutional, I have again and again asked myself the
question:   What  are we to put in the	scales	against	 the
construction  which I am inclined to adopt and in favour  of
the  view that preventive detention does not take  away	 the
freedom of movement guaranteed	in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_370">article 19 (1) (d)?</a>	 The
inevitable  answer has always been that while in one of	 the
scales
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">157</span>
we   have  plain  and  unambiguous  language,  the   opinion
eminent jurists, judicial dicta of high authority, constitu-
tional practice in the sense that no Constitution refers  to
any freedom of movement apart from personal liberty, and the
manner in which preventive detention has been treated in the
very  laws  on which our law on this subject is	 based,	 all
that  we can put in the opposite scale is a vague  and	ill-
rounded	 apprehension that some fearful object such  as	 the
revision  of  the Penal .Code is looming  obscurely  in	 the
distant	 horizon, the peculiar objection that the mere	men-
tion  of  the  scheduled tribes will alter  the	 meaning  of
certain	 plain words, the highly technical and	unreal	dis-
tinction between restriction and deprivation and the assump-
tion  not warranted by any express provision that  a  person
who  is	 preventively  detained cannot claim  the  right  of
freedom of movement because he is not a free man and certain
other  things which, whether taken singly or  ,collectively,
are too unsubstantial to carry any weight. In these  circum-
stances,  I am strongly of the view that <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_371">article  19  (1)(d)</a>
guarantees  the right of freedom of movement in	 its  widest
sense, that freedom of movement being the essence of person-
al liberty, the right guaranteed under the article is really
a right to personal liberty and that preventive detention is
a  deprivation	of that right.	I am also of the  view	that
even  on the interpretation suggested by the learned  Attor-
ney-General, preventive detention cannot but be held to be a
violation of the right conferred by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_372">article 19</a> <a href="/doc/768566/" id="a_373">,(1) (d).</a>  In
either	view, therefore, the law of preventive detention  is
subject	 to  such limited judicial review  as  is  permitted
under <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_374">article 19 (5).</a>  The scope of the review is simply  to
see  whether  any particular law  imposes  any	unreasonable
restrictions.  Considering that the restrictions are imposed
on a most valuable right, there is nothing revolutionary  in
'the  legislature  trusting  the Supreme  Court	 to  examine
whether an Act which infringes upon that right is within the
limits of reason.
</p><p id="p_187">    I  will now pass on to the consideration of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_375">article	 21</a>,
which runs as follows :-
</p><p id="p_188">    "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">158</span>
liberty except according to procedure established by law."
</p><p id="p_189">    Here again, our first step must be to arrive at a  clear
meaning	 of the provision. The only words which	 cause	some
difficulty  in	the proper construction of the	article	 are
"procedure established by law."
</p><p id="p_190">    The	 learned Attorney-General contended before  us	that
the word "law" which is used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_376">article 21</a> means  State-made
law  or	 law enacted by the State. On the other	 hand,	 the
learned counsel	 for the petitioner strongly contended	that
the  expression "procedure established by law" is used in  a
much wider sense and approximates in meaning to the  expres-
sion  "due  process of law" as interpreted  by	the  Supreme
COurt  of America in the earliest times and, if that is	 so,
it  means exactly what some of the American writers mean  to
convey by the expression "procedural due process."
</p><p id="p_191">    In	the course of the arguments, the  learned  Attorney-
General	 referred us to the proceedings in  the	 Constituent
Assembly  for  the purpose of showing that  the	 article  as
originally drafted contained the words "without due  process
of  law" but these words were subsequently replaced  by	 the
words  "except according to procedure established  by  law."
In my opinion, though the proceedings or discussions in	 the
Assembly are not relevant for the purpose of construing	 the
meaning	 of the expressions used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_377">article  21</a>,  especially
when  they are plain and unambiguous,  they are relevant  to
show  that  the Assembly intended to avoid the	use  of	 the
expression  "without due process of law."   That  expression
had  its roots in the expression "per legem terrae" (law  of
the  land)  used in Magna Charta in 1215.  In the  reign  of
Edward	III, 'however, the words "due process of  law"	were
used  in a statute guaranteeing that no person will  be	 de-
prived	of his property or imprisoned or indicted or put  to
death  without being brought in to answer by due process  of
law  (28, Edward III, Ch. III).	 The expression	 was  after-
wards  adopted in the American Constitution and also in	 the
Constitutions of some of the constituent States, though some
of the States preferred to use the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">159</span>
words "in due course of law" or "according to the law of the
land."	 [See  Cooley on "Constitutional  Limitations,"	 8th
Edn.  Vol.  II, pages 734-51.  In the  earliest	 times,	 the
American  Supreme  Court construed "due process of  law"  to
cover  matters of procedure only, but gradually the  meaning
of the expression was widened so as to cover substantive law
also, by laying emphasis on the word "due."  The  expression
was  used  in  such a wide sense that the  judges  found  it
difficult  to define it and in one of the cases it  was	 ob-
served as follows :--
</p><p id="p_192">    "It would be difficult and perhaps impossible to give to
those words a definition, at once accurate, and broad enough
to  cover every case.  This difficulty and perhaps  impossi-
bility was referred to by Mr. Justice Miller in Davidson  v.
New  Orleans,  where the opinion was expressed	that  it  is
wiser  to  ascertain  their intent and	application  by	 the
'gradual  process of judicial inclusion and  exclusion,'  as
the  cases  presented for decision shall require,  with	 the
reasoning on which such decisions may be rounded:"  Missouri
Pacific Railway Co. v. Humes (1).
</p><p id="p_193">    It	seems  plain that the Constituent Assembly  did	 not
adopt this expression on account of the very elastic meaning
given  to it, but preferred to use the words  "according  to
procedure  established by law" which occur in  the  Japanese
Constitution framed in 1946.
</p><p id="p_194">    It will not be out of place to state here in a few words
how  the  Japanese  Constitution came  into  existence.	  It
appears	 that  on the 11th October, 1945.  General  McArthur
directed  the Japanese Cabinet to initiate measures for	 the
preparation  of	 the  Japanese	Constitution,  but,  as	  no
progress  was made, it was. decided in February, 1946,	that
the problem of constitutional reform should be taken over by
the Government Section of the Supreme Commander's  Headquar-
ters.  Subsequently the Chief of this Section ,and the staff
drafted the Constitution with the help of American constitu-
tional	lawyers	 who were called to  assist  the  Government
Section in the task.  This Constitution, as a learned writer
has remarked, bore
(1)  115 U.S. 512 at page 513.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">21</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">160</span>
<p id="p_195">on  almost every page evidences of its	essentially  Western
origin,	 and this characteristic was especially	 evident  in
the  preamble  "particularly  reminiscent  of  the  American
Declaration of Independence, a preamble which,	it has	been
observed,   no	Japanese could possibly	 have  conceived  or
written	 and which few could even understand" [See  Ogg	 and
Zink's "Modern Foreign Governments"].  One of the character-
istics of the  Constitution  which  undoubtedly	 bespeaks of
direct American influence is to be found in a lengthy  chap-
ter, consisting of 31  articles, entitled "Rights and Duties
of the People," which provided for the first time an  effec-
tive  "Bill of Rights" for the Japanese people.	  The  usual
safeguards  have  been provided there  against	apprehension
without	 a warrant and against arrest or  detention  without
being  informed	 of the charges or  without  adequate  cause
(articles 33 and 34).
</p><p id="p_196">    Now	 there are two matters which deserve to	 be  noticed
:--(1)	 that the  Japanese  Constitution was framed  wholly
under  American influence; and (2) that at the time  it	 was
framed	the  trend  of judicial opinion in  America  was  in
favour	of  confining  the meaning of  the  expression	"due
process	 of  law" to what is expressed by  certain  American
writers by the somewhat quaint but useful expression "proce-
dural  due  process." That there was such a trend  would  be
clear  from the following passage which	 I quote  from	Carl
Brent  Swisher's "The Growth of Constitutional Power in	 the
United States" (page 107.):--
</p><p id="p_197">    "The  American history of its interpretation falls	into
three  periods.	 During the first period,  covering  roughly
the first century of government under the Constitution,	 due
process	 was interpreted principally as a  restriction	upon
procedure--and largely the judicial procedure--by which	 the
government  exercised its powers. During the second  period,
which,	again roughly speaking, extended through  1936,	 due
process	 was expanded to serve as a restriction	 not  merely
upon  procedure but upon the substance of the activities  in
which the government might engage. During the third  period,
extending from 1936 to date, the use of due
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">161</span>
process	 as a substantive restriction has been largely	sus-
pended or abandoned, leaving it principally in its  original
status as a restriction upon procedure."
</p><p id="p_198">     In the circumstances mentioned, it seems permissible to
surmise	 that the expression "procedure established by	law"
as used in the Japanese Constitution represented the current
trend  of  American  judicial opinion with  regard  to	"due
process of law," and, if that is so, the expression as	used
in our Constitution means all that the American writers have
read into the words "procedural due process."  But I do	 not
wish to base any conclusions upon mere surmise and will	 try
to examine the whole question on its merits.
</p><p id="p_199">     The  word "law" may be used in an abstract or  concrete
sense.	 Sometimes it is preceded by an article such as	 "a"
</p><p id="p_200">or    "the"    or  by	such   words	as    "any,"  "all,"
</p><p id="p_201">etc.,  and  sometimes it is used without  any  such  prefix.
But, generally, the word "law" has a wider meaning when used
in the abstract sense without being preceded by an  article.
The  question to be decided is whether the word "law"  means
nothing more than statute law.
</p><p id="p_202">     Now whatever may be the meaning of the expression	"due
process of law," the word "law" is common to that expression
as well as "procedure established by law" and though we	 are
not  bound  to adopt the construction put on "law"  or	"due
process	 of law" in America, yet since a number	 of  eminent
American Judges have devoted much thought to the subject,  I
am  not	 prepared to hold that we can derive  no  help	from
their opinions and we should completely ignore them.  I will
therefore  in the first instance set out certain  quotations
from  a few of the .decisions of the American Supreme  Court
construing  the	 word "law" as used in the  expression	"due
process	 of law," in so far as it bears on the	question  of
legal procedure.
</p><p id="p_203">     (1)   "Although  the legislature may  at  its  pleasure
provide new remedies or change old ones, the power is never-
theless	 subject  to  the condition that  it  cannot  remove
certain ancient land-marks,  or take away certain  fundamen-
tal rights which have been always
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">162</span>
recognized and observed in judicial procedures:" Bardwell v.
Collins (1).
</p><p id="p_204">    (2)'  'By the law of the land is most  clearly  intended
the  general law:  a law which	hears  before  it  condemns,
which  proceeds	 upon inquiry and  renders  judgments  only-
after  trial.  The meaning is that every citizen shall	hold
his  life,  liberty and property, and immunities  under	 the
protection  of	the  general rules  which  govern  society:"
Dartmouth College Case (2).
</p><p id="p_205">    (3) "Can it be doubted that due process of law signifies
a  right to be heard in one's defence ?	 If the	 legislative
department of the government were to enact a statute confer-
ring the right to condemn the citizen without any opportuni-
ty whatever of being heard, would it be pretended that	such
an  enactment would not be violative of the  Constitution  ?
If  this be true, as it undoubtedly is, how can it  be	said
that  the  judicial department. the source and	fountain  of
justice itself, has yet the authority to render lawful	that
which  if done under express legislative sanction  would  be
viola of the Constitution ? If such power obtains, then	 the
judicial department of the government sitting to uphold	 and
enforce the Constitution is the only one possessing a  power
to  disregard it.  If such authority exists then  in  conse-
quence	of their establishment, to compel obedience  to	 law

<p id="p_209">justice	 which inhere in every civilized system of  law	 and
which  are  at the root of it.	The result of  the  numerous
decisions in America has been summed up by Professor  Willis
in  his	 book on "Constitutional Law" at page  662,  in	 the
statement  that the essentials of due process are:  (1)	 no-
tice, (2) opportunity to be heard, (3)	an impartial  tribu-
nal, and (4) orderly course of procedure.  It is pointed out
by  the	 learned  author that these  essentials	 may  assume
different  forms in different circumstances, and so long  as
they are conceded in principle, the requirement of law	will
be  fulfilled.	For  example, a person	cannot	require	 any
particular  form or method of hearing, but all that  he	 can
require is a reasonable opportunity to be heard.  Similarly,
an  impartial tribunal does not necessarily mean a  judicial
tribunal in every case.	 So far as 'orderly course of proce-
dure  is concerned, he explains that it does not  require  a
'Court	to strictly weigh the ,evidence but it does  require
it to examine the entire record to ascertain the issues,  to
discover  whether  there are facts not reported and  to	 see
whether or not the law has been correctly applied to  facts.
The view expressed by other writers is practically the	same
as  that expressed by Professor Willis, though some of	them
do not expressly refer to the fourth element, viz.,  orderly
course	of procedure.  The real point however is that  these
four  elements	are  really different aspects  of  the	same
right, viz., the right to be heard before one is condemned.
    So far as this right is concerned, -judicial opinion  in
England	 appears to be the same as that in America. In	Eng-
land,  it would shock one to be told that a man can  be	 de-
prived	of  his	 personal liberty without a  fair  trial  or
hearing.  Such a case can happen if the Parliament expressly
takes  away  the right in question in an  emergency  as	 the
British Parliament did during// the last two world wars in a
limited	 number of cases. I will refer here to a  few  cases
which  show  that the fundamental principle  that  a  person
whose right is affected must be heard has been observed	 not
only  in     cases involving personal liberty but  also	 'in

come  before  administrative  or  quasi-judicial  tribunals.
Cooper	v. The Wadsworth Board of Works (1)was a case  under
an Act which empowered the District Board to alter or demol-
ish  a house where the builder had neglected to give  notice
of his intention. seven days before proceeding to lay or dig
the foundation.	 Acting upon this power, the Board  directed
the demolition of a building without notice to the  builder,
but  this was held to be illegal.  Byles 5. in dealing	with
the matter observed as follows :--
</p><p id="p_210">    "I	conceive they acted judicially, because they had  to
determine the offence, and they had to apportion the punish-
ment as well as the remedy. That being so, a long course  of
decisions,  beginning  with Dr. Bentley's case,	 and  ending
with  some very recent cases, establish that although  there
are  no	 positive  words in a  statute	requiring  that	 the
party-shall be heard, yet the justice of the common law will
supply the omission of the legislature.	 The judgment of Mr.
Justice	 Fortescue,  in	 Dr.  Bentley's	 case,	is  somewhat
quaint, but it is very applicable, and has been the law from
that time to the present.  He says, "The. objection for want
of  notice  can never be got over. The laws of God  and	 man
both  give the party an opportunity to make his defence,  if
he has any."
</p><p id="p_211">In the same case Erie C.J. observed :--
</p><p id="p_212">    "It	 has been said that the principle that no man  shall
be deprived of his property without an opportunity of  being
heard,	is limited to a judicial proceeding......  I do	 not
quite  agree with that;	 ......the law, I  think,  has	been
applied	 to many exercises of power which in  common  under-
standing would not be at all more a judicial proceeding than
would  be the act of the District Board in ordering a  house
to be pulled down."
</p><p id="p_213">    The	 observations  made  by Erie C.J.  were	 quoted	 and
applied	 by Sir Robert Collier in Smith v. The'	 Queen	(2),
and  the  observations	of Lord Campbell in  Regina  v.	 The
Archbishop of Canterbury (3) were to the. same effect.

<p id="p_215">   A  similar opinion was expressed by Sir  GeorgeJessel  in
Fisher v. Keane (1), Labouchere v. Earl of Wharncliffe	(2),
and Russell v. Russell (3).  In the last mentioned case,  he
observed as follows :--
</p><p id="p_216">    "It	 [Wood v. Woad (4)] contains a very valuable  state-
ment  by the Lord Chief Baron as to his view of the mode  of
administering justice by persons other than Judges who	have
judicial functions to perform which I should have been	very
glad  to have had before me on both those club cases that  I
recently heard, namely, the case of Fisher v. Keane and	 the
case of Labouchere v. Earl of	  Wharncliffe.	The  passage
I mean is this, referring   to a committee: 'They are  bound
in the exercise of  their functions by the rule expressed in
the  maxim  "audi  alteram partem," that no  man  should  be
condemned to consequences without having the opportunity  of
making	his defence.  This rule is not confined to the	con-
duct  of  strictly legal' tribunals, but  is  applicable  to
every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to
adjudicate  upon  matters involving  civil  consequences  to
individuals '."
</p><p id="p_217">    This opinion was quoted with approval by Lord Macnaghten
in  Lapointe v. L'Association etc. de Montreal (5).  In that
case,  on an application for pension by the appellant,	 who
had been obliged to resign, the Board of Directors,  without
any  judicial  inquiry into the circumstances,	resolved  to
refuse the claim on the ground that he was obliged to tender
his  resignation.     This procedure was condemned  by	Lord
Macnaghten as being "contrary to rules of society and  above
all  contrary  to  the elementary  principles  of  justice."
These  observations of Lord Macnaghten were referred to	 and
relied on in The King v. Tribunal of Appeal under the  Hous-
ing Act, 1919 (6). In that case, a company proposed to build
a  picture house and the local authority  having  prohibited
'the building, the company appealed under the Housing

<p id="p_220">(Additional Powers) Act,  1919, which contained a  provision
that an appeal could in certain cases be properly determined
without	 a hearing and that the appellate Court	 could	dis-
pense  with the hearing and determine the appeal  summarily.
It was held that the meaning of rule 7 was that the tribunal
on appeal might dispense with an oral hearing, not that they
might  dispense	 with a hearing of any kind, and  that	they
were bound to give the appellants a hearing in the sense  of
an  opportunity to make out a case.  The Earl of Reading  in
delivering the judgment observed:

stated by Kelly C.B. in Wood v. Woad in a passage which	  is
cited  with  approval by Lord Macnaghten in  Lapointe v.  L'
Association  etc.  de Montreal	......	"
</p><p id="p_222">    In	Local  Government  Board v.  Arlidge(1),  the  Local
Government  dismissed an appeal by a person against  whom  a
closing	 order had been made under Housing,  Town  Planning,
&amp;c.  Act, without an oral hearing and without being  allowed
to see the report made by the Board's Inspector upon 'public
local  inquiry.	  The House of Lords did not interfere	with
the order on the ground that the appeal had been dealt	with
by  an	administrative authority whose duty was	 to  enforce
obligations on the individual in the interests of the commu-
nity  and whose character was that of an  organization	with
executive functions.  The principle however was conceded and
lucidly	 set forth that when the duty of deciding an  appeal
is  imposed,  those whose duty it is to decide it  must	 act
judicially, and they must deal with the question referred to
them without bias  and	must  give to  each  of	 the parties
an opportunity of presenting its case, and that the decision
must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of  respon-
sibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice.
Commenting upon this case, which is generally regarded as an
extreme	 case,	Mr. Gavin Simonds, who afterwards  became  a
member of the House of Lords observes :--
</p><p id="p_223">(1) [1915] A.C.120.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">167</span>
<p id="p_224">    "I	think you would agree that if the  subjectmatter  of
such  proceedings as arc here indicated was the	 liberty  of
the  subject,  or indeed his life, you would regard  such  a
judicial  procedure as outrageous."  (See C.K. Allen's	"Law
and Orders," page 167).
</p><p id="p_225">    I have particularly referred to cases which were  before
administrative	tribunals,  because I have to deal  in	this
case with preventive detention which is said to be an execu-
tive  act and because I wish to point out that	even  before
executive authorities and administrative tribunals an  order
cannot	generally be passed affecting one's  rights  without
giving one such hearing as may be appropriate to the circum-
stances of the case.  I have only to add that Halsbury after
enumerating  the most important liberties which	 are  recog-
nized  in England, such as right of personal freedom,  right
to  freedom of speech, right of public meeting,	 etc.,	adds
:--
</p><p id="p_226">    "It seems to me that there should be added to this	list
the following rights which appear to have become well-estab-
lished--the right of the subject to have any case  affecting
him  tried  in	accordance with the  principles	 of  natural
justice, particularly the principles that a man may not be a
judge  in his own cause, and that no party ought to be	con-
demned	unheard,  or to have a decision	 given	against	 him
unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of putting
forward his case  ......  "(Halsbury's Laws of England,	 2nd
Edition, volume 6, page 392).
</p><p id="p_227">    The question is whether the principle that no person can
be  condemned  without a hearing by an	impartial   tribunal
which is well-recognized in all modern civilized systems  of
law  and which Halsbury puts on a par  with  well-recognized
fundamental rights cannot be regarded as part of the law  of
this  country.	I must confess that I find it  difficult  to
give  a	 negative answer to this  question.   The  principle
being part of the British system of law and procedure  which
we  have inherited, has been observed in this country for  a
very  long  the	 and is also deeply rooted  in	our  ancient
history, being the basis of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">168</span>
panchayat system from the earliest times.   The whole<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_378"> of the
Criminal  Procedure  Code</a>, whether it deals  with  trial  of
offences or with preventive or quasiadministrative  measures
such as are contemplated in <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_379">sections 107</a>, <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_380">108</a>, <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_381">109</a>, <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_382">110</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_383">145</a>,  is based upon the foundation of this principle, and it
is difficult to see that it has not become part of the	"law
of  the land" and does not inhere in our system of  law.  If
that is so, then "procedure established by law" must include
this  principle,  whatever else it may or may  not  include.
That  the word "law" used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_384">article 21</a> does not  mean	only
State-made  law is clear from the fact that though there  is
no statute laying down the complete procedure to be  adopted
in contempt of Court cases, when the contempt is not  within
the view of the Court, yet such procedure as now prevails in
these  cases  is  part of our law.   The  statute-law  which
regulates the procedure of trials and enquiries in  criminal
cases does not specifically provide for arguments in certain
cases,	but it has always been held that no decision  should
be  pronounced	without hearing arguments.  In a  number  of
cases, it has been held that though there may be no specific
provision  for notice in the statute, the provision must  be
read  into  the law. I am aware that some  Judges  have	 ex-
pressed	 a strong dislike for the expression  "natural	jus-
tice"  on the ground that it is too vague and  elastic,	 but
where  there  are well-known principles	 with  no  vagueness
about  them,  which all systems of law	have  respected	 and
recognized, they cannot be discarded merely because they are
in  the ultimate analysis found to be based on natural	jus-
tice.  That the expression "natural justice" is not  unknown
to our law is apparent from the fact that the Privy  Council
has  in	 many criminal appeals from this country  laid	down
that  it shall exercise its power of interference  with	 the
course	of criminal justice in this country when  there	 has
been a breach of principles of natural justice or  departure
from the requirements of justice. [See In re Abraham Mallory

<p id="p_228">King(1), and <a href="/doc/25987/" id="a_385">Bugga and others v. Emperor</a>(2).  In the present
case, there is no vagueness about the right claimed which is
the right to have one's guilt or innocence considered by  an
impartial body and that right must be read into the words of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_386">article 21.</a>  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_387">Article 21</a> purports to protect life and person-
al  liberty, and it would be a precarious protection  and  a
protection not worth having, if the elementary principle  of
law  under discussion which, according to Halsbury is  on  a
par with fundamental rights, is to be ignored and  excluded.
In the course of his arguments, the learned counsel for	 the
petitioner  repeatedly asked whether the Constitution  would
permit	a  law being enacted, abolishing the mode  of  trial
permitted by the existing law and establishing the procedure
of trial by battle or trial by ordeal which was in vogue  in
olden  times  in England. The question	envisages  something
which  is  not likely to happen, but it does raise  a  legal
problem	 which can perhaps be met only in tiffs way that  if
the  expression "procedure established by law" simply  means
any  procedure established or enacted by statute it will  be
difficult to give a negative answer to the question, but  ii
the  word "law" includes what I have endeavoured to show  it
does,  such an answer may be justified. It seems to me	that
there  is  nothing revolutionary in the	 doctrine  that	 the
words  "procedure established by law" must include the	four
principles  set out in Professor Willis' book, which,  as  I
have  already  stated,	are different aspects  of  the	same
principle  and which have no vagueness or uncertainty  about
them. These principles, as the learned author points out and
as the authorities show, are not absolutely rigid principles
but  are adaptable to the circumstances of each case  within
certain	 limits.  I have only to add that it  has  not	been
seriously  controverted	 that "law" in	this  article  means
valid  law and "procedure" means certain definite  rules  of
proceeding  and not something which is a mere  pretence	 for
procedure.
</p><p id="p_229">    I will now proceed to examine <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_388">article 22</a> of the  Consti-
tution which specifically deals with the subject
(1) A.I.R. 1943P.C. 211.	(2) A.I.R. 1919P. C. 108.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">170</span>
<p id="p_230">of  preventive	detention.  The first point to be  noted  in
regard	to  this  article is that it does  not	exclude	 the
operation of articles 19 and 21, and it must be read subject
to those two articles, in the same way as articles 19 and 21
must be read subject to <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_389">article 22.</a> The correct position  is
that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_390">article 22</a> must prevail in so far as there are specific
provisions  therein  regarding	preventive  detention,	but,
where  there  are no such provisions in	 that  article,	 the
operation of articles 19 and 21 cannot be excluded. The mere
fact  that  different aspects of the same  right  have	been
dealt  with in three different articles will not  make	them
mutually exclusive except to the extent I have indicated.
    I will now proceed to analyse the article and deal	with
its main provisions.  In my opinion, the main provisions  of
this  article  are  :--(1) that no person  can	be  detained
beyond three months without the report of an advisory  board
[clause	 4 (a) ]; (2) that the Parliament may prescribe	 the
circumstances  and the class or classes of cases in which  a
person	may be detained for more than three  months  without
obtaining  the opinion of an advisory board [clause 7  (a)];
(3) that when a person is preventively detained, the author-
ity making the order of detention shall communicate to	such
person	the  grounds on which the order is  made  and  shall
afford him the earliest opportunity of making a	 representa-
tion  against  the  order [clause (5) ]; and  (4)  that	 the
Parliament  may prescribe the maximum period for  which	 any
person	may  in any class or classes of	 cases	be  detained
under  any law providing for preventive detention [clause  7
</p><p id="p_231">(b) ].	The last point does not require any consideration in
this case, but the first three points do require  considera-
tion.
</p><p id="p_232">    In connection with the first point, the question  arises
as to the exact meaning of the words "such detention" occur-
ring in the end of clause 4 (a).  Two alternative  interpre-
tations were put forward: (1) "such detention" means preven-
tive  detention; (2) "such detention" means detention for  a
period	longer than three months.  If the first	 interpreta-
tion  is  correct, then the function of the  advisory  board
would  be to go into the merits of the case of	each  person
and simply
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">171</span>
report whether there was sufficient cause for his detention.
According  to the other interpretation, the function of	 the
advisory  board will be to report to the government  whether
there is sufficient cause for the person being detained	 for
more than three months. On the whole, I am inclined to agree
with the second interpretation.	 Prima facie, it is a  seri-
ous  matter to detain a person for a long period (more	than
three months) without any enquiry or trial.  But <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_391">article  22
(4)  (a)</a> provides that such detention may be ordered on	 the
report	of  the advisory board.	 Since the  report  must  be
directly connected with the object for which it is required,
the  safeguard provided by the article, viz., calling for  a
report	from  the advisory board, loses its  value,  if	 the
advisory  board is not to apply its mind to the vital  ques-
tion before the government, namely, whether prolonged deten-
tion (detention for more than three' months) is justified or
not.   Under <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_392">article 22 (4) (a</a>), the advisory board  has  to
submit its report before the expiry of three months and	 may
therefore do so on the eighty-ninth day.  It would be  some-
what farcical to provide, that after a man has been detained
for
eighty-nine days, an advisory board is to say whether '	 his
initial	 detention  was justified.  On the other  hand,	 the
determination  of the question whether	prolonged  detention
(detention  for	 more than three  months)is  justified	must
necessarily involve the determination of the question wheth-
er the detention was justified at all, and such an interpre-
tation	only can give real meaning and effectiveness to	 the
provision. The provision being in the nature of a protection
or safeguard, I must naturally lean towards the	 interpreta-
tion which is favourable to the subject and which is also in
accord with the object in view.
</p><p id="p_233">    The	 next question which we have to discuss	 relates  to
the  meaning  and scope of <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_393">article 22 (7)(a)</a> which  runs  as
follows:-
</p><p id="p_234">    "Parliament may by law prescribe---
</p><p id="p_235">(a) the circumstances under which, and the class or  classes
of  cases  in which, a person may be detained for  a  period
longer than three months under any law providing for preven-
tive detention without obtaining
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">172</span>
the  opinion  of an Advisory Board in  accordance  with	 the
provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4)."
</p><p id="p_236">    The	 question is what is meant by  "circumstances"'	 and
"class	or  classes of cases" used in this  provision.	This
question  has arisen because of the way in which  these	 ex-
pressions appear to have been interpreted and applied in the
Act  of	 Parliament  with which we are	concerned.   As	 the
matter is important and somewhat complicated, I shall try to
express	 my meaning as clearly as possible even at the	risk
of  some  repetition, and, in doing so, I  must	 necessarily
refer to the impugned Act as well as Lists I and III of	 the
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, under which Parliament
had  jurisdiction  to  enact it.  Item 9  of  List  I--Union
List--shows  that the Parliament has power to  legislate  on
preventive detention for reasons connected with (1) defence,
(2)  foreign  affairs, and (3) security of   India..   Under
List   III--Concurrent List--the appropriate item is item  3
which shows that law as to preventive detention can be	made
for  reasons connected with (1) the security of the   State,
(2) the maintenance of public order, and (3) the maintenance
of  supplies and services  essential to the community.	 The
impugned Act refers to all the subjects mentioned in Lists I
and III in regard to which law of preventive  detention	 can
be made. <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_394">Section 3</a> (1)of the Act, the substance of which has
already been mentioned, is important, and I shall  reproduce
it verbatim.
</p><p id="p_237">    "The Central Government or the State Government may-
</p><p id="p_238">     (a) if satisfied with respect to any person that with a
view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial

presence in India or with a view to making arrangements	 for
his expulsion from India,
    it	is necessary so to do, make an order directing	that
such person be detained."
</p><p id="p_243">    It will be noticed that all the subjects of	 legislation
concerning preventive detention occurring in item    of List
I are grouped in sub-clause (1) of clause (a). The  subjects
in  this group are three in number and, for  convenience  of
reference,  I shall hereafter refer to them as A, B  and  C.
In  sub-.clause	 (ii), we find grouped two  of	the  matters
referred  to in item 3 of List III, these being security  of
the  State and the maintenance of public order.	  These	 two
subjects, I shall refer to as D and E. In sub-clause  (iii),
reference  has	been made to the third matter in item  3  of
List III, and I shall refer to this subject as F.  With this
classification, let us now turn to the Constitution itself.
    On reading articles 22 (4) and 22 (7) together, it would
be clear that so long as <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_396">article 22 (4) (a)</a> holds the  field
and Parliament does not act under clause (7) (a) of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_397">article
22</a>, there must be an advisory board in every case, i.e.,  if
the  legislation relates to groups A to F, as it does  here,
there must be an advisory board for all these groups.
    <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_398">Article  22 (7)</a> however practically engrafts  an  excep-
tion.  It states in substance that the Parliament may by  an
Act  provide  for preventive detention for more	 than  three
months	without reference to an advisory board, but in	such
cases  it shall be incumbent on the Parliament to  prescribe
(1) the circumstances and (2) the class or classes of  cases
in  which such course is found to be necessary. If the	case
contemplated  in clause (4)(a)is the rule and  that  contem-
plated 'in clause (7) (a) is the exception, then the circum-
stances	 and  the  class or classes of cases must  be  of  a
special or extraordinary nature, so as to take the case	 out
of the rule and bring it within the exception.	It is always
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">174</span>
possible to draw the line between the normal or ordinary and
the  abnormal or  extraordinary cases. and this is what,  in
my opinion, the Parliament was	expected to do under  clause
(7)  (a).   I do not think that it was	ever  intended	that
Parliament could at its will treat the normal as the  abnor-
mal  or 'the rule as the exception.  But this  is  precisely
what  has  been done in this case-  All the items  on  which
preventive legislation is possible excepting one, i.e., A to
E,  have  been put within the exception, and  only  one,  F,
which relates to maintenance of supplies and services essen-
tial to the community, has been allowed to remain under	 the
rule. In other words, it is provided that there shall be  an
advisory board only for the last category, F, but no  provi-
sion  having been made for the other categories, A to E,  it
may  be assumed that the advisory board has  been  dispensed
with in those cases. The learned Attorney-General maintained
that  it would have been open to the Parliament to  dispense
with the advisory board even for the category F, and if such
a  course  had been adopted it would not have  affected	 the
validity of the Act.  This is undoubtedly a logical position
in  the sense that it was necessary for him to go as far  as
this  to justify his stand; but, in my opinion,	 the  course
adopted	 by  the Parliament in enacting <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_399">section	 12</a>  of	 the
impugned  Act is not what  is  contemplated  under   <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_400">article
22 (7)	(a)</a> or is permitted by it.  The	 circumstances to be
prescribed  must be special and extraordinary  circumstances
and  the class or classes of cases must be of the  same	 na-
ture.	In my opinion, the Constitution	 never	contemplated
that  the  Parliament should mechanically reproduce  all  or
most of the categories A to F almost verbatim and not  apply
its  mind to decide in what circumstances and in what  class
or classes of cases the safeguard of an advisory board is to
be dispensed with.
</p><p id="p_244">    I  may state here that two views are put forward  before
us as to how clauses (4) (a) and 7 (a) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_401">article 22</a> are  to
be read:--(1) that clause (4) (a) lays down the rule that in
all  cases  where detention for more than  three  months  is
ordered,  it should be done in consultation with and on	 the
report of the advisory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">175</span>
board,	and  clause (7) (a) lays down an exception  to	this
rule by providing that Parliament may pass an Act permitting
detention  for more than three months without reference	  to
an advisory board;  (2) that clauses (4)(a) and (7) (a)	 are
independent  clauses  making two  separate  and	 alternative
provisions  regarding detention for more than three  months,
in one case on the report of an advisory board and in  other
case  without reference to an advisory board.	 Looking  at
the substance and not merely at the words,  I am inclined to
hold  that clause (7) (a) practically engrafts an  exception
on  the rule that preventive detention for more	 than  three
months	can  be ordered only on the report  of	an  advisory
board,	 and so far  I have proceeded on that footing.	 But
it seems to me that it will make no difference to the  ulti-
mate  conclusion, whichever of the two views we	 may  adopt.
Even on the latter view, it must be recognized that the	 law
which the Constitution	enables the Parliament to make under
<a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_402">article	 22 (7) (a)</a> would be an exceptionally  drastic	law,
and, on the principle that an exceptionally drastic law must
be intended for an exceptional situation, every word of what
I  have said so far must stand.	 Clause (7) (a) is  only  an
enabling  provision, and it takes care to provide  that	 the
Parliament  cannot  go to the extreme limit to which  it  is
permitted  to  go without prescribing the class	 or  classes
cases  and the circumstances to which the extreme law  would
be applicable. It follows that the class or classes of cases
and the circumstances must be of a special nature to require
such legislation.
</p><p id="p_245">    It	was urged that the word "and" which  occurs  between
"circumstances" and "class or classes of cases" is used in a
disjunctive sense and should be read as "or," and by way  of
illustration  it was mentioned that when it is said  that  a
person may do this and that, it means that he is at  liberty
to  do either this or that.  I do not think that this  argu-
ment is sound.	I think that clause (7)(a) can be accurately
paraphrased somewhat as follows :--" Parliament may dispense
with an advisory board, but in that case it shall  prescribe
the circumstances and the class or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">23</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">176</span>
classes of cases  ........  "If this is the meaning, then  '
'and" must be read as "and" and not as "or";  and "may" must
be  read as "shall."  Supposing it was said that  Parliament
may  prescribe the time and place for the doing of a  thing,
then can it be suggested that both time and place should not
be  prescribed	? It seems obvious to me that the  class  or
classes of cases must have some reference to the persons  to
be detained or to their activities and movements or to both.
"Circumstances" on the other hand refer to something  extra-
neous,	such as surroundings, background, prevailing  condi-
tions,	etc.,  which might prove a fertile  field   for	 the
dangerous  activities of dangerous persons.   Therefore	 the
provision clearly means that both the circumstances and	 the
class  or classes of cases (which are two different  expres-
sions with different meanings and connotations and cannot be
regarded as synonymous) should be prescribed, and  prescrip-
tion  of  one  without prescribing the	other  will  not  be
enough.	 As I have already stated, such law as can be enact-
ed  under <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_403">article 22 (7) (a)</a> must involve, by reason of	 the
extreme	 limit to which it can go, serious  consequences  to
the persons detained.  It will mean (1) prolonged detention,
i.e.,  detention for a period longer than three months,	 and
(2) deprivation of the safeguard of an advisory board. Hence
<a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_404">article 22 (7) (a)</a> which purports to be a protective  provi-
sion  will  cease to serve its object unless it is  given  a
reasonable interpretation. To my mind, what it	contemplates
is that the law in question must not be too general but	 its
scope  should  be limited by prescribing both the  class  or
classes of cases and the circumstances.
</p><p id="p_246">    It	was contended that the expression "class or  classes
of  cases" is wide enough to enable the Parliament to  treat
any of the categories mentioned in Lists I and III, items  9
and 3 respectively, (i.e., any of the categories A to F)  as
constituting a class.  At first sight, it seemed to me to be
a  plausible  argument,, but the more I think about  it	 the
more unsound it appears to me.	The chief thing to be remem-
bered  is  what I have already emphasized  more	 than  once,
viz., that a special or extreme type of law must be  limited
to special classes of cases and circumstances.	Under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">177</span>
Constitution, the Parliament has to prescribe "the class  or
classes,"  acting within the limits of the power granted  to
it under Lists I and III.  The class or classes must be	 its
own  prescription and must be so conceived as to justify  by
their contents the removal of an important safeguard provid-
ed  by	the Constitution. Prescribing is more  than  a	mere
mechanical  process. It involves a mental effort  to  select
and  adapt the thing prescribed to the object for  which  it
has  to	 be  prescribed.  We find here that what  is  to  be
prescribed  is "class or classes" (and	also  "circumstances
").  We	 also find that what the law intends to	 provide  is
prolonged  detention (by which words I shall hereafter	mean
detention for more than three months) and elimination of the
advisory board.	 The class or classes to be prescribed	must
therefore have a direct bearing on these matters and must be
so  selected and stated that any one by looking at them	 may
say  :--"  That	 is the reason why the	law  has  prescribed
prolonged detention without reference to an advisory board."
In other words, there must be something to make the class or
classes	 prescribed fit in with an extreme type of  legisla-
tion--some  element of exceptional gravity or menace,  which
cannot	be  easily and immediately  overcome  and  therefore
necessitates  prolonged detention; and there must  be  some-
thing  to show that reference to an advisory board would  be
an undesirable and cumbersome process and wholly  unsuitable
for  the  exceptional situation to which  the  law  applies.
Perhaps a simple illustration may  make	 the position  still
clearer.  Under	 the Lists,  one of the	 subjects  on  which
Parliament  may	 make  a  law  of  preventive  detention  is
"matter	 connected  with  the maintenance  of public order."
<a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_405">The  Act</a> simply repeats this phraseology and states in	sec-
tion  3:  "with a view to preventing him (the person  to  be
detained)  from acting in a manner prejudicial to the  main-
tenance of public order."  This may be all right for <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_406">section
3</a>,  but <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_407">section 12</a> must go further.  An act prejudicial	 to.
the maintenance of public order may be an ordinary act or it
may  be an act of special gravity.  I think that <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_408">article  22
(7)(a)</a> contemplates that the graver and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">178</span>
more  heinous types of acts falling within the	category  of
acts  prejudicial  to the maintenance of  public  order	 (or
other  heads) should be prescribed so as to define and	cir-
cumscribe the area of an exceptional piece of legislation.
    That  some kind of sub-classification (if I may be	per-
mitted to use this word) of the categories A to F was possi-
ble  can be illustrated by reference to regulation 18-]3  of
the  British Defence of the Realm Regulations. This  regula-
tion  was  made under an Act of 1039 which  authorized	"the
making	of  regulations for the detention of  persons  whose
detention appears to the Secretary of State to be  expedient
in  the	 interests of public safety or the  defence  of	 the
realm."	 The two matters "public safety" and "defence of the
realm" are analogous to some of the heads stated in Lists  I
and  III.  It will be instructive to note that	under  these
two heads, regulation 18-B has set forth several subheads or
class  or  classes of cases in	which  preventive  detention
could be ordered.  These classes are much more specific than
what we find in section a of the impugned Act and  therefore
there is less chance of misuse by the executive of the power
to  order  preventive detention.  The classes  set  out	 are
these :--(1) If the Secretary of State has reasonable  cause
to  believe any person to be of hostile origin	or  associa-
tions, (2) if the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to
believe	 any person to have been recently concerned in	acts
prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm
or  in the preparation or instigation of such acts,  (3)  if
the  Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believe	 any
person to have been or to be a member of, or to have been or
to be active in the furtherance of the objects of, any	such
organization  as is hereinafter mentioned  ......   (a)	 the
organization is subject to foreign influence or control, (b)
the persons in control of the organization have or have	 had
associations  with, persons concerned in the government	 of,
or  sympathies with the system of government of,  any  Power
with  which His Majesty is at war, and in either case  there
is  danger of the utilization of the organization  for	pur-
poses  prejudicial  to the public safety, etc., (4)  if	 the
Secretary
 of  State has reasonable cause to believe that	 the  recent
conduct of any person for the time being in an area or	 any
words recently written or spoken by such a person expressing
sympathy with the enemy, indicates or indicate that   person
is likely to assist the enemy. I have only to point out that
the scope within which preventive detention can be legislat-
ed upon in this country is much larger than the scope  indi-
cated  in  the British Act under which Regulation  18-B	 was
framed, and therefore there is more scope for  specification
of  the	 circumstances as well as the class  or	 classes  of
cases under the impugned Act. But all that has been done  is
that  words which occur in the legislative Lists  have	been
taken and transferred into the Act.
</p><p id="p_247">    What  I have stated with regard to class or	 classes  of
cases also applies to the circumstances which are also to be
prescribed  under <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_409">article 22 (7) (a).</a>	These  circumstances
are  intended to supply the background or setting  in  which
the  dangerous activities of  dangerous persons might  prove
specially harmful.  They must be special circumstances which
demand a specially drastic measure and under which reference
to an advisory board might defeat the very object of preven-
tive  action.	The evident meaning of <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_410">article	22  (7)	 (a)</a>
seems  to be that the picture will not be  complete  without
mentioning both the classes and the circumstances. There was
some discussion at the Bar as to what kind of  circumstances
might have been specified.  It is not for me to answer	this
question,  but	I apprehend that an impending  rebellion  or
war,  serious  disorder	 in a particular area  such  as	 has
induced	 the Punjab Government to declare certain  areas  as
"disturbed  areas," tense communal situation, prevalence  of
sabotage or widespread political dacoities and a variety  of
other matters might answer the purpose the Constitution	 had
in view.
</p><p id="p_248">    I  will now try to sum up the result of a somewhat	pro-
tracted	 discussion  into  which I had to  enter  merely  to
clarify	 the  meaning of a very important provision  of	 the
Constitution  which  has,  in my  opinion,  been  completely
misunderstood  by the  framers of  the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">180</span>
impugned  Act.	It appears to me that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_411">article 22</a> deals	with
three classes of preventive detention :--
</p><p id="p_249">(1) preventive detention for three months;
</p><p id="p_250">    (2)	 preventive detention for more than three months  on
the report of the advisory board; and
    (3)	 preventive  detention for more	 than  three  months
without reference to the advisory board.
</p><p id="p_251">    If one has to find some kind of a label for these class-
es  for a clear understanding of the subject, one may  label
them  as  "dangerous,"	 "more dangerous" and "most  danger-
ous."	Now so far as the first two classes  are  concerned,
there  is  nothing to be prescribed under  the	Constitution
Apparently,  the authors of the Constitution were  not	much
concerned  about class No. (1), and they thought that in  so
far  as	 class No. (2) was concerned the  provision  that  a
reference  to the advisory board was necessary coupled	with
the  provision that detention was not to exceed the  maximum
period which may be fixed by the Parliament was enough.	 But
they did take care to make a special provision for class No.
(3),  and  it is extermly important for the liberty  of	 the
subject	 as well as for the smooth working of the  Constitu-
tion  that this provision should not be lightly treated	 but
should	receive a well considered  and reasonable  construc-
tion.	It  is elementary that the rigour of  a	 law  should
correspond  to or fit the gravity of the evil or  danger  it
aims at combating, and it is also evident that the law which
the Parliament has been permitted to enact under <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_412">article  22
(7)  (a)</a>  can, so far as rigour is concerned, go  to  the  I
farthest  limit.   It follows that the law  must  have	been
intended for exceptionally grave situations and	 exigencies.
Hence the authors of the Constitution have made it necessary
that  the Parliament should put certain specifications	into
the  Act which it is empowered to pass under <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_413">article 22	 (7)</a>
</p><p id="p_252">(a), so that by means of these specifications the  necessity
for enacting so drastic a law should be apparent on the face
of it, and its application should be confined to the classes
and  circumstances  specified. <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_414">The Act</a>	must  prescribe	 (1)
"c]ass	or classes of cases" which are to have reference  to
the persons.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">181</span>
<p id="p_253">against whom the law is to operate and their activities	 and
movements  and	(2) "circumstances" which would	 bring	into
prominence the conditions and the backgrounds against  which
dangerous  activities should call for special measures.	  By
means  of  such two-fold prescription, the  sphere  for	 the
application  of the law will be confined only to  a  special
type of cases--it will be less vague, less open to abuse and
enable	those who have to administer it to determine  objec-
tively when a condition has arisen to justify the use of the
power  vested in them by the law.   This, in my opinion,  is
the true meaning and significance of <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_415">article 22 (7) (a)</a>	 and
any  attempt  to  whittle it down will	lead  to  deplorable
results.
</p><p id="p_254">    Having stated my views as to the construction of <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_416">article
22 (7) (a</a>), I propose to consider at once whether <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_417">section 12</a>
of  the	 impugned Act conforms to the requirements  of	that
provision.  In my opinion, it  does not, because it fails to
prescribe  either the circumstances or the class or  classes
of  cases  in the manner required by the  Constitution.	  It
does  not  prescribe circumstances at all,  and,  though  it
purports to prescribe the class or classes, it does so in  a
manner	showing that the true meaning of the provision	from
which the Parliament derived its power has not been grasped.
I have sufficiently dwelt on this part of the case and shall
not  repeat what I have already said. But I must  point	 out
that  even  if it be assumed that the view advanced  by	 the
learned	 Attorney-General is correct and it was	 within	 the
competence  of	Parliament to treat any	 of  the  categories
mentioned in items 9 and 3 of Lists I and III as  constitut-
ing  a class and to include it without any qualification  or
change, the impugned section cannot be saved on account of a
two-fold error :--. (1) the word "and" which links "class or
classes" with "circumstances" in <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_418">article 22 (7) (a)</a> has been
wrongly	 construed  to mean "or ;" and (2)  the	 distinction
between	 "circumstances" and "class  or	 classes"  has	been
completely  ignored  and they are  used	 as  interchangeable
terms.	The first error appears to me to be quite a  serious
one, because though the Constitution lays down two  require-
ments and insists
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">182</span>
on the prescription of	circumstances  as  well as class  or
classes,  it  has been assumed in enacting <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_419">section  12</a>	that
prescription of one of them only will be enough.  The  other
error  is  still more serious and goes to the  root  of	 the
matter.	 There can be no doubt that circumstances and  class
or classes are two different expressions and have  different
meanings,  but the Act proceeds on the assumption that	cir-
cumstances  are	 identical with class or  classes,  as	will
appear	from  the words "any person detained in any  of	 the
following  classes  of cases or under any of  the  following
circumstances"	used in the section.  I have  already  shown
how  important	the  specification of  circumstances  is  in
legislation of such an extreme and drastic character. There-
fore, to confuse "classes" with "circumstances" and to	omit
to  mention "circumstances" at all are in my  opinion  grave
errors.	  There	 can, in my opinion, be no escape  from	 the
conclusion that <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_420">section 12</a> of the Act by which a most impor-
tant protection or safeguard conferred on the subject by the
Constitution has been taken away, is not a valid  provision,
since it contravenes the very provision in the	Constitution
under  which the Parliament derived its competence to  enact
it.
</p><p id="p_255">    I will now briefly deal with <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_421">article 22 (5)</a> which  makes
it incumbent on	 the  authority	 ordering preventive  deten-
tion  to communicate to the person detained the	 grounds  on
which  the order has been made and to give him the  earliest
opportunity of making a representation against the order. It
must be remembered that this provision is intended to afford
protection  to and be a safeguard in favour of	 a  detained
person,	 and it cannot be read as limiting any rights  which
he has under the law or any other provisions of the  Consti-
tution.	 If  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_422">article 21</a> guarantees that before a  person  is
deprived of his liberty he must be allowed an opportunity of
establishing  his  innocence before an	impartial  tribunal,
that  right  still remains. In point of fact,  there  is  no
express	 exclusion of that right in the Constitution and  no
prohibition against constituting an impartial tribunal.	  On
the other hand, the right to make a representation which has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">183</span>
been granted under the Constitution,  must carry with it the
right to the representation being  properly considered by an
impartial person or persons.  There must  therefore  be some
machinery   for properly examining the cases of the  detenus
and  coming  to the conclusion that they have not  been	 de-
tained	without	 reason.  If this right had  been  expressly
taken away by the Constitution, there would have been an end
of the matter, but it has not been expressly taken away, and
I am not prepared to read any implicit deprivation of such a
valuable right.	 The mere reference to an advisory board  in
<a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_423">article	 22 (4) (a)</a> does not,  if my interpretation  of	 the
provision is correct,  exclude the constitution of a  proper
machinery for the purpose of examining the cases of  detenus
on  merits.  The constitution of an advisory board  for	 the
purpose of reporting whether a person should be detained for
more than three months or not is a very different thing from
constituting a board for the purpose of reporting whether  a
man  should  be detained for a single day.  In	the  view  I
take,  all that Parliament could do under clause (7) (a)  of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_424">article	 22</a> was to dispense with an advisory board  for	 the
purpose	 contemplated in clause (4) (a) of that article	 and
not to dispense with the proper machinery, by whichever name
it may be called, for the purpose of examining the merits of
the case of a detained person.
</p><p id="p_256">    It	was argued that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_425">article 22</a> is a code by	 itself	 and
the whole law of preventive detention is to be found  within
its four corners.  I cannot however easily subscribe to this
sweeping  statement. The article does provide for some	mat-
ters of procedure, but it does not exhaustively provide	 for
them.  It is said that it provides for notice, an opportuni-
ty  to the detenu to represent his case, an  advisory  board
which  may  deal with his case, and for the  maximum  period
beyond which a person cannot be detained.  These points have
undoubtedly  been touched, but it cannot be said  that	they
have  been exhaustively treated.  The right to represent  is
given,	but  it is left to the legislature  to	provide	 the
machinery for dealing with the representation.	The advisory
board has been mentioned, but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">24</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">184</span>
it  is only to safeguard detention for a period longer	than
three  months.	 There is ample latitude still left  to	 the
Parliament, and if the Parliament makes use of that latitude
unreasonably,  <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_426">article	19 (5)</a> may enable the Court  to	 see
whether it has transgressed the limits of reasonableness.
    I will now proceed to deal with the Act in the light  of
the  conclusions I have arrived at.  So far as <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_427">section 3</a>  of
the  Act  is  concerned, it was contended that	it  is	most
unreasonable,  because it throws a citizen at the  mercy  of
certain	 authorities,  who may at their own will  order	 his
detention and into whose minds we cannot probe to see wheth-
er  there is any foundation for the subjective	satisfaction
upon which their action is to rest.  I am however unable  to
accept	this argument.	The administrative  authorities	 who
have  to  discharge their responsibilities have to  come  to
quick decisions and must necessarily be left to act on their
own judgment. This principle is by no means unreasonable and
it  underlies  all the preventive  or  quasi  administrative
measures  which	 are to be found in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_428"> the	 Criminal  Procedure
Code</a>.	Under  <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_429">section 107</a> of that code, it is left  to	 the
discretion of the magistrate concerned to determine  whether
in  his	 opinion there is sufficient ground  for  proceeding
against any person who is likely to occasion a breach of the
peace.	Under <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_430">section 145</a> also, his initial  action  depends
upon  his  personal satisfaction. Therefore I  do  not	find
anything wrong or unconstitutional in <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_431">section 3</a> of the	Act.
But I must point out that it is a reasonable provision	only
for the first step, i.e., for arrest and initial  detention,
and  must be followed by some procedure for testing the	 so-
called	subjective satisfaction, which can be done  only  by
providing a suitable machinery for examining the grounds  on
which  the  order of detention is made and  considering	 the
representations of the persons detained in relation to those
grounds.
</p><p id="p_257">    I do not also find anything radically wrong in <a href="/doc/1086093/" id="a_432">section 7</a>
of  the Act, which makes it incumbent on the authority	con-
cerned	to communicate to a detenu the grounds on which	 the
order has been made and to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">185</span>
afford him the earliest opportunity of making a	 representa-
tion  against the order. <a href="/doc/935622/" id="a_433">Section 10</a> which provides that	 the
advisory  board shall make its report within ten weeks	from
the date of the detention order is in conformity with  arti-
cle  22	 (4) (a) of the Constitution, and the  only  comment
which one can make is that Parliament was not obliged to fix
such a long period for the submission of a report and  could
have  made it shorter in ordinary cases.  The real  sections
which  appear to me to offend the Constitution are  <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_434">sections
12</a>  and <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_435">14</a>.  I have already dealt with the principal  objec-
tion  to  <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_436">section  12</a>, while discussing	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_437">article	 22 (7) (a)</a> and I am of the opinion that <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_438">section  12</a>
does  not conform to the provisions of the Constitution	 and
is  therefore ultra vires.  I also think that even if it  be
held  that it technically complies with the requirements  of
<a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_439">article	 22  (7) (a</a>), Parliament has acted  unreasonably  in
exercising its discretionary power without applying its mind
to  essential matters and thus depriving the detenus of	 the
safeguard  of an advisory board which the  Constitution	 has
provided  in  normal cases.  So far as <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_440">section	14</a>  is	con-
cerned,	 all my colleagues have held it to be  ultra  vires,
and, as I agree with the views expressed by  them, I do	 not
wish  to  encumber my judgment by      repeating in  my	 own
words  what  has been said so	   clearly and	so  well  by
them.  <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_441">Section 14</a> may be     severable from the other provi-
sions  of  the Act and it may not be possible to  grant	 any
relief	to the petitioner on the ground that <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_442">section  14</a>  is
invalid.  But I think that <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_443">section 12</a> goes to the very	root
of  the legislation inasmuch as it deprives a detenu  of  an
essential  safeguard,  and in my opinion the  petitioner  is
entitled  to a writ of habeas corpus on the ground  that  an
essential  provision of the Constitution has not  been	com-
plied  with.  This writ will of course be without  prejudice
to  any action which the authorities may have taken  or	 may
hereafter take against the petitioner under the penal law  I
have  to add this qualification because there  were  allega-
tions  of his being involved in some criminal cases but	 the
actual facts were not clearly brought out before us.

<p id="p_258">    I have only to add a few concluding remarks to my  judg-
ment.	In  studying the provisions of the impugned  Act,  I
could  not  help  instituting a comparison in  my  own	mind
between	 it  and similar legislation in England	 during	 the
last  two world wars.  I could not also help  noticing	that
the impugned Act purports to be a peacetime Act, whereas the
legislation to which I have referred was enacted during	 the
war. During the first war as well as the second, a number of
persons were detained and a number of cases were brought  to
Court in connection with their detention, but the two  lead-
ing  cases which will be quoted again and again are  Rex  v.
Halliday (1) and Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson(2).  We are
aware that in America certain standards which do not conform
to  ordinary and normal law have been applied by the  Judges
during the period of the war and sometimes they are  compen-
dionsly	 referred to as being included in "war power."	 The
two  English cases to which I have referred also  illustrate
the  same principle, as will appear from two short  extracts
which  I  wish to reproduce.  In Rex v. Halliday  (3),	Lord
Atkinson  observed  as	follows :--"  However  precious	 the
personal  liberty of the subject may be, there is  something
for  which  it may well be, to some  extent,  sacrificed  by
legal  enactment, namely, national success in the'  war,  or
escape from national plunder or enslavement."
</p><p id="p_259">    In Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson (4),  Lord  Macmillan
struck the same note in these words :--
</p><p id="p_260">    "The  liberty  which we so 'justly extol is	 itself	 the
gift  of the law and as Magna Charta recognizes may  by	 the
law  be	 forfeited  or abridged. At a time when	 it  is	 the
undoubted law of the land that a citizen may by conscription
or requisition be compelled to give up his life and all that
he  possesses  for  his country's cause it may	well  be  no
matter	for  surprise that there should be confided  to	 the
Secretary of State a discretionary power of  enforcing	 the
relatively  mild  precaution  of detention."

    These  passages represent the majority view in  the	 two
cases, but the very elaborate judgments of Lord Shaw in	 Rex
v. Halliday and that of Lord Atkin in Liversidge v. Sir John
Anderson show that there. was room for difference of opinion
as  well as for a more dispassionate treatment of  the	case
and the points involved in it.	It is difficult to say	that
there is not a good substratum of sound law in the celebrat-
ed  dictum of Lord Atkin that even amidst the clash of	arms
the  laws are not silent and that they speak the  same	lan-
guage  in war as in peace. However that may be, what I	find
is that in the regulations made in England during the  first
war as well as the second war there was an elaborate  provi-
sion  for an advisory board in all cases without any  excep-
tion,	which provided a wartime safeguard for	persons	 de-
prived	of their liberty. There was also a provision in	 the
Act  of	 1939 that the Secretary of State should  report  at
least  once in every month as to the action taken under	 the
regulation  including the number of persons  detained  under
orders	made  thereunder.  I find that	these  reports	were
printed and made available to the public.  I also find	that
the Secretary of State stated in the House of Commons on the
28th January, 1943, that the general order would be to allow
British	 subjects  detained  under the	Regulation  to	have
consultations  with their legal advisers out of the  hearing
of  an	officer.  This order applied to	 consultations	with
barristers and solicitors but not to cases where  solicitors
sent  to interview a detained person a clerk who was not  an
officer of the High Court. The impugned Act suffers in	com-
parison,  on account of want of such provisions, though,  so
far  as	 I can see, no great harm was likely  to  have	been
caused by setting up a machinery composed of either adminis-
trative	 or judicial authorities for examining the cases  of
detained persons so as to satisfy the essentials of fairness
and  justice.  <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_444">The Act</a> also suffers in comparison with	some
of  the later <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_445">Provincial Act</a>s in which the safeguard  of  an
advisory  board	 is , expressly provided for.  I  find	that
there  is a provision in <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_446">section 12</a> (2) of the Act  for	 the
review of the cases of detenus after six months, but this is
quite different
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">188</span>
from examining the merits of the case.	The object of such a
review	is  obviously to find out whether by reason  of	 any
change in the circumstances, a review of the original  order
is required.
</p><p id="p_262">    I hope that in pointing out the shortcomings of the	 Act
I  will not be misunderstood.  I am aware that both in	Eng-
land and in America and also in many other countries,  there
has  been a reorientation of the old notions  of  individual
freedom	 which	is gradually yielding to social	 control  in
many  matters.	I also realize that those who run the  State
have very onerous responsibilities, and it is not correct to
say  that  emergent conditions have  altogether	 disappeared
from  this country. Granting then that private	rights	must
often  be subordinated to the public good, is it not  essen-
tial  in  a free community to strike a just balance  in	 the
matter	?  That a person should be deprived of his  personal
liberty	 without a trial is a serious matter, but the  needs
of  society may demand it and the individual may often	have
to  yield  to those needs.  Still the  balance	between	 the
maintenance  of	 individual rights and public  good  can  be
struck only if the person who is deprived of his liberty  is
allowed	 a fair chance to establish his innocence, and I  do
not  see how the establishment of an  appropriate  machinery
giving	him such a chance can be an impediment to  good	 and
just government.
</p><p id="p_263">     PATANJALI SASTRI J.--This is an application under arti-
cle  32	 of  the Constitution of  India	 for  releasing	 the
petitioner   from  detention  in  jail without	trial  under
directions   purporting to  be issued by  the Government  of
Madras	under the Preventive Detention	Act,  1950,  and  it
has the distinction of being the first application  invoking
the  guaranteed protection of this Court as the guardian  of
Fundamental  Rights  against  alleged  infringement  of	 the
petitioner's  right  to	 freedom of movement.  As  the	case
involved  issues of great public importance and breaking  of
new  ground it was argued with thoroughness and	 ability  on
both  sides, reference being made to more or less  analogous
provisions of the Constitutions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">189</span>
other  countries and in particular the Constitution  of	 the
United States of America.
</p><p id="p_264">    The petitioner had been under detention previously under
orders passed by the said Government under the Madras  Main-
tenance	 of Public Order Act, 1947, but as the	validity  of
that Act and all other	 similar local public safety  enact-
ments	had  been questioned in some of the High  Courts  in
India  after the new Constitution came into force, the	Par-
liament	 enacted a comprehensive measure called the  Preven-
tive  Detention Act, 1950, (hereinafter referred to  as	 the
impugned Act) extending to the whole of India with a certain
exception not material here.
</p><p id="p_265">    <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_447">The	 Act</a> came into force on 25th February 1950, and,  on
the  27th February, the Government of Madras,  in  purported
exercise of the powers conferred by the impugned Act and  in
supersession  of earlier orders, directed the  detention  of
the  petitioner,   and the order was served on	him  on	 1st
March.	The petitioner contends that the impugned Act and in
particular  <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_448">sections  3</a>, <a href="/doc/1086093/" id="a_449">7</a>, <a href="/doc/935622/" id="a_450">10</a>, <a href="/doc/418681/" id="a_451">11</a>, <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_452">19</a>,, <a href="/doc/1937542/" id="a_453">13</a> and	 <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_454">14</a>  thereof
take  away  or abridge the fundamental right to	 freedom  of
movement in contravention of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_455">article 13 (2)</a> of the Constitu-
tion and is, therefore, void as declared therein.
    <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_456">Article 13</a> is one of a fasciculus of articles which	 are
comprised  in  part III of the	Indian	Constitution  headed
"Fundamental Rights."	This Part forms a new feature of the
Constitution  and  is the Indian "Bill of  Rights."   It  is
modelled  on the first ten Amendments of  the American	Con-
stitution   which declare the  fundamental  rights   of	 the
American citizen.  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_457">Article 12</a>, which is the first article in
this Part, defines "the State" as including the	 Governments
and Legislatures of the Union and the States as well as	 all
local  and other authorities against which  the	 fundamental
rights	are enforceable,  and <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_458">article 13 (1)</a>  declares	that
all  existing laws inconsistent with the provisions of	Part
III  shall,   to the extent of the inconsistency,  be  void.
Clause	(2) of the article,  on which the petitioner's	con-
tention is primarily founded reads as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">190</span>
<p id="p_266">     "The  State shall not make any law which takes away  or
abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law	made
in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of	 the
contravention, be void."
</p><p id="p_267">As  the	 constitutional inhibition  against  deprivation  or
abridgement  relates only to "the rights conferred  by	this
Part,"	it  is necessary first to ascertain the	 nature	 and
extent of the right which, according to the petitioner, Part
III has conferred on him, and, secondly, to determine wheth-
er the right so ascertained has been taken away or  abridged
by the impugned Act or by any of its provisions.  The  first
question turns on the proper interpretation of the  relevant
articles  of the Constitution, and the second  involves	 the
consideration of the provisions of the impugned Act.
</p><p id="p_268">     Mr. Nambiar appearing for the petitioner advanced three
main  lines of argument.  In the first place, the  right  to
move freely throughout the territory of India referred to in
<a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_459">article 19 (1)(d)</a> is of the very essence of personal  liber-
ty, and inasmuch as the detention authorised by the impugned
Act  was   not a "reasonable restriction"  which  Parliament
could  validly impose on such right under clause (5) of	 the
article,  the  impugned	 Act is	 void.	 Alternatively,	 the
petitioner  had a fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_460">article 21</a> not  to
be  deprived  of his personal liberty  except  according  to
procedure established by law, and the impugned Act by autho-
rising	detention otherwise than in accordance	with  proper
procedure took away that right and was therefore void.	And,
lastly,	 the provisions of the impugned Act	already	 re-
ferred	to were	 ultra vires and inoperative  as  Parliament
in enacting  them has overstepped the	  ]imitations placed
on its legislative power by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_461">article 22</a> clauses (4) to (7).
</p><p id="p_269">     Accordingly,  the	first  question	 for   consideration
is  whether <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_462">article 19 (1) (d)</a> and <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_463">(5)</a> is applicable to	 the
present	 case.	"Liberty," says John Stuart Mill,  "consists
in  doing  what one desires.  But the  liberty'	     of	 the
individual  must be thus far limited--he must not make	him-
self  a	 nuisance  to others."	Man, as	 a  rational  being,
desires	 to do many things, but in a civil society  his	 de-
sires have to be controlled, regulated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">191</span>
and  reconciled	 with the exercise of  similar	desires.  by
other  individuals.   Liberty has, therefore, to be  limited
in order to be effectively possessed.  Accordingly,  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_464">article
19</a>,  while  guaranteeing some of the most valued  phases  or
elements of liberty to every citizen as civil1 rights,	pro-
vides  for  their  regulation for  the common  good  by	 the
State	imposing  certain "restrictions" on their  exercise.
The power of locomotion is no doubt an essential element  of
personal liberty which means freedom from bodily  restraint,
and detention in jail is a drastic invasion of that liberty.
But the question is: Does <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_465">article 19</a>, in its setting in Part
III  of the Constitution, deal with the deprivation of	per-
sonal liberty in the sense of incarceration ? Sub-clause (d)
of clause (1) does not refer to freedom of movement simplic-
iter  but guarantees the right to move	freely	 "throughout
the  territory of India."  Sub-clause (e) similarly  guaran-
tees  the  right  to reside and settle in any  part  of	 the
territory  of India.  And clause (5) authorises the  imposi-
tion of "reasonable restrictions" on these  rights  in	 the
interests of the general public or for the protection of the
interests of any Scheduled Tribe.  Reading these  provisions
together,  it  is reasonably clear that they  were  designed
primarily to emphasise the factual unity of the territory of
India and to secure the right of a free citizen to move from
one  place in India to another and to reside and  settle  in
any  part of India unhampered by any  barriers	which	nar-
row-minded provincialism may seek to interpose.	 The use  of
the word "restrictions" in the various sub-clauses seems  to
imply,	in  the context, that the rights guaranteed  by	 the
article are still capable of being exercised, and to exclude
the idea of incarceration though the words "restriction" and
"deprivation"  are sometimes used as interchangeable  terms,
as restriction may reach a point where it may well amount to
deprivation.   Read  as a whole and viewed  in	its  setting
among  the group of provisions (articles 19-22) relating  to
"Right	to  -Freedom,"	<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_466">article	 19</a>  seems  to	my  mind  to
pre--suppose  that  the citizen to whom	 the  possession  of
these fundamental rights is secured retains the substratum
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">192</span>
of  personal freedom on which alone the enjoyment  of  these
rights	necessarily rests.  It was said that  subclause	 (f)
would  militate against this view, as the enjoyment  of	 the
right  "to acquire, hold and dispose of property"  does	 not
depend upon the owner retaining his personal freedom.	This
assumption is obviously wrong as regards  moveable   proper-
ties,	and  even  as regards  immoveables   he	  could	 not
acquire or dispose of them from behind the prison bars;	 nor
could  he "hold" them in the sense of exercising  rights  of
possession  and control over them which is what the	word
seems  to mean in the context.	But where, as a penalty	 for
committing  a  crime or otherwise, the citizen	is  lawfully
deprived of his freedom, there could no longer be any  ques-
tion  of his exercising or enforcing the rights referred  to
in  clause (1).	 Deprivation of personal liberty in  such  a
situation  is  not,  in my opinion, within  the	 purview  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_467">article 19</a> at all but is dealt with by the succeeding  arti-
cles  20 and 21.  In  other words, <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_468">article 19</a> guarantees  to
the citizens the enjoyment of certain civil liberties  while
they   are  free,  while  articles  20-22  secure   to	 all
persons--citizens  and non-citizens--certain  constitutional
guarantees in regard to punishment and prevention of  crime.
Different criteria are provided by which to measure legisla-
tive  judgments in the two fields, and a construction  which
would bring within <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_469">article 19</a> imprisonment in punishment  of
a  crime  committed or in prevention of a  crime  threatened
would,	as it seems to me, make a reductio  ad	absurdum  of
that  provision.  If imprisonment were to be regarded  as  a
"restriction"  of the right mentioned in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_470">article 19  (1)(d</a>),
it would equally be a restriction on the rights mentioned by
the other subclauses of clause (1), with the result that all
penal  laws providing for imprisonment as a mode of  punish-
ment  would have to run the gauntlet of clauses (2)  to	 (6)
before	their validity could be accepted.  For	instance,the
law  which imprisons for theft would, on that view, fall  to
be justified under clause (2) as a law sanctioning  restric-
tion  of freedom of speech and expression.  Indeed, a  Divi-
sion Bench of the Allahabad High Court,in a recent unreport-
ed decision brought to our notice
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">193</span>
applied the test of undermining the security of the State or
tending	 to  overthrow	it in determining  the	validity  or
otherwise of the impugned Act. The learned Judges  construed
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_471">article	 19</a>  as covering cases of  deprivation	of  personal
liberty	 and held,  logically enough, that inasmuch  as	 the
impugned Act, by authorising preventive detention, infringed
the right to freedom of speech and expression,	its validity
should be judged by the reservations in clause (2), and,  as
it  failed to stand that test, it was  unconstitutional	 and
void.
</p><p id="p_270">  Mr.	 Nambiar did not seek to go so far.  He drew a	dis-
tinction  between the right conferred by sub-clause (d)	 and
those conferred by the other sub-clauses.  He urged,  refer-
ring  to  Blackstone's Commentaries, that  personal  liberty
consisted  "in moving one's person to whatever	place  one's
inclination  might   direct," and that any law	 which	 de-
prived	 a person  of such power of locomotion was a  direct
invasion  of the right mentioned in sub-clause (d),  whereas
it inter-fered only indirectly and consequentially with	 the
rights	mentioned  in the other sub Clauses.   There  is  no
substance in the distinction suggested. It would be  illogi-
cal,  in construing <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_472">article 19</a>, to attribute to one  of	 the
sub-clauses  a scope and effect totally different  from	 the
scope  and effect of the others or to draw a distinc-.	tion
between one right and another in the group.  All the  rights
mentioned  in clause (1) are equally essential	elements  in
the liberty of the individual in any civilised and democrat-
ic  community, and imprison, ment operates as an  extinction
of  all	 of them alike. It cannot, therefore, be  said	that
deprivation  of personal liberty is an infringement  of	 the
right  conferred  by  sub-clause (d) alone but	not  of	 the
others.	 The  learned  Judges of the  Allahabad	 High  Court
realised this and were perfectly logical in holding that the
constitutional	validity of a law providing for	 deprivation
of  personal liberty or imprisonment must be judged  by	 the
tests  laid  down not only in clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_473">article  19</a>	 but
also in the other clauses including clause (2), though their
major  premise	that deprivation of personal liberty  was  a
"restriction"  within  the meaning of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_474">article 19</a> is,  in  my
judgment, erroneous.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">194</span>
<p id="p_271">It  was	 said that preventive detention being a	 drasic	 re-
striction  of the right to move freely was, in its pith	 and
substance,"  within <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_475">article 19 (1) (d)</a> read with clause	 (5)
and  not  within <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_476">article 21</a> which deals with crime  and	 its
punishment and prevention.  There    is no room here, in  my
opinion,  for the application of the rule of "pith and	sub-
stance."  As  pointed out by the Privy Council	in  Prafulla
Kumar  Mukherjee v. The Bank of Commerce Ltd.,	Khulna	(1),
approving  the observations of the Federal Court in  Subrah-
manyam	Chettiar  v. Muttuswamy Goundan (2),  the  rule	 was
evolved	 by  the Board for determining whether	an  impugned
statute was, in its true character, legislation with respect
to  matters  within the jurisdiction of one  legislature  or
another	 in a scheme of divided legislative power.  No	such
question arises here. What the Court has to ascertain is the
true scope and meaning of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_477">article 19</a> in the context of	Part
III of the Constitution, in order to decide whether depriva-
tion of personal liberty falls within that article, and	 the
pith and substance rule will be more misleading than helpful
in the decision of that issue. <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_478">Article 19</a>, as I have already
indicated,  guarantees	protection for	the  more  important
civil  liberties  of citizens who are in  the  enjoyment  of
their  freedom, while at the same time laying down  the	 re-
strictions which the legislature may properly impose on	 the
exercise  of  such  rights, and it has nothing	to  do	with
deprivation  of	 personal liberty or imprisonment  which  is
dealt with by the succeeding three articles.
    There is also another consideration which points to	 the
same conclusion.  The ]Drafting Committee of the Constituent
Assembly, to whose Report reference was freely made by	both
sides during the argument, recommended "that the word liber-
ty should be qualified by the insertion of the word 'person-
al  '  before it, for otherwise it might be  construed	very
widely so as to include even the freedoms already dealt with
in  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_479">article  13" (now <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_480">article 19</a>).</a> The	acceptance  of	this
suggestion shows that whatever may be the generally accepted
(1) 74 I.A. 23.			  (2) [1940] F.C.E. 188.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">195</span>
<p id="p_272">connotation  of	 the expression "personal liberty,"  it	 was
used  in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_481">article 21</a> in a sense which excludes  the  freedoms
dealt  with in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_482">article 19</a>, that is to say, personal  liberty
in the context of Part III of the Constitution is  something
distinct  from	the freedom to move  freely  throughout	 the
territory of India.
</p><p id="p_273">    It	was further submitted that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_483">article 19</a>  declared	 the
substantive  rights  of personal liberty  while	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_484">article  21</a>
provided the procedural safeguard against their deprivation.
This  view of the correlation between the two  articles	 has
found  favour  with some of the Judges in  the	High  Courts
which	have  had occasion to  consider	 the  constitutional
validity  of  the impugned Act.	 It is, however, to  be	 ob-
served that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_485">article 19</a> confers the rights therein  specified
only on the citizens of India, while <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_486">article 21</a> extends	 the
protection   of	  life	 and   personal	  liberty   to	 all
persons--citizens  and	noncitizens  alike.  Thus,  the	 two
articles do not operate in a conterminous field, and this is
one reason for rejecting the correlation suggested.   Again,
if  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_487">article 21</a> is to be understood as providing only  proce-
dural safeguards, where is the substantive right to personal
liberty	 of non-citizens to be found in the  Constitution  ?
Are  they denied  such	right  altogether ?  If	  they	 are
to  have  no right of personal liberty,	 why  is the  proce-
dural  safeguard in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_488">article 21</a> exended to them ?  And  where
is  that most fundamental right of all, the right  to  life,
provided for in the Constitution ?  The truth is that  arti-
cle  21, like its American prototype in the Fifth and  Four-
teenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United  States,
presents an example of the fusion of procedural and substan-
tive  rights  in  the same provision.  The  right  to  live,
though the most fundamental of all, is also one of the	most
difficult  to define and its protection generally takes	 the
form of a declaration that no person shall be deprived of it
save by due process of law or by authority of law. "Process"
or  "procedure"	 in this context connotes both the  act	 and
the  manner of proceeding to take away a man's life or	per-
sonal liberty.	And the first and essential step in a proce-
dure  established by law for such deprivation must be a	 law
made by a competent legislature
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">196</span>
Authorising such deprivation.  This brings me to the consid-
eration	 of  articles  21 and 22 to which  was	deroted	 the
greater part of the debate at the Bar.
</p><p id="p_274"> These articles run as	follows:
</p><p id="p_275">    "21.  No person shall be deprived of his life or person-
al liberty except according to procedure established by law.
</p><p id="p_276">       22.  (1) No person who is arrested shall be  detained
in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the
grounds for such arrest, nor shall he be denied the right to
consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of	 his
choice.

</p><p id="p_292">    Mr.	 Nambiar  urged that the word "law"  in	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_489">article  21</a>
should	be understood, not in the sense of an enactment	 but
as  signifying	the immutable and  universal  principles  of
natural justice--the jus naturale of the civil law--and that
the  expression "procedure established by law"	 meant	 the
same   thing as that famous  phrase  "due process   of	law"
in  the	 American  Constitution in  its	 procedural  aspect.
Numerous  American  decisions were cited to  show  that	 the
phrase	implied the basic requirements of (1)  an  objective
and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is  possi-
ble  to conform, (2) notice to the party of  the  accusation
against him, (3) a reasonable opportunity for him to  estab-
lish his innocence, and (4) an impartial tribunal capable of
giving an unbiased judgment Mr. Nambiar conceded that  these
requirements  might have to be modified or adapted  to	suit
the  nature of the particular proceeding and the  object  it
had in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">198</span>
view,  as for instance, in a case of  preventive  detention,
previous notice, which might result in the person  concerned
going  underground might be dispensed with  Learned  counsel
insisted that these requirements, being the very core of the
principles  of natural justice which transcended all  State-
made  laws, must be substantially complied with by  any	 law
governing  the	process of deprivation of life	or  personal
liberty, subject, of course, to any express provision in the
Constitution sanctioning their relaxation or dispensation in
any case or class of cases.  He also appealed to the  Pream-
ble of the Constitution as the guiding star in its interpre-
tation to support his thesis that, in view of the democratic
Constitution  which  the people of India have  purported  to
give themselves guaranteeing to the citizens certain  funda-
mental rights which are justiciabke, the provisions of	Part
III must be construed as being paramount to the	 legislative
will,	as otherwise the socalled fundamental right to	life
and personal liberty would have no protection against legis-
lative action, and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_490">article 13 12</a>) would be rendered  nugato-
ry.

human values as a means to the full evolution and expression

<p id="p_295">This  has been translated into positive law in Part  III  of
the  Indian  Constitution, and I agree	that  in  construing
these provisions the high purpose and spirit of the Preamble
as well as the constitutional significance of a	 Declaration
of Fundamental Rights should be borne in mind.	This, howev-
er, is not to say that the language of the provisions should
be  stretched  to square with this  or	that  constitutional
theory	in disregard of the cardinal rule of  interpretation
of any enactment, constitutional or other, that its  spirit,
no  less than its intendment should be	collected  primarily
from the natural meaning of the words used.
</p><p id="p_296">    Giving  full effect to these principles, however,  I  am
unable to agree that the term "law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_491">article 21</a> means	 the
immutable  and	universal  principles  of  natural  justice.
"Procedure  established by law" must be taken to refer to  a
procedure which has a statutory origin, for no procedure  is
known or can be said to have been established by such  vague
and  uncertain	concepts  as "the  immutable  and  universal
principles  of	natural justice."  In my opinion,  "law"  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_492">article 21</a> means "positive or State-made law."
</p><p id="p_297">    No	doubt,	the American Judges have adopted  the  other
connotation  in	 their	interpretation of  the	due  process
clause in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the  Ameri-
can  Constitution  (" Nor shall any person  be	deprived  of
life,  liberty	or property without due process of  law	 ").
But that clause has an evolutionary history behind it.	 The
phrase	has been traced back to 28 Edw. III Ch. 3, and	Coke
in  his Institutes identified the term with  the  expression
"the law of the land" in the Great Charter of John.  Even in
England where the  legislative omnipotence of Parliament  is
now  firmly  established,  Coke understood  these  terms  as
implying an inherent limitation on all legislation,and ruled
in  Dr. Bonham's Case (1) that "the common law will  control
Acts of Parliament and sometimes adjudge them to be  utterly
void when they are against common right and reason."  Though
this  doctrine	was later discarded in England as  being  "a

<p id="p_298">rather	than an authority to be followed" [per Willes J.  in
Lee  v.	 Dude  and Torrington Ry. (1)] it  gained  ground  m
America,  at first as a weapon in the hands of	the  Revolu-
tionists  with which to resist the laws of  Parliament,	 and
later as an instrument in the hands of the Judges for estab-
lishing	 the supremacy of the judiciary [see Calder v.	Bull
("')].	 In the latter half of the 19th century,  this	doc-
trine of a transcendental common law or natural justice	 was
absorbed  in the connotation of the phrase "due	 process  of
law"  occurring in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.	  By
laying emphasis on the word" due," interpreting "law" as the
fundamental  principles	 of natural justice and	 giving	 the
words  "liberty"  and "property" their widest  meaning,	 the
Judges	have  made  the due process clause  into  a  general
restriction  on all legislative power. And when	 that  power
was  threatened	 with  prostration by the  excesses  of	 due
process, the equally vague and expansive doctrine of "police
power,"	 i.e., the power of Government to  regulate  private
rights	in public interest, was evolved to  counteract	such
excesses.  All this has been criticised as introducing great
uncertainty in the state of the law in that country, for  no
one  could  be sure how due process of law  would  affect  a
particular  enactment.	A century after the phrase had	been
the  subject  of judicial interpretation one  learned  Judge
observed in 1877 that it was incapable of precise definition
and  that  its intent and application could only  be  ascer-
tained	by "the gradual process of inclusion and  exclusion"
[Davidson  v.  New  Orleans (3)]and, as	 recently  as  1948,
another	 Judge referred to the difficulty of  "giving  defi-
niteness  to  the  vague contours of due  process"  and	 "of
spinning  judgment  upon State action out of  that  gossamer
concept:" Haley v. State of Ohio (4).
</p><p id="p_299">     It	 is not a matter for surprise, therefore,  that	 the
Drafting Committee appointed by the Constituent Assembly  of
India recommended the substitution of the expression "except

established  by law" taken from the  Japanese  Constitution,
1946,  for  the	 words "without due process  of	 law"  which
occurred  in  the  original draft, "as the  former  is	more
specific."   In their Report the Committee added  that	they
have  "attempted to make these rights  (fundamental  rights)
and   the.  limitations to which they  must  necessarily  be
subject	 as definite as possible, since the Courts may	have
to pronounce upon them" (para. 5).  In the face of all these
considerations,	 it  is difficult to accept  the  suggestion
that "law" in. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_493">article 21</a> stands for the jus naturale of the
civil  law,  and  that the phrase  "according  to  procedure
established  by law" is equivalent to due process of law  in
its  procedural	 aspect, for that would have the  effect  of
introducing into our Constitution those "subtle and  elusive
criteria" implied in that phrase which it was the deliberate
purpose of the framers of our Constitution to avoid.
    On	the other hand, the interpretation suggested by	 the
Attorney-General  on behalf of the intervener that  the	 ex-
pression means nothing more than procedure prescribed by any
law  made by a competent legislature is hardly more  accept-
able.  "Established" according to him, means prescribed, and
if Parliament or the Legislature of a State enacted a proce-
dure,  however novel and ineffective for affording  the	 ac-
cused  person  a fair opportunity of defending	himself,  it
would  be sufficient for depriving a person of his  life  or
personal liberty.  He submitted that the Constituent  Assem-
bly  definitely rejected the doctrine of judicial  supremacy
When  it rejected the phrase "due process of law"  and	made
the  legislative will unchallengeable, provided	 only  "some
procedure"  was laid down.  The Indian Constitution   having
thus   preferred   the	English	 doctrine  of  Parliamentary
supremacy, the phrase "procedure established by law" must be
construed in accordance with the English view of due process
of  law, that is to say, any procedure which Parliament	 may
choose	to  prescribe.	 Learned counsel  drew attention  to
the speeches made by several members of the Assembly on	 the
floor  of the House for explaining, as he put it, the  "his-
torical background."  A speech
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">202</span>
made in the course of the debate on a bill could at best  be
indicative  of the subjective intent of the speaker, but  it
could  not reflect the inarticulate mental  processes  lying
behind the majority vote which carried the bill.  Nor is  it
reasonable to assume that the minds of all those legislators
were in accord.	 The Court could only search for the  objec-
tive  intent of the legislature primarily in the words	used
in  the	 enactment,  aided by such  historical	material  as
reports of statutory committees, preambles etc.	 I attach no
importance,  therefore, to the speeches made by some of	 the
members	 of  the Constituent Assembly in the course  of	 the
debate on <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_494">article 15 (now <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_495">article 21</a>).</a>
</p><p id="p_302">    The main difficulty I feel in accepting the construction
suggested  by  the Attorney-General is	that  it  completely
stultifies  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_496">article 13 (2)</a> and, indeed, the very  conception
of  a fundamental right.  It is of the essence of that	con-
ception	 that it is protected by the fundamental law of	 the
Constitution  against infringement by ordinary	legislation.
It  is not correct to say that the Constitution has  adopted
the  doctrine  of Parliamentary supremacy.  So far,  at	 any
rate, as Part III is concerned, the Constitution, as I	have
already	 observed, has accepted the American view of  funda-
mental	rights.	 The provisions of articles 13 and  32	make
this  reasonably clear.	 Could it then have been the  inten-
tion of the framers of the Constitution that the most impor-
tant fundamental rights to life and personal liberty  should
be  at	the mercy of legislative majorities as,	 in  effect,
they  would  be if "established" were to mean  merely  "pre-
scribed	 ?"  In other words, as an American Judge said in  a
similar	 context,  does the  constitutional  prohibition  in
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_497">article	 13 (2)</a> amount to no more than "You shall  not	take
away  life or personal freedom unless you choose to take  it
away," which is mere verbiage.	It is no sound answer to say
that, if <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_498">article 21</a> conferred no right immune from  legisla-
tive  invasion, there would be no question  of	contravening
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_499">article 13 (2).</a>	 The argument seems, to my mind, to beg	 the
question,  for it assumes that the article affords  no	such
immunity.  It is said that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_500">article 21</a> affords no  protection
against competent legislative action in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">203</span>
the  field  of	substantive criminal law, for  there  is  no
provision for judicial review, on the ground of	 reasonable-
ness  or  otherwise,  of such laws, as in the  case  of	 the
rights enumerated in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_501">article 19.</a>  Even assuming it to be  so
the construction of the learned Attorney. General would have
the  effect  of rendering wholly  ineffective  and  illusory
even  the  procedural protection which the article  was	 un-
doubtedly  designed to afford. It was argued that  "law"  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_502">article	 31</a> which provides that no person shall be  deprived
of his property "save by authority of law" must mean enacted
law  and that if a person's property could be taken away  by
legislative  action, his right to life and personal  liberty
need  not enjoy any greater immunity.  The analogy  is	mis-
leading.   Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_503">article 31</a> provides for payment  of
compensation and that right is justiciable except in the two
cases mentioned in clauses (4) and (6) which are of a  tran-
sitory character.  The constitutional safeguard of the right
to property in the said article is, therefore, not so  illu-
sory  or ineffective as clause (1) by itself might  make  it
appear, even assuming that" law" there means ordinary legis-
lation.
</p><p id="p_303">    Much  reliance was placed on the Irish case The King  v.
The Military Governor of Hare Park Camp (1) where the  Court
held that the term "law" in <a href="/doc/19636/" id="a_504">article 6</a> of the Irish Constitu-
tion of 1922 which provides that "the liberty of the  person
is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of his liberty
except	in accordance with law" meant a law enacted  by	 the
Parliament, and that therefore the Public Safety Act of 1924
did not contravene the Constitution.  The Court followed The
King  v. Halliday(2) where the House of Lords by a  majority
held  that  the Defence of the	Realm  (Consolidation)	Act,
1914, and the Regulations framed thereunder did not infringe
upon  the  Habeas Corpus Acts and the Magna Carta  "for	 the
simple reason that the Act and the Orders become part of the
law of the land."  But that was	 because,  as  Lord  Dunedin
pointed	 out "the British Constitution has entrusted to	 the
two Houses of parliament subject to the assent
(1)  [19241  2 I.R. 104.		   (2)	[1917]	A.C.
</p><p id="p_304">260.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">204</span>
of  the King, an absolute power untrammelled by any  written
instrument  obedience  to  which may be	 compelled  by	some
judicial  body," whereas the Irish  Constitution  restricted
the  legislative powers of the Irish Parliament by a  formal
declaration  of funda mental rights and by providing  for  a
judicial  review  of  legislation in  contravention  of	 the
Constitution  (<a href="/doc/948485/" id="a_505">article	65</a>).  This radical  distinction	 was
overlooked.
</p><p id="p_305">    The Attorney-General further submitted that, even on his
interpretation,	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_506">article  21</a> would be a	 protection  against
violation of the rights by the executive and by individuals,
an d that would be sufficient justification for the  article
ranking as a fundamental safeguard. There is no substance in
the  suggestion.  As pointed out in Eshugbayi Eleko v.	Gov-
ernment	 of Nigeria (Officer Administering) (1), the  execu-
tive could only act in pursuance of the powers given by	 law
and  no	 constitutional protection against  such  action  is
really	needed.	 Even in monarchical  Britain  the  struggle
between	 prerogative and law has long since ended in  favour
of  the latter. "In accordance with  British  jurisprudence"
said  Lord Atkin in the case cited above, "no member of	 the
executive  can interfere with the liberty or property  of  a
British subject except on the condition that he can  support
the  legality of his action before a Court of justice."	  As
for protection against individuals, it is a misconception to
think  that constitutional safeguards are  directed  against
individuals.  They are as a rule directed against the  State
and  its organs. Protection against violation of the  rights
by  individuals must be sought in the ordinary law.   It  is
therefore difficult to accept the suggestion that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_507">article 21</a>
was designed to afford protection only against infringements
by  the	 executive or individuals.  On	the  other  hand,the
insertion  of  a declaration of Fundamental  Rights  in	 the
forefront  of  the  Constitution, coupled  with	 an  express
prohibition  against  legislative  interference	 with  these
rights	(<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_508">article 13</a>) and the provision of  a  constitutional
sanction for the enforcement of such prohibition by means of
a judicial review (<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_509">article 32</a>) is, in my
(1) [1931] A.C. 662.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">205</span>
<p id="p_306">opinion,  a clear and emphatic indication that these  rights
are to be paramount to ordinary State-made laws.
   After  giving  the  matter my most  careful	and  anxious
consideration, I have come to the conclusion that there	 are
only  two possible solutions of the problem.  In  the  first
place,	a  satisfactory via media between  the	two  extreme
positions  contended  for  on either side may  be  found  by
stressing the word "established"  which implies some  degree
of  firmness,  permanence and general acceptance,  while  it
does  not exclude origination by statute. "Procedure  estab-
lished	by  law" may well be taken to mean  what  the  Privy
Council	 referred to in King Emperor v. Benoari	 Lal  Sharma
(1)  as "the ordinary  and well-established criminal  proce-
dure," that is to say, those settled usages and normal modes
of  proceeding	sanctioned by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_510"> the  Criminal  Procedure	Code</a>
which is the general law of criminal procedure in the  coun-
try.   Their  Lordships were referring	to  the	 distinction
between trial by special Courts provided by an Ordinance  of
the Governor-General and trial by ordinary Courts under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_511">	 the
Criminal  Procedure  Code</a>.  It can be no objection  to	this
view  that<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_512"> the Code</a> prescribes no single and uniform  proce-
dure for all types of cases but provides varying  procedures
for  different	classes of cases. Certain  basic  principles
emerge	as the constant factors common to all  those  proce-
dures,	and they form the core of the procedure	 established
by  law.  I  realise that even on this view,  the  life	 and
liberty	 of the individual will not be immune from  legisla-
tive  interference, for a competent legislature	 may  change
the  procedure	so as to whittle down the protection  if  so
minded.	 But, in the view I have indicated, it must not be a
change	ad  hoc for any special purpose or occasion,  but  a
change in the general law of procedure embodied in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_513"> the Code</a>.
So  long  as such a change is not effected,  the  protection
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_514">article 21</a> would be available.  The different measures
of constitutional protection which the fundamental right  to
life  and  personal liberty will enjoy under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_515">article  21</a>  as
interpreted in the three ways
(1) [1945] F.C.R. 161,175.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">206</span>
<p id="p_307">referred  to  above will perhaps be best  illustrated  by  a
concrete example.  Suppose that <a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_516">article 22 (1)</a> was not there
and Parliament passed an Act, as a temporary measure, taking
away  in certain cases the right of an accused person to  be
defended by a legal practitioner. According to the petition-
er's learned counsel the Act would be void as being contrary
to  the immutable principles of natural justice embodied  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_517">article 21</a>, whereas on the construction contended for by the
Attorney-General,  the Act would be perfectly valid,  while,
on  the view I have indicated above, the Act would  be	bad,
but if the denial of such right of defence is made a  normal
feature	 of the ordinary law of criminal procedure by  abro-
gating	<a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_518">section	 340</a>  (1)of<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_519"> the Code</a>, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_520">article  21</a>  would  be
powerless  to  protect against	such   legislative   action.
But   in a free democratic republic such  a drastic   change
in the normal law of procedure, though theoretically  possi-
ble,  would be difficult to bring about, and that  practical
difficulty  will be the measure of the	protection  afforded
by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_521">article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_308">    It was said that the safeguards provided in clauses	 (1)
and  (2)  of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_522">article 22</a> are more or less  covered  by	 the
provisions   of the  Criminal	Procedure' Code,  and	this
overlapping  would  have  been avoided if <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_523">article  21</a>	were
intended to bear the construction as indicated above.	 The
argument  overlooks that, while the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_524"> of  the	Code</a>
would  be  liable  to alteration  by  competent	 legislative
action, the safeguards in clauses (1)and (2) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_525">article	 22</a>,
being constitutional, could not be similarly dealt with: and
this sufficiently explains why those safeguards find a place
in the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_309">     The  only alternative to the construction I have  indi-
cated  above,  if a constitutional transgression  is  to  be
avoided,  would	 be to interpret the reference to  "law"  as
implying  a  constitutional amendment pro tanto, for  it  is
only a law enacted by the procedure provided for such amend-
ment (<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_526">article 368</a>) that could modify or override a fundamen-
tal right without contravening <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_527">article 13 (2).</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">207</span>
<p id="p_310">    The	 question next arises as to how far  the  protection
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_528">article 21</a>, such as it has been found to be, is avail-
able  to  persons under preventive  detention.	The  learned
Attorney-General contended that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_529">article 21</a> did not apply  to
preventive  detention at all, as <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_530">article 22</a> clauses  (4)  to
(7)  formed a complete code of constitutional safeguards  in
respect	 of  preventive detention,and, provided	 only  these
provisions are conformed to, the validity of any law  relat-
ing  to preventive detention could not be challenged.  I  am
unable	to agree with this view. The language of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_531">article  21</a>
is  perfectly  general and covers  deprivation	of  personal
liberty	 or incarceration, both for punitive and  preventive
reasons.  If it was really the intention of the	 framers  of
the Constitution to exclude the application of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_532">article 21</a> to
cases  of  preventive  detention, nothing  would  have	been
easier	than to add a reference to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_533">article 21</a> in clause	 (3)
of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_534">article 22</a> which provides that clauses (1) and (2) of the
latter	shall  not apply to any person who  is	arrested  or
detained  under any law providing for  preventive  detention
Nor is there anything in the language of clauses (4) to	 (7)
of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_535">article  22</a> leading necessarily to	the  inference	that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_536">article	 21</a>  is inapplicable to preventive detention.  These
clauses deal only with certain aspects of preventive  deten-
tion  such as the duration of such detention, the  constitu-
tion of an advisory board for reviewing the order of  deten-
tion  in certain cases, the communication of the grounds  of
detention  to  the person detained and the provision  of  an
opportunity  to him of making a representation	against	 the
order.	It  cannot  be said that these	provisions  form  an
exhaustive code dealing with all matters relating to preven-
tive detention and cover the entire area of protection which
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_537">article 21</a>, interpretedin the sense I have indicated  above,
would  afford to the person detained.  I am,  therefore,  of
opinion	 that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_538">article 21</a> is applicable to preventive  deten-
tion as well.
</p><p id="p_311">    I will  now proceed to examine whether the impugned	 Act
or any of its provisions under which the petitioner has been
ordered	 to be detained, takes away any of the	rights	con-
ferred	by  articles 21 and 22 or infringes  the  protection
afforded thereby.   The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">208</span>
outstanding  fact to be borne in mind in this connection  is
that  preventive detention has been given  a  constitutional
status.	  This sinister-looking feature, so strangely out of
place  in a democratic constitution which  invests  personal
liberty with the sacrosanctity of a fundamental right and so
incompatible with the promises of its preamble is  doubtless
designed  to prevent an abuse of freedom by anti-sOcial	 and
subversive elements which might imperil the national welfare
of  the infant Republic.  It is in this spirit that  clauses
(3)  to	 (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_539">article 22</a> should,  in my opinion,  be	con-
strued and harmonised as far as possible with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_540">article 21</a>  so
as  not to diminish unnecessarily the  protection   afforded
for  the  legitimate exercise of personal liberty.   In	 the
first  place,  as already stated, clause (3) of	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_541">article  22</a>
excludes  a,  person detained under any	 law  providing	 for
preventive  detention  from the benefit	 of  the  safeguards
provided  in clauses (1) and (2)  No doubt clause   (5)	  of
the same article makes	some amends for the  deprivation  of
these  safeguards in that it provides for the  communication
to  the person detained the grounds on which the  order	 has
been  made and for an opportunity being afforded to  him  of
making a representation against the order, but the important
right to consult and to be defended by a legal	practitioner
of  his choice is gone. Similarly, the	prohibition  against
detention in custody beyond a period of 24 hours without the
authority  of  a magistrate has also been taken away m cases
of  preventive detention.  It was not disputed that, to	 the
extent to which the express provisions of clauses (4) to (7)
authorised  the abrogation or abridgement of the  safeguards
provided  under	 other articles or  substitution  of   other
safeguards in a modified form, those express provisions must
rule.	Of the four essentials of the due process  on  which
Mr. Nambiar insisted,  (which also form part of the ordinary
and established procedure under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_542"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>,
though	I cannot agree that they are immutable	and   beyond
legislative  change)	 the requirements of notice  and  an
opportunity	    to	 establish  his innocence  must,  as
already stated,	 be taken to have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">209</span>
been  provided	for by clause (5)of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_543">article 22.</a>	 As  for  an
ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possible to
conform, <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_544">article 22</a> makes no  specific provision in cases of
preventive detention, and if such a safeguard can be said to
be    implicit	in the procedure established by law  in	 the
sense	 explained above in preventive detention  cases,  it
could  no doubt be invoked.  This point will  be  considered
presently  in dealing with provisions of the  impugned	Act.
The only   other  essential requirement, and the most essen-
tial  of all, is an impartial tribunal capable of giving  an
unbiassed   verdict.  This, Mr. Nambiar submitted, was	left
unprovided for by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_545">article 22</a>, the advisory board referred to
in clause (4)  (a) being, according to him, intended to deal
solely with the question of duration of the detention,	that
is  to	say, whether or not there was sufficient  cause	 for
detaining  the person concerned for more than three  months,
and  not  with	judging whether	  the  person  detained	 was
innocent.  A tribunal which  could give	 an unbiassed  judg-
ment  on that issue was an essential part of the  protection
afforded by article21 in whichever way it may be  interpret-
ed, and reference was made in this connection to the preven-
tive  provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_546"> of the Criminal Procedure Code</a> (Ch.  VIII).
The  impugned Act, not having provided for such	 a  tribunal
contravened  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_547">article 21</a> and was therefore void.	 It will  be
seen  that the whole of this argument is based on the  major
premise that the advisory board mentioned in clause (4)	 (a)
of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_548">article 22</a> is not a tribunal intended to deal  with	 the
issue of justification of detention.  Is that view correct?
</p><p id="p_312">    It was argued that the words "sufficient cause for	such
detention" in sub-clause (a) of clause (4) had reference  to
the  detention beyond three months mentioned in	 clause	 (4)
and  that  this view was supported by the language  of	sub-
clause (a) of clause (7) whereby Parliament is authorised to
prescribe  the	circumstances under'which and the  class  or
classes	 of  cases in which a person may be detained  for  a
period	longer than three months without the opinion  of  an
advisory board.	 In other words, learned counsel submitted,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">210</span>
the  combined  effect  of clauses (4) and (7)  was  that  no
person	could  be detained for a period	 over  three  months
without	 obtaining  the opinion of an  advisory	 board	that
there  was  sufficient cause for detention  for	 the  longer
period, except in cases where Parliament passed a law autho-
rising detention for such period even without the opinion of
an  advisory board. Thus, these two clauses  were  concerned
solely with the duration of the preventive detention, and so
was the advisory board which those clauses provided for that
purpose. I am unable to accept this view.  I am inclined  to
think  that  the words "such detention"	 in  sub-clause	 (a)
refer  back to the preventive detention mentioned in  clause
(4)  and  not to detention for a longer	 period	 than  three
months.	  An  advisory board, composed as it has  to  be  of
Judges	or lawyers, would hardly be in a position  to  judge
how  long  a  person under preventive  detention,  say,	 for
reasons	 connected with defence, should be  detained.	That
must be a matter for the executive authorities, the  Depart-
ment of Defence, to determine, as they alone are responsible
for  the defence of the country and have the necessary	data
for  taking a decision on the point.  All that	an  advisory
board can reasonably be asked to do, as a safeguard  against
the  misuse of the power, is to judge whether the  detention
is justified and not arbitrary or mala fide.  The -fact that
the advisory board is required to make its report before the
expiry of three months and so could submit it only a day  or
two  earlier cannot legitimately lead to an  inference	that
the board was solely concerned with the issue whether or not
the  detention should continue beyond that  period.   Before
any such tribunal could send in its report a reasonable time
must  elapse, as the grounds have to be communicated to	 the
person	detained, he has to make his representation  to	 the
detaining  authority which has got to be placed	 before	 the
board through the appropriate departmental channel.  Each of
these  steps  may, in the course Of official  routine,	take
some  time, and 'three months' period might well  have	been
thought a reasonable period to allow before the board  could
be-required to submit its report.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">211</span>
<p id="p_313">    Assuming,  however, that the words "such detention"	 had
reference  to the period of detention, there is no  apparent
reason	for confining the enquiry by the advisory  board  to
the  sole  issue  of duration beyond  three  months  without
reference  to the question as to whether the  detention	 was
justified or not.  Indeed, if is difficult to conceive how a
tribunal  could	 fairly	 judge whether a  person  should  be
detained for more than three months without at the same time
considering  whether  there  was sufficient  cause  for	 the
detention  at all.  I am of opinion that the advisory  board
referred  to in clause (4) is the machinery devised  by	 the
Constitution  for reviewing orders for preventive  detention
in  certain cases on a consideration of the  representations
made  by  the persons detained.	 This is the view  on  which
Parliament  has	 proceeded in enacting the impugned  Act  as
will be seen from <a href="/doc/1996234/" id="a_549">sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/935622/" id="a_550">10</a> thereof, and I think  it
is the correct view.  It follows that the petitioner  cannot
claim to have his case judged by any other impartial  tribu-
nal by virtue of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_551">article 21</a> or otherwise.
</p><p id="p_314">    Mr. Nambiar, however, objected that, on this view, a law
could authorise preventive detention for three months  with-
out  providing	for  review by any tribunal,  and  for	even
longer	periods if Parliament passed an Act such as is	con-
templated in sub-clause (a) of clause (7).  That may be	 so,
but, however deplorable such a result may be from the  point
of view of the person detained, there could be no remedy if,
on a proper construction of clauses (4) and (7), the Consti-
tution	is  found  to afford no higher	protection  for	 the
personal liberty of the individual.
</p><p id="p_315">    Turning  next  to the provisions of	 the  impugned	Act,
whose  constitutional  validity was challenged, it  will  be
necessary to consider only those provisions which affect the
petitioner before us.  In the first place, it was  contended
that <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_552">section 3</a>, which empowers the Central Government or the
State  Government to detain any person if it is	 "satisfied"
that it is necessary to do so with a view to preventing	 him
from  acting in any manner prejudicial to (among other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">212</span>
things)	 the  security of the State or	the  maintenance  of
public	order, cannot be said to comply with  the  procedure
established  by law, as the section prescribes no  objective
and  ascertainable standard of conduct to which it  will  be
possible to conform, but leaves it to the will and  pleasure
of  the Government concerned to make an order of  detention.
TIm  argument proceeds on the assumption that the  procedure
established by law is equivalent to the due process of	law.
I  have	 already endeavoured to show that it is	 not   Apart
from  this, the argument overlooks that for the purposes  of
preventive detention it would be difficult, if not  impossi-
ble  to	 lay  down objective rules  of	conduct	 failure  to
conform to which should lead to such detention.	 As tim very
term implies, the detention in such cases is effected with a
view  to prevent the person concerned from  acting  prejudi-
cially	to certain objects which the  legislation  providing
for such detention has in view.	 Nor would it be practicable
to indicate or enumerate in advance what acts or classes  of
acts  would be regarded as prejudicial.	 The  responsibility
for the security of the State and the maintenance of  public
order  etc. having been laid on the executive Government  it
must  naturally be left to that Government to  exercise	 the
power of preventive detention whenever they think the  occa-
sion demands it.
</p><p id="p_316">    <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_553">Section  12</a> came in for a good deal of  criticism.	That
section,   which  governs the  duration	 of  thepetitioner's
detention reads as follows :--
</p><p id="p_317">    "Duration  of  detention in certain	 cases.--Any  person
detained  in any of the following classes of cases or  under
any  of the following circumstances may be detained  without
obtaining  the	opinion of an Advisory Board  for  a  period
longer	than three months, but not exceeding one  year	from
the  date  of his detention, namely, where such	 person	 has
been  detained with a view to preventing him from acting  in
any manner prejudicial to:--
</p><p id="p_318">    (a)	 the defence of India, relations of India with	for-
eign powers or the security of India; or
</p><p id="p_319">    (b) the security of a State of the maintenance of public
order.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">213</span>
<p id="p_320">    (2) The case of every person detained under a  detention
order  to  which  the provisions of  sub-section  (1)  apply
shall,	within a period of six months from the date  of	 his
detention,  be	reviewed  where the order was  made  by	 the
Central	 Government or a State Government, by  such  Govern-
ment, and where the order was made by any officer  specified
in  sub-section (2)of <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_554">section 3</a>, by the State Government  to
which  such officer is subordinate, in consultation  with  a
person who is, or has been, or is qualified to be  appointed
as  a Judge of a High Court nominated in that behalf by	 the
Central Government or the State Government, as the case	 may
be."
</p><p id="p_321">    It was urged that this did not comply with the  require-
ments of clause (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_555">article 22</a> as it merely repeated	 the
"matters" or legislative topics mentioned in Entry 9 of List
I  and	Entry 3 of  List III of the Seventh Schedule to	 the
Constitution.  What Parliament has to do under clause(7)  of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_556">article	 22</a> is to prescribe "the circumstances	under  which
and  the   class  or  classes  of cases	 in which" a  person
may   be  detained  for a period  longer than  three  months
without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board.  It	 was
said  that  clause (4) (a) provided for	 ordinary  cases  of
preventive detention Where such detention could not continue
beyond	three  months without obtaining the  opinion  of  an
advisory  board,  whereas clause (7) (a) made provision	 for
special cases of detention for more than three months  with-
out  the  safeguard  of the advisory  board's  opinion,	 for
aggravated  forms of prejudicial conduct.  In  other  words,
clause (4) (a) laid down the rule and clause (7) (a) enacted
an exception.  It was therefore necessary for Parliarnent to
indicate  to  the detaining authority for its  guidance	 the
more  aggravated  forms of prejudicial	activity,  and	mere
mention of the subjects in respect  of which  Parliament  is
authorised  under  the	legislative lists to  make  laws  in
respect	 of  preventive detention could	 hardly	 afford	 any
guidance  to  such authority and should not be	regarded  as
sufficient  compliance with the requirements of clause	(7).
There is a two-fold fallacy in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">214</span>
this argument.	 In the first place, the suggested  correla-
tion between clause (4) (a) and clause (7) (a) as enacting a
rule  and  an  exception is, as a  matter  of  construction,
without foundation.  Reading clauses (4) and (7) together it
is  reasonably clear that preventive  detention	 could	last
longer	in two cases: (1) where the opinion of	an  advisory
board  is obtained,  subject however to a prescribed  period
[sub-clause  (a)of  clause (4)] and (2) where  a  person  is
detained  under a law made by Parliament  under	 sub-clauses
</p><p id="p_322">(a)  and (b) of clause (7) [sub-clause (b) of  clause  (4)].
These are two distinct and independent provisions.   It	  is
significant that sub-clause (b) of clause (4) is not  worded
as  a proviso or an exception to sub-clause (a) of the	same
clause	as it would have been if it was intended to  operate
as  such.  The attempt to correlate clause (4)(a)and  clause
(7)  (a) as a rule and an exception respectively is  opposed
both to the language and the structure of those clauses.
</p><p id="p_323">     'Secondly,	 the argument loses sight of the  fact	that
clause (7) deals with preventive detention which is a purely
precautionary measure which "must necessarily proceed in all
cases,	to  some  extent, on suspicion	or  anticipation  as
distinct from proof" [ per Lord Atkinson in Rex v.  Halliday
(1)  ]. The remarks I have' already made with  reference  to
the  absence of any objective rules of conduct in <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_557">section  3</a>
of the impugned Act apply also to this criticism of  section
</p><p id="p_324">12. It would be difficult, if not impracticable, to  mention
the variouscircumstances, or to enumerate the various class-
es  of	cases exhaustively in which a person should  be	 de-
tained	for more than three months for preventive  purposes,
except	in broad outline.  Suppose a person belongs  to.  an
organization  pledged to violent and subversive activity  as
its  policy.  Beyond his membership of theparty	 the  person
might have done nothing until he1 was arrested and detained.
But if released he might indulge in anything from the  mild-
est  form of prejudicial activity, like sticking  an  objec-
tionable handbill on a hoarding, to the most outrageous acts
of sabotage.
</p><p id="p_325">(1) L.R. 1917 A.C. 260, 275.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">215</span>
<p id="p_326">How  could the insertion in <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_558">section 12</a> of a long  series  of
categories of aggravated forms of prejudicial activities, or
the  enumeration of the various circumstances in which	such
activities  are likely to be indulged in, be of any  assist-
ance  to the detaining authority in determining whether	 the
person concerned should be detained for three months or	 for
a  longer period ?  All that would be necessary	 and  suffi-
cient for him to know for coming to a decision on the  point
is  that the person is a member of such an organisation	 and
will probably engage in subversive activities prejudicial to
the security of the State or the maintenance of public order
or,  in other words, he belongs to class (b) in <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_559">section	 12</a>.
While  enumeration  and classification in detail  would	 un-
doubtedly help in grading punishment for offences committed,
they  would  not be of much use in fixing  the	duration  of
preventive  detention.	 Sufficient guidance in	 such  cases
could  be given by broadly indicating the general nature  of
the prejudicial activity which a person is likely to indulge
in,  and that in effect is what Parliament has done in	sec-
tion  12.  Reference was made in this connection to Rule  34
of  the Defence of India Rules framed under the	 Defence  of
India  Act,  1939,  where "prejudicial act"  is	 defined  by
enumeration.  But it was also for the purpose of prohibiting
such acts [ Rule 38 sub-rule (1) ] and making them  offences
(sub-rule 5). And even there, the definition had to end in a
residuary  clause sweeping in acts likely "to prejudice	 the
efficient  prosecution	of the war, the defence	 of  British
India or, the public safety or interest." In Lists I and III
of  the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution six topics	 are
mentioned  in  respect of which Parliament could  make	laws
providing  for preventive detention, and <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_560">section 12</a>  of	 the
impugned  Act mentions five of them as being the classes  of
cases  or  the circumstances in which  longer  detention  is
authorised.    I fail to see why this could not be  regarded
as a broad classification of cases or a broad description of
circumstances where Parliament considers longer detention to
be justifiable.	 A class can well be designated with  refer-
ence to the end which one desires to secure, and the matters
referred to as classes (a)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">216</span>
and  (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_561">section 12</a> being clearly	 the
objects	 which Parliament desired to secure by enacting	 the
section, it seems to me that the classification with  refer-
ence  to  such general aims does not contravene	 <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_562">article  22
(7).</a>
</p><p id="p_327"> It was argued that Parliament did not, in enacting  <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_563">section
12</a>,  perform its duty of prescribing both the  circumstances
and  the class or classes of cases where  detention  without
obtaining   the	  advisory board's opinion could  be  for  a
period longer than three months.  The use of the disjunctive
"or"  between the word "circumstances" and the words  "class
or classes of cases"  showed,  it was said,  that Parliament
proceeded on the view that it need not prescribe both.	This
was  in contravention of <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_564">article 22 (7)</a> which used the	con-
junctive "and" between those words. There is  no  substance-
in   this  objection.	As I read  <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_565">article 22 (7)</a>  it  means
that  Parliament may prescribe either the  circumstances  or
the   classes of cases or both,	  and in  enacting   <a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_566">section
12</a>  Parliament evidently regarded the matters  mentioned  in
clause (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) as sufficiently indic-
ative both of the Circumstances under which and the  classes
in  which a person could be detained for the longer  period.
To  say,  for instance, that persons who are likely  to	 act
prejudicially to the defence of India may be detained beyond
three months is at once to "prescribe a class of persons  in
which  and the circumstances under which"  a person  may  be
detained for the longer period. In other words, the  classi-
fication  itself  may be such as to amount to  a  sufficient
description of the circumstances for purposes of clause (7).
The  circumstances which would justify precautionary  deten-
tion  beyond  three months without recourse to	an  advisory
board  must be far too numerous for anything approaching  an
exhaustive  enumeration, and it can, in my judgment,  be  no
objection  to  the validity of <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_567">section 12</a>  that	 no  circum-
stances are mentioned apart from the matters referred to  in
clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1).	 It would indeed  be
singular for the Court to strike down a parliamentary enact-
ment because in its opinion a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">217</span>
certain	 classification	 therein made is  imperfect  or	 the
mention	 of  certain circumstances is unspecific  or  inade-
quate.
</p><p id="p_328">    Lastly,  Mr.  Nambiar turned his attack  on	 <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_568">section  14</a>
which  prohibits the disclosure of the grounds of  detention
communicated  to the person detained and of the	 representa-
tion made by him against the order of detention, and  debars
the  Court from allowing such disclosure to be	made  except
for  purposes of a prosecution punishable under	 sub-section
(2) which makes it an offence for any person to disclose  or
publish	 such  grounds	 or   representation   without	 the
previous  authorisation	 of the Central	 Government  or	 the
State  Government as the case may be.  The  petitioner	com-
plains	that this provision nullifies in effect	 the  rights
conferred  upon	 him under clause (5) of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_569">article  22</a>  which
entitles  him to have the grounds of his detention  communi-
cated to him and to make a representation against the order.
If the grounds are too vague to enable him to make any	such
representation, or if they are altogether irrelevant to	 the
object	of  his detention, or are such as to show  that	 his
detention  is  not bona fide, he has the  further  right  of
moving this Court and this remedy is also guaranteed to	 him
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_570">article 32.</a> These rights and remedies, the  petitioner
submits, cannot be effectively excercised, if he is prevent-
ed  on pain of prosecution, from disclosing the	 grounds  to
the  Court.  There is great force in this  contention.	 All
that  the Attorney-General could say in answer was  that  if
the  other provisions of the Act were held to be  valid,  it
would not be open to the Court to examine the sufficiency of
the grounds on which the executive authority was "satisfied"
that  detention	 was necessary, as laid	 down  in  Machindar
Shivaji	 Mahar v. The King (1), and so the petitioner  could
not complain of any infringement of his rights by reason  of
<a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_571">section	 14</a>  which  enacted only a rule	 of  evidence.	 The
argument  overlooks that it was recognised in  the  decision
referred  to  above that it would be open to  the  Court  to
examine	 the  grounds of detention in order to	see  whether
they were relevant to the object which the legislature had

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">218</span>
<p id="p_329">in  view,  such	 as, for instance, the	prevention  of	acts
prejudicial to public safety and tranquillity, or were	such
as to show that the detention was not bona fide. An examina-
tion of the grounds for these purposes is made impossible by
<a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_572">section	 14</a>, and the protection afforded by <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_573">article  22	 (5)</a>
and  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_574">article  32</a> is thereby rendered nugatory.	 It  follows
that <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_575">section 14</a> contravenes the provisions of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_576">article 22 (5)</a>
and <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_577">article 32</a> in so far as it prohibits the person detained
from  disclosing to the Court the grounds of  his  detention
communicated to him by the detaining authority or the repre-
sentation  made by him against the order of  detention,	 and
prevents  the  Court from examining them  for  the  purposes
aforesaid, and to that extent it must be held under  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_578">article
13  (2)</a> to be void.  This however, does not affect the	rest
of  the Act which is severable.	 As the petitioner  did	 not
disclose  the grounds of his detention pending our  decision
on this point he will now be free to seek his remedy, if  so
advised, on the basis of those grounds.

MAHAJAN J.--The people of India having solemnly resolved  to
constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic on the
26th day of November 1949 gave to themselves a	Constitution
which came into force on the 26th January 1950.	 This is the
first  case  in	 which this Court has been  called  upon  to
determine  how	far the Constitution  has  secured  personal
liberty to the citizens of this country.
</p><p id="p_331">    A.K. Gopalan, the petitioner, who was already under	 the
custody of the Superintendent, Central Jail, Cuddalore,	 was
served with an order of detention under <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_579">section 3</a> (1) of the
Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950) on the	27th
February  1950.	 It was said in the order that the  Governor
of  Madras was satisfied that it was necessary to  make	 the
order  with  a	view to preventing him from  acting  in	 any
manner	prejudicial  to the security of the  State  and	 the
maintenance of public order.  On 20th March 1950 a  petition
was presented to this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_580">article 32</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">219</span>
of  the	 Constitution  praying for the issue of	 a  writ  of
habeas	corpus directing the State  of	 Madras	 to  produce
him before the Court and to set him at liberty.	 A writ	 was
accordingly  issued.   The return to the writ  is  that	 the
detention is legal under Act IV of 1950, enacted by  Parlia-
ment.	The  petitioner contends that the Act  abridges	 and
infringes certain provisions of Part III of the Constitution
and is thus outside the constitutional limits of the  legis-
lature and therefore void and unenforceable.
    The matter is one of great importance both be-cause	 the
legislative  power expressly  conferred by the 7th  Schedule
has  been impugned and	 because the liberty of the  citizen
is seriously affected. The decision of the question  whether
Act IV of  1950 takes away or abridges the rights  conferred
by  Part III of the Constitution depends on a  consideration
of two points:
</p><p id="p_332">    (1) In what measure has the Constitution secured person-
al liberty to a citizen of India, and.
</p><p id="p_333"> (2) has the impugned  legislation in any way taken away  or
abridged the rights so secured and if so, to what extent ?
</p><p id="p_334">    Act	  IV  of 1950 provides for preventive  detention  in
certain cases and it has  been enacted as a temporary  meas-
ure.   It will cease to have effect on 1st April 1951.	  It
empowers the Central Government and the State Governments to
make an order directing a person to  be detained with a view
to  preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial  to
the  defence of India, the relations of India  with  foreign
powers	or  the security of India. It also  gives  power  to
detain	a person who acts in any manner prejudicial  to	 the
security of the State or the maintenance of public order  or
the  maintenance of supplies and services essential  to	 the
community.  It came into force on 26th February 1950 and was
enacted	 by virtue of the powers conferred on Parliament  by
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_581">article	 22</a> clause (7) of Part III of the Constitution	read
with the entries in the 7th Schedule.  There can be no doubt
that the legislative will expressed herein
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">220</span>
would  be enforceable unless the legislature has  failed  to
keep within its constitutional limits.	It is quite  obvious
that the Court cannot declare a statute unconstitutional and
void  simply on the ground of unjust and  oppressive  provi-
sions	or   because  it is supposed   to  violate  natural,
social	or political rights of citizens unless it it can  be
shown  that such injustice is prohibited or such rights	 are
guaranteed or protected by the Constitution.  It may also be
observed that an Act cannot be declared void because in	 the
opinion of the Court it is opposed to the spirit supposed to
pervade the Constitution but not so expressed in words.	  It
is difficult on any general principles to limit the  omnipo-
tence of the sovereign legislative power by judicial  inter-
position except in so far as the express words of a  written
Constitution  give  that authority. <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_582">Article 13	(2)</a>  of	 our
Constitution  gives  such  an authority and  to	 the  extent
stated	therein.  It says that the State shall not make	 any
law  which  takes away or abridges the rights  conferred  by
this  Part and any law made in contravention of this  clause
shall to the extent of the contravention be void.
    Preventive	detention laws are repugnant  to  democratic
constitutions  and they cannot be found to exist in  any  of
the democratic countries of the world.	It was stated at the
Bar  that no such law was in force in the United  States  of
America.   In  England for the first time during  the  first
world  war certain regulations framed under the	 Defence  of
the  Realm  Act	 provided for preventive  detention  at	 the
satisfaction of the Home Secretary as a war measure and they
ceased to have effect at the conclusion of hostilities.	 The
same  thing  happened during thesecond world  war.   Similar
regulations were introduced during the period of the war  in
India  under  the Defence of India Act.	 The  Government  of
India  Act,  1935, conferred authority on  the	Central	 and
Provincial  Legislatures to enact laws on this	subject	 for
the  first  time and since then laws on	 this  subject	have
taken  firm  root here and have become a permanent  part  of
the  statute book of this country.  Curiously  enough,	this
subject has found place in the Constitution in the.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">221</span>
<p id="p_335">chapter on Fundamental Rights. Entry 9 of the Union List and
Entry  3 of the Concurrent List of the 7th Schedule  mention
the  scope of legislative power of Parliament in respect  of
this topic.  The jurisdiction, however, to enact these	laws
is  subject to the provisions of Part III of  the  Constitu-
tion.  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_583">Article 22</a> in this Part provides :--
</p><p id="p_336">     "(1  ) No person who is arrested shall be	detained  in

</p><p id="p_337">    (2) Every person who is arrested and detained in custody
shall  be  produced  before the nearest magistrate within  a

three months unless-
</p><p id="p_341">      (a)  an Advisory Board consisting of persons who	are,

cient cause for such detention:
</p><p id="p_342">    Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorise

scribed	 by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause	 (b)

nicate	to  such person the grounds on which the  order	 has
been  made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity  of
making a representation against the order.
    (6)	 Nothing in clause  (5) shall require the  authority
making	any such order as is referred to in that clause	 to,
disclose facts which such authority considers to be  against
the public interest to disclose,

ing for preventive detention; and
</p><p id="p_348">    (c) the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in
an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4)."
</p><p id="p_349">    The	 question  of  the constitutional  validity  of	 the
impugned statute has to be approached with great caution  in
view  of these provisions of the Constitution and has to  be
considered with patient attention.  The benefit of  reasona-
ble  doubt has to be resolved in favour of  legislative	 ac-
tion, though such a presumption is not conclusive-  It seems
that the subject of preventive detention became the particu-
lar  concern  of the Constitution because  of  its  intimate
connection  with deprivation of personal liberty to  protect
which  certain provisions were introduced in the Chapter  on
Fundamental Rights and because of the conditions  prevailing
in  the newly born Republic.  Preventive detention  means  a
complete  negation of freedom of  movement and	of  personal
liberty	  and  is incompatible with both those subjects	 and
yet  it is placed in the same compartment with them in	Part
III of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">223</span>
<p id="p_350">    Though  the Constitution  has  recognized the  necessity
of  laws  as to preventive detention it	 has  also  provided
certain	 safeguards to mitigate their harshness	 by  placing
fetters	 on  legislative power conferred  on  this  subject.
These are-
</p><p id="p_351">    (1) That no law can	 provide for detention for a  period
of  more  than three months unless the sufficiency  for	 the
cause of the detention is investigated by an advisory  board
within	the  said period of three  months.   This  provision
limits	legislative power in the matter of duration  of	 the
period of detention.  A law of preventive detention would be
void if it permits detention for a longer period than  three
months without the intervention of an advisory board.
    (2)	 That a State law cannot authorize detention  beyond
the maximum period prescribed by Parliament under the powers
given  to  it in clause (7).  This is a	 limitation  on	 the
legislative  power  of the State legislature.	They  cannot
make  a	 law authorizing preventive detention for  a  longer
period than that fixed by Parliament.
</p><p id="p_352">    (3)	 That Parliament also cannot make a law	 authorizing
detention  for	a  period beyond three	months	without	 the
intervention of an advisory board unless the law conforms to
the  conditions	 laid  down in clause  (7)  of	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_584">article	 22.</a>
Provision  also has been made to enable Parliament  to	make
laws for procedure to be followed by advisory boards.	This
is a safeguard against any arbitrary form of procedure	that
may otherwise find place in State laws.
</p><p id="p_353">    Apart  from	 these	enabling  and  disabling  provisions
certain procedural rights have been expressly safeguarded by
clause (5) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_585">article 22.</a>  A person detained under a law  of
preventive detention has a right to obtain information as to
the grounds of his detention and has also the right to	make
a  representation protesting against an order of  preventive
detention.  This right has been guaranteed independently  of
the duration of the period of detention and irrespective  of
the  existence	or non-existence of an advisory	 board.	  No
machinery, however, has been provided or expressly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">29</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_140">224</span>
mentioned for dealing with this representation.	 It seems to
me that when a constitutional right has been conferred as  a
necessary consequence, a constitutional remedy for obtaining
redress	 in case of infringement of the right must  be	pre-
sumed  to have been contemplated and it could not have	been
intended  that	the  right was merely illusory	and  that  a
representation	made  may well find place in  cold  storage.
Consideration of the representation made by virtue of clause
(5) by an unbiassed authority is, m my opinion, a  necessary
consequence  of the guaranteed right contained	herein.	 The
right  has  been conferred to enable a	detained  person  to
establish  his innocence and to secure justice, and no	jus-
tice can be said to be secured unless the representation  is
considered by some impartial person. The interpretation that
I am inclined to place on clause (5) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_586">article 22</a> is justi-
fied by the solemn words of the declaration contained in the
Preamble  to the Constitution.	It is this declaration	that
makes  our  Constitution sublime and it	 is  the  guarantees
mentioned in the chapter on Fundamental Rights that make  it
one  of	 the greatest charters of liberty and of  which	 the
people, of this	 country 'may well be proud.   This  charter
has  not been forced out of unwilling hands of	a  sovereign
like the Magna Carta but it has been given to themselves  by
the  people of the country through their Constituent  Assem-
bly.   Any interpretation of the provisions of Part  III  of
the  Constitution without reference to this solemn  declara-
tion is apt to lead one into error.  If the right of  repre-
sentation given to a detained person by clause (5) of  arti-
cle  22	 is a guaranteed right and has been  given  for	 the
purpose	    of	securing justice, then it  follows  that  no
justice	 can  be  held secured to him  unless  an  unbiassed
person considers the merits of the representation and  gives
his  opinion  on the guilt or the innocence of	the  persons
detained.  In my view, the right cannot be defeated or	made
elusive	 by  presuming that the detaining  authority  itself
will consider the representation with an unbiassed mind	 and
will render justice.  That would in a way make the  prosecu-
tor  a judge in the case and such a procedure is  repugnant.
to all notions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_141">225</span>
of  justice.   The Constitution has  further  curtailed	 the
rights	given  in clause (5) by providing in  clause  (6)  a
privilege  on  the detaining authority of  witholding  facts
which  the said authority considers not in public  interests
to  disclose.	This privilege has been	 conferred  for	 the
security  of the State and possibly for the security of	 the
Constitution  itself, but in view of these stringent  provi-
sions no additional clogs can be put on the proper consider-
ation  of the representation of the detained person by	pre-
suming	that  the detaining authority itself  will  properly
consider  the representation.  It has also to be  remembered
in  this context that a person-subjected to the law of	pre-
ventive detention has been deprived of the rights  conferred
on persons who become subject to the law of punitive  deten-
tion [vide clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_587">article 22].</a>	He has	been
denied	the right to consult a lawyer or be defended by	 him
and  he	 can  be kept in detention  without  being  produced
before a magistrate.
</p><p id="p_354">    Having  examined  the provisions of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_588">article	 22</a>,  I	 now
proceed	 to consider the first question that  was  canvassed
before us by the learned Attorney-General, i.e., that  arti-
cle 22 of the Constitution read with the entries in the	 7th
Schedule  was a complete Code on the subject  of  preventive
detention, and that being so, the other articles of Part III
could not be invoked in the consideration of the validity of
the impugne'd statute. It was conceded by the learned  coun-
sel  for  the  petitioner that to the  extent  that  express
provisions  exist in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_589">article 22</a> on the topic  of  preventive
detention  those provisions would prevail and could  not  be
controlled  by	the other provisions of Part III.   It	was,
however,  urged	 that on matters on which this	article	 had
made no special provision on this topic the other provisions
of  Part  III of the Constitution had  application,  namely,
articles  10  and 21 and to that extent laws  made  on	this
subject	 were justiciable.  In order to draw  the  inference
that the framers of the Constitution intended the provisions
as  regards preventive detention in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_590">article 22</a> to  be  self-
contained a clear indication of such an intention has to  be
gathered.  If the provisions embodied in this  article	have
dealt
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_142">226</span>
with all the principal questions that are likely to arise in
matters	 of procedure or on questions of the  reasonableness
of the period of detention, the inference of such an indica-
tion  would be irresistible.  Ordinarily when a	 subject  is
expressly  dealt with in a constitution in some	 detail,  it
has  to	 be assumed that the intention was  to	exclude	 the
application  of	 the general provisions	 contained   therein
elsewhere.   Express mention of one thing is an exclusion of
the  other.  Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.    I  am
satisfied  on a review of the whole scheme of the  Constitu-
tion  that  the intention was to make <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_591">article  22</a>  self-con-
tained	in respect of the laws on the subject of  preventive
detention.   It was contended that all the articles  in	 the
Constitution should be read in an harmonious manner and	 one
article	 should	 not be read as standing by  itself  and  as
having	no  connection with the other articles in  the	same
part.	It was said that they were all supplementary to	 one
another.   In this connection it was argued that a law	made
under <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_592">article 22</a> would not be valid unless it was in  accord
with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_593">article 21</a> of the Constitution.	This
article provides that no person shall be deprived of life or
liberty'  except according to procedure established by	law.
It  was	 contended that in substance the article  laid	down
that  no person will be deprived of life or liberty  without
having	been given a fair trial or a fair hearing  and	that
unless a law of preventive detention provided such a hearing
that law would be in contravention of this article and	thus
void.	Conceding  for the sake of argument   (but   without
expressing   any opinion  on  it )  that   this	  contention
of   the  learned     counsel  is   correct,  the   question
arises	whether	   there  is anything in  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_594">article  22</a>  which
negatives  the application of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_595">article 21</a> as above  construed
to a law on preventive detention.  In my opinion, sub-clause
(5) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_596">article 22</a> read with clauses (1) and (2) leads to the
inference that the contention raised by the learned  counsel
is  unsound.  Clause (5), as already stated,  provides	that
notice	has  to be given to a detenu of the grounds  of	 his
detention. It also provides a limited hearing inasmuch as it
gives him an opportunity to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">227</span>
establish his innocence.  As, in my opinion, the  considera-
tion  of  a representation made by a detained person  by  an
unbiassed  authority is implicit in clause (5) it  gives  to
the  detained  person all that he is entitled to  under	 the
principles of natural justice.	The right to consult and  to
be  represented	 by a counsel of his own   choice  has	been
denied	in express terms to such a person by  the  Constitu-
tion.  He is also denied an opportunity of appearing  before
a magistrate.  When the Constitution has taken away  certain
rights	that  ordinarily  will be possessed  by	 a  detained
person and in substitution thereof certain other rights have
been  conferred on him even in the matter of procedure,	 the
inference is clear that the intention was to deprive such  a
person	of the right of an elaborate procedure usually	pro-
vided for in judicial proceedings.  Clause (6) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_597">article 22</a>
very  strongly supports this conclusion.  There	 would	have
been  no point in laying down such detailed rules of  proce-
dure  in  respect of a law of preventive  detention  if	 the
intention was that such a law would be subject to the provi-
sions  of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_598">article 21</a> of the Constitution.  In  its  ultimate
analysis  the argument of the learned counsel for the  peti-
tioner	resolves itself to this: that the  impugned  statute
does not provide for an impartial tribunal for a  considera-
tion  of  the representation of the detained person  and  to
this  extent it contravenes <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_599">article 21</a> of the  Constitution.
As  discussed  above, in ray opinion, such  a  provision  is
implicit  within  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_600">article 22</a> itself and that being  so,	 the
application of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_601">article 21</a> to a law made under <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_602">article 22</a>  is
excluded.
</p><p id="p_355">    It was next contended that a law of preventive detention
encroaches  on the right of freedom of movement	 within	 the
territory of India guaranteed to a citizen under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_603">article  19
(1)  (d)</a> and that being so, by reason of the  provisions  of
sub-clause  (5)	 of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_604">article 19</a> it was	justiciable  on	 the
ground	of reasonableness.  It is true, as  already  pointed
out, that a law of preventive detention is wholly incompati-
ble  with  the right of freedom of movement  of	 a  citizen.
Preventive  detention  in  substance is a  negation  of	 the
freedom	 of locomotion guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_605">article	 19 (1)	 (d)</a>
but it cannot be said that it merely restricts it.  Be	that
as it may, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">228</span>
question  for consideration is whether it was intended	that
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_606">article	 19</a> would govern a law made under the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_607">article	 22.</a>   <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_608">Article 19 (5)</a> is a saving  and	an  enabling
provision.   It empowers Parliament to make a  law  imposing
reasonable  restriction on the right of freedom of  movement
while <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_609">article 22 (7)</a> is auother enabling provision  empower-
ing  Parliament to make a law on the subject  of  preventive
detention  in certain circumstances.  If a law	conforms  to
the  conditions laid down in '<a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_610">article 22 (7</a>), it would be  a
good  law and it could not have been intended that that	 law
validly made should also conform itself to the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_611">article 19 (5).</a>	 One enabling provision cannot be considered
as  a safeguard against another enabling provision.  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_612">Article
13  (2)</a> has absolutely no application in such  a  situation.
If the intention of the constitution was that a law made  on
the subject of preventive detention had to be tested on	 the
touchstone  of reasonableness, then it would not have  trou-
bled  itself  by expressly making provision  in	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_613">article  22</a>
about  the precise scope of the limitation subject to  which
such  a	 law could be made and by mentioning  the  procedure
that the law dealing with that subject had to provide.	Some
of the provisions of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_614">article 22</a> would then have been  redun-
dant, for instance, the provision that no detention can last
longer	than  three  months without the	 necessity  of	such
detention being examined by an advisory board.	This  provi-
sion negatives the idea that the deprivation of liberty	 for
a  period  of three months without the consultation  of	 the
advisory board would be justiciable on the ground of reason-
ableness. Again <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_615">article 22</a> has provided a safeguard that  if
an  advisory board has to be dispensed with, it can only  be
so  dispensed with under a law made by Parliament  and	that
Parliament  also  in enacting such a law has to	 conform  to
certain conditions.  This provision would have' been  unnec-
essary in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_616">article 22</a> if a law on this subject was  justicia-
ble.   In  sub-clause  (b) of  clause  (7) of	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_617">article	  22</a>
provision   has	  been	made  enabling	Parliament  to	 fix
the    maximum		       period for  which  a   person
can   be  detained		    under a law on the	sub-
</p><p id="p_356">ject of preventive detention.		  Under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_145">229</span>
this  express provision it is open to Parliament to fix	 any
period,	 say,  even  a period of five to ten  years  as	 the
maximum	 period	 of detention of a person.  Can it  be	said
that  in view of this express provision of the	Constitution
such  a	 law  was intended to be justiciable  by  reason  of
<a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_618">article	 19  (5) ?</a> Duration of detention  is  the  principal
matter in preventive detention laws which possibly could  be
examined  on the touchstone of reasonableness under  <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_619">article
19  (5</a>),  but this has been expressly  excluded	 by  express
provisions  in	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_620">article 22.</a> In my  judgment,  therefore,  an
examination of the provisions of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_621">article 22</a> clearly suggests
that the intention was to make it self-contained as  regards
the  law of preventive detention and that the validity of  a
law  on the subject of preventive detention cannot be  exam-
ined or controlled either by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_622">article 21</a> or
by  the provisions of <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_623">article 19 (5)</a> because <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_624">article 13	 (2)</a>
has no application to such a situation and <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_625">article 22</a> is not
subject to the provisions of these two articles. The Consti-
tution in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_626">article 22</a> has gone to the extent of even  provid-
ing that Parliament may by law lay down the procedure to  be
followed by an advisory board. On all important points	that
could  arise  in connection with the subject  of  preventive
detention  provision  has been made in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_627">article 22</a>  and	that
being so, the only correct approach in examining the validi-
ty  of	a law on the subject of preventive detention  is  by
considering whether the law made satisfied the	requirements
of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_628">article 22</a> or in any way abridges or contravenes them and
if  the answer is in the affirmative, then the law  will  be
valid,	but if the answer is in the negative, the law  would
be void.
</p><p id="p_357">    In	expressing  the view that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_629">article 22</a> is in  a  sense
self-contained	on the law of preventive detention I  should
not however be understood as laying down that the framers of
the  article in any way overlooked the safeguards laid	down
in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_630">article 21.</a>	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_631">Article 21</a>, in my opinion. lays  down	sub-
stantive law as giving protection to life and liberty  inas-
much as it says that they cannot be deprived except  accord-
ing to the procedure established by law; in other words,  it
means  that before a person can be deprived of his  life  or
liberty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">230</span>
as a condition precedent there should exist some substantive
law  conferring	 authority for doing so and the	 law  should
further	 provide for a mode of procedure for  such  depriva-
tion.	This  article gives complete' immunity	against	 the
exercise  of  despotic power by the executive.	 It  further
gives  immunity	 against invalid laws which  contravene	 the
Constitution.	It gives also further guarantee that in	 its
true concept there should be some form of proceeding  before
a  person can be condemned either in respect of his life  or
his liberty.  It negatives the idea of fantastic,  arbitrary
and oppressive forms of proceedings.  The principles  there-
fore underlying <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_632">article 21</a> have been kept in view in  draft-
ing  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_633">article 22.</a>  A law properly made under <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_634">article  22</a>	 and
which  is valid in all respects under that article and	lays
down  substantive as well as adjective law on  this  subject
would fully satisfy the requirements of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_635">article 21</a>, and that
being so, there is no conflict between these two articles.
    The	 next question that arises for decision	 is  whether
there  is anything in Act IV of 1950 which  offends  against
the  provisions of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_636">article 22</a> of Part III of  the  Constitu-
tion.	The  learned counsel  for the  petitioner  contended
that  <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_637">section  3</a>  of the Act was bad  inasmuch	as  it	made
"satisfaction  of the Government" as the criterion  for	 de-
taining	 a person.  It was said that as <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_638">section 3</a> laid	down
no objective rule of conduct for a person and as people were
not  told  as to what behaviour was expected  of  them,	 the
result was that it could not be known what acts a person was
expected to avoid and what conduct on his part was  prejudi-
cial  to  the security of the State or the  maintenance	 of'
public	order; in other words, it was argued that <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_639">section  3</a>
left  the  determination of the prejudicial  act       of  a
person to the arbitrary judgment of the Government and	that
even  the  officer who was to administer this law  had	been
furnished no guide and no standard of conduct in arriving at
his own satisfaction whether the conduct was prejudicial  to
the  security  of  the State etc.   This  criticism  of	 the
learned	 counsel,  in my opinion, is not valid,	  It  is  no
doubt  true that a detention order depends on the  satisfac-
tion of the'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">231</span>
Government but this  provision is in accordance with <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_640">article
22</a>  of	 the   Constitution which to  my  mind	contemplates
detention  on the satisfaction of the  executive  authority.
By  its	 very  nature the subject is such  that	 it  implies
detention  on the judgment of the authority  entrusted	with
the  making of the order.  The whole intent and	 purpose  of
the law of preventive detention would be defeated if  satis-
faction of the authority  concerned was subject to such	  an
objective standard and was also subject to conditions as  to
legal proof and procedure.  In the 7th Schedule jurisdiction
to  make the law on this subject has been given for  reasons
connected  with defence etc. and the maintenance  of  public
order.	These  are subjects which concern the life  and	 the
very  existence of the State. Every citizen is	presumed  to
know what behaviour is prejudicial to the life of the  State
or to its existence as an ordered State.   Considering	that
the  State  is presumed to have a government  that  conducts
itself	in  a  reasonable way and also	presuming  that	 its
officers  usually will be reasonable men, it cannot be	said
that  in  making  "satisfaction of the	government"  as	 the
standard  for  judging prejudicial acts of persons  who	 are
subject to the law of preventive detention <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_641">section 3</a> in	 any
way contravenes <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_642">article 22</a> of the constitution.
    <a href="/doc/1086093/" id="a_643">Section  7</a> of the impugned Act gives full effect to	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_644">article 22</a> sub clause (5)  and	enacts	that
representation	has to be made to the Central or State	Gov-
ernment as the case may be.  It was impeached on the  ground
that  no machinery has been provided herein to consider	 and
adjudicate  on	the merits of the  representation.  To	this
extent, as already indicated, the law is defective.   In the
absence of a machinery for the investigation of the  conten-
tions  raised  in the representation it may be open  to	 the
detenu	to  move this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_645">article 32</a>  for  a  proper
relief.	 It is,	 however,  unnecessary to express any  opin-
ion  as to the precise remedy open to a detained  person  in
this respect.  The absence of a provision of this nature  in
the  statute  however would not make the  law  wholly  void.
<a href="/doc/1996234/" id="a_646">Section 9</a> of the Act makes reference
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">30</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">232</span>
to  the	 advisory board obligatory in  cases  falling  under
sub-clause (iii) of clause (a) or clause (b) of	 sub-section
(1) of section a within six weeks of the order.	 The  proce-
dure  to be followed by the advisory board is laid  down  in
<a href="/doc/935622/" id="a_647">section 10</a>.  Parliament has been authorized to lay down such
a  procedure to be followed by an advisory  board   in	sub-
clause	 (c) of clause	(7). It was contended that  the	 law
had not provided a personal hearing to the detenu before  an
advisory  board, nor had it given him a right to  lead	evi-
dence  to establish his	 innocence.   In  my  opinion,	this
criticism  is not sound and does not in any  way  invalidate
the law. The advisory board has been given the power to call
for  such  information as it requires even from	 the  person
detained.  It has also been empowered to examine the materi-
al placed before it in the light of the facts and  arguments
contained  in the representation.  The opportunity  afforded
is not as full as a person gets under normal judicial proce-
dure but when the Constitution itself contemplates a special
procedure  being prescribed for preventive detention  cases,
then  the  validity  of the law on that	 subject  cannot  be
impugned on the grounds contended for.
</p><p id="p_358">    <a href="/doc/418681/" id="a_648">Section  11</a> of the Act was also impugned on	 the  ground
that  it offended against the  Constitution inasmuch  as  it
provided for  preventive detention for an indefinite period.
This section in my opinion has to be read in the  background
of  the provision in sub-clause (3) of <a href="/doc/278240/" id="a_649">section 1</a> of the	 Act
which  says  that the Act will cease to have effect  on	 1st
April,	 1951.	Besides, the words "for such  period  as  it
thinks fit" do not in any way offend against the  provisions
of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_650">article 22</a> wherein Parliament has been given the power to
make  a law fixing the maximum period for preventive  deten-
tion.  It has to be noted that Parliament has fixed a period
of  one	 year  as the maximum period  for  the	duration  of
detention where detention has to be without reference to  an
advisory board.	 In my opinion, there is nothing in  <a href="/doc/418681/" id="a_651">section
11</a> which is outside the constitutional limits of the  powers
of the supreme legislature.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">233</span>
<p id="p_359">It  is	<a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_652">section	 12</a> of the Act which  was  assailed  by	 the
learned	 counsel for the petitioner rather vehemently.	This
section	 is of a very controversial character.	It has	been
enacted	 on  the authority of clause (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_653">article  22</a>	 and
runs thus :--
</p><p id="p_360">  "(1) Any person detained in any of the following classes
of  cases  or under any of the following  circumstances	 may
be    detained without obtaining the opinion of an  Advisory
Board for a period longer than three months, but not exceed-
ing  one year from the date of his detention, namely,  where
such person has been detained with a view to  preventing him
from acting in any manner prejudicial to-
</p><p id="p_361">    (a)	 the defence of India, relations of India with	for-
eign powers or the security of India; or
</p><p id="p_362">    (b) the security of a State or the maintenance of public
order.
</p><p id="p_363">    (2) The case of every person detained under a  detention
order  to  which  the provisions of  sub-section  (1)  apply
shall,	within a period of six months from the date  of	 his
detention,  be	reviewed  where the order was  made  by	 the
Central	 Government or a State Government, by  such  Govern-
ment, and where the order was made by any officer  specified
in sub-section (2) of section a, by the State Government  to
which  such officer is subordinate, in consultation  with  a
person who is, or has been, or is qualified to be  appointed
as, a Judge of a High Court nominated in that behalf by	 the
Central Government or the State Government, as the case	 may
be."
</p><p id="p_364">    The section purports to comply with the conditions	laid
down  in clause (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_654">article 22.</a> It was,  however,  argued
that  in substance and reality it has failed to comply	with
any  of	 the conditions laid down therein; that	 it  neither
mentions  the circumstances under which nor the	 classes  of
cases in which preventive detention without recourse to	 the
machinery  of  an  advisory board could	 be  permitted.	 The
crucial	 question  for consideration is whether	 <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_655">section  12</a>
mentions any circumstances under which or defined the class-
es of cases in which authority was conferred by clause (7)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">234</span>
to dispense with an advisory board.   So far as I have	been
able  to  gather from opinions of text-book writers  on	 the
subject	 of  classification, the rule seems  clear  that  in
making	classification of cases there has to be	 some  rela-
tionship  to the classification to the objects sought to  be
accomplished.	The question for consideration therefore  is
what object was sought to be accomplished when the Constitu-
tion included clause (7) in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_656">article 22.</a>	 It seems clear that
the real purpose of clause (7) was to provide for a  contin-
gency where compulsory requirement of an advisory board	 may
defeat	the object of the law of preventive detention.	  In
my opinion, it was incorporated in the Constitution to	meet
abnormal  and exceptional cases, the cases being of  a	kind
where an advisory board could not be taken into	 confidence.
The authority to make such drastic legislation was entrusted
to  'the supreme legislature but with the further  safeguard
that  it can only enact a law	  of such a  drastic  nature
provided  it prescribed the circumstances under	 which	such
power had to be used or in the alternative it prescribed the
classes of cases or stated a determinable group of cases  in
which  this  could be done.  The intention was to  lay	down
some  objective standard for the guidance of  the  detaining
authority  on the basis of which without consultation of  an
advisory board detention could be ordered beyond the  period
of three months. In this connection it has to be  remembered
that  the  Constitution	 must have thought  of	really	some
abnormal  situation  and      of some  dangerous  groups  of
persons when it found it necessary to dispense with a tribu-
nal  like  an advisory board which functions in	 camera	 and
which  is not bound even to give a personal hearing  to	 the
detenu and whose proceedings are privileged.  The law on the
subject of preventive detention in order to avoid even	such
an  innocuous  institution could only be  justified  on	 the
basis  of  peculiar circumstances  and	peculiar  situations
which  had to be objectively laid down and that was what  in
my  opinion was intended by clause (7).	 If the	 peculiarity
lies  in a situation outside 'the control or view of  a	 de-
tained	person, then it may be said that the description  of
such a situation would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_152">235</span>
amount to a prescription of the circumstances justifying the
detention  for	a longer period than three months by  a	 law
without the intervention of an advisory board'. If, however,
the abnormality relates to the conduct and character of	 the
activities of a certain determinable group of persons,	then
that would amount to a class of cases which was contemplated
to  be	dealt  with under clause (7). In  such	cases  alone
arbitrary detention could be held justifiable by law  beyond
a period of three months.
</p><p id="p_365">    It was argued by the learned counsel for the  petitioner
that the phrase "circumstances under which, and the  classes
of cases in which" used in clause (7) had to be construed in
a   cumulative	sense;	on  the	 other	hand,  the   learned
Attorney-General contended that the word "and" had been used
in this clause in the same sense as "or." He further  argued
that  even if the word "and" is not given that	meaning	 the
true  construction of the phrase was that  Parliament  could
prescribe  either the circumstances or the classes of  cases
for  making  a law on the subject  of  preventive  detention
authorizing detention for a longer period than three  months
without	 the machinery of an advisory board. In	 Full  Bench
Reference  No. 1 of 1950, Das Gupta J. of the Calcutta	High
Court held that the intention of the legislature in enacting
the clause was that the law of preventive detention  author-
izing detention for a longer period than three months  with-
out the intervention of an advisory board had to fulfil both
the requirements laid down in clause (7) and not only one of
the requirements in the alternative.  The same view has been
expressed by my brother Sir Fazl Ali. I share this view with
him.  I would, however, like to consider this matter from  a
different  aspect  on  the assumption  that  the  contention
raised by the learned Attorney-General is right.
    Dealing  first  with  the question	whether	 <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_657">section  12</a>
mentions  any circumstances, so far as I have been  able  to
see,  it does not prescribe any circumstances unless it	 can
be said that the prejudicial acts for reasons connected with
the security of State, maintenance of public order, etc. are
both the circumstances as well as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">236</span>
the classes of cases.  In my opinion, this line of  approach
cannot	be held to be correct in the construction of  clause
(7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_658">article 22.</a>  I am inclined to agree with the  learned
Attorney-General that the phrase "circumstances under which"
means some situation extraneous to the detenu's own acts, in
other  words,  it means some happening in the  country	with
which  the detenu is not concerned, such as a  situation  of
tense  communal feelings, an apprehended internal  rebellion
or  disorder, the crisis of an impending war or	 apprehended
war, etc.  In such a situation the machinery of an  advisory
board could be dispensed with because it may become  cumber-
some or it may hamper the exercise of necessary powers.	  In
this view of the matter I have no hesitation in holding that
no circumstances have been stated in <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_659">section 12</a>, though	 the
section	 ostensibly says so.  If it was permissible to	con-
jecture, it seems that the draftsman of <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_660">section 12</a>' repeated
the  words of clause' (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_661">article 22</a> without an  applica-
tion  of his mind to the meaning of those words and  as	 the
legislation  was passed in haste to meet an emergent  situa-
tion,  it suffers from the defects which all hasty  legisla-
tion suffer from.
</p><p id="p_366">    I now proceed to consider whether <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_662">section 12</a> has classi-
fied the cases in which detention for a longer period beyond
three  months  could be suffered by a  citizen	without	 the
benefit of the machinery of an advisory board.	The  section
has placed five subjects out of the legislative list  within
its  ambit and these are described as the classes of  cases.
The question is whether it can be said that a mere selection
of all or any of the categories of the subjects for  reasons
connected with which a law of preventive detention could be'
made  under the 7th Schedule amounts to a classification  of
cases  as contemplated in clause (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_663">article 22.</a> Entry  9
of the Union List and Entry 3 of the Concurrent List of	 the
7th  Schedule  lay down the ambit of  legislative  power  of
Parliament  on	the subject of preventive detention  on	 the
following six subjects :--
</p><p id="p_367">     (1) Defence of India, (2) Foreign Affairs, (a) Security
of India, (4) Security of the State, (5) Mainten-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_154">237</span>
<p id="p_368">ance of public order, (6) Maintenance of supplies and  serv-
ices essential to the community.
</p><p id="p_369">    Clause  (4) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_664">article 22</a> enjoins in respect of all	 the
six  subjects that no law can provide for preventive  deten-
tion for a longer period than three months without reference
to an advisory board.  Clause (7) gives permission to make a
law for dispensing with an advisory board by a	prescription
of the circumstances and by a prescription of the classes of
cases in which such a dispensation can be made.	 The  legis-
lative	authority under clauses (4)  and (7)in	my  opinion,
extends to all these six subjects.  The normal procedure  to
be followed when detention is intended to be beyond a period
of  three months in respect of the six subjects is  provided
in  sub-clause (4)  The extraordinary and unusual  procedure
was  intended, to be adopted in certain abnormal  cases	 for
which  provision  could be made by a  parliamentary  statute
under clause (7). It seems to me, however, that section-  12
of  Act IV of 1950 has reversed this process quite  contrary
to  the intention of the Constitution.	By this section	 Act
IV of 1950 has dispensed with the advisory board in five out
of  the	 six  subjects above mentioned	and  the  compulsory
procedure  of an advisory board laid down in clause  (4)  of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_665">article	 22</a> has been relegated to one out of these six	sub-
jects.	 This has been achieved by giving a construction  to
the  phrase  "circumstances under which and the	 classes  of
cases  in which" so as to make it co-extensive and  cotermi-
nous  with  the "subjects of legislation."  In	my  opinion,
this  construction of clause (7) is in contravention of	 the
clear  provisions  of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_666">article 22</a>, and makes  clause  (4)  of
<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_667">article	 -9</a><a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_668">,2</a> to all intents and purposes nugatory.  Such  a
construction of the clause would amount to the	Constitution
saying	in  one breath that a law  of  preventive  detention
cannot provide for detention for a longer period than  three
months	without	 reference to an advisory board and  at	 the
same  breath  and moment saying that Parliament,  if  it  so
chooses, can do so in respect of all or any of the  subjects
mentioned  in  the legislative field.  If that	was  so,  it
would  have been wholly unnecessary to provide such a  safe-
guard in the Constitution on a matter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_155">238</span>
which very seriously affects personal liberty.	On the other
hand, it would be a reasonable construction of the clause to
hold  that  the Constitution authorized Parliament  that  in
serious	 classes  of cases or in cases of  those  groups  of
persons who are incorrigible or whose activities are  secret
the  procedure	of an advisory board may well  be  dispensed
with, that being necessary in the interests of the State. On
the other construction as adopted by the framers of  <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_669">section
12</a>,  the Constitution need not have troubled itself by	con-
ferring an authority on Parliament for making such a law.
    Moreover,  if that was the intention, it would  have  in
very  clear  words  indicated this by  drafting	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_670">article  22</a>
clause (4) thus:
</p><p id="p_370">    "Unless otherwise provided by Parliament no law  provid-
ing for preventive detention shall authorize detention for a
longer period than three months unless an Advisory Board has
investigated   the   sufficiency  of  the  cause   of	such
detention."
</p><p id="p_371">    The words "Unless otherwise provided for by	 Parliament"
would  have been in accord with the construction  which	 the
framers of <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_671">section 12</a> have placed on <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_672">article 22</a> clause (7).
    I am further of the opinion that the construction placed
by the learned Attorney-General on clause (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_673">article  22</a>
and adopted by the framers of Act IV of 1950 creates a	very
anomalous  situation.  The matter may be examined  from	 the
point of view of the law of preventive detention for reasons
connected  with supplies and services essential to the	life
of the community.  This subject has been put under <a href="/doc/1996234/" id="a_674">section 9</a>
in  Act	 IV of 1950.  Suppose a tense situation	 arises	 and
there is a danger of the railway system being sabotaged	 and
it  becomes necessary to pass detention orders against	cer-
tain persons.  According to Act IV of 1950 in such a serious
state  of  affairs  the procedure of an	 advisory  board  is
compulsory,  while on the other hand, if there is an  appre-
hension of disturbance of public order by reason of a  wrong
decision  of an umpire at a cricket match or on	 account  of
conduct	 of persons celebrating the festival of	 Holi,	then
detention beyond three
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_156">239</span>
months	can  be	 ordered without reference  to	an  advisory
board.	Could such an anomalous result be in the  contempla-
tion of the framers of the Constitution ?  The	construction
that I am inclined to place on the section is in accord with
the  scheme  of the law of punitive detention.	Hurt  is  an
offence	 under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_675"> the Indian Penal Code</a> and this is one of	 the
subjects  of punitive detention.  The cases on	the  subject
have  been classified in different groups,  namely,   simple
hurt,  grievous hurt, grievous hurt with dangerous  weapons,
grievous  hurt	to  extort a confession,  grievous  hurt  to
restrain a public officer from doing his duty, grievous hurt
by a rash act, and grievous hurt on provocation. Even simple
hurt  has been classified in different categories. The	sub-
ject of assault has also been similarly dealt with. <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_676">Sections
352</a>  to	 <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_677">356</a>  deal with cases classified  according  to	 the
gravity	 of  the  offence, i.e., cases	of  simple  assault,
assault	 on a public servant, assault on women,	 assault  in
attempt to'commit theft, assault for wrongfully confining  a
person and assault on grave provocation have been separately
grouped.  Another illustration is furnished by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_678"> the  Criminal
Procedure Code</a> in the preventive <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_679">sections 107</a> to <a href="/doc/27376/" id="a_680">110</a>.  These
deal  with different groups of persons; vagrants are in	 one
class, habitual offenders in another, bad characters in	 the
third and disturbers of peace in the fourth.  It seems	that
it  is	on  lines similar to these that it  must  have	been
contemplated by the Constitution that classes of cases would
be  prescribed	by Parliament, but this has not	 been  done.
The  Constitution has recognised varying scales of  duration
of  detention  with the idea that this will  vary  with	 the
nature	of  the apprehended act, detention for a  period  of
three  months  in  ordinary cases, detention  for  a  longer
period than three months with the intervention of an adviso-
ry board in more serious cases, while detention for a longer
period	than  three months without the	intercession  of  an
advisory board for a still more dangerous class and for acts
committed  in grave situations.	 It can hardly be said	that
all cases of preventive detention for reasons connected with
the maintenance of public order stand on the same footing in
the degree of gravity and deserve the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_157">240</span>
duration  of  detention	 and all cases	connected  with	 the
maintenance  of supplies and services essential to the	life
of  the	 community stand in the matter of their	 gravity  on
such  a	 footing as to require a lenient treatment.   It  is
true  that in a sense all persons who act  prejudicially  to
the defence of India may be comprehensively said to form one
group  and  similarly persons who act prejudicially  to	 the
maintenance  of supplies and services essential to the	life
of the community may form another class but the question is,
whether it was in this comprehensive sense that	 classifica-
tion was intended by the  Constitution in clause (7) or	 was
it  intended in a narrower and restricted sense ? It has  to
be remembered that the law under clause (7) was intended  to
provide	 detention for a longer period and such a  law	very
seriously  abridges personal liberty  and in this  situation
giving a narrower and restricted meaning to this  expression
will  be in accordance with well established canons of	con-
struction of statutes.
</p><p id="p_372">    The wide construction of clause (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_681">article 22</a> brings
within	the  ambit  of the clause all the  subjects  in	 the
legislative  list and very seriously abridges  the  personal
liberty of a citizen.  This could never have been the inten-
tion  of  the framers of the Constitution.  The	 narrow	 and
restricted  interpretation is in accord with the  scheme  of
the  article and it also operates on the whole field of	 the
legislative list and within that field it operates by demar-
cating	certain portions out of each subject which  requires
severe treatment.  If I may say so m conclusion, <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_682">section  12</a>
treats	the lamb and the leopard in the same  class  because
they  happen to be quadrupeds.	Such a classification  could
not  have  been in the thoughts of  the	 Constitution-makers
when  clause  (7)  was introduced in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_683">article  22.</a>   For	 the
reasons given above, I am of the opinion that section 12  of
Act  IV of 1950 does not fulfil the requirements  of  clause
(7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_684">article 22</a> of the Constitution and is not a law which
falls  within the ambit of that clause. That being so,	this
section	 of Act IV of 1950 is void and by reason of  it	 the
detention  of the petitioner cannot be justified.  There  is
no other provision in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">241</span>
this  law  under  which he can be detained  for	 any  period
whatsoever.
</p><p id="p_373">    It was argued that it was neither practicable nor possi-
ble  to make a classification on any definite basis  in	 the
case of apprehended acts of persons whose activities are  of
a  prejudicial character to the maintenance of public  order
or to the security of the State or to the defence of  India.
This contention to my mind is not sound.  Such a classifica-
tion  was made in the rules  under the Defence of India	 Act
by  defining  "a  prejudicial act" in  regulation  34.	Mere
difficulty in precisely ascertaining the groups or in defin-
ing objectively the conduct of such groups is no ground	 for
not  complying with the clear provisions of the	 statute  or
for  disobeying	 it.  I see no difficulty  whatsoever  if  a
serious	 effort	 was made to comply with the  provisions  of
clause (7). I cannot see that the compulsory requirement  of
an  advisory board is likely to lead to such  disastrous  or
calamitous results that in all cases or at least in five out
of  the six subjects of legislation it becomes necessary  to
dispense with this requirement. The requirement of an  advi-
sory board is in accordance with the preamble of the Consti-
tution	and  is the barest minimum that can make  a  law  of
preventive  detention to some little degree tolerable  to  a
democratic  Constitution.   Such a law also  may  have	some
justification  even  without  the requirement of an advisory
board	to meet certain defined dangerous situations  or  to
deal  with a class of people who are a danger to  the  State
but without such limitation the law would be destructive  of
all  notions of personal liberty.  The Constitution must  be
taken  to have furnished an adequate safeguard to its  citi-
zens when it laid down certain conditions in clause (7)	 and
it could not be considered that it provided no safeguard  to
them  at  all  and that the words used in  clause  (7)	were
merely illusory and had no real meaning.
</p><p id="p_374">    Section  14 of Act IV of 1950 has been impugned  on	 the
ground	that it contravenes and abridges the  provisions  of
articles 22 (5) and 32 of the Constitution.  This section is
in these terms:--
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">242</span>
<p id="p_375">    "(1) No Court shall except for the purposes of a  prose-
cution for an offence punishable under subsection (2), allow
any  statement	to be made,  or any evidence  to  be  given,
before	it of the substance of any communication made  under
<a href="/doc/1086093/" id="a_685">section 7</a> of the grounds on which a detention order has been
made against any person or of any representation made by him
against	 such  order,  and notwithstanding   anything	con-
tained	in  any	 other law, no Court shall  be	entitled  to
require	 any  public officer to produce before	it,   or  to
disclose the substance of, any such communication or  repre-
sentation  made, or the proceedings of an advisory board  or
that part of the report of an advisory board which is confi-
dential.
</p><p id="p_376">    (2) It shall be an offence punishable with	imprisonment
for  a term which may extend to one year, or with  fine,  or
with both, for any person to disclose or publish without the
previous  authorisation	 of the Central	 Government  or	 the
State Government, as the case may be, any contents or matter
purporting  to	be  contents of any  such  communication  or
representation as is referred to in sub-section (1):
</p><p id="p_377">    Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to
a  disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person  who  is
the subject of a detention order."
</p><p id="p_378">    This section is in the nature of an iron curtain  around
the  acts  of the authority making the order  of  preventive
detention.  The Constitution has guaranteed to the  detained
person	the right to be told the grounds of  detention.	  He
has been given a right to make a representation [vide  arti-
cle 22 (5)], yet <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_686">section 14</a> prohibits the disclosure of	 the
grounds furnished to him or the contents of the	 representa-
tion  made  by him in a Court of law and makes a  breach  of
this injunction punishable with imprisonment.
    <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_687">Article 32 (1)</a> of the Constitution is in these terms :--
    "The  right	 to move the Supreme  Court  by	 appropriate
proceedings  for the enforcement of the rights conferred  by
this Part is guaranteed."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_160">243</span>
<p id="p_379">Sub-section (4) says :--
</p><p id="p_380">    "The  right	 guaranteed  by this article  shall  not  be
suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitu-
tion."
</p><p id="p_381">    Now	 it  is quite clear that if an authority  passes  an
order of preventive detention for reasons not connected with
any of the six subjects mentioned in the 7th Schedule,	this
Court  can always declare the detention illegal and  release
the  detenu, but it is not possible for this Court to  func-
tion  if  there	 is a  prohibition  against  disclosing	 the
grounds	 which have been served upon him. It is only  by  an
examination of the grounds that it is possible to say wheth-
er  the	 grounds fall within the ambit	of  the	 legislative
power  contained  in  the Constitution or  are	outside	 its
scope. Again something may be served on the detenu  as being
grounds	 which are not grounds at all.	In this	 contingency
it  is the right of the detained person under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_688">article 32</a>  to
move this Court for enforcing the right under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_689">article 22 (5)</a>
that  he  be given the real grounds on which  the  detention
order is based.	 This Court would be disabled from  exercis-
ing  its functions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_690">article 32</a> and adjudicating on	 the
point that the grounds given satisfy the requirements of the
sub-clause  if it is not open to it to see the grounds	that
have been furnished.  It is a guaranteed right of the person
detained to have the very grounds which are the basis of the
order of detention.  This Court would be entitled to examine
the matter and to see whether the grounds furnished are	 the
grounds	 on the basis of which he has been detained or	they
contain	 some other vague or irrelevant material. The  whole
purpose of furnishing a detained person with the grounds  is
to  enable  him	 to make  a  representation  refuting  these
grounds	 and  of proving his innocence. In order  that	this
Court may be able to safeguard this fundamental right and to
grant him relief it is absolutely essential that the  detenu
is  not prohibited under penalty of punishment	to  disclose
the  grounds  to the Court and no injunction by law  can  be
issued to this Court disabling it from having a look at	 the
grounds.  <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_691">Section  14</a> creates a substantive offence  if	 the
grounds	 are disclosed and it also lays a duty on the  Court
not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_161">244</span>
to  permit  the disclosure of such  grounds.   It  virtually
amounts	 to a suspension of a guaranteed right	provided  by
the  Constitution inasmuch as it indirectly by	a  stringent
provision  makes  administration of the law  by	 this  Court
impossible  and	 at  the same time it  deprives	 a  detained
person	from obtaining justice from this Court. In my  opin-
ion,  therefore, this section when it prohibits the  disclo-
sure of the grounds contravenes or abridges the rights given
by  Part III to a citizen and is ultra vires the  powers  of
Parliament to that extent.
</p><p id="p_382">    The result of the above discussion is that, in my  opin-
ion, sections 12 and 14 of Act IV of 1950 as above indicated
are  void  and the decision of the detenu's case has  to  be
made  by  keeping out of sight these two provisions  in	 the
Act.  If  <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_692">sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_693">14</a> are deleted from  the  impugned
legislation,  then the result is that the detention  of	 the
petitioner  is not legal. The statute has not  provided	 for
detention for a period of three months or less in such cases
as  it could have done under article22 (4) of the  Constitu-
tion  and that being so, the petitioner cannot be  justifia-
bly  detained  even for a period of three  months.  I  would
accordingly order his release.
</p><p id="p_383">    In	view of the decision above arrived at I do not	con-
sider  it  necessary  to express any opinion  on  the  other
points	that were argued at great length before us,  namely,
(1)what	 is  'the scope and true meaning of  the  expression
"procedure established by law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_694">article 21</a> of the  Consti-
tution, and (2) what is the precise scope of articles 19 (1)
</p><p id="p_384">(d) and 19 (5)of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_385">MUKHERJEA J.--This is an application under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_695">article 32</a> of the
Constitution  praying for a writ of habeas corpus  upon	 the
respondents with a view to release the petitioner who, it is
alleged,  is being unlawfully detained in the Central  Jail,
Cuddalore, within the State of Madras.
</p><p id="p_386">    The	 petitioner, it is said, was initially	arrested  in
Malabar	 on  17th  of December, 1947,  and  prosecution	 was
started against him on various charges for having
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_162">245</span>
delivered  certain  violent speeches. While  these  criminal
cases  were going on, he was served with an order of  deten-
tion  under  the Madras Maintenance of Public Order  Act  on
22nd  April, 1948.  This order of detention was held  to  be
illegal	 by the Madras High Court, but on the same day	that
the judgment was pronounced, a second order of detention was
served	upon him.  On his moving the High Court again for  a
writ  of habeas corpus in respect to the  subsequent  order,
his  application was dismissed on the ground that as he	 was
not  granted  bail in one of the three criminal	 cases	that
were pending against him, the detention could not be said to
be  unlawful.  Liberty, however, was given to him  to  renew
his application if and when his detention under the criminal
proceedings ceased.  In two out of the three criminal  cases
the trial before the magistrate ended on February 23,  1949,
and  the petitioner was sentenced to  rigorous	imprisonment
for 6 months in each of the cases. These sentences, however,
were  set aside in appeal on 26th September, 1949.   As	 re-
gards the third case, he was tried by the Sessions Judge  of
North  Malabar and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for  5
years  but this sentence was reduced to 6 months'  imprison-
ment  by  the Madras High Court on appeal.   The  petitioner
made  a	 fresh application to the High Court praying  for  a
writ  of habeas corpus in respect of his detention under the
Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act and this application,
which  was  heard after he had served out his  sentences  of
imprisonment  referred to above, was dismissed	in  January,
1950.  On 25th February, 1950, the Preventive Detention	 Act
was passed by the Parliament and on the 1st of March follow-
ing,  the  the detention of the applicant under	 the  Madras
Maintainance  of Public Order Act was cancelled and  he	 was
served	with a fresh order of detention under <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_696">section 3</a>	 (1)
of  the	 Preventive Detention Act, 1950.  On behalf  of	 the
respondents the	 detention of the petitioner is sought to be
justified on the strength of the Preventive Detention Act of
1950.  The position taken up on behalf of the petitioner  on
the  other  hand is that the said Act is invalid  and  ultra
vires  the conStitution by reason of its being	in  conflict
with certain
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_163">246</span>
fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution.
It is argued, therefore, that the detention    of the  peti-
tioner is invalid and that he should be set at liberty.
    The contentions that have been but forward-by Mr. Nambi-
ar  who appeared in support of the petition, may be  classi-
fied  under  four heads.   His first contention is  that  as
preventive detention is, in substance, a restriction on	 the
free movements of a person throughout the Indian  territory,
it  comes within the purview of <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_697">article 19 (1) (d)</a>  of	Part
III  of	 the Constitution which lays  down  the	 fundamental
rights. Under clause	(5) of the article, any	 restriction
imposed upon this right of free movement must be  reasonable
and  should  be prescribed in the interests of	the  general
public.	 The question as to whether it is reasonable or	 not
is  a  justiciable matter which is to be determined  by	 the
Court.	This being the legal position, the  learned  Counsel
invites us to hold that the main provisions of the  impugned
Act,  particularly those which are contained in <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_698">sections  3</a>,
<a href="/doc/1086093/" id="a_699">7</a>, <a href="/doc/935622/" id="a_700">10</a>, <a href="/doc/418681/" id="a_701">11</a>, <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_702">12</a>, <a href="/doc/1937542/" id="a_703">13</a> and <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_704">14</a> are wholly unreasonable and  should
be invalidated on that ground.
</p><p id="p_387">    The second contention advanced by the learned Counsel is
that the impugned legislation is in conflict with the provi-
sion  of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_705">article 21</a> of the Constitution inasmuch as it	pro-
vides  for deprivation of the personal liberty of a man	 not
in  accordance with a procedure established by law.   It  is
argued	that the word 'law' here does not mean or  refer  to
any particular legislative enactment but it means the gener-
al  law of the land, embodying those principles	 of  natural
justice'  with	regard to procedure which  are	regarded  as
fundamental, in all systems of civilised jurisprudence.
    It	is conceded by the learned counsel that	 the  proce-
dure,  if  any, with regard to preventive detention  as	 has
been  prescribed  by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_706">article 22</a> of  the	 Constitution  which
itself	finds a place in the chapter on	 Fundamental  Rights
must  override	those general rules of procedure  which	 are
contemplated  by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_707">article 21</a> but with regard to	matters	 for
which no provision is made in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_708">article 22</a>, the general provi-
sion made in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_709">article 21</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_164">247</span>
must  apply.   He has indicated in course of  his  arguments
what  the  essentials of such procedure are  and  the  other
point  specifically  raised in this connection is  that	 the
provision  of section 12 of the Preventive Detention Act  is
in conflict with <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_710">article 22 (7)</a> of the Constitution.
    The last argument in support of this application is that
the provisions of sections 3 and 14 of the Preventive Deten-
tion Act are invalid as they take away and render completely
nugatory the fundamental right to constitutional remedies as
is provided for in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_711">article 32</a> of the Constitution.
    In discussing these points it should be well to keep  in
mind the general scheme of the Indian Constitution  relating
to the protection of the fundamental rights of the  citizens
and the limitations imposed in this respect upon the  legis-
lative powers of the Government.  The Constitution of  India
is a written Constitution and though  it has adopted many of
the  principles of the English Parliamentary system, it	 has
not accepted the English doctrine of the absolute  supremacy
of Parliament in matters of legislation. In this respect  it
has  followed  the American Constitution and  other  systems
modelled on it.	 Notwithstanding the representative  charac-
ter  of their political institutions,  the Americans  regard
the  limitations  imposed  by their  Constitution  upon	 the
action of the Government, both legislative and executive, as
essential to the preservation of public and private  rights.
They  serve as a check upon what has been described  as	 the
despotism  of the majority; and as was observed in the	case
of  Hurtado  v. The People of California (1)  "a  government
which  holds the lives, the liberty and the property of	 its
citizens,  subject at all times to the absolute	 disposition
and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository
of power, is after all but a despotism."  In India it is the
Constitution  that is supreme and Parliament as well as	 the
State  Legislatures must not only act within the  limits  of
their  respective legislative spheres as demarcated  in	 the
three
 (1) 110 U.S. 516.

<p id="p_388">lists occuring in the Seventh Schedule to the  Constitution,
but Part III of the Constitution guarantees to the  citizens
certain	 fundamental rights which the legislative  authority
can  on	 no account transgress. A statute law  to  be  valid
must, in all cases, be in conformity with the constitutional
requirements  and it is for the judiciary to decide  whether
any  enactment is unconstitutional or not.   <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_712">Article 13	 (2)</a>
is imperative on this point and provides expressly that	 the
State  shall not make any law which takes away	or  abridges
the right conferred by this Part and any law made in contra-
vention	 of this clause shall, to the extent of the  contra-
vention,  be  void.   Clause (1) of  the  article  similarly
invalidates  all existing laws which are  inconsistent	with
the provisions of this Part of the Constitution.
    The	 fundamental rights guaranteed by  the	Constitution
have been classified under seven heads or categories.	They
are:
</p><p id="p_389">(1) Right to equality;
</p><p id="p_390"> (2) Right to freedom;
</p><p id="p_391">(3)  Right  against exploitation;

</p><p id="p_393">(5) Cultural and educational rights;
</p><p id="p_394"> (6) Right to property;	 and
(7) Right to constitutional remedy.
</p><p id="p_395"> The arrangement differs  in many respects from that adopted
in the American Constitution and bears a likeness on certain
points to similar declarations in the Constitutions of other
countries.
</p><p id="p_396">Of  the different classes  of fundamental rights spoken	  of
above, we are concerned here primarily with right to freedom
which is  dealt with in four articles beginning from <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_713">article
19</a>   and  also	with the  right	 to  constitutional   remedy
which  is   embodied   in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_714">article 32.</a>

19  (1) (d)</a> of the Constitution, according to which a  right
to  move freely throughout the territory of India is one  of
the  fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens.   If  it
comes within that sub-clause, it is not disputed that clause
(5)  of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_720">article 19</a> would be attracted to it and it would  be
for  the courts to decide whether the  restrictions  imposed
upon  this right by the Parliament are	reasonable  restric-
tions  and are within the permissible limits  prescribed  by
clause (5) of the article.
</p><p id="p_399">    There  is no authoritative definition of the term  'Pre-
ventive Detention' in Indian law, though as description of a
topic  of legislation it occurred in the  Legislative  Lists
of  the Government of India Act, 1935, and has been used  in
Item  9	 of  List I and Item 3 of List III  in	the  Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution.  The expression has its origin
in  the language used by Judges or the law Lords in  England
while explaining the nature of detention under Regulation 14
(B) of the Defence of Realm Consolidation Act, 1914,  passed
on  the outbreak of the First World War; and the  same	lan-
guage was repeated in connection with the emergency  regula-
tions made during the last World War.  The word ' preventive
' is used in contradistinction to the word ' punitive.'	  To
quote  the words of Lord Finlay in Rex v. Halliday(1),	 "it
is  not a punitive but a precautionary measure." The  object
is  not	 to punish a man for having done  something  but  to
intercept  him	before he does it and to  prevent  him	from
doing  it. No offence is proved, nor any charge	 formulated;
and the justification of such detention is suspicion

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_168">250</span>
<p id="p_400">or reasonable probability and not criminal conviction  which
can  only be warranted by legal evidence (1).  Detention  in
such  form  is	unknown in America. It was  resorted  to  in
England	 only  during war time but no country in  the  world
that  I am aware of has made this an integral part of  their
Constitution as has been done in India.	 This is undoubtedly
unfortunate,  but  it is not our business  to  speculate  on
questions  of  policy or to attempt to explore	the  reasons
which  led the representatives of our people to make such  a
drastic	 provision in the Constitution itself, which  cannot
but be regarded as a most unwholesome encroachment upon	 the
liberties of the people.
</p><p id="p_401">    The	 detention of a man even as a precautionary  measure
certainly  deprives  him  of his personal  liberty,  and  as
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_721">article	 21</a>  guarantees to every man, be he a citizen  or  a
foreigner,  that  he shall not be deprived of his  life	 and
personal  liberty, except in accordance with  the  procedure
established  by	 law, the requirements of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_722">article  21</a>  would
certainly  have	 to  be complied with,	to  make  preventive
detention  valid in law. What these requirements are I	will
discuss later on.  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_723">Article 22</a> comes immediately after  arti-
cle  21.   It  secures to all  persons	certain	 fundamental
rights	in relation to arrest and detention, and as  already
said, by way of exception to the rights thus declared, makes
certain	 specific provisions relating to  preventive  deten-
tion.  The subject of preventive detention is  specified  in
and constitutes Item No. 9 in the Union legislative List and
it  also  forms Item  No. 3 in the Concurrent  List.   Under
<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_724">article	 246</a>  of the Constitution, the	Parliament  and	 the
State  Legislatures are empowered to legislate on this	sub-
ject  within  the  ambit of  their  respective	authorities.
Clause(3)  of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_725">article 22</a> expressly enjoins that the  protec-
tive provisions of clauses (1) and (2) of the article  would
not be available to persons detained under any law providing
for preventive detention.  The only fundamental rights which
are guaranteed by the Constitution in the matter of  preven-
tive  detention and which to that extent  impose  restraints
upon the exercise of legislative powers in that respect are

<p id="p_402">contained  in clauses (4) to (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_726">article 22.</a>	 Clause	 (4)
lays  down that no law of preventive detention shall  autho-
rise  the  detention of a person for a	period	longer	than
three  months, unless an advisory board	 constituted in	 the
manner laid down in sub-clause (a) of the clause has report-
ed before the expiration of the period that there is  suffi-
cient  cause  for such detention. The  period  of  detention
cannot,	 in any event, exceed the maximum which the  Parlia-
ment  is  entitled to prescribe under clause  (7)  (b).	 The
Parliament  is	also given the authority to  prescribe	 the
circumstances  and the class of cases under which  a  person
can be detained for a period longer than three months  under
any law of preventive detention without obtaining the  opin-
ion of the advisory board.  There is one safeguard  provided
for  all  cases which is contained in clause (5)  and  which
lays  down that the authority making the order of  detention
shall,	as soon as possible communicate to such	 person	 the
grounds	 on which the order has been made and  shall  afford
him  the  earliest opportunity of  making  a  representation
against	 the  order.   But even here,  the  authority  while
giving the grounds of detention need not disclose such facts
which it considers against public interest to disclose.
   The	question that we have to consider is whether a	law
relating  to preventive detention is justiciable in a  Court
of law on the ground of reasonableness under <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_727">article 19	 (5)</a>
of  the Constitution inasmuch as it takes away	or  abridges
the right to free movement in the territory of India guaran-
teed  by clause (1) (d)of the article. It will be seen	from
what has been said above that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_728">article 22</a> deals	specifically
with the subject of preventive detention and expressly takes
away the fundamental rights relating to arrest and detention
enumerated  in clauses (1) and (2) of the article from	per-
sons  who are detained under any law which may be passed  by
the  Parliament or State Legislatures acting  under  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_729">article
246</a> of the Constitution read with the relevant items in	 the
legislative  lists.  I will leave aside for the	 moment	 the
question as to how far the court can examine the reasonable-
ness or otherwise of the procedure that is prescribed by any
law relating
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_170">252</span>
to preventive detention, for that would involve a considera-
tion  of the precise scope and meaning of article.  21;	 but
this  much is beyond controversy that so far as	 substantive
law  is	 concerned, <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_730">article 22</a> of the Constitution  gives  a
clear  authority to the legislature to take away the  funda-
mental	rights relating to arrest and detention,  which	 are
secured by the'first two clauses of the article. Any  legis-
lation	on  the subject would only have to  conform  to	 the
requirements  of  clauses (4) to (7) and  provided  that  is
done,  there is nothing in the language employed nor in	 the
context	 in  which it appears which affords any	 ground	 for
suggestion that such law must be reasonable in its character
and that it would be reviewable by the Court on that ground.
Both  articles 19 and 22 occur in the same Part of the	Con-
stitution and both of them purport to lay down the fundamen-
tal  rights which the Constitution guarantees.	It  is	well
settled that the Constitution must be interpreted in a broad
and  liberal manner giving effect to all its parts, and	 the
presumption  should  be that no conflict or  repugnancy	 was
intended  by  its framers.  In interpreting the words  of  a
Constitution,  the same principles undoubtedly	apply  which
are applicable in construing a statute, but as was  observed
by Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth of Australia ( 1  ),
"the  ultimate	result must be determined  upon	 the  actual
words used not in vacuo but as occurring in a single complex
instrument in which one part may throw light on the  other."
"The  Constitution," his Lordship went on saying, "has	been
described  as the federal compact and the construction	must
hold a balance between all its parts."
</p><p id="p_403">    It	seems to me that there is no conflict or  repugnancy
between the two provisions of the Constitution and an exami-
nation of the scheme and language of the catena of  articles
which deal with the rights to freedom would be sufficient to
show that what clause (1) (d) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_731">article 19</a> contemplates  is
not  freedom from detention, either punitive or	 preventive;
it  relates to and speaks of a different aspect or phase  of
civil liberty.
</p><p id="p_404">(1) [1936] A.C. 578 at p. 613.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_171">253</span>
<p id="p_405">    <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_732">Article  19</a>, which is the first of this series of  arti-
cles, enumerates seven varieties or forms of freedom  begin-
ning with liberty of speech and expression and ending'	with
free  right to practise any trade, profession  or  business.
The  rights declared it articles 19 to 22 do  not  certainly
exhaust	 the  whole list of liberties which  people  possess
under  law.  The object of the framers of  the	Constitution
obviously  is  to  enumerate and guarantee  those  forms  of
liberty which come under well-known categories recognised by
constitutional writers and are considered to be	 fundamental
and of vital importance to the community.
</p><p id="p_406">    There  cannot  be any such thing as absolute  or  uncon-
trolled liberty wholly freed from restraint, for that  would
lead to anarchy and disorder.  The possession and  enjoyment
of  all	 rights,  as was observed by the  Supreme  Court  of
America	 in  Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1), are	 subject  to
such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing
authority  of the country essential to the  safety,  health,
peace,	general	 order	and morals of  the  community.	 The
question,  therefore  arises in each case of  adjusting	 the
conflicting interests of the individual and of the  society.
In  some  cases, restrictions have to be  placed  upon	free
exercise of individual rights to safeguard the interests  of
the society; on the other hand, social control which  exists
for public good has got to be restrained, lest it should  be
misused to the detriment of individual rights and liberties.
Ordinarily,  every man has the liberty to order his life  as
he  pleases,  to say what he will, to go where he  will,  to
follow any trade, occupation or calling at his pleasure	 and
to  do any other thing which he can lawfully do without	 let
or hindrance by any other person.  On the other hand for the
very  protection  of these liberties the  society  must	 arm
itself with certain powers.  No man's liberty would be worth
its  name if it can be violated with impunity by any  wrong-
doer and if his property or possessions could be preyed upon
by a thief or a marauder. The society, therefore, has got to
exercise  certain powers for the protection of these  liber-
ties and to arrest, search, imprison and
(1) 197 U.S. 11.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_172">254</span>
<p id="p_407">punish those who break the law.	 If these powers are'  prop-
erly exercised, they themselves are the safeguards of  free-
dom,  but  they	 can certainly be abused.   The	 police	 may
arrest	any man and throw him into prison without  assigning
any reasons; they may search his belongings on the slightest
pretext;  he may be subjected to a sham trial and even	pun-
ished  for  crimes unknown to law.  What  the  Constitution,
therefore,  attempts  to do in declaring the rights  of	 the
people is to strike a balance between individual liberty and
social control.
</p><p id="p_408">    To me it seems that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_733">article 19</a> of the Constitution gives
a list of individual liberties and prescribes in the various
clauses the restraints that may be placed upon them by	law,
so that they may not conflict with public welfare or general
morality.  On  the  other hand articles 20, 21	and  22	 are
primarily  concerned  with penal enactments  or	 other	laws
under  which personal safety or liberty of persons could  be
taken away in the interests of the society and they set down
the  limits within which the State control should  be  exer-
cised.	<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_734">Article 19</a> uses the expression ' 'freedom" and	men-
tions the several forms and aspects of it which are  secured
to individuals, together with the limitations that could  be
placed	upon them in the  general interests of the  society.
Articles 20, 21 and 22 on the other hand do not make use  of
the expression "freedom" and they lay down the	restrictions
that  are to be placed on State control where an  individual
is  sought to be deprived of his life or  personal  liberty.
The  right  to	the safety of one's life and  limbs  and  to
enjoyment of personal liberty, in the sense of freedom	from
physical restraint and coercion of any sort, are the  inher-
ent  birthrights  of  a man.  The essence  of  these  rights
consists  in restraining others from interfering  with	them
and hence they cannot be described in terms of	"freedom" to
do particular things. There is also no question of  imposing
limits on the activities of individuals so far as the  exer-
cise  of  these rights is concerned.  For these	 reasons,  I
think, these rights have not been mentioned in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_735">article 19</a> of
the Constitution.  An individual can be deprived of his life
or personal liberty only by action
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_173">255</span>
of  the	 State,	 either under the provisions  of  any  penal
enactment  or in the exercise of any other coercive  process
vested	in it under law.  What the Constitution does  there-
fore  is to put restrictions upon the powers of	 the  State,
for  protecting	 the  rights of the  individuals.   The	 re-
straints  on State authority operate as guarantees of  indi-
vidual	freedom	 and secure to the people the  enjoyment  of
life  and  personal liberty which are thus  declared  to  be
inviolable except in the manner indicated in these articles.
In  my	opinion, the group of articles 20 to 22	 embody	 the
entire protection guaranteed by the Constitution in relation
to deprivation of life and personal liberty both with regard
to  substantive	 as  well as to procedural law.	 It  is	 not
correct	 to  say, as I shah show more fully later  on,	that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_736">article	 21</a> is confined to matters of procedure only.  There
must  be a substantive law, under which the State is  empow-
ered  to deprive a man of his life and personal liberty	 and
such law must be a valid law which the legislature is compe-
tent to enact within the limits of the powers assigned to it
and which does not transgress any of the fundamental  rights
that  the Constitution lays down.  Thus a person  cannot  be
convicted  or punished under an ex post facto law, or a	 law
which compels the accused to incriminate himself in a crimi-
nal  trial  or punishes him for the same offence  more	than
once.  These are the protections provided for by <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_737">article 20.</a>
Again a law providing for arrest and detention must  conform
to  the	 limitations prescribed by clauses (1)	and  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_738">article	 22.</a>  These provisions	indeed have  been  withdrawn
expressly in case of preventive detention and protections of
much more feeble and attenuated character have been  substi-
tuted  in their place;but this is a question of	 the  policy
adopted	 by  the Constitution which does not concern  us  at
all.   The position, therefore, is that with regard to	life
and personal liberty, the Constitution guarantees protection
to this extent that no man could be deprived of these rights
except	under a valid law passed by a competent	 legislature
within the limits mentioned above and in accordance with the
procedure  which  such law lays down.  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_739">Article	19</a>,  on	 the
other hand,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_174">256</span>
enunciates  certain particular forms of civil liberty  quite
independently  of  the rights dealt with under	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_740">article	 21.</a>
Most of them may be connected with or dependent upon person-
al liberty but are not identical with it; and the purpose of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_741">article 19</a> is to indicate the limits within which the  State
could,	by legislation, impose restrictions on the  exercise
of  these rights by the individuals.  The reasonableness  or
otherwise  of such legislation can indeed be  determined  by
the Court to the extent laid down in the several clauses  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_742">article 19</a>, though no such review is permissible with regard
to laws relating to deprivation of life and personal  liber-
ty.   This  may be due to the fact that	 life  and  personal
freedom constitute the most vital and essential rights which
people	enjoy under any State and in such  matters the	pre-
cise  and  definite  expression of  the	 intention  of	 the
legislature  has  been preferred by the Constitution to	 the
variable  standards  which the	judiciary might	  lay  down.
We find the rights relating  to personal liberty  being	 de-
clared	almost in the  same  terms  in	  the  Irish Consti-
tution	<a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_743">article 40 (1) (4) (1)</a> of which lays down  that	 "no
citizen	 shall be deprived  of his personal liberty save  in
accordance  with law." In the Constitution of the Free	City
of  Danzig, "the liberty of the person has been declared  to
be  inviolable and no limitation or deprivation of  personal
liberty may be imposed by public authority except by  virtue
of  a  law" (vide <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_744">article 74</a>).	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_745">Article 31</a> of  the  Japanese
Constitution  is the closest parallel to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_746">article 21</a>  of	 the
Indian	Constitution and the language is  almost  identical.
This  is the scheme adopted by the Constitution	 in  dealing
with  the  rights  to freedom described in  the	 chapter  on
fundamental rights and in my opinion, therefore, the  proper
test  for  determining the validity of	an  enactment  under
which  a  person is sought to be deprived of  his  life	 and
personal  liberty has to be found not in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_747">article 19</a>, but  in
the  three following articles of the Constitution.   <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_748">Article
20</a>  of course has no application so far as the law  relating
to preventive detention is concerned.
</p><p id="p_409">Mr. Nambiar's endeavour throughout has been to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_175">257</span>
establish  that <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_749">article 19 (1) (d)</a> of the Constitution	read
with <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_750">article 19 (5)</a> enunciates the fundamental rights of the
citizens regarding the substantive law of personal  liberty,
while  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_751">article 21</a> embodies the protection as regards  proce-
dural  law. This, in my opinion, would be looking  at  these
provisions from a wrong angle altogether.  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_752">Article 19</a> cannot
be said to deal with substantive law merely, nor <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_753">article  21</a>
with mere matters of procedure.	 It cannot also be said that
the  provisions of <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_754">article 19 (1) (d)</a> read with	 clause	 (5)
and  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_755">article 21</a> are complementary to each other.   The	con-
tents  and  subject  matter of the two	provisions  are	 not
identical  and they proceed  on totally	 different   princi-
ples. There is no mention of any "right to life" in  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_756">article
19</a>,  although  that is the primary and	the  most  important
thing  for  which provision is made in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_757">article 21.</a>   If	 the
contention of the learned counsel is correct, we would	have
to hold that no protection is guaranteed by the Constitution
as  regards  right to life so far substantive  law  is	con-
cerned. In the second place, even if freedom of movement may
be regarded as one of the ingredients of  personal  liberty,
surely there are other elements included in the concept	 and
admittedly no provision for other forms of personal  liberty
are  to	 be  found in <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_758">article 19 (5)</a>  of  the  Constitution.
Furthermore  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_759">article  19</a>  is applicable	 to  citizens  only,
while  the rights guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_760">article 21</a> are for all	per-
sons.  citizens as well as aliens.  The only proper  way  of
avoiding these anomalies is to interpret the two  provisions
as  applying  to different subjects and this  would  be	 the
right conclusion if we have in mind the scheme which  under-
lies this group of articles.
</p><p id="p_410">    I  will now turn to the language of <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_761">article 19  (1)	 (d)</a>
and see whether preventive detention really comes within its
purview. <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_762">Article 19 (1) (d)</a> provides that all citizens shall
have  the right to move freely throughout the  territory  of
India.	 The  two sub-clauses which come  immediately  after
sub-clause (d) and are intimately connected with it, are  in
these terms:
</p><p id="p_411">    "(e)  To reside and settle in any part of the  territory
of India;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_176">258</span>
<p id="p_412">     (f)  to acquire, hold and dispose of property."  Clause
(5)relates to all these three sub-clauses and lays down that
nothing	 in them shall affect the operation of any  existing
law  in	 so  far as it imposes, or prevent  the	 State	from
making	any  law imposing, reasonable  restrictions  on	 the
exercise  of  any of the rights conferred by the  said	sub-
clause either in the interests of the general public or	 for
the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe.
    I  agree with the learned Attorney-General that in	con-
struing	 <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_763">article  19 (1) (d)</a> stress is to be laid  upon	 the
expression "throughout the territory of India," and it is  a
particular  and	 special kind of right, viz., that  of	free
movement  throughout the Indian territory, that is  the	 aim
and object of the Constitution to secure.  In the next	sub-
clause,	 right	tO  reside and settle "in any  part  of	 the
territory  of  India" is given and here again  the  material
thing  is not the right of residence or settlement  but	 the
right to reside or settle in any part of the Indian territo-
ry.  For an analogous provision, we may refer to <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_764">article 301</a>
which  says  that subject to the other	provisions  of	this
Part,  commerce and intercourse throughout the territory  of
India shall be free. The meaning of sub-clause (d) of  arti-
cle  19	 (1)  will be clear if we take it  along  with	sub-
clauses (e) and (f), all of which have been lumped  together
in  clause  (5) and to all of which  the  same	restrictions
including those relating to protecion of the interest of any
scheduled  tribe  have	been made applicable.	It  will  be
remembered that these rights are available only to citizens.
To  an alien or foreigner, no guarantee of such	 rights	 has
been given.  Normally all citizens would have the free right
to  move from one part of the Indian territory	to  another.
They  can shift their residence from one place to any  other
place  of  their choice and settle anywhere they  like.	 The
right of free trade,  commerce and  intercourse	  throughout
the territory of India is also secured.	 What the  Constitu-
tion  emphasises upon by guaranteeing these rights  is	that
the whole of Indian Unian in spite of its being divided into
a number of States is really one unit as far as the citizens
of the Union are concerned. All the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_177">259</span>
   citizens  would  have the same privileges  and  the	same
facilities  for	 moving into any part of the  territory	 and
they can reside or carry on business anywhere they like; and
no  restrictions  either inter-State or otherwise  would  be
allowed	 to  set up in these respects between  one  part  of
India and another.
</p><p id="p_413">    So	far  as free movement throughout  the  territory  is
concerned,  the right is subject to the provision of  clause
(5),  under which reasonable limitation may be imposed	upon
these  liberties in the interests of the general  public  or
protection  of	any scheduled tribe. The  interests  of	 the
public	which necessitates such restrictions may be of	var-
ious  kinds.   They may be connected with the  avoidance  of
pestilence  or	spreading of  contagious  diseases;  certain
places	'again may be kept closed for military purposes	 and
there  may  be	prohibition of entry into  areas  which	 are
actual or potential war zones or where disturbances of	some
kind or other prevail.	Whatever the reasons might be, it is
necessary  that these restrictions must be reasonable,	that
is to say, commensurate with the purpose for which they	 are
laid  down.  In addition to general interest, the  Constitu-
tion  has specified the protection of the interests  of	 the
scheduled  tribes as one of the factors which has got to  be
taken  into consideration in the framing of  these  restric-
tions.	The scheduled tribes, as is well known, are a  back-
ward  and unsophisticated class of people who are liable  to
be  imposed  upon by shrewd and	 designing  persons.   Hence
there are various provisions disabling them from  alienating
even  their own properties except under special	 conditions.
In  their interest and for their benefit, laws may  be	made
restricting  the ordinary right of citizens to go or  settle
in particular areas or acquire property in them. The  refer-
ence  to  the  interest of scheduled tribe  makes  it  quite
clear-that the free movement spoken of in the clause relates
not  to general rights of locomotion but to  the  particular
right  of  shifting or moving from one part  of	 the  Indian
territory  to  another, without any sort  of  discriminatory
barriers.
</p><p id="p_414">    This  view	will receive further support if we  look  to
some analogous provisions ,in the Constitution of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_178">260</span>
other  countries.  It will be seen that sub-clauses (d)	 (e)
and  (f)of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_765">article 19 (1)</a> are embodied in  almost  identical
language  in  one single article, viz., <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_766">article	 75</a>  of	 the
Constitution  of the Free City of Danzig.  The article	runs
as follows:
</p><p id="p_415">    "All  nationals shall enjoy freedom of  movement  within
the free city and shall have the right to stay and to settle
at  any place they may choose, to acquire real property	 and
to  earn  their living in any way. This right shall  not  be
curtailed without legal sanctions."
</p><p id="p_416">    The several rights are thus mentioned together as  being
included in the same category, while they are differentiated
from  the "liberty of the person" which is "described to  be
inviolable  except by virtue of a law" in <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_767">article  74</a>  which
appears just previous to this article.	An analogous  provi-
sion  in slightly altered language occurs in <a href="/doc/158646/" id="a_768">article 111</a>  of
the Constitution of the German Reich which is worded in	 the
following manner:
</p><p id="p_417">    All	   Germans  enjoy the right of	change	of  domicile
within the whole Reich.	 Every one has the right to stay  in
any  part  of the Realm that he chooses,  t6  settle  there,
acquire landed property and pursue any means of livelihood."
Here again the right to personal liberty has been dealt with
separately in <a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_769">article 114.</a>  A suggestion was made in  course
of  our	 discussions  that the	expression  "throughout	 the
territory  of India" occurring in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_770">article 19 (1)  (d)</a>  might
have been used with  a view to save Passport Regulations  or
to emphasise  that no rights of free emigration are  guaran-
teed by the  Constitution.  The suggestion does not seem  to
me  to	be proper.  No State can guarantee to  its  citizens
the.	free   right  to  do  anything	 outside   its	 own
territory.This	is true of all the fundamental	rights	men-
tioned	 in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_771">article 19</a> and not merely of the right  of	free
movement. Further it seems to me that the words	 "throughout
the  territory of India" have nothing to do with  rights  of
emigration.   We find that both in the	Danzig as well as in
the German Constitution, where	similar words have been used
with  regard to the excercise of the right of free  movement
throughout the.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_179">261</span>
<p id="p_418">territory, there are specific provisions which guarantee  to
all  nationals the free right of emigration to	other  coun-
tries (vide <a href="/doc/1985537/" id="a_772">article 76</a> of the Danzig Constitution and  arti-
cle  112  of the Constitution of the German Reich).   In  my
opinion,  therefore,  preventive  detention  does  not	come
either within the express language or  within the spirit and
intendment of clause (1) (d) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_773">article 19</a> of the  Constitu-
tion which deals with a totally different aspect or form  of
civil liberty.
</p><p id="p_419">   It is true that by reason of preventive detention, a	 man
may be prevented from exercising the right of free  movement
within the territory of India as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_774">article  19
(1)  (d)</a> of the Constitution, but that is merely  incidental
to or consequential upon loss of liberty resulting from	 the
order  of detention.  Not merely the right under clause	 (1)
</p><p id="p_420">(d), but many of the other rights which are enumerated under
the  other-sub-clauses	of  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_775">article 19 (1)</a> may	be  lost  or
suspended so long as preventive detention continues.  Thus a
detenu	so long as he is under detention may not be able  to
practise  any profession, or carry on any trade or  business
which  he might like to do; but this would not make the	 law
providing for preventive detention a legislation taking away
or  abridging  the rights under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_776">article 19 (1)	(g)</a>  of	 the
Constitution and it would be absurd to suggest that in	such
cases  the validity of the legislation should be  tested  in
accordance  with  the requirement of clause (6)	 of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_777">article
19'</a>and that the only restrictions that could be placed	upon
the person's free exercise of trade and profession are those
specified in that clause. Mr. Nambiar concedes that in	such
cases we must look to the substance of the particular legis-
lation	and  the mere fact that	 it   incidentally  trenches
upon  some other right to which it does not directly  relate
is  not material.  He argues, however, that the	 essence  or
substance  of  a legislation which provides  for  preventive
detention is to take away or curtail the right of free move-
ments  and  in fact, "personal liberty"	 according  to	him,
connotes nothing else but unrestricted right of	 locomotion.
The  learned  counsel refers in this connection	 to  certain
passages  in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws  of	Eng-
land, where
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_180">262</span>
the author discusses what he calls the three  absoluterights
inherent  in  every Englishman, namely, rights	of  personal
security,   personal   liberty	 and   property.   "Personal
security",  according to Blackstone, consists in a  person's
legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limb, his
body,  his  health  and his  reputation;  whereas  "personal
liberty" consists in the power of locomotion, of changing of
situation  or moving one's person to whatsoever place  one's
own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint
unless	by  due	 course of law (1).  It will  be  seen	that
Blackstone  uses  the  expression "personal  liberty"  in  a
somewhat  narrow  and restricted sense.	 A  much  wider	 and
larger	connotation is given to it by later writers on	con-
stitutional documents, particularly in America. In  ordinary
language  "personal  liberty" means liberty relating  to  or
concerning  the person or body of the individual; and  "per-
sonal  liberty" in this sense is the antithesis of  physical
restraint  or  coercion.   According to	 Dicey,	 who  is  an
acknowledged  authority	 on the subject	 "personal  liberty"
means a personal right not to be subjected to  imprisonment,
arrest	or other physical coercion in any manner  that	does
not admit of legal  justification(2). It is, in my  opinion,
this  negative right of not being subjected to any  form  of
physical restraint or coercion that constitutes the  essence
of personal liberty and not mere freedom to move to any part
of the Indian territory.
</p><p id="p_421">    In	this connection, it may not be irrelevant to.  point
out  that  it was in accordance with the  recommendation  of
the'Drafting Committee that the word "personal" was inserted
before "liberty" in <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_778">article 15</a> of the Constitution which now
stands as <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_779">article 21.</a> In the report of the Drafting  Commit-
tee   it is stated that the word "liberty" should be  quali-
fied  by  the insertion of the word "personal"	 before	 it;
otherwise,  it might be construed very widely so as  to	 in-
clude  even the freedoms already dealt with in	<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_780">article	 13.</a>
Article. 13, it should be noted, is the present <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_781">article	 19.</a>

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_181">263</span>
<p id="p_422">Constituent Assembly, the intention obviously was to exclude
the  contents of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_782">article 19.</a> from the concept  of  "personal
liberty" as used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_783">article 21.</a>	 To -what extent the meaning
of  words used in the Constitution could be discovered	from
reports of Drafting Committee or debates on the floor of the
House  is a matter not quite free from doubt and I may	have
to take up this matter later on when discussing the  meaning
of  the material clause in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_784">article 21</a>  of the  Constitution.
It is enough to say at this stage that if the report of	 the
Drafting Committee is an appropriate material upon which the
interpretation	of  the words of the Constitution  could  be
based,	it  certainly  goes against the	 contention  of	 the
applicant and it shows that the words used in <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_785">article 19 (1)</a>
</p><p id="p_423">(d)  of the Constitution do not mean the same thing  as	 the
expression  "personal  liberty" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_786">article 21</a> does.   It  is
well  known that the word "'liberty" standing by itself	 has
been  given a very wide meaning by the Supreme Court of	 the
United	States	of America.  It includes not  only  personal
freedom	 from physical restraint but the right to  the	free
use of one's own property and to enter into free contractual
relations,   In the Indian Constitution, on the other  hand,
the expression "personal liberty" has been deliberately used
to restrict it to freedom from physical restraint of  person
by incarceration or otherwise. Apart from the report of	 the
Drafting Committee, that is the plain grammatical meaning of
the expression as I have already explained.
    It may not, I think, be quite accurate to state that the
operation  of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_787">article 19</a> of the Constitution is	 limited  to
free  citizens only and that the rights have been  described
in that article on the presupposition that the citizens	 are
at liberty.  The deprivation of personal liberty may  entail
as  a  consequence the loss or abridgement of  many  of	 the
rights	described  in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_788">article 19</a>, but that  is	because	 the
nature of these rights is such that free exercise of them is
not  possible  in the absence of personal liberty.   On	 the
other hand, the right to hold and dispose of property  which
is  in	subclause  (f) of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_789">article 19 (1)</a> and  which  is	 not
dependent  on  full possession of personal  liberty  by	 the
owner may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_182">264</span>
not  be	 affected if the owner is  imprisoned  or  detained.
Anyway, the point is not of much importance for purposes  of
the present discussion.	 The result is that, in my  opinion,
the  first contention raised by Mr. Nambiar  cannot  succeed
and  it must be held that we are not   entitled	 to  examine
the reasonableness or otherwise of the Preventive  Detention
Act  and  see whether it is within  the	 permissible  bounds
specified in clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_790">article 19.</a>
</p><p id="p_424">I  now	come to the second point raised by  Mr.	 Nambiar  in
support	 of  the  application; and upon this  point  we	 had
arguments of a most elaborate nature addressed to us by	 the
learned	 counsel on both sides,	 displaying  a	considerable
amount	of learning and research.  The point, however, is  a
short  one and turns upon the interpretation to be put	upon
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_791">article	 21</a>  of the Constitution, which lays down  that	 "no
person shall be deprived of his	 ........  personal liberty,
except	according  to procedure established by law."   On  a
plain  reading of the article the meaning seems to  be	that
you cannot deprive a man of his personal liberty, unless you
follow	and  act  according to the law	which  provides	 for
deprivation  of	 such liberty.	The  expression	 "procedure"
means  the  manner  and form of enforcing the  law.   In  my
opinion, it cannot be disputed that in order that there	 may
be a legally established procedure, the law which establish-
es  it must be a valid and lawful law which the	 legislature
is competent to enact in accordance with <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_792">article 245</a> of	 the
Constitution  and  the particular items in  the	 legislative
lists  which  it relates to.  It is also not  disputed	that
such  law  must not offend against  the	 fundamental  rights
which  are  declared in Part III of  the  Constitution.	 The
position taken up by the learned Attorney-General is that as
in  the present case there is no doubt about the  competency
of  that Parliament to enact the law relating to  preventive
detention  which is fully covered by Item 9 of List  I,	 and
Item  3	 of List III, and as no question of  the  law  being
reasonable  or otherwise arises for consideration by  reason
of the fact that <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_793">article 19 (1) (d)</a> is not attracted to this
case,  the law must be held to be a valid piece of  legisla-
tion and if the procedure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_183">265</span>
laid  down  by it has been adhered to, the validity  of	 the
detention cannot possibly be  challenged.  His further argu-
ment is that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_794">article 22</a> specifically provides for preventive
detention  and	lays down fully what the requirements  of  a
legislation  on the subject should be.	As the impugned	 Act
conforms to the requirements of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_795">article 22</a>, no further ques-
tion of its validity under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_796">article 21</a> of the Constitution at
all arises. The latter aspect of his arguments, I will	deal
with   later   on.   So	 far  as  the  main    argument	  is
concerned,the  position	 taken	up by Mr.  Nambiar  is	that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_797">article 21</a> refers to 'procedure	 only  and  not to  substan-
tive  law  the	procedure, however, must  be  one  which  is
established   by   law.	  The  expression   "law"   in	this
context does not mean or signify,  according to the  learned
counsel, any particular	  law  enacted by  the	 legislature
in  conformity	with  the  requirements	 of   the  Constitu-
tion	 or  otherwise possessing a binding  authority.	  It
refers to law in the abstract or general sense--in the sense
of jus and not lex--and meaning thereby the legal principles
or fundamental rules that lie at the root of every system of
positive  law including our own, and the authority of  which
is acknowledged in the jurisprudence of all civilised  coun-
tries.	It is argued that if the word	 "law" is interpret-
ed in the sense of any State-made law, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_798">article 21</a> could	 not
rank  as a fundamental right imposing a check or  limitation
on the legislative authority of the Government.	 It will  be
always	competent  to the legislature to pass a	 law  laying
down a thoroughly arbitrary and irrational procedure opposed
to all elementary principles of justice and fairness and the
people	would have no protection whatsoever,  provided	such
procedure  was scrupulously adhered to.	 In support of	this
argument the learned counsel has relied upon a large  number
of  American cases, where the Supreme Court of	America	 ap-
plied the doctrine of "due process of law" as it appears  in
the  American Constitution for the purpose  of	invalidating
various legislative enactments which appeared to that  Court
to be capricious and arbitrary and opposed to the  fundamen-
tal principles of law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">266</span>
<p id="p_425">    It	may be noted here that in the original draft of	 the
Indian Constitution the words used in <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_799">article 15 (which	 now
stands	as <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_800">article 21</a>)</a> were "in accordance with due  process
of  law."  The Drafting Committee recommended that in  place
of  the "due process" clause, the expression  "according  to
procedure  established by law" should be  substituted.	 The
present <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_801">article 21</a> seems to have been modeled on <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_802">article  31</a>
of the Japanese Constitution, where the language employed is
"no  person shall be deprived of'life or liberty, nor  shall
any  other criminal penalty be imposed, except according  to
procedure  established by law."	 Mr. Nambiar   argues	that
the expression	"procedure established by law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_803">article 21</a>
of  the	 Constitution  bears the same meaning  as  the	"due
process"  clause  does in America, restricted only  to	this
extent, viz., that it is limited to matters of procedure and
does not extend to questions of substantive law.  To  appre-
ciate the arguments that have been advanced for and  against
this view and to fix the precise meaning that is to be given
to  this  clause  in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_804">article 21</a>, it would  be  necessary  to
discuss	 briefly  the  conception of the  doctrine  of	"due
process	 of law" as it appears in the American	Constitution
and  the way in which it has been developed and	 applied  by
the Supreme Court of America.
</p><p id="p_426">    In	the history of	Anglo-American law,  the concept  of
"due process of law" or what is considered to be its equiva-
lent "law of the land" traces its lineage far back into	 the
beginning  of the 13th century A.D. The famous 39th  chapter
of  the	 Magna Charta provides that "no free  man  shall  be
taken  or imprisoned or disseized, or outlawed or exiled  or
in any way destroyed; nor shall we go upon him nor send upon
him  but by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the	 law
of  the land." Magna Charta as a charter of English  liberty
was  confirmed by successive English monarchs and it  is  in
one  of these confirmations (28 Ed. III, Chap. 3)  known  as
"Statute  of Westminster of the liberties of  London",	that
the  expression	 "due  process of law" for  the	 first	time
appears.  Neither of these phrases was explained or  defined
in any	of  the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_185">267</span>
</p><p id="p_427">-documents,  but on the authority of Sir Edward Coke it	 may
be said that both the expressions have the same meaning.  In
substance,  they  guaranteed that persons  should  not	  be
imprisoned without proper indictment and trial by peers, and
that  property	should not be seized except  in	 proceedings
conducted  in due form in which the owner or the  person  in
possession  should  have an opportunity to  show  cause	 why
seizure	 should not be made (1).  These concepts  came	into
America	 as part of the rights of Englishmen claimed by	 the
colonists.  The expression in one form or other appeared  in
some  of  the  earlier	State Constitutions  and  the  exact
phrase "due process of law" came to be a part of the Federal
Constitution  by  the Fifth Amendment which was	 adopted  in
1791 and which provided that "no person shall... be deprived
of life, liberty or property without due process of law." It
was imposed upon the State Constitution in almost  identical
language by the Fourteenth Amendment in the year 1868.
    What "due process of law" exactly means is difficult  to
define even at the present day, The Constitution contains no
description  of	 what is "due process of law"  nor  does  it
declare	 the principles by application of which it could  be
ascertained.   In  Twining v. New Jersey (2) the  Court	 ob-
served:
</p><p id="p_428">    "Few  phrases in the law are so elusive of exact  appre-
hension	 as this.  This COurt has always declined to give  a
comprehensive  definition of it and has preferred  that	 its
full meaning should be gradually ascertained by the  process
of inclusion and exclusion in the course of the decisions of
cases as they arise."
</p><p id="p_429">    It	is  clear,  however, that the  requirement  of	"due
process of law" in the United States Constitution imposes  a
limitation upon all the powers of Government, legislative as
well  as executive and judicial. Applied in England only  as
protection  against executive usurpation and royal  tyranny,
in America it became a bulwark against arbitrary legislation
(3).

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_186">268</span>
<p id="p_433">As  it	is a restraint upon the legislative power  and	the-
object	is to protect citizens against arbitrary and  capri-
cious  legislation, it is not within the competence  of	 the
Congress  to make any process a "due process of law" by	 its
mere will; for that would make the limitation quite  nugato-
ry.   As laid down in the case cited above, "it is  not	 any
act legislative in form that   is law; law is something more
than  mere will exerted as an act of power."  It  means	 and
signifies the general law of the land, the settled and abid-
ing  principles	 which inhere in the  Constitution  and	 lie
at the root of the entire legal system.	 To quote the  words
of  Daniel Webster in a famous argument	 before.the  Supreme
Court (1):
</p><p id="p_434">   "By	the  law of the land is most  clearly  intended	 the
general	 law--a	 law which hears before it  condemns,  which
proceeds upon enquiry and renders judgment only after trial.
The  meaning  is  that every citizen shall  hold  his  life,
liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the
general rules which govern society."
</p><p id="p_435">   What these principles of general law are nobody has	ever
attempted  to  enumerate.  To a large extent  they  are	 the
principles of English common law and modes of judicial	pro-
ceedings obtaining in England, the traditions of which	came
along  with  the settlers in America.  Some Judges  seem  to
have  alluded  to the principles of natural justice  in	 ex-
plaining what is meant by general law or "law of the  land,"
though the doctrine of a law of nature did not obtain a firm
footing at any time.  In Wynehamer v. New York (2),  Justice
Hubbard declared himself opposed to the judiciary attempting
to  set bounds to the legislative authority or	declaring  a
statute	 invalid upon any fanciful theory of'higher  law  or
first  principles of natural right outside of the  Constitu-
tion.	Coke's	dictum of a supreme  fundamental  law  which
obviously referred to principles of English common law	cer-
tainly did exercise considerable influence upon the minds of
the  American Judges (3) and there are observations in	some
cases
 (1)  Darmouth College case, 4 Wheaton p. 518.	     (2)  13
N.Y. 379.
</p><p id="p_436">	      (3) Willis on Constitutional Law, p. 647.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_187">269</span>
<p id="p_437">which  go to suggest that the principles of natural  justice
were regarded as identical with those of common law,  except
where  the rules of common law were not considered to be  of
fundamental  character or were not acted upon as  being	 un-
suited to the progress of time or conditions of the American
Society (1).  In the case of Loan Association v. Topeka (2),
it  was observed that there are limitations upon  powers  of
Government  which grow out of the essential nature  of	free
Governments--implied   reservations  of	 individual   rights
without	 which the social compact could not exist and  which
are respected by all Governments entitled to the name.	What
is  hinted at, is undoubtedly the old idea of a social	com-
pact  under  which political institutions were	supposed  to
come into being; and the suggestion is that  when the Ameri-
cans  formed themselves into a State by surrendering a	por-
tion  of their rights which they possessed at that time	 and
which	presumably   they  inherited  from   their   English
ancestors,  there  were	 certain  rights  of  a	 fundamental
character  still  reserved  by them  which  no	State  could
possibly take away.
</p><p id="p_438">    As has been said already, "due process of law" has never
been  defined  by  Judges or Jurists in	 America.  The	best
description of the expression would be to say that it  means
in  each particular case such an exercise of the  powers  of
Government as the settled maxims of law permit and sanction,
and  under such safeguards for the protection of  individual
rights	as those maxims prescribe for the class of cases  to
which the one in question belongs (3).
</p><p id="p_439">    In the actual application of the clause relating to "due
process	 of  law" to particular cases the decisions  of	 the
Supreme Court of America present certain peculiar and unusu-
al  features  and  there is total lack	 of  uniformity	 and
consistency  in	 them.	 Ever since the	 appearance  of	 the
clause in the Fifth Amendment and down to the middle of	 the
19th century, it was interpreted as a restriction on  proce-
dure, and particularly the judicial procedure, by which	 the
Government

tions, Vol. II, p. 741.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_188">270</span>
<p id="p_440">exercises its powers.  Principally it related to the  proce-
dure  by which persons were tried for crimes and  guaranteed
to accused persons the right to have a fair trial in compli-
ance with well established criminal proceedings.   The	same
principle  applied to the machinery or proceeding  by  which
property rights were adjudicated and by which the powers  of
eminent	 domain	 and taxation were exercised.	During	this
period it was not considered to have any bearing on substan-
tial law at all.
</p><p id="p_441">    Change,  however, came in and the period  that  followed
witnessed  a growing  recognition of the doctrine that	sub-
stantive rights of life, liberty and property are  protected
by the requirement of due process of law against any  depri-
vation attempted at by legislative authority; and the polit-
ical  and economic conditions of the country accounted to  a
great extent for this change in judicial outlook.  The close
of  the	 civil	war brought in a new  period  of  industrial
development leading to accumulation of large capital in	 the
hands  of  industrialists and the emergence  of	 a  definite
labouring  class.   New and important problems	arose  which
the States attempted to deal with by various laws and  regu-
lations.   Some	 of them seem to have been  ill-advised	 and
arbitrary  and	there  was  a  clamour	amongst	 businessmen
against	 what  they described as  legislative  encroachments
upon  their  vested private rights.  The Supreme  Court	 now
began  to  use the rule of due process of law  as  a  direct
restraint  upon substantial legislation and any	 statute  or
administrative	act, which imposed a limitation upon  rights
of  private property or free contractual  relations  between
the employers and employed, was invalidated as not being  in
accordance with due process of law (1).	 What constituted  a
legitimate exercise of the powers of legislation now came to
be  a judicial question and no statute was valid  unless  it
was.  reasonable in the opinion of the Court.  The  question
of reasonableness obviously depends largely upon the.  ideas
of  particular	individuals  and the Courts  or	 rather	 the
majority of Judges thus marshalled their own

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_189">271</span>
<p id="p_442">views of social and economic policy in deciding the reasona-
bleness or otherwise of the statutes.  In the language of  a
well-known  writer,  the Courts became a  kind	of  negative
third  chamber both to the State Legislatures and  the	Con-
gress(1).   To what extent the Courts laid stress  upon	 the
doctrine  of freedom of contract is illustrated in the	case
of Lochner v. New York(2).  In that case the question  arose
as to the validity of a labour legislation which  prohibited
the employment of persons in certain fields of activity	 for
more than 60 hours a week.  Lochner was indicted for violat-
ing  this  law by employing a man in his  Biscuit  and	Cake
Factory	 who was to work more than 60 hours in a week.	 The
Court by a majority of 5 to 4 held the statute to be invalid
on the ground that the "right to purchase or sell labour  is
part of the liberty protected by the Amendment unless  there
are circumstances which excluded the right."  That  decision
has been criticized not merely on the ground that it  rested
upon  an  economic  theory which to quote  the	language  of
Holmes	J., who was one of the dissentient Judges  "was	 not
entertained by a large part of the country;" but it  ignored
that such regulation was necessary for protecting the health
of  the	 employees, that is to say, it was in  substance  an
exercise  of  police powers with a view to  accomplish	some
object of public interest(s).
</p><p id="p_443">    It	may  be mentioned here that while  the	due  process
doctrine was being extended by	judicial pronouncements, the
doctrine of police power which operates to some extent as  a
check  upon  the  "due process"	 clause	 was  simultaneously
gaining	 importance.  Roughly speaking, police power may  be
defined as "a right of a Government to regulate the  conduct
of  its	 people in the interests of public  safety,  health,
morals and convenience.	 Under this authority, a  Government
may make regulations concerning the safety of building,	 the
regulation of traffic, the reporting of incurable  diseases,
the inspection of markets, the sanitation of factories,	 the
hours of work for women

<p id="p_446">and children, the sale of intoxicants and such other matters
,,(1).	Here again, the extent to which the Court can inter-
fere  with  exercise of police powers by the State  has	 not
been  clearly defined by judicial pronouncements.  The	doc-
trine  generally accepted is that although any enactment  by
legislature  under  the guise of exercise of  police  powers
would not necessarily be constitutional, yet if the  regula-
tion  has a direct relation to its proposed object which  is
the  accomplishment of some legitimate public  purpose,	 the
wisdom	or policy of the legislation should not be  examined
by  the Courts.	 The rule is not without its exceptions	 but
it  is not necessary to elaborate them for our present	pur-
pose(2).   The	later decisions, though not  quite  uniform,
reveal	the growing influence of the police power  doctrine.
It  may	 be said that since 1936 there has been	 a  definite
swing  of the judicial pendulum in the other direction.	  In
the  case  of West Coast Hotel Company v.  Parrish(3)  which
related	 to  the legality of a Statute	for  regulating	 the
minimum wages of women, Chief Justice Hughes, who  delivered
the opinion of the Court, observed as follows:
   "In each case the violation alleged	   by those  attack-
ing minimum wage regulation for	     women is deprivation of
freedom of contract.  What  is the freedom? The Constitution
does  not  speak  of freedom of contract.    It	  speaks  of
liberty	 and  prohibits the deprivation of  liberty  without
due  process  of law.  In prohibiting that  deprivation	 the
Constitution does not recognise an  absolute  and uncontrol-
lable  liberty. Liberty in each of its phases has its histo-
ry and connotation.  But the liberty safeguarded is  liberty
in  a social organisation which requires the  protection  of
law.  against  the evils which menace  the  health,  safety,
morals and welfare of the people."
</p><p id="p_447">    In	the succeeding years the indications  certainly	 are
that the requirement of due process of law as a	 substantial
restriction on Government control is becoming a thing of the
past and the rule is being restricted more

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_191">273</span>
<p id="p_449">and  more  to its original procedural  meaning.	  What	will
happen	in  future  cannot certainly be	 predicted  at	this
stage(1).
</p><p id="p_450">     Thus it will be seen that the "due process" clause	  in
the  American Constitution came to be used as a	 potent	 in-
strument  in the hands of the judiciary for exercising	con-
trol  over social legislation. The  judicial  pronouncements
are  not guided by  any uniform principle, and the  economic
and social ideas of the Judges, who form the majority in the
Supreme Court for the time being, constitute, so to say, the
yard-stick for measuring the reasonableness or otherwise  of
any  enactment	passed	during that period.   No  writer  of
American  Constitutional  Law  has been able  uptil  now  to
evolve anything like a definite and consistent set of  prin-
ciples out of the large mass of cases, where the doctrine of
"due process of law" has been invoked or applied.
</p><p id="p_451">     It is against this background that we must consider how
the  constitution-makers in India dealt with and gave  final
shape  to  the provisions, on an analogous  subject  in	 the
Indian Constitution.  In the Draft Constitution, <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_805">article  15
(which	now stands as <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_806">article 21</a>)</a> was apparently  framed  on
the  basis of the 5th and 14th Amendments in   the  American
Constitution.	The article was worded as follows:
</p><p id="p_452">      "No  person shall be deprived of his life	 or  liberty
without due process of law."
</p><p id="p_453">     The  Drafting Committee in their report  recommended  a
change	in the language of this article.  The first  sugges-
tion  was that the word "personal" shall be inserted  before
the  word "liberty" and the second was that  the  expression
"in  accordance with procedure established by law" shall  be
substituted for "due process of law," the reason given being
that the former expression was more specific.
</p><p id="p_454">      The learned Attorney-General has placed before us	 the
debates	 in  the Constituent Assembly  centering  round	 the
adoption  of this recommendation of the	 Drafting  Committee
and he has referred us to the
  (1)  Swisher--The  Growth of Constitutional Power  in	 the
United States, pp. 123-25.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_192">274</span>
<p id="p_455">speeches   of	several	  members  of	the   Assembly	 who
played an important part in the shaping of the Constitution.
As an aid to discover the meaning of the words in a  Consti-
tution, these debates are of doubtful value. ''Resort can be
had  to	 them"' says Willoughby,  ''with great	caution	 and
only when latent ambiguities are to be solved. The  proceed-
ings  may be of some value when they clearly point  out	 the
purpose	 of the provision. But when the question is  of	 ab-
stract	meaning,  it will be difficult to derive  from	this
source much material assistance in interpretation"(1).
   The learned Attorney-General concedes that these  debates
are not admissible to explain the meaning of the words	used
and  he wanted to use them only for the purpose	 of  showing
that the Constituent Assembly when they finally adopted	 the
recommendation	of the Drafting Committee, were fully  aware
of the implications of the differences between the old	form
of  expression and the new.  In my opinion, in	interpreting
the  Constitution, it will be better if such extrinsic	evi-
dence is left out of account. In matters like this,  differ-
ent  members act upon different impulses and from  different
motives and it is quite possible that some members  accepted
certain words in a particular sense, while others took	them
in a different light.
</p><p id="p_456">   The	report of the Drafting Committee,  however,has	been
relied	upon by both parties and there are decided  authori-
ties  in  which	 a higher value has been  attached  to	such
reports	 than  the debates on the floor of  the	 House.	  In
Caminetti  v. United States (2), it is said that reports  to
Congress  accompanying the introduction of proposed law	 may
aid the Courts in reaching the true meaning of the  legisla-
tion  in  case	of doubtful interpretation.  The  report  is
extremely  short.  It simply says that the  reason  for	 the
suggested change is to make the thing more specific.
   I  have  no doubt in my mind that if	 the  "due  process"
clause	which  appeared in the original	 draft	was  finally
retained  by  the Constituent Assembly, it could  be  safely
presumed that the framers of the Indian

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_193">275</span>
<p id="p_458">Constitution  wanted that expression to bear the same  sense
as it does in America.	But when that form was abandoned and
another was deliberately substituted in its place, it is not
possible  to  say  that in spite of the	 difference  in	 the
language and expression, they should mean the same thing and
convey	the same idea.	Mr. Nambiar's contention is that  in
view of the somewhat uncertain and fluidic state of  law  as
prevails in America on the subject, the	 Drafting  Committee
recommended an	alteration  for	 the  purpose  of making the
language  more	specific and he would have us hold  that  it
was made specific in this way, namely, that instead of being
extended  over the whole sphere of law, substantive as	well
as adjective,  it  was	limited	 to  procedural	  law  mere-
ly.   That is the reason, he says, why instead of  the	word
"process" the expression  "procedure"  was adopted, but	 the
word  "law"  means  the same thing as it does  in  the	"due
process" clause in America and refers not to any  State-made
law but to the fundamental principles which are inherent  in
the legal system and are based upon the immutable  doctrines
of natural justice.
</p><p id="p_459">    Attractive	though	this argument might at	first  sight
appear,	 I do not think that it would be possible to  accept
it as sound.  In the first place, it is quite clear that the
framers of the Indian Constitution did not desire to  intro-
duce into our system the elements of uncertainty,  vagueness
and  changeability that have grown round the  "due  process"
doctrine  in  America.	They wanted to	make  the  provision
clear,	definite  and  precise and  deliberately  chose	 the
words" procedure established by law," as in their opinion no
doubts	would  ordinarily arise about the  meaning  of	this
expression.  The  indefiniteness in the application  of	 the
"due process" doctrine in America has nothing to do with the
distinction  between  substantive and procedural  law.	 The
uncertainty and elasticity are in the doctrine itself  which
is a sort of hidden mine, the contents of which nobody knows
and  is merely revealed from time to time to  the.  judicial
conscience of the Judges.  This theory, the Indian Constitu-
tion deliberately discarded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_194">276</span>
and  that  is why they substituted a different form  in	 its
place  which, according to them, was more specific.  In	 the
second place, it appears to me that when the same words	 are
not  used,  it will be against the ordinary canons  of	con-
struction  to interpret a provision in our  Constitution  in
accordance  with  the  interpretation put  upon	 a  somewhat
analogous provision in the Constitution of another  country,
where  not  only the language is different, but	 the  entire
political conditions and constitutional set-up are  dissimi-
lar.  In the Supreme Court of America, stress has been	laid
uniformly upon the word "due" which occurs before and quali-
fies  the expression "process of  law."	   "Due"   means   "
what is just and proper" according to the circumstances of a
particular case. It is this word which introduces the varia-
ble element in the application of the doctrine; for what  is
reasonable  in	one set of circumstances may not  be  so  in
another and a different set.  In the Indian Constitution the
word  "due"  has  been	deliberately omitted and this  shows
clearly that the Constitution-makers of India had no  inten-
tion of introducing the American doctrine.  The word "estab-
lished"	 ordinarily means "fixed or laid down" and if  "law"
means, as Mr. Nambiar contends, not any particular piece  of
law but the indefinite and indefinable principles of natural
justice which underlie positive systems of law, it would not
at  all be appropriate to use the expression  "established,"
for natural law or natural justice cannot establish anything
like a definite procedure.
</p><p id="p_460">    It does not appear that in any part of the	Constitution
the  word "law" has been used in the sense of "general	law"
connoting  what	 has  been described as	 the  principles  of
natural	 justice outside the realm of positive law.  On	 the
other  hand, the provision of' <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_807">article 31</a> of  the  Constitu-
tion,  which appears in the. chapter on Fundamental  Rights,
makes  it clear that the word "law" is equivalent to  State-
made  law and to deprive a person of his property,  the	 au-
thority	 or sanction of such law is necessary.	As has	been
said  already, the provision of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_808">article 21</a>  of.	 the  Indian
Constitution reproduces, save in one particular, the-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_195">277</span>
<p id="p_461">language  of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_809">article 31</a> of the Japanese Constitution and  it
is  quite clear from the scheme and provisions of the  Japa-
nese  Constitution that in speaking of law it refers to	 law
passed	or  recognised as such by the State.  In  the  Irish
Constitution  also,  there is provision	 in  almost  similar
language  which	 conveys the same idea. <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_810">Article 40  (4)	 (1)</a>
provides that "no citizen shall be deprived of his  personal
liberty save in accordance with law," and by law is certain-
ly meant the law of the State.
</p><p id="p_462">    Possibly the strongest argument in support of Mr. Nambi-
ar's  contention is that if law is taken to mean  State-made
law, then <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_811">article 21</a> would not be a restriction on  legisla-
tion  at all. No question of passing any law  abridging	 the
right  conferred  by this article could possibly  arise	 and
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_812">article	 13 (2)</a> of the Constitution would have no  operation
so  far as this provision is concerned.	 To quote the  words
of  an	American  Judge it would sound very  much  like	 the
Constitution  speaking to the legislature  that	 the  latter
could  not  infringe the right created	 by  these  articles
unless it chose to do so (1).
</p><p id="p_463">    Apparently	this is a plausible argument but it must  be
admitted  that we are not concerned with the policy  of	 the
Constitution.	The  fundamental rights	 not  merely  impose
limitations  upon the legislature, but they serve as  checks
on  the	 exercise of executive powers as well,	and  in	 the
matter of depriving a man of his personal liberty, checks on
the  high-handedness of the executive in the shape  of	pre-
venting	 them from taking any step, which is not in  accord-
ance  with law, could certainly rank as fundamental  rights.
In the Constitutions of various other countries, the  provi-
sions relating to protection of personal liberty are couched
very much in the same language as in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_813">article 21.</a>  It is	 all
a  question of policy as to whether the legislature  or	 the
judiciary  would have the final say in such matters and	 the
Constitution-makers of	India deliberately decided to  place
these powers in the hands of the legislature.  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_814">Article 31</a> of
the  Japanese  Constitution, upon which <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_815">article	 21</a>  of	 our
Constitution is modelled, also
(1) Vide per Bronson 5. in Taylor v. Porte 4 Hill 1&lt;0.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_196">278</span>
<p id="p_464">proceeds  upon the same principle.  The	 Japanese  Constitu-
tion, it is to be noted, guarantees at the same. time  other
rights	in regard to arrest, detention and access  to  Court
which  might  serve as checks on  legislative  authority  as
well.  Thus <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_816">article 32</a> provides:
</p><p id="p_465">    "No	 person shall be denied the right of access  to	 the
Courts."
</p><p id="p_466"><a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_817">Article 34</a> lays down:
</p><p id="p_467">    "No	 person shall be arrested or detained without  being
at  once informed of the charges against him or without	 the
immediate  privilege  of counsel, nor shall he	be  detained
without adequate cause; and upon demand of any person,	such
cause  must  be	 immediately  shown in	open  Court  in	 his
presence and in the. presence of his counsel."
</p><p id="p_468">    It	was  probably on the analogy of <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_818">article	 34</a>  of	 the
Japanese Constitution that the first two clauses of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_819">article
22</a>  of the Indian Constitution were framed. <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_820">Article  22</a>	 was
not in the original Draft Constitution at all; and after the
"due process" clause was discarded by the Constituent Assem-
bly  and  the present form was substituted in its  place  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_821">article 21</a>, <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_822">article 22</a> was introduced with a view to provide
for  some sort of' check in matters of arrest and  detention
and  the protection it affords places limitations  upon	 the
authority  of  the legislature as  well.  These	 protections
indeed have been denied to cases of preventive detention but
that again is a question of policy which does not concern us
as a Court. My conclusion, therefore, is that in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_823">article  21</a>
the word "law" has been used in the sense of State-made	 law
and not as an equivalent of law in the abstract	 or  general
sense	embodying  the principles of natural  justice.	 The
article presupposes that the law is a valid and binding	 law
under  the provisions. of the Constitution having regard  to
the competency of the legislature and the subject it relates
to and does not infringe any of the fundamental rights which
the Constitution provides for.
</p><p id="p_469">    In	the view that I have taken, the question  raised  by
Mr. Nambiar that the Preventive Detention Act is invalid, by
reason of the fact that the procedure it lays
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_197">279</span>
down is not in conformity with the rules of natural justice,
does not fall for consideration.  It is enough, in my  opin-
ion,  if  the law is a valid law which	the  legislature  is
competent  to pass and which does not transgress any of	 the
fundamental rights declared in Part III of the Constitution.
It  is	also unnecessary to enter into a discussion  on	 the
question raised by the learned Attorney-General as to wheth-
er <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_824">article 22</a> by itself is a self-contained Code with regard
to  the law of Preventive Detention and whether or  not	 the
procedure it lays down is exhaustive.  Even if the procedure
is not exhaustive, it is not permissible to supplement it by
application  of the rules of natural justice.  On the  third
point  raised by Mr. Nambiar, the only question,  therefore,
which  requires consideration is whether section 12  of	 the
Preventive Detention Act is ultra vires of the	Constitution
by reason of its being not in conformity with the  provision
of <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_825">article 22 (7)(a).</a> <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_826">Article 22 (7) (a)</a> of the Constitution
empowers the Parliament to prescribe the circumstances under
which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a  person
may be detained for a period longer than three months  under
any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining
the  opinion  of an advisory board in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of sub-clause (a) of clause (4).  Section 12  of
the Preventive Detention Act which purports to be an  enact-
ment in pursuance of <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_827">article 22 (7) (a)</a> of the	Constitution
provides as follows:
</p><p id="p_470">    "(1) Any person detained in any of the following classes
of cases or under any of the following circumstances may  be
detained without obtaining the opinion of an advisory  board
for  a	period longer than three months, but  not  exceeding
one year from the date of his detention, namely, where	such
person has been detained with a view to preventing him	from
acting in any manner prejudicial to
</p><p id="p_471">    (a)	 the defence of India, relations of India with	for-
eign powers or the security of India; or
</p><p id="p_472">	(b) the security of a State or the maintenance
of public order."
</p><p id="p_473">It will be noticed that there are altogether six
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_198">36</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_199">280</span>
heads or subjects in the two Items in the legislative lists,
namely,	 Item  No. 9 of List I and Item No. 3  of  List	 III
which deal with preventive detention.  Item No. 9 of List  I
mentions reasons connected with defence, foreign affairs and
security  of India, while Item No. 3 of List III  speaks  of
reasons connected with security of a State, the	 maintenance
of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services
essential to the community.  With the exception of the	last
head; all the remaining five have been listed in <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_828">section  12</a>
of the preventive Detention Act and they have been mentioned
both  as circumstances and classes of cases in which  deten-
tion for more than three months would be permissible without
the opinion of any advisory board. Mr. Nambiar's argument is
that  the  mentioning_ of five out of  the  six	 legislative
heads  in  <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_829">section  12</a> does not amount	to  prescribing	 the
circumstances under which, or the classes of cases in which,
a  person  could be detained for more than three  months  as
contemplated  by <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_830">article 22 (7) (a).</a>  It is  also  contended
that in view of the fact that the two items  "circumstances"
and  "classes" are separated by the conjunction "and,"	what
the   Constitution really contemplated was that	 both  these
items  should be specified and a statement or  specification
of any one of them would not be a proper compliance with the
provisions  of the clause.  It is further pointed  out	that
the  mentioning	 of the same matters as	 "circumstances"  or
"classes" is not warranted by <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_831">article 22 (7)</a> of the  Consti-
tution and is altogether illogical and unsound.
</p><p id="p_474">     I must say that <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_832">section 12</a> has been drafted in a rather
clumsy	manner and certainly it could have been framed in  a
better	and  more proper way.  Under <a href="/doc/158433/" id="a_833">article  22(7)(a</a>),	 the
Parliament  may	 specify the circumstances under which,	 and
the classes of cases in which, the necessity of placing	 the
cases  of detention for examination  by the  advisory  board
could  be  dispensed with.   By "classes of cases"  we	mean
certain	 determinable groups, the individuals  comprised  in
each group being related to one another in a particular	 way
which  constitutes  the determining factor of	that  group.
"Circumstances"	 on the other hand
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_200">281</span>
connote	 situations or conditions which are external to	 the
persons concerned.  Preventive detention can be provided for
by  law	 for reasons connected with six	 different  ,matters
specified  in the relevant items in the	 legislative  lists,
and  whatever  the reasons might be, there  is	a  provision
contained in <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_834">article 22 (4) (a)</a> which lays down that  deten-
tion  for  more	 than three months could  not  be  permitted
except with the sanction of the advisory board.	 An alterna-
tive however has been provided for by clause (b) and Parlia-
ment  has been given the option to take away the  protection
given  by clause (a) and specify the circumstances  and	 the
cases when this rule will not apply.  I am extremely  doubt-
ful  whether the classification of cases made by  Parliament
in <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_835">section 12</a> of the Act really fulfils the object which the
Constitution  had in view.  The basis of classification	 has
been the apprehended acts of the persons detained  described
with  reference	 to the general heads mentioned in the items
in the legislative lists as said above.	 Five out of the six
heads  have been taken out and labelled as classes of  cases
to  which  the protection of clause (4) (a) of	the  article
would not be available.	 It is against common sense that all
forms  of  activities connected with these  five  items	 are
equally dangerous and merit the same drastic treatment.	 The
descriptions  are  very	 general and there may	be  acts  of
various	 degrees of intensity and danger under each  one  of
these heads.
</p><p id="p_475">    Although I do not think that <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_836">section 12</a> has been  framed
with due regard to the object which the Constitution had  in
view,  I  am unable to say that the section  is	 invalid  as
being  ultra  vires the Constitution. The  Constitution	 has
given  unfettered  powers  to Parliament in  the  matter  of
making the classifications and it is open to the  Parliament
to adopt any method or principle as it likes.	If it  chose
the  principle implied in the enumeration of subjects  under
the  relevant  legislative  heads, it cannot  be  said	that
Parliament has exceeded its powers.
</p><p id="p_476">    I  am also unable to hold that both	 "circumstances"  as
well as "classes" have to be prescribed in order to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_201">282</span>
comply with the requirement of sub-clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_837">article  22
(7).</a>   The sub-clause (a) of the article lays down a  purely
enabling  provision  and Parliament, if it so  chooses,	 may
pass any legislation in terms of the same. Where an optional
power  is  conferred  on certain authority  to	perform	 two
separate acts, ordinarily it would not be obligatory upon it
to  perform both; it may do either if it so likes. Here	 the
classes	 have been specified and the classes apparently	 are
composed  of  persons who are detained for  the	 purpose  of
preventing them from committing certain apprehended acts.  I
am  extremely doubtful whether the classes themselves  could
be described as "circumstances" as they purport to have been
done in the section.  "Circumstances" would ordinarily refer
to conditions like war, rebellion, communal disturbances and
things	like  that, under which extra  precaution  might  be
:necessary and the detention of suspected persons beyond the
period of three months without the sanction of the  advisory
board might be justified.  It is said that the likelihood of
these  persons	committing  the particular  acts  which	 are
specified  might constitute "circumstances." In my  opinion,
that is not a plain and sensible interpretation. But whatev-
er that may be, as I am of opinion that it is not obligatory
on  Parliament to prescribe both the circumstances  and	 the
classes	 of cases, I am unable to hold that  <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_838">section  12</a>  is
ultra vires the Constitution because the   circumstances are
not mentioned.	As I have said at  the beginning, the  draft
is  rather clumsy and I do not know why Parliament used	 the
word "or" when in the Constitution itself the word "and" has
been used.
</p><p id="p_477">    In	the fourth and last point raised by Mr. Nambiar	 the
principal  question  for consideration is  the	validity  of
section	 14  of the Preventive	Detention  Act.	  Subsection
(1)of  <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_839">section	14</a>  prohibits any Court	 from  allowing	 any
statement  to be made or any evidence to be given before  it
of  the substance of any communication made under <a href="/doc/1086093/" id="a_840">section  7</a>
of  the	 grounds on which a detention order  has  been	made
against any person or any representation made by him against
such order.  It further provides that no Court shall be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_202">283</span>
entitled to require any public officer to produce before  it
or  to disclose the substance of any such  communication  or
representation made or the proceedings of an advisory  board
or  that  part of the report of an advisory board  which  is
confidential.  Sub-section (2) further provides that:
</p><p id="p_478">      "It  shall be an offence punishable with	imprisonment
for  a term which may extend to one year, or with  fine,  or
with both, for any person to disclose or publish without the
previous  authorisation	 of the Central	 Government  or	 the
State  Government,  as	the' case may be,  any	contents  or
matter	purporting to be contents of any such  communication
or representation as is referred to in sub-section (1):
</p><p id="p_479">      Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall  apply
to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is
the subject of a detention order."
</p><p id="p_480">     The provisions of this section are obviously of a	most
drastic	 character.  It imposes a ban on the Court and	pre-
vents  it  from	 allowing any statement to be  made  or	 any
evidence produced before it of the substance of any communi-
cation made to the detenu apprising him of the grounds	upon
which  the  detention  order was made.	The  Court  is	also
incompetent to look into the proceedings before the advisory
board  or  the report of the latter which  is  confidential.
Further	 the  disclosure of such materials has been  made  a
criminal  offence  punishable with imprisonment for  a	term
which  may extend to one year.	Mr. Nambiar's contention  is
that  these restrictions render utterly nugatory the  provi-
sions of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_841">article 32</a> of the Constitution which guarantees  to
every  person  the right to move this Court  by	 appropriate
proceedings  for the enforcement of the rights conferred  by
Part  III of the Constitution.	It is not disputed that	 the
petitioner has the right of moving this Court for a writ  of
habeas corpus, and unless the Court is in a position to look
into and examine the grounds upon which	 the detention order
has been made, it is impossible for it to come to any  deci-
sion  on the point and pass a proper judgment.	 Though	 the
right to  move this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_203">284</span>
Court is not formally taken away, the entire proceedings are
rendered  ineffective and altogether illusory. On behalf  of
the respondent, it is pointed out that <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_842">article 32</a> guarantees
only  the right to constitutional remedy for enforcement  of
the   rights  which are declared by the	 Constitution.	  If
there  are no rights under the Constitution,  guaranteed  to
a person who is detained under any law of preventive  deten-
tion,  no  question of	enforcing  such	 rights	 by  an	 ap-
proach	to  this Court at all arises.  I do not	 think	that
this argument proceeds on a  sound basis; and in my opinion,
<a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_843">section	 14</a>  does take away and materially curtails some  of
the fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitu-
tion  itself.  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_844">Article 22</a>, clause (5), of  the	Constitution
lays  down  as	a fundamental right that when  a  person  is
detained for preventive detention, the authority making	 the
order  shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such  person
the  grounds  on which the order has been  made,  and  shall
afford him the earliest opportunity of making a	 representa-
tion  against  the order.  Under clause (6),  the  authority
need  not disclose such facts as it considers to be  against
public interest to disclose.  But so far as the grounds	 are
concerned,  the disclosure is not prohibited under any	cir-
cumstance.  It is also incumbent upon the detaining authori-
ty  to afford a detenu the earliest opportunity of making  a
representation against the detention order. It has been held
in  several cases, and in my opinion quite rightly, that  if
the  grounds  supplied to a detained person are	 of  such  a
vague  and indefinite character that no proper and  adequate
representation	could  be made in reply to  the	 same,	that
itself	would be an infraction of the right which  has	been
given to the detenu under law.	In my opinion, it would	 not
be  possible for the Court to decide whether the  provisions
of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_845">article 22</a>, clause (5), have	 been duly complied with and
the fundamental right guaranteed by it has been made  avail-
able  to the detenu unless the grounds communicated  to	 him
under  the provisions of this article are actually  produced
before the Court.  Apart from this, it is also open to.	 the
person detained to contend that the detention
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_204">285</span>
order has been a main fide exercise of power by the  detain-
ing  authority and that the grounds upon which it is  based,
are  not  proper  or relevant grounds  which  would  justify
detention  under  the-provisions of the law  itself.   These
rights	of  the detenu would for all practical	purposes  be
rendered unenforceable if the Court is precluded from  look-
ing  into the grounds which have been supplied to him  under
section	 7 of the Preventive Detention Act.  In my  opinion,
section	 14 of the Preventive Detention Act does  materially
affect the fundamental rights declared under Part III of the
Constitution  and  for	this reason it must be	held  to  be
illegal and ultra vires.  It is not disputed, however,	that
this section can be severed from the rest of the Act without
affecting  the other provisions of the Act in any way.	 The
whole Act cannot, therefore, be held to be ultra vires.
    Mr. Nambiar has further argued that <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_846">section 3</a> of the Act
also contravenes the provisions of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_847">article 32</a> of the Consti-
tution, for it makes satisfaction of the particular authori-
ties  final in matters of preventive detention	and  thereby
prevents   this	  Court	 from satisfying itself	 as  to	 the
propriety  of  the detention order. This  contention  cannot
succeed	 as  no infraction of any fundamental right  is	 in-
volved	in it.	As has been pointed out already, this  Court
cannot interfere unless it is proved that the power has been
exercised  by the authorities in a mala fide manner or	that
the grounds are not proper or relevant grounds which justify
detention.   The  provisions are undoubtedly harsh,  but  as
they do not take away the rights under articles 21 and 22 of
the Constitution, they cannot be held to be illegal or ultra
vires.
</p><p id="p_481">    The	 result,  therefore,  is that, in  my  opinion,	 the
Preventive Detention Act must be declared to be intra  vires
the  Constitution with the exception of <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_848">section 14</a> which  is
held to be illegal and ultra vires.   The present  petition,
however, must stand dismissed, though it may be open to	 the
petitioner to make a fresh application if he so chooses	 and
if the grounds that have been supplied to him under  <a href="/doc/1086093/" id="a_849">section
7</a>  of  the Act do furnish adequate reasons for	making	such
application.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_205">286</span>
<p id="p_482">    DAS	 J.--I am likewise of opinion that this	 application
should be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_483">    The	 contention of learned counsel appearing in  support
of this application is that the provisions of the Preventive
Detention Act, 1950  (Act IV of 1950), are extremely drastic
and  wholly  unreasonable and take away or,  in	 any  event,
considerably abridge the fundamental rights conferred on the
citizens  by the provisions of Part III of the	Constitution
and that this Court should declare the Act wholly void under
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_850">article 13 (2)</a> of the Constitution and set the petitioner at
liberty.
</p><p id="p_484">    It	is necessary to bear in mind the scope and ambit  of
the powers of the Court under the Constitution.	 The  powers
of  the Court are not the same under all Constitutions.	  In
England	 Parliament  is supreme and there is  no  limitation
upon  its legislative powers. Therefore, a law duly made  by
Parliament  cannot be challenged in any Court.	The  English
Courts	have  to interpret and apply the law; they  have  no
authority to declare such a law illegal or unconstitutional.
By  the American Constitution the' legislative power of	 the
Union is vested in the Congress and in a sense the  Congress
is the supreme legislative power.  But the written Constitu-
tion  of  the United States is supreme above all  the  three
limbs  of  Government and, therefore, the law  made  by	 the
Congress,  in order to be valid, must be in conformity	with
the  provisions	 of  the Constitution.	If it  is  not,	 the
Supreme	 Court	will intervene and declare that	 law  to  be
unconstitutional  and  void.   As will be  seen	 more  fully
hereafter, the Supreme Court of the United States, under the
leadership of Chief Justice Marshall, assumed the power	 to.
declare	 any law unconstitutional on the ground of  its	 not
being in "due process of law," an expression to be found  in
the Fifth Amendment (1791) of the United States Constitution
and  the  Fourteenth Amendment (1868) which related  to	 the
State  Constitutions.	It is thus that	 the  Supreme  Court
established   its own supremacy over the executive  and	 the
Congress.   In India the position of the Judiciary is  some-
where in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_206">287</span>
between	 the Courts in England and the United States.  While
in  the main leaving our Parliament and the  State  Legisla-
tures  supreme in their respective legislative	fields,	 our
Constitution  has,  by some of the articles,  put  upon	 the
Legislatures  certain  specified limitations some  of  which
will have to be discussed hereafter. The point to be  noted,
however, is that in so far as there is any limitation on the
legislative power, the Court must, on a complaint being made
to it, scrutinise and ascertain whether such limitation	 has
been  transgressed and if there has been  any  transgression
the Court will courageously declare the law  unconstitution-
al, for the Court is bound by its oath to uphold the Consti-
tution. But outside the limitations imposed on the  legisla-
tive  powers our Parliament and the State  Legislatures	 are
supreme in their respective legislative fields and the Court
has no authority to question the wisdom or policy of the law
duly made by the appropriate legislature. Our  Constitution,
unlike	the  English Constitution,  recognises	the  Court's
supremacy over the legislative authority, but such supremacy
is a very limited one, for it is confined to the field where
the  legislative power is circumscribed by  limitations	 put
upon it by the	Constitution itself.   Within this restrict-
ed field the Court may, on a scrutiny of the law made by the
Legislature,  declare it void if it is found to have  trans-
gressed	 the constitutional limitations. But  our  Constitu-
tion,  unlike the American Constitution, does not  recognise
the  absolute  supremacy of the Court over  the	 legislative
authority in all respects, for outside the restricted  field
of  constitutional limitations our Parliament and the  State
Legislatures  are  supreme in their  respective	 legislative
fields	and  in that wider field there is no scope  for	 the
Court in India to play the role of the Supreme Court of	 the
United	States.	  It is well for us to	constantly  remember
this basic limitation on our own powers.
</p><p id="p_485">    The impugned Act has been passed by Parliament after the
Constitution  came into force.	<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_851">Article 246</a> gives  exclusive
power to Parliament to make laws with respect to any of	 the
matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule and  it
gives exclusive power to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_207">288</span>
the  State Legislatures to make laws with respect to any  of
the  matters specified in List II of that Schedule. It	also
gives concurrent power to Parliament as well as to the State
Legislatures to make laws with respect to any of the matters
enumerated  in List III in the Seventh	Schedule.  Residuary
powers of legislation are vested in parliament under article
</p><p id="p_486">248.
    The first thing to note is that under Entry 9 of List  I
the parliament and under Entry 3 in List III both parliament
and  the State Legislatures are empowered to make  laws	 for
preventive detention for reasons connected with the  several
matters specified in the respective entries.  This  legisla-
tion is not conditioned upon the existence of any war with a
foreign	 power or upon the proclamation of  emergency  under
Part XVIII of the Constitution. Our Constitution has, there-
fore, accepted preventive detention as the subjectmatter  of
peacetime  legislation as distinct from	 emergency  legisla-
tion.	It  is	a novel feature to  provide  for  preventive
detention  in the Constitution.	 There is no such  provision
in the Constitution of any other country that I know of.  Be
that  as it may, for reasons good or bad,  our	Constitution
has  deliberately and plainly given power to Parliament	 and
the  State Legislatures to enact preventive  detention	laws
even in peacetime.  To many of us a preventive detention law
is  odious  at all times but what I desire to  emphasise  is
that  it  is not for the Court to question  the	 wisdom	 and
policy of the Constitution which the people have given	unto
themselves.  This is another basic fact which the Court must
not overlook.
</p><p id="p_487">     The  next thing to bear in mind is that, if there	were
nothing else in the Constitution, the legislative powers  of
Parliament  and the State Legislatures in  their  respective
fields would have been absolute.  In such circumstances	 the
Court  would have been entitled only to	 scrutinise  whether
Parliament or the State Legislature had, in making a partic-
ular  law,  over-.  stepped its legislative  field  and	 en-
croached upon the legislative field of the other legislative
power, but could not have otherwise questioned the  validity
of any law made by the parliament or the State Legislatures.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_208">289</span>
<p id="p_488">Thus under Entry 9 of List I the Parliament and under  Entry
3 of List III the Parliament and the State Legislature could
make  as drastic a preventive detention law as	it  pleased.
Such  a law might have authorised a policeman, not to  speak
of a District Magistrate or Sub-Divisional Magistrate or the
Commissioner of Police, to take a man, citizen or  non-citi-
zen,  into custody and keep him in detention for as long  as
he pleased.  This law might not have made any provision	 for
supplying  to  the detenu the grounds of  his  detention  or
affording any opportunity to him to make any  representation
to  anybody  or for setting up any advisory  board  at	all.
Likewise,  under Entries 1 and 2 in List III the  Parliament
or  the State Legislature might have added as many  new	 and
novel offences as its fancy might have dictated and provided
for any cruel penalty ranging from the maiming of the  limbs
to boiling to death in oil or repealed the whole<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_852"> of the Code</a>
of  Criminal Procedure and provided for trial by  battle  or
ordeal	or for conviction by the verdict of a sorcerer or  a
soothsayer.  Such law might have forbidden any speech criti-
cising the Government, however mildly, or banned all  public
meetings  or prohibited formation of all associations  under
penalty	 of  law. Under Entry 33 of List  I  the  Parliament
might have made a law for acquiring anybody's properties for
the purposes of the Union without any compensation and under
Entry 36 in List III the State Legislature could do the same
subject	 to  the provisions of Entry 42 in  List  III  which
empowers  the  making of a law laying  down  principles	 for
payment of compensation which might be anything above  noth-
ing.   Under  Entry 81 Parliament could have  made  any	 law
restricting  or	 even prohibiting inter-State  migration  so
that a Bengali would not be able to move into and settle  in
Bihar  or vice versa.  It is needless to multiply  instances
of atrocious laws which Parliament or the State	 Legislature
might  have made under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_853">article 246</a> read with  the  different
lists  if there were nothing else in the Constitution.	 Our
Legislatures,  subject to the limitation of distribution  of
legislative  powers,  would have been as  supreme  in  their
respective legislative fields as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_209">290</span>
English Parliament is and has been.  The Court in India,  in
such event, would have had to take the law duly made, inter-
pret  it and apply it.	It would not have been	entitled  to
utter  a  word as to the propriety of  the  particular	law,
although it might have shuddered at the monstrous atrocities
of such law.
</p><p id="p_489">    Our	 Constitution, however, has not accepted this  abso-
lute  supremacy of our Parliament or the State	Legislature.
Thus by <a href="/doc/369702/" id="a_854">article 245 (1)</a> the legislative power is  definitely
made  "subject	to the provisions  of  this   Constitution."
Turning	 to  the Constitution, <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_855">article 13  (2)</a>	provides  as
follows:
</p><p id="p_490">    "The  State shall not make any law which takes  away  or
abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law	made
in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of	 the
contravention, be void."
</p><p id="p_491">    This  clearly  puts a definite limitation  on  the	wide
legislative  powers  given by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_856">article 246.</a> It  is  certainly
within	the  competency of the Court to	 judge	and  declare
whether there has been any contravention of this limitation.
In  this  respect  again the Court has	supremacy  over	 the
Legislature.
</p><p id="p_492">    From  the  provisions  so far referred  to,	 it  clearly
follows	 that  there are two principal	limitations  to	 the
legislative power of parliament, namely,--
</p><p id="p_493">     (i) that the law must be within the legislative  compe-
tence  of  parliament  as prescribed  by  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_857">article  246;</a>	 and
</p><p id="p_494">(ii)   that such law must be subject to the  pro-visions  of
the  Constitution  and	must not take away  or	abridge	 the
rights conferred by Part III.
</p><p id="p_495">     There  can	 be no question--and,  indeed,	the  learned
Attorney-General does not contend otherwise--that both these
matters	 are  justiciable and it is open to  the  Courts  to
decide	whether	 Parliament has transgressed either  of	 the
limitations upon its legislative power.
</p><p id="p_496">     Learned  counsel for the petitioner does not  say	that
the  impugned Act is ultra vires the legislative  powers  of
Parliament  as prescribed by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_858">article 246.</a> His contention  is
that the impugned Act is void
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_210">291</span>
because it takes away or abridges the fundamental rights  of
citizens conferred by Part III of the Constitution.  It	 is,
therefore,  necessary to ascertain first the  exact  nature,
extent and scope of the particular fundamental right insist-
ed  upon and then to see whether the impugned Act has  taken
away  or,  in  any way, abridged the  fundamental  right  so
ascertained.
</p><p id="p_497">    Civil rights of a person are generally divided into	 two
classes,  namely,  the rights attached to  the	person	(jus
personarum)  and the rights to things, i.e.,  property	(jus
rerum).	 Of the rights attached to the person, the first and
foremost  is the freedom of life, which means the  right  to
live,  i.e.,  the right that one's life shall not  be  taken
away except under authority of law.  Next to the freedom  of
life comes the freedom of the person, which means that one's
body shall not be touched, violated, arrested or  imprisoned
and one's limbs shall not be injured or maimed except  under
authority of law.  The truth of the matter is that the right
to live and the freedom of the person are the primary rights
attached  to the person.  If a man's person is free,  it  is
then  and then only that he can exercise a variety of  other
auxiliary  rights,  that is to say, he can,  within  certain
limits,	 speak what he likes, assemble where he likes,	form
any  associations or unions, move about freely as  his	"own
inclination may direct," reside and settle anywhere he likes
and  practise  any profession or carry	on  any	 occupation,
trade  or business. These are attributes of the	 freedom  of
the  person  and  are consequently rights  attached  to	 the
person.	 It should be clearly borne in mind that  these	 are
not  all  the rights attached to the person.   Besides	them
there  are  varieties  of other rights which  are  also	 the
attributes of the freedom of the person. All rights attached
to the person are usually called personal liberties and they
are  too numerous to be enumerated. Some of these  auxiliary
rights	are so important and fundamental that they  are	 re-
garded	and valued as separate and independent rights  apart
from the freedom of the person.
</p><p id="p_498">    Personal liberties may be compendiously summed up as the
right to do as one pleases within the law.  I
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_211">292</span>
say within the law because liberty is not unbridled licence.
It  is what Edmund Burke called "regulated freedom."	Said
Montesquieu in Book III, Ch. 3, of his Spirit of the Laws:
</p><p id="p_499">    "In Governments, that is, in societies directed by laws,
liberty can consist only in the power of doing what we ought
to  will, and in not being constrained to do what  we  ought
not to will.   We must have continually present to our minds
the difference between independence and liberty.  Liberty is
a right of doing whatever the laws permit, and if a  citizen
could  do what they forbid, he would no longer be  possessed
of liberty, because all his fellow-citizens would enjoy	 the
same power."
</p><p id="p_500">    To	the  same effect are the following  observations  of
Webster in his Works Vol. II, p. 393:
</p><p id="p_501">"Liberty  is  the creation of  law,   essentially  different
from  that  authorised	licentiousness	that  trespasses  on
right.	 It  is a legal and refined idea, the  offspring  of
high  civilization, which the savage never understands,	 and
never	can  understand.   Liberty exists in  proportion  to
wholesome  restraint; the more restraint on others  to	keep
off  from  us, the more liberty we have. It is an  error  to
suppose	  that	 liberty   consists   in   a   paucity	  of
laws  .........	 The working of our complex system, full  of
checks and restraints on legislative, executive and judicial
power  is favourable to liberty and justice.   These  checks
and restraints are so many safeguards set around  individual
rights and interests. That man is free who is protected from
injury."
</p><p id="p_502">    Therefore,	putting	 restraint on the freedom  of  wrong
doing  of one person is really. securing the liberty of	 the
intended  victims.  To curb the freedom of the	saboteur  of
surreptitiously	 removing the fish plates from	the  railway
lines is to ensure the safety and liberty of movement of the
numerous  innocent and unsuspecting  passengers.  Therefore,
restraints on liberty should be judged not only subjectively
as applied to a few individuals who come within their opera-
tions but also objectively as securing the liberty of a	 far
greater number of individuals.	Social interest in individu-
al
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_212">293</span>
liberty	 may well have to be subordinated to  other  greater
social	interests.   If a law ensures and  protects	 the
greater	 social interests then such law will be a  wholesome
and  beneficent law although it may infringe the liberty  of
some individuals, for it will enure for	 the greater liberty
of  the	 rest of the members of the society.   At  the	same
time, our liberty has also to be guarded against  executive,
legislative  as	 well as judicial usurpation of	 powers	 and
prerogatives.  Subject to certain restraints on	 individuals
and reasonable checks on the State every person has a varie-
ty  of personal liberties too numerous to be cataloged.	  As
will  be  seen more fully hereafter,  our  Constitution	 has
recognised  personal  liberties as fundamental	rights.	  It
has guaranteed some of them under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_859">article 19 (1)</a> but put re-
straints  on them by clauses (2) to (6).  It has put  checks
on the State's legislative powers by articles 21 and 22.  It
has  by providing for preventive detention, recognised	that
individual liberty may be subordinated to the larger  social
interests.
</p><p id="p_503">   Turning  now to the Constitution I find that Part III  is
headed	and  deals  with "Fundamental  Rights"	under  seven
heads, besides,	 "General" provisions (articles 12 and	13),
namely	"Right to Equality" (articles 14 to 18),  "Right  to
Freedom"  (articles 19 to 22), "Right against  Exploitation"
(articles  23  and  24),  "Right  to  Freedom  of  Religion"
(articles  25  to  28), "Cultural  and	Educational  Rights"
(articles  29  and 30), "Right to  Property"  (<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_860">article	31</a>),
"Right	to  Constitutional Remedies" (articles	32  to	35).
Under the heading "Right to Freedom" are grouped four  arti-
cles,  19 to 22.  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_861">Article 19 (1)</a> is in the  following  terms
:--
</p><p id="p_504">" (1) All citizens shall have the right-
</p><p id="p_505">(a)  to	 freedom of speech and expression;
</p><p id="p_506">(b)  to	 assemble peaceably and without arms;  (c)  to	form
associations or unions;
</p><p id="p_507">   (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India;
</p><p id="p_508">   (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory  of
India;
</p><p id="p_509">(f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_213">294</span>
</p><p id="p_510">    (g)	 to  practise  any profession, or to  carry  on	 any
occupation, trade or business."
</p><p id="p_511">    It will be noticed that of the seven rights protected by
clause	(1)  of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_862">article 19</a>, six of them, namely,  (a),	(b),
</p><p id="p_512">(c),  (d),  (e) and (g) are what are said to be	 rights	 at-
tached	to the person (jus personarum). The remaining  item,
namely, (f) is the right to property (jus rerum).  If  there
were nothing else in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_863">article 19</a> these rights would have been
absolute rights and the protection given to them would	have
completely debarred parliament or any of the State  Legisla-
tures  from making any law taking away or abridging  any  of
those  rights.	But a perusal of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_864">article 19</a> makes  it  abun-
dantly	clear  that none of the seven rights  enumerated  in
clause (1) is an absolute right, for each of these rights is
liable	to  be curtailed by laws made or to be made  by	 the
State to the extent mentioned in the several clauses (2)  to
(6)  of that article.	Those clauses save the power of	 the
State  to make laws imposing certain specified	restrictions
on the several rights.	The nett result is that the unlimit-
ed  legislative	 power given by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_865">article 246</a>  read  with	 the
different  legislative lists in the Seventh Schedule is	 cut
down  by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_866">article 19</a> and all laws  made  by
the State with respect to these rights must, in order to  be
valid,	observe	 these limitations. Whether any law  has  in
fact transgressed these limitations is to be ascertained  by
the Court and if in its view the restrictions imposed by the
law are greater than what is permitted by clauses (2) to (6)
whichever  is applicable the Court will declare the same  to
be  unconstitutional and, therefore, void under <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_867">article	 13.</a>
Here again there is scope for the application of the "intel-
lectual	 yardstick"  of the Court.  If, however,  the  Court
finds,	on  scrutiny, that the law has not  overstepped	 the
constitutional	limitations, the Court will have  to  uphold
the law, whether it likes the law or not.
</p><p id="p_513">     The first part of the argument is put broadly,  namely,
that personal liberty is generally guaranteed by the Consti-
tution	by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_868">article 19 (1)</a> and that the Preventive  Detention
Act, 1950, has imposed unreasonable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_214">295</span>
restrictions  thereon  in  violation of	 the  provisions  of
clauses (2) to (6) of that article.  The very first question
that arises, therefore, is as to whether the freedom of	 the
person	which  is primarily and directly  suspended  or	 de-
stroyed by preventive detention is at all governed by  arti-
cle  19 (1).  If personal liberty as such is  guaranteed  by
any  of	 the sub-clauses of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_869">article 19 (1)</a> then why  has  it
also been protected by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_870">article 21 ?</a> The answer suggested  by
learned counsel for the petitioner is that personal  liberty
as  a substantive right is protected by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_871">article 19  (1)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_872">article 21</a> gives only an additional protection by  prescrib-
ing the procedure according to which that right may be taken
away.	 I  am unable to accept this  contention.   If	this
argument were correct, then it would follow that our Consti-
tution	does  not guarantee to any person, citizen  or	non-
citizen,  the freedom of his life as a substantive right  at
all, for the substantive right to life does not fall  within
any  of the sub-clauses of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_873">article 19.</a>  It  is
retorted  in  reply that no constitution or human  laws	 can
guarantee life which is the gift of God who alone can  guar-
antee and protect it.  On a parity of reasoning no Constitu-
tion  or human laws can in that sense guarantee	 freedom  of
speech	or  free  movement, for one may be  struck  dumb  by
disease or may lose the use of his legs by paralysis or as a
result	of  amputation.	 Further, what has been	 called	 the
procedural  protection	of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_874">article 21</a> would be	 an  act  of
supererogation, for when God takes away one's life, whatever
opportunity  He	 may have had given to Adam to	explain	 his
conduct	 before sending him down, He is not likely in  these
degenerate-days	 to  observe the requirements of  notice  or
fair trial before any human tribunal said to be required  by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_875">article 21.</a> The fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment
    of the American Constitution give specific protection to
life  as  a substantive right.	So does <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_876">article	 31</a>  of	 the
Japanese  Constitution of 1946.	 There is no reason why	 our
Constitution  should  not do the same.	The  truth  is	that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_877">article	 21</a> has given that protection to life as a  substan-
tive right and that, as will be seen hereafter, that article
properly  understood does not purport to prescribe any	par-
ticular procedure at all. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_215">38</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_216">296</span>
further astounding result of the argument of counsel for the
petitioner will be that the citizen of India will have	only
the rights enumerated in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_878">article 19</a>, clause (1) and no other
right  attached	 to his person. As I  have  already  stated,
besides	 the  several rights mentioned in the  several	sub-
clauses	 of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_879">article 19 (1)</a> there  are many  other   personal
liberties   which  a  free man, i.e., a	 man  who  has	 the
freedom	 of his person, may exercise.  Some of	those  other
rights have been referred to by Harries C.J. of Calcutta  in
his  unreported	 judgment in Miscellaneous Case No.  166  of
1950  (K.shitindra  v. The Chief Secretary of  West  Bengal)
while  referring the case to a Full Bench in  the  following
words :--
</p><p id="p_514">    "It must be remembered that a free man has far more	 and
wider  rights  than those stated in <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_880">article 19	(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.  For example, a free man can eat what he likes
subject to rationing laws, work as much as he likes or	idle
as much as he likes.  He can drink anything he likes subject
to  the	 licensing laws and smoke and do a hundred  and	 one
things which are not included in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_881">article 19.</a>  If freedom  of
person	was the result of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_882">article 19</a>, then a free man  would
only  have the seven rights mentioned in that article.	 But
obviously the free man in India has far greater rights."
</p><p id="p_515">    I  find  myself in complete agreement with	the  learned
Chief  Justice	on this point.	If it  were  otherwise,	 the
citizen's  right to eat what he likes will be liable  to  be
taken away by the executive fiat of the Civil Supply Depart-
ment  without  the  necessity of any  rationing	 laws.	 The
Government  may enforce prohibition without any	 prohibition
laws  or licensing laws and so on. I cannot accept that	 our
Constitution intended to give no protection to the bundle of
rights	which,	together with the rights mentioned  in	sub-
clauses	 (a) to (e) and (g) make up personal  liberty.	 In-
deed,  I  regard it as a merit of our Constitution  that  it
does not attempt to enumerate exhaustively all the  personal
rights but uses the compendious expression "personal  liber-
ty" in' <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_883">article 21</a>, and protects all of them.
    It	is pointed out that in the original draft  the	word
"liberty" only was used as in the American
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_217">297</span>
Constitution  but  the	Drafting Committee  added  the	word
"personal" to make it clear that what was being protected by
what  is now <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_884">article 21</a> was not what had already  been	pro-
tected by what is now <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_885">article 19.</a>  If it were permissible to
refer to the Drafting Committee's report, it would be anoth-
er  answer  to the contentions of learned  counsel  for	 the
petitioner that personal liberty as a substantive right	 was
protected by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_886">article 19.</a>  I do not, however,  desire to base
my judgment on the Drafting Committee's report and I express
no opinion as to its admissibility.  Whatever the intentions
of the Drafting Committee might have been, the	Constitution
as finally passed has in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_887">article 21</a> used the words "personal
liberty" which have a definite connotation in law as I	have
explained.  It does not mean only liberty of the person	 but
it  means liberty or the rights attached to the person	(jus
personarum).  The expressions "freedom of life" or "personal
liberty" are not to be found in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_888">article 19</a> and it is strain-
ing the language of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_889">article 19</a> to squeeze in personal liber-
ty into that article.  In any case the right to life  cannot
be read into <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_890">article 19.</a>
</p><p id="p_516">    <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_891">Article 19</a> being confined, in its operation, to citizens
only, a non-citizen will have no protection for his life and
personal liberty except what has been called the  procedural
protection of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_892">article 21.</a>  If there be no substantive  right
what will the procedure protect ? I recognise that it is not
imperative that a foreigner should have the same  privileges
as are given to a citizen, but if <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_893">article 21</a> is construed in
the  way I have suggested even a foreigner will	 have  equal
protection for his life and personal liberty before the laws
of our country under our Constitution.	I am unable,  there-
fore, for all the reasons given above, to agree that person-
al  liberties  are  the result of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_894">article 19</a>  or  that	that
article purports to protect all of them.
</p><p id="p_517">    It is next urged that the expression "personal  liberty"
is synonymous with the right to move freely and,  therefore,
comes  directly under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_895">article 19 (1) (d).</a> Reference is	made
to the unreported dissenting judgment of Sen J. of  Calcutta
in  Miscellaneous Case No. 166 of 1950 while referring	that
case to a Full Bench.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_218">298</span>
<p id="p_518">In  his	 judgment Sen J. quoted the following  passage	from
Blackstone's Commentaries :--
</p><p id="p_519">     "Next to personal security the law of :England regards,
asserts and preserves, the personal liberty of	individuals.
This personal liberty consists	in the power of	 locomotion,
of changing situation, or moving one's person to  whatsoever
place one's own inclination may direct, without imprisonment
or  restraint,	unless by due course of law."  (Page  73  of
George Chase's Edition (4th Edition) of Blackstone, Book  I,
Chapter I.
</p><p id="p_520">    On the authority of the above passage the learned  Judge
concluded  that	 personal  liberty came	 within	 <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_896">article  19
(1)(d).</a>	 I am unable to agree with the learned Judge's	con-
clusion.   On  a perusal of Chapter I of Book  I  of  Black-
stone's Commentaries it will appear that the]earned  commen-
tator divided the rights attached to the person (jus person-
arum)  into  two classes, namely,  "personal  security"	 and
"personal  liberty."   Under the  head	"personal  security"
Blackstone  included several rights, namely, the rights	 to'
life, limb, body, health and reputation, and under the	head
"personal  liberty" he placed only the right of	 free  move-
ment.  He first dealt with the several rights classified  by
him under the head "personal security" and then proceeded to
say  that next to those rights came personal  liberty  which
according to his classification consisted only in the  right
of  free locomotion. There is no reason to suppose  that  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_897">article	 21</a>  of our Constitution  the  expression  "personal
liberty"  has  been used in the restricted  sense  in  which
Blackstone used it in his Commentaries. If "personal  liber-
ty"  in	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_898">article 21</a> were synonymous with the right  to	move
freely	which is mentioned in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_899">article 19 (1) (d</a>),  then	 the
astounding result will be that only the last mentioned right
has what has been called the procedural protection of  arti-
cle 21 but none of the other rights in the other sub-clauses
of  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_900">article  19 (1)</a> has any procedural	protection  at	all.
According  to learned counsel for the petitioner the  proce-
dure  required by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_901">article 21</a> consists of notice and a  right
of hearing before an impartial tribunal.  Therefore, accord-
ing  to him, a man's right of movement cannot be taken	away
without giving him notice and a fair trial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_219">299</span>
before	an impartial tribunal but he may be deprived of	 his
freedom of speech or his property or any of his other rights
without the formality of any procedure at all. The  proposi-
tion  has only to be stated to be rejected. In my  judgment,
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_902">article	 '19</a>  protects some of the important  attributes  of
personal  liberty as independent rights and  the  expression
"personal liberty" has been 'used in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_903">article 21</a> as a compen-
dious term including within its meaning all the varieties of
rights which go to make up the personal liberties of men.
    Learned  counsel for the petitioner next  contends	that
personal  liberty undoubtedly means or includes the  freedom
of  the person and the pith and substance of the freedom  of
the person is right to move about freely and consequently  a
preventive  detention  law which destroys  or  suspends	 the
freedom of the person must inevitably destroy or suspend the
right  of free movement and must necessarily offend  against
the  protection	 given to the citizen by <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_904">article  19  (1)(d)</a>
unless it satisfies the test of reasonableness laid down  in
clause (5).  The argument is attractive and requires serious
consideration  as  to the exact purpose and  scope  of	sub-
clause (d) of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_905">article 19 (1).</a>
</p><p id="p_521">    There are indications in the very language of <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_906">article 19
(1) (d)</a> itself that its purpose is to protect not the gener-
al right of free movement which emanates from the freedom of
the  person but only a specific and 'limited aspect  of	 it,
namely, the special right of a free citizen of India to move
freely throughout the Indian territory, i.e., from one State
to another within the Union.  In other words, it guarantees,
for example, that a free Indian citizen ordinarily  residing
in  the State of West Bengal will be free to move from	West
Bengal	to  Bihar or to reside and settle in Madras  or	 the
Punjab	without any let or hindrance other than as  provided
in clause (5).	It is this special right of movement of	 the
Indian citizen in this specific sense and for this  particu-
lar purpose which is protected by <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_907">article 19 (1) (d).</a>  It is
argued on the authority of a decision of a Special Bench  of
the  Calcutta  High Court presided over by Sen J.  in  <a href="/doc/245155/" id="a_908">Sunil
Kumar v. The Chief
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_220">300</span>
Secretary  of West Bengal</a> (1) that the words "through-.	 out
the  territory of India" occurring in that  sub-clause	only
indicate  that	our Constitution does not guarantee  to	 its
citizens  the  right  of free movement in  or  into  foreign
territory  and	that  those words have been  added  to	save
passport restrictions.	I am unable to accept this interpre-
tation.	 Our Constitution cannot possibly give to any of its
citizens any right of free movement in a foreign country and
it  was wholly superfluous to specifically indicate this  in
the  Constitution, for that would have gone without  saying.
The  words "throughout the territory of India" are not	used
in  connection with most of the other sub-clauses of  clause
(1)  of	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_909">article 19.</a>  Does such omission indicate  that	 our
Constitution  guarantees to its citizens freedom  of  speech
and expression, say, in Pakistan ? Does it guarantee to. its
citizens  a  right to assemble or to  form  associations  or
unions	in a foreign territory ? Clearly not. Therefore,  it
was  not necessary to use those words in sub-clause  (d)  to
indicate  that	free movement in foreign countries  was	 not
being  guaranteed.    It is said that by the  use  of  those
words the Constitution makes it clear that no1 guarantee was
being  given to any citizen with regard to  emigration	from
India  without a passport and that the freedom	of  movement
was  restricted	 within the territory of  India.   Does	 the
omission  of  those words from <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_910">article 19 (1)  (a)</a>  indicate
that  the citizen of India has been guaranteed such  freedom
of  speech  and expression as will enable him to  set  up  a
broadcasting station and broadcast his views and expressions
to foreign lands without a licences ? Clearly not.  Dropping
this  line  of argument and adopting a totally new  line  of
argument it is said that by the use of the words "throughout
the territory of India" the Constitution indicates that	 the
widest right of free movement that it could possibly give to
its  citizens  has been given. Does. then, the	omission  of
those  words  from the other subclauses	 indicate  that	 the
Constitution  has kept back some parts of those rights	even
beyond	the limits of the qualifying clauses  that follow  ?
Do  not	 those other rights prevail  throughout	 the  Indian
territory ?

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_221">301</span>
<p id="p_523">Clearly they do, even without those words.  Therefore, those
words must have been used in sub-clause (d) for -some  other
purpose.  That other purpose, as far as I can apprehend	 it,
is to indicate that free movement from one State to  another
within the Union is protected so that Parliament may not  by
a  law made under Entry 81 in List I curtail it	 beyond	 the
limits prescribed by clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_911">article 19.</a>	Its purpose,
as  I read it, is not to provide protection for the  general
right of free movement but to secure a specific and  special
right  of the Indian citizen to move freely  throughout	 the
territories  of India regarded as an independent  additional
right  apart from the general right of locomotion  emanating
from  the freedom of the person.  It is a guarantee  against
unfair discrimination in the matter of free movement of	 the
Indian citizen throughout the Indian Union.  In short, it is
a  protection against provincialism.  It has nothing  to  do
with the freedom of the person as such.	  That is guaranteed
to every person, citizen or otherwise, in the manner and  to
the extent formulated by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_912">article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_524">    Clause  (5)	 of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_913">article 19</a> qualifies sub-clause  (d)  of
clause (1) which should, therefore, be read in the light  of
clause	(5). The last mentioned clause permits the State  to
impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the  right
of  free movement throughout the territory of India  as	 ex-
plained above. Imposition of reasonable restrictions clearly
implies	 that  the right of free movement  is  not  entirely
destroyed but that parts of the right remain. This  reasona-
ble restriction can be imposed either in the interest of the
general public or for the protection of the interests of any
Scheduled Tribe. The Scheduled Tribes usually reside in what
are called the Scheduled Areas.	 The provision for  imposing
restriction  on the citizens' right of free movement in	 the
interests of the Scheduled Tribes clearly indicates that the
restriction is really on his right of free movement into  or
within	the  Scheduled Areas. It means that if it  be  found
necessary  for	the protection of the Scheduled	 Tribes	 the
citizens  may  be restrained from entering  into  or  moving
about  in the Scheduled Areas, although they are left  quite
free to move about elsewhere.  This restraint may well be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_222">302</span>
necessary  for the protection of the members of the,  Sched-
uled  Tribes who are generally impecunious and constitute  a
backward  class.   They may need protection  against  money-
lenders or others who may be out to exploit them.   They may
have  to be protected against their own	 impecunious  habits
which  may  result  in their  selling  or  mortgaging  their
hearths	 and homes. Likewise, the free movement of  citizens
may  have  to be restricted in the interest of	the  general
public.	  A person suffering from an infectious disease	 may
be prevent from moving about and spreading the disease.	 and
regulations for his segregation in the nature of  quarantine
may have to be introduced.  Likewise, healthy people may  be
prevented,  in	the interests of the  general  public,	from
entering  a  plague-infected area.  There may  be  protected
places, e.g., forts or other strategic places, access where-
to may have to be regulated or even prohibited in the inter-
ests of the general public.  The point to be noted, however,
is  that when free movement is thus restricted,	 whether  in
the interest of the general public or for the protection  of
the Scheduled Tribes, such restriction has reference  gener-
ally  to a certain local area which becomes  the  prohibited
area  but the right of free movement in all other  areas  in
the Union is left unimpaired.  The circumstance that  clause
(5)  contemplates only the taking away of a  specified	area
and  thereby  restricting the field of the exercise  of	 the
right conferred by subclause (d) of clause (1) indicates  to
my mind that subclause (d)is concerned, not with the freedom
of the person or the general right of free movement but with
a  specific  aspect of it regarded as an  independent  right
apart  from  the freedom of the person. In  other  words  in
sub-clause (d)the real emphasis is on the words	 "throughout
the territory of India."  The purpose of <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_914">article 19 (1)	 (d)</a>
is  to	guarantee that there shall be no State	barrier.  It
gives protection against provincialism. It has nothing to do
with the freedom of the person as such.
</p><p id="p_525">    Finally, the ambit and scope of the rights protected  by
<a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_915">article	 19 (1)</a> have to be considered.	Does it protect	 the
right of free movement	and the other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_223">303</span>
personal  rights  therein  mentioned  in  all  circumstances
irrespective  of  any  other consideration ?   Does  it	 not
postulate  a  capacity to exercise the rights  ?   Does	 its
protection  continue even though the citizen lawfully  loses
his  capacity  for  exercising those rights ?  How  can	 the
continuance of those personal rights be compatible with	 the
lawful detention of the person ?  These personal rights	 and
lawful	detention  cannot go together. Take the	 case  of  a
person who has been properly convicted of an offence punish-
able  under  a section<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_916"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>	 as  to	 the
reasonableness	of which there is no dispute.  His right  to
freedom	 of speech is certainly impaired. Under	 clause	 (2)
the State may make a law relating to libel, slander, defama-
tion, contempt of Court or any matter which offends  against
decency or morality or which undermines the security of,  or
tends  to  overthrow, the State.  Any law on  any  of  these
matters contemplated by this clause certainly must have some
direct	reference to speech and expression.  It	 means	that
the  law may directly curtail the freedom of speech so	that
the  citizen may not talk libel or speak  contemptuously  of
the  Court  or	express indecent or  immoral  sentiments  by
speech	or  other  forms of expression	or  utter  seditious
words.	 To say that every crime undermines the security  of
the State and, therefore, every section<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_917"> of the Indian  Penal
Code</a>, irrespective of whether it has any reference to speech
or expression, is a law within the meaning of this clause is
wholly	unconvincing  and betrays only a  vain	and  forlorn
attempt to find an explanation for meeting the argument that
any  conviction by a Court of law must necessarily  infringe
<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_918">article	 19 (1) (a).</a> -There can be no getting away from	 the
fact  that a detention as a result of a	 conviction  impairs
the  freedom of speech far beyond what is permissible  under
clause	(2) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_919">article 19.</a>   Likewise a detention on  lawful
conviction  impairs each of the other personal	rights	men-
tioned	in  sub-clauses (b) to (e) and (g)  far	 beyond	 the
limits	of  clauses  (8) to (6).  The  argument	 that  every
section<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_920"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> irrespective of whether  it
has any reference to any of the rights referred	 to in	sub-
clauses (b) to (e) and (g) is a law imposing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_224">304</span>
reasonable  restriction	  on  those several rights  has	 not
even the merit of plausibility.	  There can be no doubt that
a detention as a result of lawful conviction must necessari-
ly  impair  the fundamental personal  rights  guaranteed  by
<a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_921">article	 19  (1)</a>   far	beyond	what  is  permissible  under
clauses (2) to (6) of that article and yet nobody can  think
of  questioning	 the  validity of the detention	 or  of	 the
section<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_922">	 of the Indian Penal  Code</a> under which the  sentence
was  passed. Why ? Because the freedom of his person  having
been lawfully taken away, the convict ceases to be  entitled
to  exercise the freedom of speech and expression or any  of
the other personal rights protected by clause (1) of article
</p><p id="p_526">19. On a parity of reasoning he cannot, while the  detention
lasts,	exercise any other personal right, e.g.,  he  cannot
eat  what he likes or when he likes but has to eat what	 the
Jail  Code  provides for him and at the time when he  is  by
Jail regulations required to eat.  Therefore, the conclusion
is irresistible that the rights protected by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_923">article 19 (1</a>),
in  so far as they relate to rights attached to the  person,
i.e.,  the rights referred to in sub-clauses (a) to (e)	 and
</p><p id="p_527">(g),  are  rights  which only a free citizen,  who  has	 the
freedom	 of  his  person unimpaired, can  exercise.   It  is
pointed	 out,  as a counter to the  above  reasonings,	that
detention  as  a  result  of a lawful  conviction  does	 not
deprive a person of his right to acquire or hold or  dispose
of  his property mentioned in sub-clause (f). The answer  is
simple,	 namely, that that right is not a right attached  to
the person (jus personrum) and its existence is not  depend-
ent  on the freedom of the person.  Loss of freedom  of	 the
person,	 therefore, does not suspend the right to  property.
But  suppose  a person loses his property by reason  of	 its
having been compulsorily acquired under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_924">article 31</a> he  loses
his right to hold that property and cannot complain that his
fundamental  right  under sub-clause (f) of  clause  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_925">article	 19</a> has been infringed.	 It follows that the  rights
enumerated  in <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_926">article 19 (1)</a> subsist while the citizen	 has
the  legal  capacity to exercise them. If  his	capacity  to
exercise them is gone, by reason of a lawful conviction with
respect to the rights
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_225">305</span>
in sub-clauses (a) to (e) and (g), or by reason of a  lawful
compulsory  acquisition	 with respect to the right  in	sub-
clause	(f), he ceases to have those rights while his  inca-
pacity lasts.  It further follows that if a citizen's  free-
dom of the person is lawfully taken away otherwise than as a
result of a lawful conviction for an offence, that  citizen,
for  precisely the same reason, cannot exercise any  of	 the
rights attached to his person including those enumerated  in
sub-clauses  (a)  to (e) and (g) of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_927">article 19 (1).</a>   In  my
judgment a lawful detention, whether punitive or preventive,
does not offend against the protection conferred by  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_928">article
19 (1) (a)</a> to (e) and (g), for those rights must necessarily
cease when the freedom of the person is lawfully taken away.
In  short, those rights end where the lawful  detention	 be-
gins.  So construed, <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_929">article 19</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_930">article 21</a>	may,  there-
fore,  easily go together and there is, in reality, no	con-
flict between them.  It follows, therefore, that the validi-
ty or otherwise of preventive detention does not depend	 on,
and is not dealt with by, <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_931">article 19.</a>
</p><p id="p_528">To summarise, the freedom of the person is not the result of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_932">article 19.</a>  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_933">Article 19</a> only   deals with' certain  particu-
lar  rights  which, in their	origin	and  inception,	 are

importance are regarded as specific and independent  rights.
It  does  not deal with the freedom of the person  as  such.
<a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_934">Article	 19 (1) (d)</a> protects a specific aspect of the  right
of  free  locomotion,  namely,	the  right  to	move  freely
throughout  the	 territory of India which is regarded  as  a

protected as such. The protection of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_935">article 19</a> is co-termi-
nous  with the legal capacity of a citizen to  exercise	 the
rights protected thereby, for sub-clauses (a) to (e) and (g)

alone  can ensure the capacity to exercise the	rights	pro-
tected by those sub-clauses.  A citizen who loses the  free-
dom  of his person by being lawfully detained, whether as  a
result	of  a conviction for an offence or as  a  result  of
preventive  detention loses his capacity to  exercise  those
rights	and,  therefore, has none of the rights	 which	sub-

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_226">306</span>
<p id="p_529">In my judgment <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_937">article 19</a> has no bearing on the question  of
the validity or otherwise of preventive detention and,	that
being so, clause (5) which prescribes a test of	 reasonable-
ness to be defined and applied by the Court has no  applica-
tion at all.
</p><p id="p_530">    <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_938">Article 19</a> being thus out of the way, I come to  <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_939">article
20</a> which is concerned with providing protection against what
are  well known as ex post facto laws, double  jeopardy	 and
self-incrimination.  This article constitutes  a  limitation
on the absolute legislative power which would, but for	this
article, be exercisable by Parliament or the State  Legisla-
tures under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_940">article 246</a> read with the legislative lists.  If
the Legislature disobeys  this limitation  the	Court	will
certainly prevent it.  <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_941">Article 20</a> has no bearing on  preven-
tive detention laws and I pass on.
</p><p id="p_531"><a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_942">Article 21</a> runs thus:
</p><p id="p_532">    "21.  No person shall be deprived of his life or person-
al  liberty   except according to procedure  established  by
law."
</p><p id="p_533">    The contention of learned counsel for the petitioner  is
that  by this article the Constitution offers to every	per-
son,  citizen or non-citizen, only a procedural	 protection.
According to the argument, this article does not purport  to
give  any protection to life or personal liberty as  a	sub-
stantive right but only prescribes a procedure that must  be
followed  before  a person may be deprived of  his  life  or
personal  liberty.  I am unable to accept  this	 contention.
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_943">Article 21</a>, as the marginal note states, guarantees to every
person "protection of life and personal liberty."  As I read
it,  it defines the substantive fundamental right  to  which
protection  is given and does not purport to  prescribe	 any
particular  procedure  at all.	That a person shall  not  be
deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to
procedure established by law is the substantive	 fundamental
right to which protection is given by the Constitution.	 The
avowed	object	of  the article, as I apprehend	 it,  is  to
define	the ambit of the right to life and personal  liberty
which is to be protected as a fundamental right.  The  right
to life and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_227">307</span>
personal liberty protected by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_944">article 21</a> is not an  absolute
right	but is a  qualified right--a right circumscribed  by
the possibility or risk of being lost according to procedure
established  by law.  Liability to deprivation according  to
procedure  established by law is in the nature of  words  of
limitation. The article delimits the right by a reference to
its  liability to deprivation according to procedure  estab-
lished	by law and by this very definition throws  a  corre-
sponding  obligation  on  the State to	follow	a  procedure
before	depriving  a man of his life and  personal  liberty.
What  that procedure is to be is not within the	 purpose  or
purview of this article to prescribe or indicate.
</p><p id="p_534">     The claim of learned counsel for the petitioner is that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_945">article 21</a> prescribes a procedure.  This procedure,  accord-
ing  to learned counsel, means those  fundamental  immutable
rules of procedure which are sanctioned or well	 established
by principles of natural justice accepted in all climes	 and
countries and at all times.  Apart from the question whether
any  rule of natural procedure exists which conforms to	 the
notions	 of  justice  and fair play of all  mankind  at	 all
times,	it  has to be ascertained whether  the	language  of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_946">article	 21</a> will permit its introduction into our  Constitu-
tion. The question then arises as to what is the meaning  of
the  expression	 "procedure established by law."   The	word
"procedure" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_947">article 21</a> must be taken to signify some step
or method or manner of proceeding leading up to the depriva-
tion of life or personal liberty.  According to the language
used  in the article, this procedure has to be	"established
by  law."   The	 word "establish" according  to	 the  Oxford
English	 Dictionary, Vol. III, p. 297, means, amongst  other
things, "to render stable or firm ; to strengthen by materi-
al support; to fix, settle, institute or ordain	 permanently
by  enactment or agreement."  According to  Dr.	 Annandale's
edition of the New Gresham Dictionary the word	"establish,"
means,	amongst	 other	things, "to  found  permanently;  to
institute; to enact or decree; to ordain; to ratify; to make
firm."	It follows that the word "established" in its  ordi-
nary natural sense means, amongst other things,	  "enacted."
"Established  by  law"	will,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_228">308</span>
therefore, mean "enacted by law."  If this sense of the word
"established"  is  accepted, then the word "law"  must	mean
State-made  law and cannot possibly mean. the principles  of
natural	 justice, for no procedure can be said to have	ever
been  "enacted" by those principles. When <a href="/doc/1641007/" id="a_948">section  124-A</a>  of
the  Indian Penal Code speaks of "Government established  by
law," surely it does not mean "Government set up by  natural
justice."  Therefore,  procedure established by law must,  I
apprehend,  be procedure enacted by the State which, by	 its
definition in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_949">article  12</a>, includes parliament. There is  no
escape from this position if the cardinal rule of  construc-
tion,  namely,	to give the words used in  a  statute  their
ordinary natural meaning, is applied. And this	construction
introduces no novelty or innovation, for at the date of	 the
Constitution  the  law of procedure in	this  country.	both
civil  and criminal, was mainly if not wholly, the  creature
of  statute.  The Hindu or Muhammadan  laws   of   procedure
were  abrogated and replaced by<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_950"> the Code</a> of Civil  Procedure
or<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_951">  the	 Code</a> of Criminal Procedure.   Therefore,  procedure
established by law is quite compatible with procedure enact-
ed  by law. If, however, the word "established" is taken  to
mean  "sanctioned"  or	"settled" or "made  firm"  then	 the
question  will arise as to the meaning of the word "law"  in
that context.  Reference is made to Salmond's Jurisprudence,
10th Edition, p. 37, showing that the term "law" is used  in
two  senses and it is suggested that the word "law"  in	 the
expression  "established by law "means law in  its  abstract
sense of the principles of natural justice. It is "jus"	 and
not  "lex," says learned counsel for the petitioner.  It  is
pointed out that both the English and the Indian law in many
cases, some of which have been cited before us, have  recog-
nised and applied the principles of natural justice and that
this Court should do the same in interpreting tim provisions
of  our Constitution. I find it difficult to let in  princi-
ples  of natural justice as being within the meaning of	 the
word  "law,"  having regard to the obvious meaning  of	that
word in the other articles.  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_952">Article 14</a> certainly embodies a
principle of natural justice which ensures to.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_229">309</span>
<p id="p_535">  every	 person equality before the law.  When natural	jus-
tice  speaks of and enjoins equality- before the  law,	that
law  must  refer to something outside natural  justice,	 and
must  mean the State-made laws.	 It is only when  the  State
law gives equality to every person that that law is said  to
be  in	accordance with natural justice.  There	 can  be  no
doubt that the words "in accordance with law" in <a href="/doc/1987997/" id="a_953">article  17</a>
have  reference to State law.  Likewise, the word  "law"  in
<a href="/doc/1501707/" id="a_954">article	 20 (1)</a> can mean nothing but law made by the  State.
The  same  remark applies to the words "in  accordance	with
law"  in articles 23, 31 and 32.  Natural justice  does	 not
impose	any tax and, therefore, the word "law"	in  articles
265 and 286 must mean State-made law. If this be the correct
meaning of the word "law" then there is no scope for  intro-
ducing	the principles of natural justice in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_955">article 21</a>	 and
"procedure  established by law" must mcan  procedure  estab-
lished by law made by the State which, as defined,  includes
Parliament and the Legislatures of the States.
    We	have  been referred to a number of  text  books	 and
decisions  showing the development of the American  doctrine
of  "due  process of law" and we have been  urged  to  adopt
those  principles in our Constitution. The matter has to  be
considered  against its historical background.	The  English
settlers in different parts of America had carried with them
the English common law as a sort of personal law  regulating
their rights and liberties inter se as well as between	them
and the State.	After the War of Independence the  Constitu-
tions  of  the United States were drawn up in  writing.	 The
majority  of those who framed the Constitution were  lawyers
and  had closely studied the Commentaries of the great	Eng-
lish  jurist Blackstone, who in his famous commentaries	 had
advocated  the separation of the three limbs of	 the  State,
namely,	 the executive, the legislature and  the  judiciary.
Montesquit's  Spirit  of  Laws had  already  been  published
wherein	 he gave a broader and more emphatic  expression  to
the  Aristotelian  doctrine of separation  of  powers.	 The
experience  of	the repressive laws of	Parliament  had	 im-
pressed upon the framers of the American Constitution the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_230">310</span>
belief	that it was the habit of all legislative  bodies  to
grasp  and exercise powers that did not belong to them.	 The
interference of the colonial governors with legislation	 and
the  judiciary was also real.  This sad	 experience  coupled
with the political philosophy of the time induced the  fram-
ers  of the American Constitutions to adopt  safeguards	 not
only against the executive but also against the legislature.
(See  Munro  on	 the Government of the	United	States,	 5th
Edition,  Chapter IV, p. 53 et seq.).  Says Judge Cooley  in
his Constitutional Limitations, 6th Edition, Vol. II,  Chap-
ter XI, p. 755:
</p><p id="p_536">    "The  people of the American States, holding the  sover-
eignty	in  their own hands, have no occasion to  exact	 any
pledges from any one for a due observation    of  individual
rights;	 but the aggressive tendency of power is  such	that
they have deemed it of no small importance, that, in framing
the  instruments  under which their governments	 are  to  be
administered  by  their agents, they should repeat  and	 re-
enact this guarantee, and thereby adopt it as a principle of
constitutional protection."
</p><p id="p_537">    There can be little doubt that the people of the differ-
ent  States in America intended not to take any risk  as  to
their  life, liberty or property even from the	legislature.
As Munro puts it at pp. 58-61 :--
</p><p id="p_538">    "The  framers of the Constitution set boundaries to	 the
powers	of the Congress, and it was their intent that  these
limitations should be observed.	 But how was such observance
to be enforced by the Courts ? The statesmen of 1767 did not
categorically answer that question."
</p><p id="p_539">    The	 Constitution  was silent and there was	 no  express
provision  as  to  who was to serve as umpire  in  case	 the
Congress  overstepped the limits of its legislative  powers.
By  the 5th Amendment what is now known as the "due  process
clause"	 was introduced in the Federal Constitution  and  by
the 14th Amendment a similar clause was adopted in the State
Constitutions.	Some  of the State  Constitutions  used	 the
words "due course of law," some repeated the words of  Magna
Charta, namely, "the law of the land" but most of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_231">311</span>
them  used  the expression "due process of  law."   All	 the
expressions  meant  the same thing, namely, that  no  person
should	be deprived of his life, liberty or property  except
in due process of law. The Constitution by this clause	gave
the  Supreme  Court an opportunity to take upon	 itself	 the
function  of declaring the national  laws  unconstitutional.
And the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice
John Marshall, seized this opportunity and assumed the right
to say the last word on questions of constitutionality,	 and
possesses that right to-day:  (Munro, p. 62).
    The expression "due process of law" has been interpreted
by  the	  American Courts  in  different ways  at  different
times.	 Carl  Brent Swisher in	 his book on the  Growth  of
Constitutional	Power in the United States at p.  107  says,
with  reference	 to the development of the doctrine  of	 due
procedure:
</p><p id="p_540">    "The  American history of its interpretation falls	into
three periods.	During the first period covering roughly the
first  century	of Government under  the  Constitution	"due
process" was interpreted "principally as a restriction	upon
procedure--and largely the judicial procedure--by which	 the
Government   exercised	 its  powers.  During	the   second
period,which, again roughly speaking, extended through 1936,
"due  process"	was expanded to serve as a  restriction	 not
merely upon procedure but upon the substance of the  activi-
ties in which the Government might engage.  During the third
period extending from 1936 to date, the use of "due process"
as  a substantive restriction has been largely suspended  or
abandoned, leaving it principally in its original status  as
a restriction upon procedure."
</p><p id="p_541">    In	the guise of interpreting "due process of  law"	 the
American  Courts went much further than even Lord Coke	ever
thought of doing. The American Courts gradually arrogated to
themselves  the	 power to revise all  legislations.  In	 the
beginning  they	 confined themselves to insisting on  a	 due
procedure to be followed before a person was deprived of his
life,  liberty or property. In course of time, "due  process
of  law" came to be applied to personal liberty,  to  social
control, to procedure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_232">40</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_233">312</span>
to  jurisdiction and to substantive law:  (Willis, p.  642).
In the words of Munro "due process of law" became a sort  of
palladium  covering all manner of individual  rights.	A_II
the  while the Supreme Court refused to define	the  phrase,
but used it to enable it to declare unconstitutional any Act
of  legislation which it thought unreasonable:	(Willis,  p.
</p><p id="p_542">657). In Holden v. Hardy (1) we find the following  observa-
tions:
</p><p id="p_543">    "This Court has never attempted to define with precision
the words' due process of law ................	It is suffi-
cient to say that there are certain immutable principles  of
justice	 which	inhere in the very idea of  free  government
which  no  member of the Union may disregard."In  Taylor  v.
Peter (2) Bronson J. observed:
</p><p id="p_544">    "The  words	 'by  the law of the land' as  used  in	 the
Constitution,  do not mean a statute passed for the  purpose
of  working the wrong.	That construction would	 render	 the
restriction  absolutely nugatory, and turn this part of	 the
Constitution into mere nonsense. The people would be made to
say to the two Houses: ' You shall be vested with the legis-
lative	power of the. State, but no one shall be  disenfran-
chised	or deprived of any of the rights or privileges of  a
citizen,  unless  you pass a statute for that  purpose.	  In
other words you shall not do the wrong unless you choose  to
do it.'"
</p><p id="p_545">    It was thus that the Supreme Court of the United  States
firmly	established  its own supremacy over  the  other	 two
limbs of the State, namely, the executive and the  Congress.
In  the	 words of John Dickinson quoted in Munro at  p.	 61,
"The Judges of Aragon began by setting aside laws and  ended
by  making them."  And all this sweeping  development  could
only be possible because of the presence of one little	word
"due"  which,  in  its content, knows no bound	and  is	 not
subject to any fixed definition. Whenever a substantive	 law
or  some procedure laid down in any law did not find  favour
with the majority of the learned Judges of the Supreme Court
it was not reasonableand, therefore, it was not "due."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_234">313</span>
The  very  large and nebulous import of the word  "due"	 was
bound to result in anomalies, for what was not "due" on	 one
day  according to the Judges then constituting	the  Supreme
Court  became "due" say 20 years later according to the	 new
Judges who then came to occupy the Bench, for the Court	 had
to adapt the Constitution to the needs of the society  which
were  continually changing and growing.	 The larger  content
of  due process of law, which included both  procedural	 and
substantive  due  process  of law, had of  necessity  to  be
narrowed  down, for social interest in personal liberty	 had
to  give way to social interest in other matters which	came
to be considered to be of more vital interest to the  commu-
nity.  This was achieved by the Supreme Court of the  United
States evolving the new doctrine of police powers--a  pecul-
iarly  American	 doctrine.  The police	powers	are  nowhere
exhaustively  defined.	In Chicago B. &amp; Q. Ry.	v.  Drainage
Commissioner  (1) ,, police power" has been stated  to	"em-
brace regulations designed to promote the public convenience
or  the general prosperity, as well as regulations  designed
to  promote  the  public health, the public  morals  or	 the
public safety." Reference in this connection may be made  to
Cooley's  Constitutional Limitations, 8th Edition, Vol.	 II,
p. 1223 and to Chapter XXVI of Willis at p. 727.
    The nett result is that the all-inclusive and  indefina-
ble  doctrine of due process of law has in America now	been
brought	 back  to its original status of  a  procedural	 due
process of law by the enunciation and application of the new
doctrine of police power as an antidote or palliative to the
former.	 Who knows when the pendulum will swing again.
    Turning  now to what has been called the procedural	 due
process	 of  law it will be found that the matter  has	been
described  in  different languages in different	 cases.	  In
Westervelt v. Gregg (2) Edwards J. defined it thus:
</p><p id="p_547">    "Due process of law undoubtedly means, in the due course
of legal proceedings, according to those rules
204 u.s. 561,592.		   (2) 12 N.Y. 202.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_235">314</span>
<p id="p_548">and forms which have been established for the protection  of
private rights."
</p><p id="p_549">    A more specific definition of the expression "the law of
the  land" meaning procedural due process was given by	Web-
ster appearing as counsel for the plaintiff in error in	 the
Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1):
</p><p id="p_550">    "By	 the  law of the land is most clearly  intended	 the
general	 law;  a law which hears before it  condemns;  which
proceeds upon inquiry and renders judgment only after trial.
The  meaning  is  that every citizen shall  hold  his  life,
liberty, property, and. immunities, under the protection  of
the  general rules which govern society.   Everything  which
may pass under the form of an enactment is not therefore  to
be considered the law of the land."
</p><p id="p_551">Willis in Ch. XXIII, p. 661, says:
</p><p id="p_552">    "The  guarantee  of due process of law as  a  matter  of
procedure means that no part of a person's personal liberty,
including ownership, shall be taken away from him except  by
the  observance of certain formalities. Hence its object  is
the protection of the social interest in personal liberty."
</p><p id="p_553">    At	p.  662 Willis enumerates the  requirements  of	 the
procedural  due	 process of law as follows:(1)	notice.	 (2)
opportunity to be heard, (3) an impartial tribunal, and	 (4)
an  orderly course of procedure.  In short,  the  procedural
due process requires that a person who is to be deprived  of
his  life,  liberty or property shall have had "his  day  in
Court." This according to Willough by p. 736, means:
</p><p id="p_554">    "(1)  that	he shall have had due notice, which  may  be
actual	or constructive, of the institution of the  proceed-
ings by which his legal rights may be affected; (2) that  he
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appear and defend
his  rights,  including	 the right himself  to	testify,  to
produce	 witnesses, and to introduce relevant documents	 and
other evidence, (3) that the tribunal in or before which his
rights are adjudicated is so constituted as to give reasona-
ble assurance of its.
</p><p id="p_555">(1)  4 Wheaton 518 at p. 579; 4 L. Edn. 629 at p. 645.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_236">315</span>
<p id="p_556">honesty	 and  impartiality; and (4) that it is	a  Court  of
competent jurisdiction."
</p><p id="p_557">    It will be noticed that the fourth item of Willoughby is
different  from the fourth item of Willis. Such,  in  short,
are  the history of the development of the doctrine  of	 the
process of law in the United States and the requirements  of
the  procedural	 due process as insisted on by	the  Supreme
Court of that country.
</p><p id="p_558">    Learned  counsel for the petitioner before us  does	 not
contend that we should import this American doctrine of	 due
process	 of law in its full glory but that we  should  adopt
the procedural part of it and insist that no person shall be
deprived  of  his  life or personal liberty  except  by	 the
observance  of the formalities which justice and  fair	play
require	 to be observed.  The arguments of  learned  counsel
for  the  petitioner are attractive and in the	first  blush
certainly appeal to our sentiment but on serious  reflection
I find several insuperable objections to the introduction of
the American doctrine of procedural due process of law	into
our  Constitution.  That doctrine can only thrive  and	work
where the legislature is subordinate to the judiciary in the
sense  that the latter can sit in judgment over	 and  review
all  acts of the legislature.  Such a doctrine can  have  no
application  to	 a field where the legislature	is  supreme.
That  is why the doctrine of "due process of law"  is  quite
different  in  England	where Parliament  is  supreme.	This
difference  is pointedly described by Mathews J.  in  Joseph
Hurtado v. People of California (1) at p. 531:
</p><p id="p_559">    "The  concessions  of Magna Charta were wrung  from	 the
King as guarantees against oppression and usurpation of	 his
prerogatives.  It did not enter into the minds of the barons
to  provide security against their own body or in favour  of
the  commons  by limiting the power of Parliament,  so	that
bills  of  attainder,  ex post facto  laws,  laws  declaring
forfeitures of estates and other arbitrary Acts of  legisla-
tion  which  occur so frequently in  English  history,	were
never  regarded	 as inconsistent with the law of  the  land,
for,  notwithstanding what was attributed to Lord  Coke	 in.
Bonham's
(1) (1883) 110 U.S. 516.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_237">316</span>
<p id="p_560">case,  [8 Coke 115, 118 (a),] the omnipotence of  Parliament
over the Common Law was absolute, even against common  right
and  reason.  The actual and practical security for  English
liberty against legislative tyranny was the power of a	free
public opinion represented by the Commons.
    In this country written Constitutions were deemed essen-
tial  to  protect  the rights and liberties  of	 the  people
against	 the encroachments of power delegated to their	gov-
ernments and the provisions of Magna Charta were incorporat-
ed  in the bills of rights.  They were limitations upon	 all
the  powers of government, legislative as well as  executive
and judicial."
</p><p id="p_561">    This  basic distinction between the two  systems  should
never  be  lost sight of, if confusion of thought is  to  be
avoided. Although our Constitution has imposed some  limita-
tions  on  the legislative authorities, yet subject  to	 and
outside	 such  limitations  our Constitution  has  left	 our
Parliament  and	 the  State Legislatures  supreme  in  their
respective legislative fields.	In the main, subject to	 the
limitations I have mentioned, our Constitution has preferred
the  supremacy of the Legislature to that of the  Judiciary.
The  English principle of due process of law is,  therefore,
more  in  accord  with our Constitution	 than  the  American
doctrine which has been evolved for serving quite a  differ-
ent  system. The picturesque language of Bronson  J.  quoted
above,	while  that  is quite appropriate  to  the  American
Constitution  which does not recognise the  supremacy	  of
the Congress, is wholly out of place in, and has no applica-
tion to, a Constitution such as ours, which, subject only to
certain restrictions, recognises the supremacy of the Legis-
latures	 in their respective fields.  In the next place,  it
is common knowledge that our Constitution-makers deliberate-
ly  declined  to adopt the uncertain and  shifting  American
doctrine  of due process of law and substituted	 the  words'
"except	 in  due process of law" that were in  the  original
draft by the more specific expression "except in  accordance
with procedure established by law."  To try to bring in	 the
American doctrine, in spite of this fact, will be to stulti-
fy the intention of the Constitution as expressed in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_238">317</span>
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_956">article 21.</a> In the third place, in view of the plain meaning
of  the language of that article as construed and  explained
above  it is impossible to let in what have been called	 the
principles  of natural justice as adopted in the  procedural
due  process  of law by the American Supreme  Court.  Again,
even  the  all-pervading little word "due" does not  find  a
place  in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_957">article 21</a> so as to qualify	the  procedure.	  It
speaks of procedure and not "due" procedure and,  therefore,
"the  intellectual  yardstick" of the  Court  is  definitely
ruled  out.  Finally, it will be incongruous to	 import	 the
doctrine  of due process of law without its palliative,	 the
doctrine  of  police powers.  It is impossible to  read	 the
last mentioned doctrine into <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_958">article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_562">    It	has  also been suggested as a compromise  that	this
Court  should  adopt a middle course  between  the  flexible
principles  of	natural justice as adopted by  the  American
doctrine of due process of law and the unbending rigidity of
mere  State-made laws.	h is said that we have our  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_959">Code  of</a>
Criminal  Procedure  which embodies  within  its  provisions
certain salutary principles of procedure and we must  insist
that  those  underlying	 principles should  be	regarded  as
procedure  established or settled by our positive law.	 But
who  will say what are those fundamental principles?	What
principles.  do	 I reject as inessential and  what  shall  I
adopt as fundamental ?	What is fundamental to me today	 may
not  appear  to be so to another Judge a decade	 hence,	 for
principles  give  way with changing  social  conditions.  In
America	 it was suggested that due process of law should  be
taken to  mean the general body of common law as it stood at
the date of the Constitution.  In Bardwell v. Collins (1) it
was negatived in the following words:
</p><p id="p_563">    "'Due process of law' does not mean the general body  of
the  law,  common  and statute, as it was at  the  time	 the
Constitution  took effect; for that would deny the  legisla-
ture power to change or amend the law in any particular."
The Court, however, brought in principles of
(1) 44 Minn. 97.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_239">318</span>
<p id="p_564">natural	 justice under the due process clause.	To  sanctify
what I may to-day regard as the basic principles  underlying
our Code of Criminal Procedure will be to make them  immuta-
ble  and  to prevent the legislature even  to  improve	upon
them.	This  is nothing but imposing on the  legislature  a
limitation  which the Constitution has not placed on it.   I
do not think it is a permissible adventure for the Court  to
undertake.   It is a dangerous adventure, for it will  bring
about  stagnation which means ruin. We must accept the	Con-
stitution which is the supreme law. The Constitution has  by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_960">article	 21</a> required a procedure and has prescribed  certain
minimum	 requirements of procedure in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_961">article 22.</a> To add  to
them  is not to interpret the Constitution but to recast  it
according to our intellectual yardstick and our	 unconscious
predilections as to what an ideal Constitution should be.
    <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_962">Article  21</a>, in my judgment, only formulates a  substan-
tive fundamental right to life and personal liberty which in
its content is not an absolute right but is a limited  right
having	its  ambit circumscribed by the risk  of  its  being
taken away by following a procedure established by law	made
by  the appropriate legislative authority and the  proximate
purpose	 of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_963">article 21</a> is not to prescribe  any  particular
procedure.  It is to be kept in mind that at the  date	when
the  Constitution came into effect we had<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_964"> the  Indian  Penal
Code</a>  creating diverse offences and a conviction for any  of
them  would deprive a person of his personal liberty.  Under
<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_965">article	 246</a> read with Entry 1 of the Concurrent List,	Par-
liament or any State Legislature could add more offences and
create further means for taking away personal liberty.	 But
all  this deprivation of personal liberty as a result  of  a
conviction  could  only be done by following  the  procedure
laid down by<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_966"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure.  Again, at	 the
date  of this Constitution there were  preventive  detention
laws in almost every province and a person could be deprived
of  his	 personal  liberty under those	laws.	Those  laws,
however,  provided  a procedure of a sort which	 had  to  be
followed.   Therefore,	before the  Constitution  came	into
force, personal liberty could be taken away
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_240">319</span>
only  by  following the procedure enacted  by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_967">  the  Criminal
Procedure  Code</a> in the case of punitive detention or by	 the
procedure enacted by the different <a href="/doc/190229/" id="a_968">Security Act</a>s in case  of
preventive  detention.	 Power, however, has been  given  to
Parliament and the State Legislatures under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_969">article 246</a> read
with  Entry 2 of the Concurrent List to make laws  with	 re-
spect  to Criminal Procedure.	If  that  article  stood  by
itself the Parliament or the State Legislature could  repeal
the  whole<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_970"> of the Criminal Procedure Code</a> and also  do	away
even  with the skeleton procedure provided in  the  <a href="/doc/190229/" id="a_971">Security
Act</a>s.	If <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_972">article 246</a> stood by itself then the	 appropriate
legislative   authority could  have taken away the life	 and
personal liberty of any person without any procedure at all.
This  absolute supremacy of the legislative  authority	has,
however,  been	cut down by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_973">article 21</a>	which  delimits	 the
ambit and scope of the substantive right to life and person-
al  liberty  by reference to a procedure and by	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_974">article  22</a>
which  prescribes the minimum procedure which must  be	fol-
lowed.	In this situation the only power of the Court is  to
determine whether the impugned law has provided some  proce-
dure  and  observed and obeyed the minimum  requirements  of
<a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_975">article	 29.</a> and if it has, then it is not for the Court  to
insist	on more elaborate procedure according to its  notion
or  to question the wisdom of the legislative  authority  in
enacting  the particular law, however  harsh,  unreasonable,
archaic or odious the provisions of that law may be.
    It	is said that if this strictly technical	 interpreta-
tion  is put upon <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_976">article 21</a> then it will not  constitute  a
fundamental  right at all and need not have been  placed  in
the  chapter on Fundamental Rights, for every person's	life
and personal liberty will be at the mercy of the Legislature
which,	by providing some sort of a procedure and  complying
with  the few requirements of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_977">article 22</a>, may, at any  time,
deprive a person of his life and liberty at its pleasure and
whim.	There are several answers to this line of  argument.
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_978">Article	 21</a> as construed by me will, if nothing	 else,	cer-
tainly	protect	 every person against the executive  and  as
such will be as much a fundamental right deserving
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_241">411</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_242">320</span>
a  place in the Constitution as the famous 39th	 Chapter  of
the Magna Charta was and is a bulwark of liberty in  English
law.   It appears to me that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_979">article 21</a> of our	Constitution
read  with  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_980">article 32</a> also gives us  some  protection	even
against the legislative authority in that a person may	only
be  deprived of his life and personal liberty in  accordance
with procedure which, although enacted by it, must at  least
conform to the requirements of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_981">article 22.</a>  Subject to	this
limitation our parliament or any State Legislature may enact
any law and provide any procedure it pleases for depriving a
person	of his life and personal liberty under	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_982">article	 21.</a>
Such  being  the meaning of that article and the  ambit	 and
extent of the fundamental right of life and personal liberty
which the people of this country have given unto themselves,
any  law for depriving any person of his life  and  personal
liberty	 that  may be made by  the  appropriate	 legislative
authority  under  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_983">article  246</a> and in  conformity  with	 the
requirements  of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_984">article 22</a> does not take away	 or  abridge
any  right   conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_985">article  21</a>,	for the	 very  right
conferred by that article is circumscribed  by	this  possi-
bility or risk and, therefore, such law cannot be   regarded
as   violating	 the  provisions of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_986">article  13	 (2).</a>	 Our
Constitution is a compromise between Parliamentary supremacy
of  England  and the supremacy of the Supreme Court  of	 the
United	States. Subject to the limitations I have  mentioned
which  are certainly justiciable, our Constitution  has	 ac-
cepted the supremacy of the legislative authority and,	that
being so, we must be prepared to face occasional vagaries of
that body and to put up with enactments of the nature of the
atrocious  English statute to which learned counsel for	 the
petitioner has repeatedly referred, namely, that the  Bishop
of  Rochester's cook be boiled to death.  If Parliament	 may
take  away life by providing for hanging by the neck,  logi-
cally there can be no objection if it provides a sentence of
death  by shooting by a firing squad or by guillotine or  in
the  electric chair or even by boiling in oil.	A  procedure
laid down by the legislature may offend against the  Court's
sense of justice and fair play
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_243">821</span>
and  a sentence provided by the legislature may outrage	 the
Court's notions of penology, but that is a wholly irrelevant
consideration.	The  Court may construe	 and  interpret	 the
Constitution and ascertain its true meaning but once that is
done  the Court cannot question its wisdom or  policy.	 The
Constitution is supreme.  The Court must take the  Constitu-
tion  as  it finds it, even if it does not accord  with	 its
preconceived  notions of what an ideal	Constitution  should
be.   Our  protection against legislative tyranny,  if	any,
lies  in ultimate analysis in a free and intelligent  public
opinion which must eventually assert itself.
    The conclusion I have arrived at does not introduce	 any
novelty,  for in many other Constitutions the  supremacy  of
the  legislature is recognised in the matter of depriving  a
person	of  his life, liberty and  property.	The  English
Democratic Constitution is one in point.  Take the Constitu-
tion  of the Irish Free State.	<a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_987">Article 40 (4) (i)</a>  provides
that  no citizen shall be deprived of personal liberty	save
in  accordance with law, and <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_988">article 50 (5)</a> guarantees	that
the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be
forcibly entered save in accordance with law.  The words "in
accordance with law" in both the above clauses must mean the
same  thing and I have no doubt in my mind,  reading  clause
(5)that it means in accordance with the State-made law,	 for
we have not been referred to any rule prescribed by  natural
justice	 regulating  searches of, or  entry  into,  dwelling
houses.	 <a href="/doc/846895/" id="a_989">Article 107 (2)</a> of the Czechoslovakian Constitution
uses  the  words "in accordance with law" which,  read	with
clause	(1) of that article, obviously means the law  to  be
made  which  will form part of the  Constitution.  Take	 the
Constitution  of the Free City of Danzig. Article74 of	that
Constitution which is in Part II headed "Fundamental  Bights
and Duties" provides as follows:
</p><p id="p_565">    "The  liberty  of  the person shall	 be  inviolable.  No
limitation or deprivation of personal liberty may be imposed
by public authority, except by virtue of a law."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_244">322</span>
<p id="p_566">  The word" law" clearly cannot, in the context,mcan princi-
ples of natural justice-  Again, <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_990">article 75</a> of that  Consti-
tution protects the freedom of movement within the Free City
and the right to stay and to settle at any place, to acquire
real  property	and  to earn   a living.   It  concludes  by
saying that this right shall not be curtailed without  legal
sanctions.  Legal sanctions, in this context, can only	mean
sanctions  of  the  City laws.	<a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_991">Article 114</a>  of	 the  Weimar
Constitution   is on the same lines and expressed in  almost
the same language as <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_992">article 74</a> of the Danzig  Constitution.
Take the Japanese Constitution of 1946 from which our  arti-
cle  21 is reputed to have been taken. Article XXXI of	that
Constitution says:
</p><p id="p_567">No person shall be deprived of life or liberty nor shall any
other  criminal	 penalty  be imposed,  except  according  to
procedure established by law."
</p><p id="p_568">Surely the words "except according to procedure	 established
by  law" in their application to the imposition of  criminal
penalty	 must mean State-made law and the same words in	 the
same sentence in the same article cannot, according to ordi-
nary  rules  of construction of statutes, mean	a  different
thing in their application to deprivation of life or  liber-
ty.  I am aware that it is not right to construe one Consti-
tution	in the light of another and that is not	 my  purpose
when I refer to the other Constitutions; but I do think that
after reading the relevant provisions of other written	Con-
stitutions one sees quite clearly that there is no  pressing
special reason applicable to or inherent in written  Consti-
tutions which requires the importation of the principles  of
natural	 justice or of the American doctrine of due  process
of  law	 into our Constitution.	 The  several  Constitutions
referred  to above have not adopted that  American  doctrine
but  have been content with leaving the life and liberty  of
their citizens to the care of the laws made by their  legis-
latures.  It is no novelty if our Constitution has done	 the
same.  For all these reasons, in spite of the very able	 and
attractive  arguments of the learned counsel for  the  peti-
tioner	which I freely acknowledge, I am not convinced	that
there  is any scope for the introduction into <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_993">article 21</a>  of
our
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_245">323</span>
Constitution  of the doctrine of due process of law even  as
regards	 procedure.  I may or may not like it, but  that  is
the result of our Constitution as I understand it.
    The	 learned  Attorney-General has referred	 to  certain
debates	 in the Constituent Assembly on the original  clause
which has now become <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_994">article 21</a>, not as evidence to be	used
in interpreting the language of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_995">article 21</a> but as   disclos-
ing the historical background.	His purpose, he says, is  to
show that the framers of our Constitution had the  essential
difference  in	the meaning of the phrases "due	 process  of
law" and "according to procedure established by law" clearly
explained  to them, that they knew that the  former  implied
the supremacy of the judiciary and the latter the  supremacy
of the legislature and with all that knowledge they deliber-
ately  agreed to reject the former expression and adopt	 the
latter.	 As, in my opinion, it is possible to interpret	 the
language of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_996">article 21</a> on the ordinary rules of	 interpreta-
tion  of    statutes, I do not think it is at all  necessary
to  refer  to the debates. As I do not propose to refer	 to,
or  rely   on, the debates for the purposes of this case,  I
express no opinion on the  question of the admissibility  or
otherwise of the debates.
</p><p id="p_569">    I now pass on to <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_997">article 22.</a>  The contention of  learned
counsel	 for the petitioner is that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_998">article 21</a> by reason  of
the  last few words, "according to procedure established  by
law"  attracts the four requirements of the American  proce-
dural  due process of law as summarised by Willis  to  which
reference  has	been made earlier, and that  those  require-
ments,	except to the extent they have been expressly  abro-
gated  or modified by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_999">article 22</a>, must be strictly  followed
before	a  person may be deprived of his  life	or  personal
liberties.   I	have already stated for	 reasons  set  forth
above,	that there is no scope for introducing any  rule  of
natural	 justice or the American procedural due	 process  of
law  or	 any underlying principle of our  Code	of  Criminal
Procedure  into that article.  This being the  conclusion  I
have arrived at, the major premise assumed by learned  coun-
sel for the petitioner is missing and this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_246">324</span>
line of argument does not begin and cannot be accepted.
    The learned Attorney-General, on the other hand. has  at
one stage of his argument, urged that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1000">article 21</a> has nothing
to  do with preventive detention at all and that  preventive
detention  is wholly covered by <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_1001">article 22 (4)</a> to (7)  which
by  themselves constitute a complete code.  I am  unable  to
accede	to this extreme point of view also.  The true  posi-
tion, as I apprehend it, lies between the two extreme views.
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1002">Article 21</a>, to my mind, gives protection to life and person-
al  liberty  to the extent therein mentioned.  It  does	 not
recognise  the	right  to life and personal  liberty  as  an
absolute right but delimits the ambit and scope of the right
itself	 The  absolute right is by the	definition  in	that
article	 cut  down by the risk of its being  taken  away  in
accordance  with procedure established by law.	It  is	this
circumscribed  right   which is substantively  protected  by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1003">article	  21</a>  as   against  the	 executive as  well  as	 the
legislature, for the Constitution has conditioned its depri-
vation	by the necessity for a procedure established by	 law
made  by itself.  While subclauses (2) to (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1004">article  19</a>
have  put  a limit on the fundamental rights of	 a  citizen,
articles  21 and 22 have    put a limit on the power of	 the
State  given  under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1005">article 246</a> read  with  the	 legislative
lists.	Under our Constitution our life and personal liberty
are  balanced by restrictions on the rights of the  citizens
as  laid down in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1006">article 19</a> and by the checks put  upon	 the
State by articles 21 and 22.   preventive detention deprives
a  person  of his personal liberty as  effectively  as	does
punitive detention and, therefore, personal liberty, circum-
scribed	 as it is by the risk of its being taken  away,	 re-
quires	protection  against punitive as well  as  preventive
detention.  The language of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1007">article 21</a> is quite general	 and
is  wide enough to give its limited protection	to  personal
liberty	 against  all forms of detention.    It	 protects  a
person against preventive detention by the executive without
the sanction of a law made by the legislature.	 It prevents
the legislature from taking away a person's personal liberty
except	in  accordance with procedure  established  by	law,
although such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_247">325</span>
law  is	 to be by itself.  If, as contended by	the  learned
Attorney-General  and held by me, <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1008">article 19</a>  only  protects
the rights of a free citizen as long as he is free and	does
not deal with total deprivation of personal liberty and	 if,
as  contended by the learned Attorney-General,	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1009">article  21</a>
does not protect a person against preventive detention	then
where  is  the protection for life and personal	 liberty  as
substantive rights which the procedural provisions of  arti-
cle 22 may protect ?  What is the use of procedural  protec-
tion  if  there is no substantive right ?   In	my  judgment
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1010">article	 21</a> protects the substantive rights by	requiring  a
procedure  and <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1011">article 22</a> gives the minimum procedural	pro-
tection.
</p><p id="p_570">Clauses	 (1)  and (2) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1012">article 22</a> lay down  the  procedure
that has to be followed when a man is arrested. They  ensure
four  things: (a) right to be informed regarding grounds  of
arrest, (b) right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal
practitioner of his choice, (c) right to be produced  before
a magistrate within 24 hours and (d) freedom from  detention
beyond	the  said  period  except  by order of	the   magis-
trate.	These  four procedural requirements  are  very	much
similar to the requirements  of	 the procedural due  process
of  law	 as enumerated by Willis.  Some	 of  these  salutary
protections  are  also to be found in our Code	of  Criminal
Procedure.  If the procedure has already been prescribed  by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1013">article	 21</a> incorporating the principles of natural  justice
or the principles underlying our Code of Criminal  Procedure
what was the necessity of repeating them in clauses (1)	 and
(2)  of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1014">article 22 ?</a> Why this unnecessary overlapping ?	 The
truth  is that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1015">article 21</a> does not prescribe any  particular
procedure but in defining the protection to life and person-
al liberty merely envisages or indicates the necessity for a
procedure  and	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1016">article 22</a> lays down the  minimum  rules  of
procedure that even Parliament cannot abrogate or  overlook.
This  is  so far as punitive detention	is  concerned.	 But
clause (3) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1017">article 22</a> expressly provides that none of the
procedure laid down in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply to an
alien enemy or to a person who is arrested or detained under
any  law  providing for preventive detention.	It  is	thus
expressly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_248">326</span>
made  clear  that a detenu need not be produced	 before	 the
magistrate  and	 he  is not to have the	 assistance  of	 any
lawyer for consultation or for defending him. Such being the
express	 provision of our Constitution nobody  can  question
its wisdom.  So I pass on.
</p><p id="p_571">Clauses	 (4),  (5),  (6)  and (7) of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1018">article  22</a>  in  terms
relate to preventive detention.	 <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1019">Article 246</a> authorises	 the
appropriate legislature to make a law for preventive  deten-
tion  in terms of Entry 9 in List I and/or Entry 3  in	List
III  of the Seventh Schedule. On this legislative power	 are
imposed	 certain  limitations  by <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_1020">article  22  (4)</a>  to	(7).
According to this the legislature, whether it be  Parliament
or  a State Legislature, is reminded that no law made by  it
for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of  a
person	for a longer period than three months except in	 two
cases mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (b).  The proviso  to
sub-clause  (a) and sub-clause (b) refer to a law made	only
by  Parliament	under clause (7).  Under clause	 (7)  it  is
Parliament  alone  and not any State  Legislature  that	 may
prescribe what are specified in the three subclauses of that
clause.	  Although  a State Legislature may make a  law	 for
preventive detention in terms of Entry 3 in List III of	 the
Seventh	 Schedule  no such law may authorise  detention	 for
more than three months unless the provisions of	 sub-clauses
</p><p id="p_572">(a)and	(b) of clause (4) sanction such detention.   Even  a
law  made by Parliament cannot authorise detention for	more
than  three months unless it is a law made under the  provi-
sions  of  clause (7).	In short, clause (4) of	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1021">article  22</a>
provides  a  limitation on the legislative power as  to	 the
period	of  preventive	detention.  Apart  from	 imposing  a
limitation  on the legislative power, clause (4)  also	pre-
scribes	 a procedure of detention for a period	longer	than
three months by providing for an advisory board.  Then comes
clause	(5). It lays down the procedure that has to be	fol-
lowed when a person is detained under any law providing	 for
preventive  detention, namely, (a) the grounds of the  order
of  detention must be communicated to the detenu as soon  as
may  be,  and (b) the detenu must be afforded  the  earliest
opportunity of making a representation against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_249">327</span>
the order.  The first requirement takes the place of  notice
and  the second that of a defence or hearing. These are	 the
only  compulsory  procedural requirements laid down  by	 our
Constitution.	There is nothing to prevent the	 Legislature
from providing an elaborate procedure regulating  preventive
detention but it is not obliged to do so.  If some procedure
is  provided as envisaged by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1022">article 21</a> and  the  compulsory
requirements of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1023">article 22</a> are obeyed and carried out nobody
can,  under our Constitution, as I read it, complain of	 the
law providing for preventive detention.
</p><p id="p_573">    Learned  counsel  for the petitioner concedes  that	 the
four  requirements of procedural due process  summarised  by
Willis	will  have to be modified in  their  application  to
preventive  detention.	 Thus he does not insist on a  prior
notice before arrest, for he recognises that such a require-
ment  may frustrate the very object of preventive  detention
by  giving  an opportunity to the person in question  to  go
underground.   The  provision in clause	 (5)  for  supplying
grounds	 is a good substitute for notice.  He also does	 not
insist that the Tribunal to judge the reasonableness of	 the
detention should be a judicial tribunal.  He will be  satis-
fied  if the tribunal or advisory board, as it is called  in
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1024">article	 22</a>  of the Constitution, is an impartial  body	 and
goes  into  the	 merits of the order of	 detention  and	 its
decision is binding on the executive government.  He insists
that the detenu must have a reasonable and effective  oppor-
tunity	to  put up his defence.	 He does not insist  on	 the
assistance  of counsel, for that is expressly taken away  by
the Constitution itself.  But he insists on what he calls an
effective  opportunity	of being heard in person  before  an
impartial tribunal which will be free to examine the grounds
of his detention and whose decision should be binding  alike
on  the	 detenu and the executive authority  which  detains.
The  claim  may be reasonable but the  question	 before	 the
Court  is not reasonableness or otherwise of the  provisions
of <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_1025">article 22 (4)</a> to (7). Those provisions are not justicia-
ble, for they are the provisions of the Constitution  itself
which is supreme over everybody.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_250">42</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_251">328</span>
<p id="p_574">The  Court can only seek to find out, on a proper  construc-
tion, what protection has in fact been provided. The Consti-
tution has provided for the giving of the grounds of  deten-
tion  although	facts as distinguished from grounds  may  be
withheld  under clause (6) and the right  of  representation
against	 the  order of detention.  It has provided  for	 the
duration of the detention.  There the guaranteed fundamental
procedural rights end.	There is no provision for any  trial
before	any tribunal.  One cannot import the condition of  a
trial  by any tribunal from the fact that a right of  repre-
sentation has been given.  The right to make  representation
is  nothing  more than the right to  "lodge  objections"  as
provided by the Danzig Constitution and the Weimar Constitu-
tion.  The representations made will no doubt be  considered
by the Government. It is said a prosecutor cannot be himself
the  judge.  Ordinarily, the orders of detention will  in  a
great  majority of cases be made by the District  Magistrate
or Sub-Divisional Officer or the Commissioner of Police. The
representation	of the detenu goes to the  Government.	 Why
should it be assumed that a high government official at	 the
seat  of  the government will not impartially  consider	 the
representation	and  judge  the propriety of  the  order  of
detention  made	 by local officials ? Clause  (5)  does	 not
imperatively  provide  for any oral representation  which  a
hearing will entail. Indeed the exclusion of the  provisions
of  clauses (1) and (2) negatives any idea of trial or	oral
defence.  The  Court may not, by temperament  and  training,
like  this at all but it cannot question the wisdom  or	 the
policy	of the Constitution. In my judgment as regards	pre-
ventive	 detention  laws, the only limitation put  upon	 the
legislative power is that it must provide some procedure and
at  least incorporate the minimum requirements laid down  in
<a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_1026">article 22 (4)</a> to (7). There is no limitation as regards the
substantive  law.   Therefore, a  preventive  detention	 law
which provides some procedure and complies with the require-
ments  of  <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_1027">article 22 (4)</a> to (7) must be held to be  a	good
law, however odious it may appear to the Court to be.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_252">329</span>
<p id="p_575">    Learned  counsel for the petitioner contends  -that	 the
impugned Act does not comply with even the bare requirements
of <a href="/doc/1262401/" id="a_1028">article 22 (4)</a> to (7).  It is pointed out that <a href="/doc/413354/" id="a_1029">section  3</a>
of  the Act does not lay down any objective test but  leaves
it  to the authority to define and say whether a  particular
person comes within the legislative heads.  In other  words,
it  is contended that Parliament has not legislated  at	 all
but  has delegated its legislative powers to  the  executive
authorities.  I do not think there is any substance in	this
contention.  In the first place this is not an objection  as
to procedure but to substantive law which is not open to the
Court's	 scrutiny.  In the next place this contention  over-
looks the basic distinction between the delegation of  power
to  make  the  law and the conferring of  an  authority	 and
discretion as to its execution to be exercised under and  in
pursuance of the law.  The impugned Act has specifically set
forth  an ascertainable standard by which the conduct  of  a
particular person is to be judged by the detaining  authori-
ty.
</p><p id="p_576">    It	is  next urged that <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_1030">section 12</a> of the Act  does	 not
comply with the requirements of clause (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1031">article 22</a> for
two reasons, namely--
</p><p id="p_577">    (i)	 that clause (7) contemplates a law prescribing	 the
circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases
in which, a person may be detained for a period longer	than
three  months and then another law thereafter providing	 for
preventive detention for a period longer than three  months;
and
</p><p id="p_578">    (ii)  that under clause (7)	 Parliament  must  prescribe
both the circumstances under which, and the class or classes
of  cases  in which, a person may be detained for  a  period
longer than three months.
</p><p id="p_579">    As regards the first  point I do not see why  Parliament
must  make  two	 laws, one laying down	the  principles	 for
longer	detention and another for detention for such  longer
period.	  It may be that a State cannot provide	 for  longer
detention until Parliament
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_253">330</span>
has  made  the law, but I can see no reason  why  Parliament
cannot	do  both by the same Act.  In fact, clause  (4)	 (b)
contemplates  the detention itself to be in accordance	with
the  provisions	 of any law made by  Parliament	 under	sub-
clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). Therefore, the  detention
can  well be under the very law which the  Parliament  makes
under  sub-clauses  (a)	 and (b) of clause (7).	 As  to	 the
second	point the argument is that Parliament has a  discre-
tion under clause (7) to make a law and it is not obliged to
make  any law but when our Parliament chooses to make a	 law
it  must prescribe both the circumstances under	 which,	 and
the  class  or classes of cases in which, a  person  may  be
detained for a period longer than three months.	 I am unable
to  construe clause (7) (a) in the way suggested by  learned
counsel	 for  the petitioner.  It is an	 enabling  provision
empowering  Parliament to prescribe two things.	  Parliament
may prescribe either or both. H a father tells his  delicate
child  that he may play table tennis and badminton  but	 not
the  strenuous game of football, it obviously does not	mean
that tim child, if he chooses to play at all, must play both
table  tennis and badminton.  It is an option given  to	 the
child.	 Likewise, the Constitution gives to Parliament	 the
power  of prescribing two things. Parliament is not  obliged
to  prescribe at all but if it chooses to prescribe  it	 may
prescribe either or both.   Clause 7 (a), in my opinion, has
to  be read distributively as follows:	The  Parliament	 may
prescribe  the	 circumstance  under which a person  may  be
detained  for a period longer than three months and  Parlia-
ment may prescribe the class or classes of cases in which  a
person	may  be	 detained for a	 period	 longer	 than  three
months. That appears to me to be consonant with sound  rules
of  construction.  Further, the circumstances and the  class
or  classes  of cases may conceivably coalesce.	 Indeed	 the
Full Bench case No. 1 of 1950 before the Calcutta High Court
(Kshitindra Narayan v. The Chief Secretary) itself indicates
that the same provision may be read as circumstances or as a
classification.	 In that case learned counsel conceded	that
<a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_1032">section	 12</a>  had prescribed the circumstances but  his	com-
plaint was that it had not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_254">331</span>
prescribed  the class or classes of cases. The	majority  of
the Court repelled this contention. One learned Judge howev-
er, held that <a href="/doc/1453729/" id="a_1033">section 12</a> had prescribed the class or classes
of  cases but had not prescribed the circumstances.  It	 is,
therefore, clear that the classification itself may indicate
the  circumstances.  Again, the classification may be  on  a
variety	 of  bases.  It may be according  to  provinces	 the
detenus	 come from.  It may be according to the age  of	 the
detenus. It may be according to the object they are supposed
to  have  in view or according to the  activities  they	 are
suspected  to  be engaged in.  In this case  Parliament	 has
taken five out of the six legislative heads and divided them
into  two categories.  The detenus are thus  classified	 ac-
cording to their suspected object or activities	 endangering
the several matters specified in the section.  I do not	 see
why  classification  cannot be made on the  footing  of	 the
objectives of the detenus falling in some of the legislative
heads, for each legislative head has a specific	 connotation
well understood in law.	 If I am correct that there has been
a  classification then the fact that a person  falls  within
one  or the other class may well be the circumstances  under
which  he  may be detained for a period	 longer	 than  three
months.	  I  do not consider it right, as a matter  of	con-
struction, to read any further limitation in clause 7 (a) of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_1034">article 22.</a>  In my judgment Par]lament was not obliged under
clause (7) to prescribe both circumstances and classes,	 and
in any case has in fact and substance prescribed both.
    I  am  conscious  that a law made  by  Parliament  under
<a href="/doc/1659639/" id="a_1035">article	 22 (7)</a>will do away with the salutary  safeguard  of
the opinion of an advisory board.  But it must be remembered
that  our Constitution itself contemplates that	 in  certain
circumstances  or  for certain class or classes	 of  detenus
even  the advisory board may not be safe and it has  trusted
Parliament  to make a law for that purpose.  Our  preference
for an advisory board should not blind us to this aspect  of
the matter.  It is true that circumstances ordinarily relate
to extraneous things, like riots, commotion,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_255">332</span>
political or communal or some sort of abnormal situation and
it is said that the framers of the Constitution had in	mind
some  such situation when the advisory board might  be	done
away with.  It is also urged that they had in mind that	 the
more dangerous types of detenus should be denied the  privi-
lege  of  the  advisory board.	I am free  to  confess	that
prescription  of specific circumstances or a more rigid	 and
definite specification of classes would have been better and
more  desirable.   But	that is crying for  the	 ideal.	 The
Constitution  has  not in terms put any such  limitation  as
regards	 the circumstances or the class or classes of  cases
and  it	 is  idle to speculate as to the  intention  of	 the
Constitution-makers,  who, by the way, are the very  persons
who made this law.  It is not for the Court to improve	upon
or add to the Constitution. If the law duly made by  Parlia-
ment is repugnant to good sense, public opinion will  compel
Parliament to alter it suitably.
</p><p id="p_580">    Finally,  an objection is taken that <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_1036">section 14</a>  of	 the
impugned Act takes away or abridges the right of the  detenu
to move this Court by appropriate proceedings.	Both clauses
(1)  and  (2) of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1037">article 32</a> speak of enforcement  of  rights
conferred by Part III. The right to move this Court is given
to  a person not for the sake of moving only but for  moving
the  Court for the enforcement of some rights  conferred  by
Part III and this Court has been given power to issue direc-
tions or orders or writs for the enforcement of any of	such
rights.	 In order, therefore, to attract the application  of
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1038">article	 32</a>, the person applying must first satisfy that  he
has  got  a right under Part III which has  to	be  enforced
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1039">article 32.</a>  I have already said that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1040">article 19</a>	does
not  deal with the freedom of the person. I have  also	said
that articles 21 and 22 provide for protection by  insisting
on  some  procedure.   Under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_1041">article 22	 (5)</a>  the  authority
making	the order of detention is enjoined, as soon  as	 may
be,  to communicate to the detenu the grounds on which	that
order has been made. This provision has some purpose,  name-
ly,  that  the	disclosure of the grounds  will	 afford	 the
detenu the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_256">333</span>
opportunity  of making a representation against	 the  order.
Supposing the authority does not give any grounds at all  as
distinct from facts referred to in Clause (6).	Surely,	 the
detenu	loses  a fundamental right because he  is  prevented
from  making a representation against the order.  of  deten-
tion.	Suppose	 the authority hands over to  the  detenu  a
piece  of  paper with some scribblings on it  which  do	 not
amount	to any ground at all for detention.  Then  also	 the
detenu	can  legitimately complain that his right  has	been
infringed.   He	 can then come to the Court to	get  redress
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1042">article 32</a>, but he cannot show to the Court the  piece
of paper with the scribblings on it under <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_1043">section 14</a> of	 the
Act  and the Court cannot judge whether he has actually	 got
the  grounds which he is entitled to under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_1044">article  22	(5).</a>
In.  such a case the detenu may well complain that both	 his
substantive right under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_1045">article 22 (5)'</a> as well as his right
to  constitutional remedies under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1046">article 32</a> have  been	 in-
fringed.   He can complain of infringement of  his  remedial
rights	under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1047">article 32</a>, because he cannot show that  there
has  been  an infringement of his  substantive	right  under
<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_1048">article	 22 (5).</a>  It appears to me, therefore, that  <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_1049">section
14</a>  of	the  Act in so far as it prevents  the	detenu	from
disclosing  to the Court the grounds communicated to him  is
not in conformity with Part III of the Constitution and	 is,
therefore, void under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_1050">article 13 (2).</a>  That section,  howev-
er,  is clearly severable and cannot affect the	 whole	Act.
On  this question the views of Meredith C.J. and Das  J.  of
Patna in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 124 of 1950 (Lalit Kumar
Barman v. The State) and the majority of the learned  Judges
of the Calcutta High Court in Full Bench Case No. 1 of	1950
(Kshitindra  Narayan  v. The Chief Secretary) appear  to  be
correct and sound.
</p><p id="p_581">    For	 the reasons I have given above, in my opinion,	 the
impugned  Act is a valid law except as to <a href="/doc/5353/" id="a_1051">section 14</a>  in  so
far as it prevents the grounds being disclosed to the Court.
The  petitioner before us does not complain that he has	 not
got  proper grounds.  Further, the period of  his  detention
under the impugned Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_257">334</span>
has not gone beyond three months and, in the  circumstances,
this  application  should, in my opinion,  stand  dismissed.
