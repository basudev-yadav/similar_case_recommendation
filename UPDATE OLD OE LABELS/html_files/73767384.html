VIBHU BAKHRU, J.

</pre><p id="p_1">1.     The Assessee has filed the present appeal under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Section 260A</a> of the

Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereafter 'the Act') impugning the order dated 22 nd

March, 2013 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereafter

'Tribunal') in ITA No. 6286/Del/2012. The Assessee had preferred the

aforesaid appeal before the Tribunal, impugning the assessment order passed

by the Assessing Officer (hereafter 'AO') making the Transfer Pricing

Adjustments (hereafter 'TP Adjustments') in respect of the Assessment Year

(hereafter 'AY') 2008-09 as finalised by the Transfer Pricing Officer



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ITA 102/2015                                                  Page 1 of 42</span>
 (hereafter 'TPO') pursuant to the directions issued by the Dispute

Resolution Panel (hereafter 'DRP').
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.     The Assessee is, essentially, aggrieved by the TP Adjustments made

in respect of the consideration for the services rendered by the Assessee to

its overseas holding company. The TP Adjustments have been made on the

basis of the average operating profit margin (operating profit as a percentage

of operating costs) declared by other companies - eight in number - selected

as comparables for the purposes of ascertaining the Arm's Length Price

(hereafter 'ALP'). According to the Assessee, two of the companies chosen

as comparable by the concerned authority, namely, Vishal Information

Technology Ltd. (hereafter 'Vishal') and eClerx Services Ltd. (hereafter

'eClerx') could not be considered as comparables as the functions performed

and the services rendered by the said companies were materially different

from those performed by the Assessee.

               of Rule l0B (2) of the Rules in respect of the analysis of
               functionally comparable companies?
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">4.     The factual context in which the aforesaid questions of law arise are

briefly stated as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">

4.1    The Assessee is a wholly owned subsidiary of vCustomer, USA, (an

Associated Enterprise - hereafter 'AE'). The Assessee is engaged in

providing voice-based customer care to the AE's clients. The Assessee

renders Call Center services, which fall within the broad description of

Information Technology Enables Services (hereafter 'ITeS'). The Assessee

has two units registered under the Software Technology Park Scheme of the

Government of India, which are located at New Delhi and Pune. The

Assessee is remunerated for the voice call services on cost plus basis. The

Assessee explained that the AE undertakes all activities such as marketing

and enters into contracts with its customers seeking voice call services. The

AE bears all the business risks and the Assessee only acts as an offshore

service provider to the customers of the AE. In consideration for the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">ITA 102/2015                                                      Page 3 of 42</span>
 services, the AE remunerates the Assessee by payment of all costs incurred

by the Assessee plus a mark up of fifteen percent of the costs.



4.2    During the previous year, relevant to the AY 2008-09, the Assessee

received an amount of Rs. 91,73,94,525/- for voice-based call center

services. The Assessee sought to justify the consideration received for the

international transactions entered into with the AE to be at ALP. The

Assessee submitted a Transfer Pricing Report adopting operating profit

margin as the Profit Level Indicator (hereafter 'PLI') for the transfer pricing

studies. The Assessee applied the Transactional Net Margin Method

(hereafter 'TNMM'), which was considered to be the most appropriate

method for the purposes of benchmarking the international transaction. The

Assessee's operating profit margin (i.e. operating profit/total cost) was

computed at 14.83% and the Assessee claimed that the same was

comparable with other companies rendering voice call services. For the

purposes of the transfer pricing study, the Assessee chose eight comparable

entities and the arithmetic average of the operating profit margins of the said

comparables was computed 15.74%. According to the Assessee, its PLI was

within the acceptable range as indicated under the second proviso to Section




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">ITA 102/2015                                                      Page 4 of 42</span>
 92C. The Assessee further claimed that the PLI was liable to be adjusted on

account of (i) working capital provided to the Assessee by the AE and (ii)

the risks of the business borne by the AE.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.     The AO referred the matter to the TPO. The TPO, by an order dated

19th October, 2011, passed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">section 92CA(3)</a> of the Act, computed the

TP Adjustment at Rs. 11,00,35,400/- (Rupees Eleven Crore Thirty Five

Thousand and Four Hundred). The TPO accepted the method adopted by the

Assessee (i.e. TNMM), but rejected the benchmarking report. The TPO also

rejected the Assessee's claim for any adjustment on account of working

capital provided to the Assessee and/or risks borne by the AE. The TPO

proceeded to identify a different set of comparable companies for the

purposes of determining the ALP. The companies selected by the TPO

which were considered to be comparables included eClerx and Vishal

(subsequently known as Coral Hub Ltd.). The TPO computed the average

operating profit margin of the comparable companies at 28.96% on the basis

of the average operating profit margin of eleven companies selected by the

TPO as comparables for the purposes of benchmarking the international

transactions. On the aforesaid basis, the TPO computed the TP Adjustment




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">ITA 102/2015                                                  Page 5 of 42</span>
 at Rs. 11,00,35,400/-. The AO incorporated the aforesaid adjustment in the

draft assessment order passed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">Section 144C(1)</a> of the Act on 20th

December, 2011. The Assessee objected to the draft assessment order dated

20th December, 2011 before the DRP. The Assessee impugned the draft

assessment order on several grounds including selection of certain

companies as comparables and exclusion of other companies considered as

appropriate comparables by the Assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.     The DRP accepted the Assessee's contention with respect to certain

companies, which were considered as comparables by the TPO and directed

that the said companies be excluded for the purposes of determining the (i.e.

average operating profit margin). However, the Assessee's contentions with

regard to the exclusion of Vishal and eClerx were rejected by the DRP. The

DRP held that these companies were also providing Information Technology

Enabled Services (ITeS) and, thus, could be used as comparables. Insofar as

eClerx is concerned, the DRP held that although there were functional

dissimilarities, the same were not significant enough to warrant a rejection

of the said company as a comparable. With respect to Vishal, the DRP held

that the difference in business model of Vishal would not materially affect




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">ITA 102/2015                                                    Page 6 of 42</span>
 the profit margin and thus, there was no infirmity with the TPO's decision to

include the said company as a comparable in its report.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">7.     The TPO recomputed the TP Adjustment in terms of the directions

issued by the DRP and computed the TP Adjustment at Rs. 5,92,07,428/-.

The AO also made certain additions on account of excess deduction claimed

under <a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_4">Section 10A</a> of the Act and disallowance under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_5">Section 14A</a> of the

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">8.     The Assessee appealed against the final assessment order dated 9 th

October, 2012, inter alia, on the ground that eClerx and Vishal could not be

considered as comparable entities for the purpose of calculating the

benchmark operating profit margin. The Assessee claimed that the said

companies were engaged in the business of Knowledge Process Outsourcing

(hereafter 'KPO') and, thus, could not be included as comparables for the

purposes of benchmarking studies. According to the Assessee, although

KPO services were ITeS but the nature of the said services was materially

different from the services rendered by the Assessee. It was asserted that

eClerx is engaged in financial services in the nature of account




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">ITA 102/2015                                                    Page 7 of 42</span>
 reconciliation, trade order management services and has been rated as a

leading KPO by Nelso Hall. It was contended that similarly Vishal was

engaged in the services of data analytics and providing data processing

solutions to some of the largest brands in the world. Vishal too had been

rated as a leading KPO by Nelso Hall. In addition, it was pointed out that

whilst the employee costs incurred by Vishal was relatively low and

constituted only 4.39% of its total cost during the relevant year, the hire

charges, vendor payments constituted almost 87% of the total costs.

According to the Assessee, this evidenced that Vishal's business model was

different and Vishal had outsourced significant part of its operations.



</p><p id="p_16">9.     The Tribunal rejected the Assessee's contention and held that both

eClerx and Vishal were engaged in providing ITeS and once a service fell

within that category then no sub-classification of the segment was

permissible. The Tribunal held that KPO is a term given to the branch of

BPO Services where apart from processing of data, knowledge is also

applied. The Assessee's objection that the said two companies had

abnormally high profits and thus ought to be excluded as comparables was

also rejected.

<p id="p_17">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">ITA 102/2015                                                      Page 8 of 42</span>
</p><p id="p_18"> 10.    The learned counsel for the Assessee submitted that eClerx and Vishal

were KPO service providers and could not be considered as comparables for

the purposes of benchmarking the Assessee's international transactions with

the AE. The learned counsel referred to the decision of the Special Bench of

the Tribunal in Maersk Global Centers (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT, ITA

7466/Mum/2012, dated 7th March, 2014 and submitted that the issue of

whether Vishal and eClerx could be used as comparables was decided in

favour of the Assessee.

<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">11.    We have heard the counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">12.    At the outset, it is necessary to bear in mind that the object and

purpose of introducing provisions relating to transfer pricing adjustment in

the Act. By virtue of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_6">Finance Act</a>, 2001, <a href="/doc/1942568/" id="a_7">Section 92</a> of the Act was

substituted by <a href="/doc/1942568/" id="a_8">Sections 92</a> to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">92F</a> of the Act with effect from 1 st April, 2002.

<a href="/doc/1942568/" id="a_10">Section 92</a> of the Act, as was in force prior to 1 st April, 2002, enabled the

AO to bring the correct profits to tax in relation to certain cross-border

transactions. However, with a large number of multi-national companies

establishing operations in India, either through their subsidiaries or through

other related ventures, a need was felt to provide a statutory framework to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">ITA 102/2015                                                     Page 9 of 42</span>
 ensure that there is no avoidance of tax by transfer of income from India to

other tax jurisdictions. Circular no. 14 of 2001 issued by the CBDT indicates

that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1942568/" id="a_11">Section 92</a> to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">92F</a> of the Act were introduced "With a

view to provide a detailed statutory framework which can lead to

computation of reasonable, fair and equitable profits and tax in India".



</p><p id="p_23">13.    The heading of Chapter X also clearly indicates that it contains

"special provisions relating to avoidance of tax". The object of Chapter X

of the Act is not to tax any notional income but to ensure that the real

income is brought to tax under the Act. This has also been explained by a

Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/175175391/" id="a_13">Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications

India Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. v. Commissioner of Income Tax-III and Ors</a>. 374

ITR 118 in the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         "77. As a concept and principle Chapter X does not
         artificially broaden, expand or deviate from the concept of
         "real income". "Real income", as held by the Supreme Court
         in Poona Electricity Supply Company Limited versus CIT, :
         [1965] 57 ITR 521 (SC), means profits arrived at on
         commercial principles, subject to the provisions of the Act.
         Profits and gains should be true and correct profits and gains,
         neither under nor over stated. Arm's length price seeks to
         correct distortion and shifting of profits to tax the actual
         income earned by a resident/domestic AE. The profit which
         would have accrued had arm's length conditions prevailed is
         brought to tax. Misreporting, if any, on account of non-arm's




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">ITA 102/2015                                                      Page 10 of 42</span>
          length conditions resulting in lower profits, is corrected."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_24">14.     The substratal rationale of the transfer pricing regulations is to ensure

that the true income of an Assessee is brought to tax under the Act and there

is no avoidance of tax by transfer of income from India to any other tax

jurisdiction by virtue of the influence exercised by the associated

enterprises. The aim of the provisions of Chapter X of the Act is to compute

the income in relation to a controlled transaction between an Assessee and

its associated enterprise having regard to ALP, in order to nullify the effect

of transfer of income to a jurisdiction outside India, if any, in respect of the

controlled transactions.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">15.    The exercise of determining the ALP in respect of international

transactions between the related enterprises is aimed to determine the price,

which would have been charged for products and services, as nearly as

possible, in case such international transactions were not controlled by virtue

of them being executed between related parties. The object of the exercise

is, thus, to remove the effect of any influence on the prices or costs that may

have been exerted on account of the international transactions being entered

into between related parties. It is, at once, clear that for the exercise of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">ITA 102/2015                                                       Page 11 of 42</span>

transactions be compared with uncontrolled transactions which are similar in

all material aspects.

controlled transaction, it would be essential to ensure that the instances of

uncontrolled entities/transactions selected as comparables are similar in all

material aspects that have any bearing on the value or the profitability, as the

case may be, of the transaction. Any factor, which has an influence on the

entities; the value addition in respect of products and services provided by

parties; the business model; and the assets and resources employed. It cannot

be disputed that the functions performed by an entity would have a material

bearing on the value and profitability of the entity. It is, therefore, obvious

that the comparables selected and the tested party must be functionally

similar for ascertaining a reliable ALP by TNMM. Rule 10B(2) of the

Income Tax Rules, 1962 also clearly indicates that the comparability of

controlled transactions would be judged with reference to the factors as

indicated therein. Clause (a) and (b) of Rule 10B(2) expressly indicate that

benchmarking international transactions entered into by an entity rendering

voice call services - such as the Assessee -with its associated enterprise by

using TNMM and taking operating profit margin as the PLI .

<p id="p_38">23.    In this case, the Tribunal noted that eClerx was engaged in data

 were functionally similar to those of eClerx. The Tribunal concluded that

voice call services and KPO services were essentially ITeS and, therefore,

entities rendering the aforesaid services could be considered as comparables

for the purpose of benchmarking international transactions by using TNMM.

The Tribunal held that further sub-division of ITeS was not permissible. The

Tribunal followed its earlier decision in Willis Processing Services (I) (P.)

<p id="p_42">25.    Whilst Voice Call Center represents the lower-end of ITeS, KPO

represents services involving a higher level of skills and knowledge. India

has vast human resources and a large number of highly-skilled technical

professionals. The expression "KPO" indicates the involvement of domain

knowledge in providing ITeS. Typically, KPO includes involvement of

advance skills; the services provided may include analytical services, market

research, legal research, engineering and design services, intellectual

management etc. On the other hand, Voice Call Centers are normally

involved in customer support and processing of routine data. In the case of

Maersk Global Centers (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT (supra) a Special Bench

of the Tribunal had referred to a report prepared by National Skill

Development Corporation (NSDC) on Human Resource and Skill

Requirements in IT and ITES Sector (2022) and noted that the KPO sector

 has been described as "a value play". The said report also indicates that

KPO services are likely to span activities such as "patent advisory, high-end

research and analytics, online market research and legal advisory".

and to generate further employment opportunities. In terms of the said

scheme, "Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)" is defined to mean "the

transfer of an organization's entire non-core but critical business

process/function to an external centre which uses an IT-based service

delivery" and "Knowledge Processing Outsourcing (KPO)" has been

defined to mean "allocation of relatively high-level tasks to an outside

Outsourcing (BPO)".

Center services for customer support and a KPO service provider may be

employing IT-based delivery systems, the characteristics of services, the

functional aspects, business environment, risks and the quality of human

resource employed would be materially different. It plainly follows that

benchmarking international transactions on the basis of comparing the PLI

of high-end KPO service providers with the PLI of Voice Call Centers

would be unreliable and possibly flawed.

 Paragraph 1.36 of the "OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational

Enterprises and Tax Administrations" published in 2010 (hereafter 'OECD

considering the comparability of uncontrolled transactions/entities with the

controlled transactions/entities. Sub-rule (2) of rule 10B of the Income Tax

Rules, 1962 also mandates that the comparability of international

transactions with uncontrolled transactions would be judged with reference

to the factors indicated under clauses (a) to (d) of that sub-rule, which are

similar to the comparability factors as indicated under the OECD

Guidelines. These include characteristics of property or services transferred

and functions performed. The relevant extract from the OECD Guidelines

           1.39 Differences in the specific characteristics of property
           or services often account, at least in part, for differences
           in their value in the open market. Therefore, comparisons
           of these features may be useful in determining the
           comparability of controlled and uncontrolled transactions.
           Characteristics that may be important to consider include
           the following: in the case of transfers of tangible
           property, the physical features of the property, its quality
           and reliability, and the availability and volume of supply;
           in the case of the provision of services, the nature and
           extent of the services; and in the case of intangible
           property, the form of transaction (e.g. licensing or sale),
           the type of property (e.g. patent, trademark, or know-
           how), the duration and degree of protection, and the
           anticipated benefits from the use of the property.
           1.40 Depending on the transfer pricing method, this factor
           must be given more or less weight. Among the methods
           described at Chapter II of these Guidelines, the
           requirement for comparability of property or services is
           the strictest for the comparable uncontrolled price
           method. Under the comparable uncontrolled price
           method, any material difference in the characteristics of
           property or services can have an effect on the price and
           would require an appropriate adjustment to be considered
           (see in particular paragraph 2.15). Under the resale price
           method and cost plus method, some differences in the
           characteristics of property or services are less likely to
           have a material effect on the gross profit margin or mark-
           up on costs (see in particular paragraphs 2.23 and 2.41).
           Differences in the characteristics of property or services
           are also less sensitive in the case of the transactional
           profit methods than in the case of traditional transaction
           methods (see in particular paragraph 2.69). This however



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">ITA 102/2015                                                       Page 27 of 42</span>
            does not mean that the question of comparability in
           characteristics of property or services can be ignored
           when applying these methods, because it may be that
           product differences entail or reflect different functions
           performed, assets used and/or risks assumed by the tested
           party. See paragraphs 3.18-3.19 for a discussion of the
           notion of tested party.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_60">           1.41 In practice, it has been observed that comparability
           analyses for methods based on gross or net profit
           indicators often put more emphasis on functional
           similarities than on product similarities. Depending on the
           facts and circumstances of the case, it may be acceptable
           to broaden the scope of the comparability analysis to
           include uncontrolled transactions involving products that
           are different, but where similar functions are undertaken.
           However, the acceptance of such an approach depends on
           the effects that the product differences have on the
           reliability of the comparison and on whether or not more
           reliable data are available. Before broadening the search
           to include a larger number of potentially comparable
           uncontrolled transactions based on similar functions
           being undertaken, thought should be given to whether
           such transactions are likely to offer reliable comparables
           for the controlled transaction.

           advertising, transportation, financing and management.
           The principal functions performed by the party under

           made for any material differences from the functions

           that party is being compared. While one party may
           provide a large number of functions relative to that of the
           other party to the transaction, it is the economic
           significance of those functions in terms of their

both engaged in rendering ITeS. The Tribunal held that, "once a service

falls under the category of ITeS, then there is no sub-classification of

segment". Thus, according to the Tribunal, no differentiation could be made

between the entities rendering ITeS. We find it difficult to accept this view

as it is contrary to the fundamental rationale of determining ALP by

comparing controlled transactions/entities with similar uncontrolled

transactions/entities. ITeS encompasses a wide spectrum of services that use

Information Technology based delivery. Such services could include

rendering highly technical services by qualified technical personnel,

 involving advanced skills and knowledge, such as engineering, design and

support. While, on the other end of the spectrum ITeS would also include

voice-based call centers that render routine customer support for their

clients. Clearly, characteristics of the service rendered would be dissimilar.

Further, both service providers cannot be considered to be functionally

similar. Their business environment would be entirely different, the demand

and supply for the services would be different, the assets and capital

employed would differ, the competence required to operate the two services

would be different. Each of the aforesaid factors would have a material

bearing on the profitability of the two entities. Treating the said entities to

be comparables only for the reason that they use Information Technology for

the delivery of their services, would, in our opinion, be erroneous.

difficult to classify services strictly as falling under the category of either a

BPO or a KPO. The Tribunal also observed that one of the key success

factors of the BPO Industry is its ability to move up the value chain through

KPO service offering. For the aforesaid reasons, the Special Bench of the

Tribunal held that ITeS Services could not be bifurcated as BPO and KPO

Services for the purpose of comparability analysis in the first instance. The

Tribunal proceeded to hold that a relatively equal degree of comparability

can be achieved by selecting potential comparables on a broad functional

analysis at ITeS level and that the comparables so selected could be put to

further test by comparing specific functions performed in the international

Global Centers (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra). As indicated above, the expression

'BPO' and 'KPO' are, plainly, understood in the sense that whereas, BPO

does not necessarily involve advanced skills and knowledge; KPO, on the

other hand, would involve employment of advanced skills and knowledge

for providing services. Thus, the expression 'KPO' in common parlance is

used to indicate an ITeS provider providing a completely different nature of

service than any other BPO service provider. A KPO service provider would

also be functionally different from other BPO service providers, inasmuch as

the responsibilities undertaken, the activities performed, the quality of

resources employed would be materially different. In the circumstances, we

are unable to agree that broadly ITeS sector can be used for selecting

comparables without making a conscious selection as to the quality and

nature of the content of services. Rule 10B(2)(a) of the Income Tax Rules,

1962 mandates that the comparability of controlled and uncontrolled

transactions be judged with reference to service/product characteristics. This




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">ITA 102/2015                                                     Page 33 of 42</span>
 factor cannot be undermined by using a broad classification of ITeS which

takes within its fold various types of services with completely different

content and value. Thus, where the tested party is not a KPO service

provider, an entity rendering KPO services cannot be considered as a

comparable for the purposes of Transfer Pricing analysis. The perception

that a BPO service provider may have the ability to move up the value chain

by offering KPO services cannot be a ground for assessing the transactions

relating to services rendered by the BPO service provider by benchmarking

it with the transactions of KPO services providers. The object is to ascertain

the ALP of the service rendered and not of a service (higher in value chain)

that may possibly be rendered subsequently.

Global Centers (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra), there may be cases where an entity

may be rendering a mix of services some of which may be functionally

comparable to a KPO while other services may not. In such cases a

classification of BPO and KPO may not be feasible. Clearly, no straitjacket

formula can be applied. In cases where the categorization of services

found to be materially dissimilar in aspects and features that have a bearing

on the profitability of those entities. However, where the controlled

transactions are clearly in the nature of lower-end ITeS such as Call Centers

inclusion of any KPO service provider as a comparable would not be

warranted and the transfer pricing study must take that into account at the

 once again clear that both Vishal and eClerx could not be taken as

comparables for determining the ALP. Vishal and eClerx, both are into KPO

Services. In Maersk Global Centers (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Special

Bench of the Tribunal had noted that eClerx is engaged in data analytics,

data processing services, pricing analytics, bundling optimization, content

operation, sales and marketing support, product data management, revenue

management. In addition, eClerx also offered financial services such as

real-time capital markets, middle and back-office support, portfolio risk

management services and various critical data management services.

Clearly, the aforesaid services are not comparable with the services rendered

by the Assessee. Further, the functions undertaken (i.e. the activities

performed) are also not comparable with the Assessee. In our view, the

Tribunal erred in holding that the functions performed by the Assessee were

broadly similar to that of eClerx or Vishal. The operating margin of eClerx,

thus, could not be included to arrive at an ALP of controlled transactions,

which were materially different in its content and value. In Maersk Global

Centers (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Special Bench of the Tribunal had

noted the same and had, thus, excluded eClerx as a comparable. It is further

observed that the comparability of eClerx had also been examined by the

admittedly, its business model was completely different. Admittedly,

Vishal's expenditure on employment cost during the relevant period was a

small fraction of the proportionate cost incurred by the Assessee, apparently,

for the reason that most of its work was outsourced to other vendors/service

providers. The DRP and the Tribunal erred in brushing aside this vital

difference by observing that outsourcing was common in ITeS industry and

the same would not have a bearing on profitability. Plainly, a business

model where services are rendered by employing own employees and using

one's own infrastructure would have a different cost structure as compared

to a business model where services are outsourced. There was no material

for the Tribunal to conclude that the outsourcing of services by Vishal

would have no bearing on the profitability of the said entity.

below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">          "... that it had a very low employment cost and very high
          cost on account of venture payment, which suggested that its

          view of this functional difference, Vishal Ltd. could not be
          considered as a comparable."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_65">40.    The Assessee had also sought the exclusion of eClerx and Vishal on

the ground that both the companies had returned supernormal profits.

Whereas the operating margins (operating margin over total cost) in case of

Vishal and eClerx were 50.68% and 65.88% respectively, the PLIs of all

other comparables were in the range of 2.2% to 24%. In our view, it would

not be apposite to exclude comparables only for the reason that their profits

are high, as the same is not provided for in the statutory framework. The

OECD Guidelines suggest that a quartile method be adopted which excludes

entities that fall in the extreme quartiles for comparability. However, neither

Chapter X of the Act nor the Rules made by CBDT provide for exclusion for

such statistical reason.

supernormal profits may in certain cases indicate a functional dissimilarity

or dissimilarity with respect to a feature that has a material bearing on the

profitability. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to undertake

further analysis to eliminate the possibility of the high profits resulting on

account of any material dissimilarity between the tested party and the chosen

comparable. A wide deviation in the PLI amongst selected comparables

could be indicative that the comparables selected are either materially

dissimilar or the data used is not reliable. The Tribunal proceeded on the

basis that an adjustment could be made only in cases where supernormal

profits resulted from the factors indicated in Rule 10B of the Income Tax

Rules, 1962. In our view, the factors mentioned in Rule 10B are not

exhaustive. The principal object of benchmarking international transactions

against uncontrolled transactions is to impute an ALP to those transactions.

This exercise would fail if a factor, which has a material bearing on the

value or the profitability, as the case may be, depending on the method used,

is ignored.

 consideration. The Tribunal proceeded on the basis that while applying

TNMM method, broad functionality is sufficient and it is not necessary that

further effort be taken to find a comparable entity rendering services of

similar characteristics as the tested entity.    The DRP held that TNMM

allows flexibility and tolerance in selection of comparables, as functional

dissimilarities are subsumed at net margin levels, as compared to Resale

Price Method or Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method and, therefore, the

functional dissimilarities pointed out by the Assessee did not warrant

rejection of eClerx and Vishal as comparables.

identifying comparable transactions/entities is concerned, the same would

not differ irrespective of the transfer pricing method adopted. In other

words, the comparable transactions/entities must be selected on the basis of

similarity with the controlled transaction/entity. Comparability of controlled

and uncontrolled transactions has to be judged, inter alia, with reference to

comparability factors as indicated under rule 10B(2) of the Income Tax

Rules, 1962. Comparability analysis by TNMM method may be less

sensitive to certain dissimilarities between the tested party and the

 comparables. However, that cannot be the consideration for diluting the

standards of selecting comparable transactions/entities. A higher product

and functional similarity would strengthen the efficacy of the method in

ascertaining a reliable ALP. Therefore, as far as possible, the comparables

must be selected keeping in view the comparability factors as specified.

Wide deviations in PLI must trigger further investigations/analysis.

the significant activities undertaken, the assets or resources used/consumed,

the risks assumed. Thus, comparison of activities undertaken/functions

performed is important for determining the comparability between

controlled and uncontrolled transactions/entity. It would not be apposite to

ignore functional dissimilarity only for the reason that its impact may be

reduced on account of using arithmetical mean of the PLI. The DRP had

noted that eClerx was functionally dissimilar, but ignored the same relying

on an assumption that the functional dissimilarity would be subsumed in the

profit margin. As noted, the content of services provided by the Assessee

and the entities in question were not similar. In addition, there were also
