HEADNOTE:
On  July  19,  1964, the Acting	 President  promulgated,  in
exercise of the power conferred by cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_18">Article 123</a> of
the  Constitution, Ordinance 8 of 1969, transferring to	 and
vesting the undertaking of 14 named Commercial Banks,  which
held  deposits of not less than rupees fifty crores, in	 the
corresponding	new  Banks  set	 up  under  the	  Ordinance.
Petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Ordinance
were  lodged  in  this Court, but  before  they	 were  heard
Parliament  enacted the Banking Companies  (Acquisition	 and
<a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_19">Transfer of Undertakings) Act</a>, 1969.  The object of the	 Act
was  to	 provide  for the acquisition and  transfer  of	 the
Undertakings of certain banking companies in order to  serve
better the needs of development of the economy in conformity
with  the  national policy and _objectives and	for  matters
connected therewith or incidental
531
thereto.  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_20">The Act</a> repealed the Ordinance and came into force
on  July 19, 1969, i.e., the day on which the Ordinance	 was
promulgated,  and the Undertaking of every named  Bank	with
all  its  rights, liabilities and assets  was  deemed,	with
effect	from that date, to have vested in the  corresponding
new bank.  By<a href="/doc/470751/" id="a_21"> s. 15(2)</a> (e), the named Banks were entitled to
engage in business other than banking which by virtue of <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_22"> s.
6(1)</a>  of  the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,  they  were	 not
prohibited  from carrying on.  <a href="/doc/1309466/" id="a_23">Section 6</a> read with  Schedule
11  provided  for and prescribed the method  of	 determining
compensation	for   acquisition   of	 the	undertaking.
Compensation to be determined was for the acquisition of the
undertaking  as a unit and by <a href="/doc/1089724/" id="a_24">section 6(2)</a>, though  separate
valuation  had to be made in respect of the several  matters
specified  in  Schedule	 11  of	 the  Act,  the	 amount	  of
compensation  was to be deemed to be a single  compensation.
Under Schedule 11 the compensation payable was to be the sum
-total	of  the value of the assets under the heads  (a)  to
(h), calculated in accordance with the provisions of Part  I
less  the  sum	total of  the  liabilities  and	 obligations
calculated  in	accordance with the provisions of  Part	 11.
The  corresponding new Banks took over vacant possession  of
the lands and buildings of the named Banks.  By	 Explanation
I to cl. (e) of Part I of Schedule It the value of any	land
or  building to be taken into account in valuing the  assets
was  to	 be  the  market  value	 or  the  ascertained  value
whichever  was	less; by Explanation 2 cl.  (1)	 ascertained
value"' in respect of buildings wholly occupied on the	date
of  the commencement of the Act was to be twelve  times	 the
amount	of  annual rent or the rent for which  the  building
could  reasonably  be expected to be let out  from  year  to
year, reduced by certain deductions for maintenance, repairs
etc.; under cl. (3) of Explanation 2 the value of open	land
with no building thereon or which was not appurtenant to any
building was to be determined with reference to the price at
which sale or purchase of comparable'lands were made  during
the   period  of  three	 years	immediately  preceding	 the
commencement  of  the  Act.   The  compensation	 was  to  be
determine(1), in the absence of agreement, by a tribunal and
paid in securities which would mature not before ten years.
The  petitioner held shares in some of the named Banks,	 had
accounts. current and fixed deposit, in these Banks and	 was
also  a Director of one of the Banks.  In  petitions  'under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_25">Article 32</a> of the Constitution he challenged the validity of
the Ordinance and the Act on the following principal grounds
(i)  the   Ordinance  was  invalid  because  the   condition
precedent to the exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_26">Article 23</a>	 did
not exist:
(ii) the  Act was not within the legislative  competence  of
Parliament,  because,  (a) to the extent to  which  the	 Act
vested in the corresponding new Banks the assets of business
other  than <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_27">Banking the Act</a> trenched upon the  authority  of
the  State  Legislature and (b) the power to  legislate	 for
acquisition of property in entry 42 List III did not include
the power to legislate for acquisition of an undertaking;
(iii)	  Articles  19(1)(f)  and  31(2)  are  not  mutually
	      exclusive and a law providing for	 acquisition
	      of  property  for a public  purpose  could  be
	      tested for its validity on the ground that  it
	      imposed  limitations on the right to  property
	      which  were not reasonable; so tested, the
	      provisions  of the Act which  transferred	 the
	      Undertaking of, the named Banks and prohibited
	      those  Banks  from  carrying  on	business  of
	      Banking  and practically prohibited them	from
	      carrying on non-banking busi-
532
ness, impaired the freedoms guaranteed by Articles 19(1) (f)
	      and (g);
(iv) the  provisions of the Act which prohibited  the  named
Banks  from  carrying on banking  business  and	 practically
prohibited  them  from	carrying  on  non-banking   business
violated  the  guarantee  of  equal  protection	 and   were,
therefore, discriminatory;
(v)  the  Act violated the guarantee of	 compensation  under
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_28">Article 31(2);
(vi)</a> the  Act  impaired the guarantee of 'freedom  of  trade
under <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_29">Article 301;</a> and
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_30">(vii)	  -</a>retrospective  operation given to Act 22 of	1969
was  ineffective  since	 there was  no	valid  Ordinance  in
existence  and	the  provision in  the	Act  retrospectively
validating   infringement  of  the  fundamental	 rights	  of
citizens was not within the competence of Parliament.
On behalf of the Union of India a preliminary objection	 was
raised that the petitions were not maintainable because,  no
fundamental right of the petitioner was directly impaired as
he  was	 not the owner of the property	of  the	 undertaking
taken over.
HELD   :   (Per	 Shah,	Sikri,	Shelat,	  Bhargva,   Mitter,
Vaidialingam Hegde, Grover, Reddy and Dua, JJ.)
1. The petitions were maintainable.
A  company  registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_31">Indian Companies Act</a>  is  a
legal  person,	separate and distinct  from  its  individual
members.  Hence a shareholder, a depositor or a director  is
not  entitled  to move a petition for  infringement  of	 the
rights	of  the company unless by the  action  impugned	 his
rights are also infringed.  But, if the State action impairs
the right of the share-holders as well as of the company the
Court  will  not, concentrating merely	upon  the  technical
operation  of the action deny itself jurisdiction  to  grant
relief.	  In  the -present case the petitioner's  claim	 was
that by the Act and the Ordinance the rights. guaranteed  to
him  under Articles 14, 19 and 31 of the  Constitution	were
impaired.   He thus challenged the infringement of  his	 own
rights and not of the Banks. [555 <a href="/doc/1799890/" id="a_32">G-556 H]

v. The Union of India" [1950] S.C.R. 869, referred to.
2.   (i)  Exercise of the power to promulgate  an  Ordinance
under  <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_35">Article	123</a>  is strictly  conditioned.	 The  clause
relating to the satisfaction is composite; the	satisfaction
relates to the existence of circumstances, as well as to the
necessity  to  take  immediate action on  account  of  those
circumstances.	 Determination	by  the	 President  of	 the
existence  of  circumstances  and  the	necessity  to	take
immediate  action on which the satisfaction depends, is	 not
declared final.
533
[Since the Act was declared invalid no opinion was expressed
on  the extent of the jurisdiction of the court	 to  examine
whether	 the  condition	 relating  to  satisfaction  of	 the
President was fulfilled.] [559 H-560 B; 561 G]
(ii) Act 22 of 1969 was within the legislative competence of
Parliament.
The competence of Parliament is not covered in its  entirety
by  entries 43 and 44 of List I of the Seventh Schedule.   A
law  regulating the business of a corporation is not  a	 law
with respect to regulation of a corporation. [563 B]
Parliament has exclusive power to legislate with respect  to
"Banking"  in  entry  54 List I. A  legislative	 entry	must
receive a meaning conducive to the widest amplitude  subject
to   limitations  inherent  in	the  federal  scheme   which
distributes  legislative  power between the  union  and	 the
constituent  units.  But, the field of "banking"  cannot  be
extended  to  include trading activities  which,  not  being
incidental  to banking, encroach upon the substance  of	 the
entry "trade and commerce" in entry 26 List II. It cannot be
said that all forms of business described in<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_36"> s. 6(1)</a> of	 the
Banking	 Regulation  Act,  1949, cls. (a)  to  (n)  are,  if
carried	 on in addition to banking as defined in<a href="/doc/199190/" id="a_37"> s. 5(b)</a>  of
the  Act,  banking,  and that  Parliament  is  competent  to
legislate  in respect that business under entry 54  List  I.
[565 D, 566 D]
The contention that Parliament was incompetent to  legislate
for  acquisition of the named Banks in so far as it  related
to  assets of the non-banking business had to fail  for	 two
reasons	 :  (a) there was no evidence that the	named  Banks
held  any assets for any distinct nonbanking  business,	 and
(b)  the acquisition was not shown to fall within any  entry
in List II of Seventh Schedule. [568E]
Power to legislate for acquisition of "Property" in entry 42
List III includes the power to legislate for acquisition  of
an undertaking.	 The expression "property" in entry 42, List
III, has a wide connotation and it includes not only assets,
but the Organisation, liabilities and obligations of a going
concern as a unit.  The expression "undertaking" in  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_38">section
4</a>  of  the Act clearly means a going concern  with  all	 its
rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the  various
rights	and  assets which compose it.  The  obligations	 and
liabilities  of	 the business form an integral part  of	 the
undertaking   and  for	compulsory  acquisition	 cannot	  be
divorced  from	the assets, -rights and privileges.   A	 law
could.	therefore, be enacted for compulsory acquisition  of
an undertaking as defined in<a href="/doc/199190/" id="a_39"> s. 5</a> of the Act. [568 B-D]
There was no satisfactory proof in support of the plea	that
the Act was not enacted in the larger interest of nation but
to  serve  political ends.  Whether by the exercise  of	 the
power  vested  in the Reserve Bank  under  the	pre-existing
laws,  results could be achieved which it was the object  of
the  Act to achieve was not relevant in considering  whether
the Act amounted to abuse of legislative power.	 This  court
has  the  power to strike down a law on ground	of  want  of
authority,  but	 the Court will not sit in appeal  over	 the
policy of the Parliament in enacting a law. [583 D, 584 H]
Commonwealth  of Australia v. Bank of New South Wales,	L.R.
[1950] A.C. 235 and <a href="/doc/286982/" id="a_40">Rajahmundry Electric Supply	 Corporation
Ltd. v. The State of Andhra</a>, [1954] S.C.R. 779, referred to.
(iii)	  (a)  Articles 19(1)(f) and 31(2) are not  mutually
exclusive.
534
Under  the  Constitution the extent  of	 protection  against
impairment  of a fundamental right is determined not by	 the
object of the legislature nor by the form of the action, but
by its direct operation upon the individual's tights. [576C]
In  this Court, there is, however. a body di authority	that
the  nature and extent of the protection of the	 fundamental
rights is measured not by the operation of the State  action
upon  the  rights  of  the individual  but  by	its  object.
Thereby the constitutional scheme which makes the guaranteed
rights subject to the permissible restrictions within  their
allotted field, fundamental, got blurred and gave impetus to
a  theory that certain Articles of the Constitution enact  a
Code dealing exclusively with matters dealt with therein and
the  protection	 which	an aggrieved  person  may  claim  is
circumscribed by the object of the State action.  The  deci-
sion in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_41">A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras</a>, [1950]  S.C.R.
88, given early in the history of the Court. has formed	 the
nucleus	 of  this  theory.   The  principle  underlying	 the
opinion	 of  the  majority in Gopalan was  extended  to	 the
protection of the freedom in respect of property and it	 was
held that <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_42">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_43">31(2)</a> were mutually exclusive in
their operation and that the substantive provisions of a law
relating  to acquisition of property were not liable  to  be
challenged  on	the ground that	 they  imposed	unreasonable
restrictions  on.  the	right to hold  property.   With	 the
decision in Kavalappara Kochuni v. State of Kerala, [1960] 3
S.C.R.	887, there arose two divergent lines of authority  :
(i)  "authority	 of law" in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_44">Art. 31 ( 1 )</a> is  liable  to  be
tested	on  the ground that it	violates  other	 fundamental
rights	and  freedoms including the right to  hold  property
guaranteed 'by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_45">Art. 19(1)(f);</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_46">(ii) "</a>authority of a	law"
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_47">Art. 3 1(2)</a> is not liable to be tested
on  the ground that it impairs the guarantee of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_48">Art. 19(  1)
(f</a>),  in  so  far as  it  imposed  substantive	restrictions
through	 it  may be tested on the ground  of  impairment  of
other  guarantees.  The expression "law" in the two  clauses
of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_49">Article 31</a> had, therefore, two different meanings.	[570
C-576 B]
The  theory  that the object and form of  the  State  action
determined the extent of the protection which the  aggrieved
party  may claim is not consistent with	 the  constitutional
scheme.	 Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_50">Art. 19</a> and cls. (1) &amp; (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_51">Art. 31</a>
prescribes  restrictions upon State action subject to  which
the right to property may be exercised.	 <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_52">Article 19(5)</a> is  a
broad generalisation dealing with the nature of	 limitations
which  may be placed by law on the 'right to property.	 The
guarantees,  under  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_53">Art.  31(1)</a>	 <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_54">&amp;  (2)</a>	 arise	out  of	 the
limitations  imposed on the authority of the State, by	law,
to take over the individual's property.	 The true  character
of   the  limitations  under  the  two	provisions  is	 not

which  may be placed by law subject to which the rights	 may
be  exercised.	 Limitations  prescribed  for  ensuring	 due
exercise  of the authority of the State to deprive a  person
of his property and of the power to compulsorily acquire his
property are, therefore, specific classes of limitations  on
the right to property falling within <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_60">Art. 19(1)(f).</a>  In	 the
Constitution  the enunciation of rights either expressly  or
by  implication does not follow a uniform pattern.  But	 one
thread	runs through them; they seek to protect the  'rights

infringement of those rights within specific limits.  [576E-

Formal compliance with the conditions under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_61">Article 31(2)</a> is
not  sufficient to negative the protection of the  guarantee
of the right to pro-
			    535
perty.	 The validity of "law" which authorises	 deprivation
of   property  and  a  "law"  which  authorises	  compulsory
acquisition  of	 property  for	a  public  purpose  must  be
adjudged by the application of the same tests.	 Acquisition
must  be  under the authority of a law	and  the  expression
'law"  means  a law which is within the	 competence  of	 the
legislature and does not impair the guarantee of the  rights
in  Part  III. if property is compulsorily  acquired  for  a
public	purpose and the law satisfies the  'requirements  of
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_62">Art.  31(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_63">31(2A</a>), the -court may presume that  by	 the
acquisition a reasonable restriction on the exercise of	 the
right  to hold' property is imposed in the interest  of	 the
general public.	 This is so, not because the claim to  plead
infringement  of the fundamental right under  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_64">Art.  19(1)(f)</a>
does not avail the owner; it is because the acquisition	 im-
poses  permissible restriction on the right of the owner  of
the, property compulsorily acquired. [577 H-578 D]

(b)  The law which prohibited, after July 19,  1969,the
named  Banks  from  carrying on banking	 business,  being  a
necessary incident of the right assumed by the Union,  could
not  be challenged because of <a href="/doc/588489/" id="a_74">Art.19(6)(ii)</a> in so far as  it
affected the right to carry on business. [583 C]
Clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_75">Art. 19</a> consists of two parts : (i) -the right
declared  by  sub-cl.  (g)  is	not  protected	against	 the
operation  of  any  law imposing, in the  interests  of	 the
general	 public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise  of
the  right  conferred  by  that	 sub-clause;  and  (ii)	  in
particular sub-cl. (g) does not affect the operation of. any
law relating inter alia, to carrying on by the State or by a
Corporation owned or controlled by the State, of any. trade,
business,  industry  or	 service whether  or  not  such	 law
provides   for	the  exclusion,	 complete  or  partial,	  of
citizens.   It	cannot	be  held  that	the  expression	 "in
particular"   used  in	cf.  (6)  is  intended'	 either	  to
particularise  or to illustrate the general law set  out  in
the  first limb of the clause and, therefore, is subject  to
the  enquiry whether it imposes reasonable  restrictions  on
the  exercise  of the right in the interest of	the  general
public.	 The rule enunciated by this Court in <a href="/doc/1258563/" id="a_76">Akadasi Padhan
v.  State of Orissa</a>, [1963] Supp. 12 S.C.R. 691, applies  to
all  laws  relating to the carrying on by the State  of	 any
trade,	business,.  industry  or  service.   The  basic	 and
essential  provisions  of  law	which  are  "integrally	 and
essentially  connected"	 with the carrying of trade  by	 the
State wilt not be exposed to the challenge that they  impair
guarantee  under  <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_77">Art. 19(1)(g</a>), whether  the  citizens	 are
excluded  completely  or  partially from  carrying  on	that
trade, or the trade is competitive.  Imposition of  restric-
tions which are incidental or subsidiary to the carrying  on
of  trade  by  the State whether to  the  exclusion  of	 the
citizen	 or not must however. satisfy the test of  the	main
limb of the Article. [580 F, H; 581 <a href="/doc/1258563/" id="a_78">H]

(c)  The  restrictions- imposed upon the right of the  named
Banks	to  ,carry  "non-banking"  business   were   plainly
unreasonable.
By<a href="/doc/470751/" id="a_82"> s. 15(2)</a> (e) of the Act the Banks were entitled to engage
in business other than banking.	 But a business organisation
deprived   of  its  entire  assets  and	  undertaking,	 its
managerial and other staff, its premises and its name,	even
if it had a right to carry on non-banking business would not
be  able to do so, specially, when even the portion  of	 the
value of its undertaking made payable to it as	compensation
was  not  made	immediately  payable.	Where	restrictions
imposed upon the carrying on of a business are so  stringent
that  the business cannot, in practice, be carried  on,	 the
Court	will  regard  imposition  of  the  restrictions	  as
unreasonable. [579 F, 586 <a href="/doc/154519/" id="a_83">H]

(iv) When,   after   acquiring	the   assets,	undertaking,
organisation, goodwill and the names of the named Banks they
are  prohibited from carrying on banking business,  whereas,
other  banks,  Indian as well as foreign, are  permitted  to
carry  on  banking business, a	flagrantly  hostile  discri-
mination  is  practised.  There is no  explanation  why	 the
named  Banks are specially selected for being  subjected  to
this  disability.   <a href="/doc/470751/" id="a_85">Section 15(2)</a> of the  Act-which  by	 the
clearest   implication	prohibited  the	 named	Banks	from
carrying  on  banking business is, therefore, liable  to  be
struck down.
The  named  Banks, though theoretically	 competent  are,  in
substance, prohibited from carrying on non-banking business.
For  reasons  set out for holding that	the  restriction  is
unreasonable,  the  guarantee of equality  was	impaired  by
preventing  the	 named	Banks from  carrying  on  nonbanking
business. [590 E-H]
[In  the  absence  of any reliable data the  Court  did	 not
express any opinion on the question whether selection of the

537
after  the  coming into force of  the  Constitution  (Fourth

compensation  in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_95">Art. 31(2)</a> after the  Constitution  (Fourth
Amendment) Act continued to have the same meaning it had  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_96">Art. 31(2)</a> before it was amended viz., "just equivalent"  or
"full  indemnification".   But this Court in <a href="/doc/673450/" id="a_97">Tile  State  of
Gujarat	 v.  Shantilal	Mangaldas</a>,  [1969]  3  S.C.R.	341,
observed that compensation payable as compulsory acquisition
of  property was not by the application of  any	 principles,
determinable as a precise sum and by calling it a "just"  or
"fair"	 equivalent,  no  definiteness	could  be   attached
thereto,  that the rules relating to determination of  value
of lands, buildings, machinery and other classes of property
differed,   and	 the  application  of  several	methods	  or
principles lead to widely divergent amounts; that principles
could be challenged on the ground that they were  irrelevant
to  the	 determination of compensation but not on  the	plea
that  what  was awarded as a result of	the  application  of
those principles was not just or fair compensation; and that
a challenge to a statute that the principles specified by it
did not award a just equivalent would be in clear  violation
of   the  constitutional  declaration  that  inadequacy	  of
compensation  provided is not justiciable.   Notwithstanding
the  difference in Vajravelu and Shantilal  Mangaldas,	both
the lines of thought, which converge in the ultimate result,
support the view that the principle specified by the law for
determination	of  compensation  is  beyond  the  pale	  of
challenge,  if	it  is	relevant  to  the  determination  of
compensation and is a recognised principle applicable in the
determination  of  compensation	 for  property	compulsorily
acquired and the principle is appropriate in determining the
value  of the class of property sought to be  acquired.	  On
the  application  of  the view expressed  in  Vajravelu	 and
Shantilal  Mangaldas cases the Act had to be struck down  as
it  failed  to provide the expropriated	 Banks	compensation

There are different methods applicable to different  classes
of property and a method appropriate to the determination of
value  of one class of property may be wholly  inappropriate
in  determining	 the value of another  class.	A  principle
specified by Parliament for determining compensation for the
property  to be acquired is not conclusive.  But if  several
principles   are  appropriate  and  one	 is   selected	 for
determination  of the value of the property to be  acquired,
selection  of  that  principle to  the	exclusion  of  other
principles is not open to challenge, for, the selection must
be left to the wisdom of the Parliament. [599 C, F]
The  object  underlying the principles of  valuation  is  to
award,	the  owner the equivalent of his property  with	 its
existing advantages and its
538
potentialities.	  Where there is an established	 market	 for
the  property  acquired the problem  of	 valuation  presents
little difficulty.  Where there is no established market for
the  property  acquired,  the object  of  the  principle  of
valuation must be to pay to the owner for what he has  lost,
including  the	benefit	 of advantages present	as  well  as
future,	 without  taking  into account the  urgency  of	 the
acquisition,  the disinclination of the owner to  part	with
the property and the benefit which the acquirer is likely to
obtain by the acquisition. [599 G]
Compensation  to  be  determined  under	 the  Act  was	 for
acquisition  of the undertaking and when an  undertaking  is
acquired  as  a	 unit the principles  for  determination  of
compensation  must  be	relevant  and  appropriate  to	 the
acquisition of the entire undertaking.	<a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_108">But the Act</a>  instead
of  providing for valuing the entire undertaking as  a	unit
provided   for	determining  the  value,  reduced   by	 the
liabilities,   of   only  some	of  the	  components   which
constituted  the  undertaking and  also	 provided  different
methods of determining compensation in respect of each	such
component.  This method is prima facie not a method relevant
to the determination of compensation for acquisition of	 the
undertaking, for, the aggregate value of the component-,  is
not  necessarily  the  value of the entirety of	 a  unit  of
property acquired, especially, when the property is a  going
concern	 with an organised business.  On this  ground  alone
acquisition  of	 the undertaking was liable to	be  declared
invalid	 for  it impaired the constitutional  guarantee	 for
payment of compensation for acquisition of property by	law.
[601 D]
Even  if  it  be assumed that the  aggregate  value  of	 the
different   components	was  equal  to	the  value  of	 the
undertaking  of	 the  named banks as a	going  concern,	 the
principles  specified did not give a true recompense to	 the
bank  for loss of the undertaking.  In determining the	com-
pensation for the undertaking (i) certain important  classes
of  assets were omitted from the heads (a) to (h); (ii)	 the
method	specified for valuation of lands and  buildings	 was
not relevant to determination of compensation and the  value
determined thereby in certain circumstances was illusory  as
compensation;  and (iii) the principle for determination  of
the aggregate Value of liabilities was also irrelevant. 1602
B]
The  undertaking of a Banking Company taken once as a  going
concern would ordinarily include the good-will and the value
of   the  unexpired  long-term	leases	in  the	  prevailing
conditions  in the urban areas.	 But good-will of the  banks
was  not  one of the items in the assets  in  the  schedule.
Thus, the value determined by excluding important components
of  the undertaking such as the good-will and the  value  of
the unexpired period of cases would not be compensation	 for
the  undertaking.   The	 view of  this	Court  in  Vajravelu
Mudaliar  that	exclusion  of potential	 value	amounted  to
giving	inadequate compensation and was not fraud  on  power
had  no	 application 'when valuation of an  undertaking	 was
sought	to be made by breaking it up -into several heads  of
assets, and important heads were excluded and others  valued
by the application of irrelevant principles. [602 C, 608 B]
Trego v. Hunt, L.R. [1896] A.C. 7, referred to.
Making a provision 'for payment of capitalised annual rental
at  twelve  time  the amount of rent  cannot  reasonably  be
regarded  as  payment of compensation having regard  to	 the
conditions  prevailing	in  the money  market.	 Again,	 the
annual rent was reduced by several outgoings and the balance
was capitalised.  The vice of items (v) &amp; (vi) of cl. (1) of
Explanation  2	was that they provided for  deduction  of  a
capital charge
			    539
out  of	 the annual rental which according  to	no  rational
system	of valuing property by capitalisation of the  rental
method	was  admissible.   The method provided	by  the	 Act
permitted   the	 annual	 interest  on  the  amount  of	 the
encumbrance  to	 be deducted before capitalisation  and	 the
capitalised  value  was again reduced by the amount  of	 the
encumbrance because, the encumbrance included not only those
mortgages or capital charges in respect of which the  amount
had fallen due but also the liability under the mortgage  or
capital charge whether the period stipulated under the	deed
creating  the encumbrance had expired or not.  In  effect  a
single	debt was, in determining the  compensation,  debited
twice,	first, in computing the value of assets and,  again,
in computing the liabilities.  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_109">By the Act</a>, the corresponding
new  banks  took  over vacant possession of  the  lands	 and
buildings belonging to the named banks.	 <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_110">The Act</a> instead  of
taking	into  account the value of the	premises  as  vacant
premises  adopted  a method which could not be	regarded  as
relevant.   Under  cl. 3 of Explanation 2 the value  of	 the
open  land was to be the market value whereas the  value  of
the  land  with buildings to be taken into account  was	 the
value  determined by the method of capitalisation of  annual
rent   or  market  value  whichever  was  less.	  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_111">The	Act</a>,
therefore,   did  not  specify	a  relevant  principle	 for
determination of compensation for lands and buildings.	[604
B605 B, 606 B-607 F]
The  deficiencies  in  the  Act did  not  result  merely  in
inadequate  compensation within the meaning of	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_112">Art.  31(2).</a>
The  Constitution  'guarantees a  right	 to  compensation-an
equivalent  in money of the property compulsorily  acquired.
That  is  the  basic guarantee.	 The  law  must,  therefore,
provide	  compensation	and  for  determining	compensation
relevant  principles must be specified : if  the  principles
are  not  relevant  the ultimate  value	 determined  is	 not
compensation.	Therefore, determination of compensation  to
be  paid  for the acquisition of an undertaking	 as  a	unit
after awarding compensation :for some items which go to make
up the under-, taking and omitting important items  amounted
to adopting an irrelevant principle in the determination  of
the   value   of  the  undertaking  and	 did   not   furnish
compensation to the expropriated owner. [607 H, 608 E]
Further,  by giving the expropriated owner  compensation  in
bonds  of the face value of the amount	determined  maturing
after  many years and carrying a certain rate  of  interest,
the  constitutional guarantee was not  necessarily  complied
with.  If the market value of the bonds is not approximately
equal to the face value, the expropriated owner may raise  a
grievance that the guarantee under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_113">Art. 31 (2)</a> is  impaired.
[609 D-E]
[In view of the finding that there was no evidence that	 the
named  banks owned distinct assets apart from the assets  of
the  banking business the Court did not express any  opinion
on  the question whether a composite undertaking of  two  or
more distinct lines of business may be acquired where  there
is a public purpose for the acquisition of the assets of one
or  more  lines of business but not in	respect-of  all	 the
lines of business. [591 F]
The  Court did not also express any opinion on the  question
whether	  in  adopting	the  method  of	  determination	  of
compensation,  by  aggregating	the value  of  assets  which
constitute the undertaking, the rule that cash, and  choses-
in-action  are	incapable of compulsory acquisition  may  be
applied. [604 B]
In  view  of the decision that the  provisions	relating  to
determination  and  payment  of	 compensation  impaired	 the

Per Ray, J. dissenting
[His  Lordship did not deal with the  preliminary  objection
based  on the petitioner's locus standi since the  petitions
were heard on merits.]
(i)  The interpretation of <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_125">Article 123</a> is to be made  first,
on the language of the Article and, secondly, the context in
which  that power Is reposed in the President, The power  is
vested	in  the	 President who the executive  head  and	 the
circumstances contemplated in the Article are a guide to the
President for exercise of such power.  Parliament is not  In
session	 throughout  the year and during  the  gaps  between
sessions the legislative power of promulgating Ordinance  is
reposed	  in  the  Presidence,	in  cases  of  urgency	 and
emergency.  The President is the sole, judge whether he will
make  the Ordinance.  The President under <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_126">Article  74(1)</a>  of
the  Constitution, acts on the advice of Ministers  who	 are
responsible  to	 Parliament  and under	<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_127">Article	 74(2)</a>	such
advice	is  not	 to  be enquired into  by  any	Court.	 The
Ordinances  promulgated	 under <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_128">Article 123</a>, are	 limited  in
life  and the Ordinance must be laid before  Parliament	 and
the  life  of the Ordinance may be further  shortened.	 The
President,  under <a href="/doc/1340387/" id="a_129">Article 361(1</a>), is not answerable  to	 any
Court  for acts done in the performance of his duties.	 The
power  under  <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_130">Article  123</a>  relates  to	 policy	 and  to  an
emergency when immediate action is considered necessary	 and
it  an	objective test is applied the  satisfaction  of	 the
President  contemplated in the Article will be shorn of	 the
power of the President himself and as the President will  be
acting on the advice of Ministers it may lead to  disclosure
of facts which under <a href="/doc/1752614/" id="a_131">Article 75(4)</a> are not to be  disclosed.
For these reasons it had to he held that the satisfaction of
the President under <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_132">Article 123</a> is subjective. [657 D-H]
The only way in which the exercise of power by the President
can be challenged is by establishing bad 'faith or mala fide
or  corrupt motive.  The fact that the Ordinance was  passed
shortly	 before the Parliament session -began, did not	show
any mala fide.	Besides, the respondent was not called	upon
to meet any case of mala fides. [659 G]

(ii) <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_137">The  Act</a>  was one for acquisition of property  and	 was

Under<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_138"> s. 6(1)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the	four
types of businesses, namely, (i) the receiving of scrips  or

of safe deposit vaults, (ii) agency business, (iii) business
of guarantee, giving of indemnity and underwriting and	(iv)
business  of acting as executors and trustees,	disputed  by
the petitioner not to be banking business, are recognised as
legitimate  forms  of business of a  banking  company.	 The
provisions   contained	 in <a href="/doc/1521150/" id="a_139"> s.	 6(1)</a>  are   the   statutory
restatement of the gradual evolution, over a century, of the
various kinds of business of banking companies.	 By cl.	 (n)
of <a href="/doc/1521150/" id="a_140"> s. 6(1)</a>, in addition to the forms of business  mentioned
in cls;. (-a) to (n), a banking company may engage in "doing
all such other things as are incidental or conducive, to the
promotion  or advancement of the business of  the  company".
The  words  "other  things" 'appearing	in  cl.	 (n),  after
enumerating  the  various types of business in cls.  (a)  to
(n),  point to the inescapable conclusion that the  business
mentioned in cls. (a) to (n) are all incidental or conducive
to  the	 promotion or advancement of the  business  or	the,
banking company.  Entry 45 in List I of Seventh Schedule  is
only "banking" and it does not contain any qualifying  words
like "the conduct of business" occurring in entry 38 of	 the
Government of India Act, 1935.	"Banking will therefore have
the  wide  meaning to include all legitimate business  of  a
banking company referred to in<a href="/doc/199190/" id="a_141"> s. 5(b)</a> as well as in<a href="/doc/1521150/" id="a_142"> s. 6(1)</a>

The view of this Court in Kavalappar Kochunni  v.  Slate  of

[621 C. H]
The provisions of the Constitution are to be interpreted  in
a  harmonious  manner,	that  is,  each	 provision  must  be
rendered  free	to  operate  with full	vigour	in  its	 own
legitimate field.  If acquisition or requisition of property
for  a	public	purpose has to satisfy	again  the  test  of
reasonable  restriction	 in  the  interest  of	the  general
public,	 harmony is repelled and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_159">Art. 31(2) -</a>becomes a	mere
repetition  and	 meaningless.  A reasonable  restriction  is
inherent and implicit in public purpose.  That is why public
purpose is dealt with separately in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_160">Art. 31 (2).</a>  It will be
pedantry  to say that acquisition for public purpose is	 not
in the interest of the public.	Articles 31(2) and 31(2)(A.)
form  a self contained code, because : (i) it  provides	 for
acquisition or requisition with authority of a law; (ii) the
acquisition  or requisition is to be for a  public  purpose;
(ii)  the  law	should provide for  compensation;  (iv)	 the
adequacy  of  compensation  is not to  be  questioned;	and,
finally,  the amendment of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_161">Art. 31</a> indicates in bold  relief
the  separate and distinctive field of law  for	 acquisition
and  requisition,  by  the State,  of  property	 for  public
purpose. [622 C-623 C]
A public purpose is a purpose affecting the interest of	 the
general	 public and, therefore, the welfare State  is  given
powers of acquisition or requisition of property for  public
purpose.   One	cannot	be  guided  either  by	passion	 and
property on the one hand or prejudice against deprivation on
the other.  Public purpose steers clear of both passion	 and
prejudice The object of the Act according to the legislation
is to use the deposits in wider public interest and what was
true of public purpose when the Constitution was ushered  in
the mid-century is a greater truth after two decades.[623 <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_162">H]

(c)  <a href="/doc/470751/" id="a_174">Section  15(2)</a>  of the Act allowed the named  Banks  to
carry  on  business  other  than  banking.  if	the   entire
undertaking  of	 a  banking company was	 -taken	 by  way  of
acquisition,   the   assets  could  not	 be   separated	  to
distinguish  those belonging to the banking  business  from,

were not in fact divisible on any such basis.	Furthermore,
that  would  be striking at the root of acquisition  of	 the
entire	undertaking.  No acquisition or requisition  of	 the
undertaking   of   a   banking	company	  is   complete	  or
comprehensive  without all businesses which  are  incidental
and conducive to the entire business of the bank.  It  would
be: strange to hold that in the teeth of express  provisions
in the Act permitting the banks to carry on businesses other
than banking that the same would amount to a prohibition  On
the bank to carry on those businesses.	Constitutionality of
the  Act  could not be impeached on the ground	of  lack  of

(iv) The acquisition of the undertaking did not offend	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_176">Art.

relation  to  the object to be achieved by the	Act  and  it
followed that these Banks could not, therefore, be,  allowed
to  carry on banking business to nullify the very object  of
the  Act.  The fourteen banks were not in the same class  as
other scheduled banks.	The classification, was on the basis
of  the fourteen Banks having deposit of Rs. 50	 crores	 and
over.	The  object of the Act was to  control	the  deposit
resources  for developing national economy and as  such	 the
selection  of fourteen Banks, having regard to their  larger
resources,  their  greater coverage,, their  managerial	 and
personal resources and the administrative and organisational
factors	 involved  in expansion, was both  intelligible	 and
sound and related to the object of the Act.  From the  point
of view of resources these fourteen banks were better suited
than others and, therefore, speed and efficiency which	were
necessary for implementing the objectives of the Act  'Could

illusory, there is no infraction of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_182">Art. 31(2)</a> and the owner
cannot impeach it on the ground of "just equivalent" of	 the
property acquired.  The relevancy is to compensation and not
to  adequacy.  It is unthinkable that Parliament, after	 the
Constitution  Fourth Amendment Act, intended that  the	word
compensation  should mean 'just equivalent' when  Parliament
had put a bar on challenge to the adequacy of  compensation.
Just  compensation cannot be inadequate, and anything  which
is  impeached as unjust or unfair is impinging on  adequacy.

<a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_185">Under  the Act</a> entire undertaking was the subject matter  of
acquisition  and  compensation	was  to	 be  paid  for	 the
undertaking   and  not	for  each  of  the  assets  of	 the
undertaking.  There is no uniform established principle	 for
valuing	 an  undertaking as a going concern  but  the  usual
principle  is assets minus liabilities.	 If it be  suggested
that  no compensation was provided for any particular  asset
that would be Questioning adequacy of compensation, because,
compensation was provided for the entire undertaking.	When
the  relevant  principle set out was  ascertained  value  it
could  not be urged that market value should have  been	 the
principle.   It	 would	really be  going  into	adequacy  of
compensation  by preferring the metrits of one principle  to
that  of  the other for the oblique purpose of	arriving  at
what  was suggested to be just equivalent. [650 G, 651	F-G.
649 D]
The  contention	 as to exclusion of  good-will	amounted  to
questioning adequacy and would not vitiate the principle  of
valuation  which  had been laid down.  Good-will  can  arise
when  the  undertaking	is sold as  a  going  concern.	 The
fourteen  banks carried on business under licence by  reason
of <a href="/doc/195670/" id="a_186"> s. 22</a> of the Banking Regulation Act, and the concept  of
sale in such it situation is unreal.  In case of  compulsory
acquisition  no goodwill passes to the acquiring  authority.
Besides, no facts were pleaded in the petition to $.how what
goodwill the banks had. [653 F]
In the valuation of lands and buildings market value is	 not
the, only principle.  That is why the Constitution has	left
the  laying  down  of the  principles  to  the	legislature.
Ascertained  value; is a relevant and sound principle  based
on capitalisation method which is accepted for valuation  of
land  and properties.  The contention that twelve times	 the
annual	rent  was not a relevant principle and	was  not  an
absolute  rule and compensation might be illusory could	 not
be accepted.  Capitalisation method is not available to land
because	 land is not generally let out.	 Nor can it he	said
that  the principle is irrelevant when there are  two  plots
side by side one with building and the other vacant  because
standard  rent necessarily takes into account value of	land
on  which  the building is situated.  If  rental  method  be
applied	 to  land  the	value may be little,  but  it  is  a
principle   relevant  to'  determination  of   compensation.
Furthermore,  there was no case in the petition	 that  there
was  land with building side by side with vacant land.	[651
F-H, 652 A-C]
As to securities shares and debentures Explanation (iv)	 and
(v)  to Part 1(c) would be operative only when market  value
of  shares;  and  debentures was  considered  reasonable  by
reason	of its having been affected by abnormal	 factors  or
when   market  value  of  shares  and  debentures  was	 not
ascertainable.	 In both cases principles were.	 laid  down,
namely, how
545
valuation had to be made taking into account various factors
and  these  principles	were relevant  to  determination  of
compensation.
Deductions   on	 account  of  maintenance  and	repairs	  is
essential  in  the capitalization method.   Insurance  would
also be an essential deduction in the capitalisation  method
and it could not be assumed that the Bank would insure for a
value higher than what was necessary; also payment of tax or
ground	rent  might  be out of income but these	 had  to  be
provided for in ascertaining value of the building under the
capitalisation method.
There  was no basis for the argument that Explanation 2	 (i)
(vi)  which  dealt with deduction of  interest	on  borrowed
capital	 was included twice, namely, under Explanation	2(i)
(vi)  and  also under liabilities in Part II.	Interest  on
mortgage  or  borrowed capital is one of the  deductions  in
calculating outgoings under capitalisation method.  In	Part
11  the liabilities were those existing at the	commencement
of  the Act and contingent liabilities	which  corresponding
new Bank might reasonably be expected to be required to meet
out of its own resources on or after the commencement of the
Act.  Interest payable on mortgage or borrowed capital on or
after  the commencement of the Act would not be	 taken	into
account	 as outground for saying that the principle was	 not
relevant. [654 G]

to  payment of compensation in<a href="/doc/1521150/" id="a_187"> s. 6(1)</a> and that<a href="/doc/1745813/" id="a_188"> s. 6(6)</a>	 was
an unreasonable: restriction had no force because (i)  there
was no question of fixing time within which agreement was to
be  reached or determination was to be, made by	 a  tribunal
and  (ii) 'under<a href="/doc/1745813/" id="a_189"> s. 6(6)</a> the government would pay the  money
to  the	 Bank only if the Bank agreed to pay to	 the  share-
holders; therefore,<a href="/doc/1745813/" id="a_190"> s. 6(6)</a> was a provision for the  benefit
of  the	 Bank  and  the,  share-holders	 and  there  was  no
unreasonableness in it. [652 D-653 D]
The  principles	 set  out in the Act  was  relevant  to	 the
determination of compensation.	It might be that adoption of
one principle conferred lesser sum of money than adoption of
another; but that would not be. a ground for saying that the
principle was not relevant. [654 G]
(vi) <a href="/doc/287871/" id="a_191">Article  305</a>  directly  applies to a  law	relating  to
banking	 and  all  business  necessarily  incidental  to  it
carried on by the State to the complete or partial exclusion
of the fourteen banks.	<a href="/doc/412767/" id="a_192">Article 302</a> can have no	 application
and  an individual cannot complain of violation of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_193">Art.	 301</a>
in  such  a case.  <a href="/doc/287871/" id="a_194">Article 305</a> applied in the  present	case
arid,	therefore  neither  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_195">Art.  301</a>  nor  <a href="/doc/412767/" id="a_196">Art.   302</a>	 was
applicable. [641 H]
(vii)	  A  legislation  which	 has  retrospective   effect
affecting  acquisition	or requisition of  property  is	 not
unconstitutional   and	 is  valid.   <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_197">The  Act</a>	 which	 was
retrospective  in  operation did not violate  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_198">article  31(2)</a>
because the Article speaks of "authority of law" without any
words of limitation or restriction as to law being in  force
at  the time.  Further, the vital distinction  between	<a href="/doc/1501707/" id="a_199">Art.
20(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_200">Art. 31(2</a>), namely, that the former cannot have by
its  own  terms have any retrospective operation  while	 the
latter	can, is to be kept in the forefront in	appreciating
the   soundness	 of  the  proposition	that   retrospective
legislation  as to acquisition of property does not  Violate
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_201">Art. 31(2).</a> [615 A-B, 617 <a href="/doc/82588/" id="a_202">B]

</p><p id="p_14">In  India there was till 1949 no  comprehensive	 legislation
governing  banking business and banking	 institutions.	 The
Central Legislature enacted the <a href="/doc/444965/" id="a_209">Banking Companies Act</a> 10  of
1949   (later  called  "<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_210">The  Banking  Regulation  Act</a>")	  to
consolidate  and amend the law relating to  certain  matters
concerning banking.  By<a href="/doc/199190/" id="a_211"> s. 5</a> (b) of that Act, "banking"	 was
defined	 as  meaning  "the accepting,  for  the	 purpose  of
lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public,
repayable  on  demand  or  otherwise",, and  by	<a href="/doc/199190/" id="a_212"> s.  5(c)</a>  a
"banking  company"  meant "any company which  transacts	 the
business of banking in India".	By<a href="/doc/1309466/" id="a_213"> s. 6</a> it was enacted	that
in addition to the business of banking as defined in<a href="/doc/199190/" id="a_214"> s. 5(b)</a>
a banking company may engage in one or more of the forms  of
business  specified  in cls. (a) to (o) of sub-s.  (1).	  By
sub-s.	(2) of<a href="/doc/1309466/" id="a_215"> s. 6</a> banking companies were  prohibited	from
engaging "in any form of business other than those  referred
to  in	sub-section  (1)".  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_216">The Act</a>  applied  to  commercial
banks,	and enacted provisions, amongst others, relating  to
prohibition   of   employment	of   managing	agents	 and
restrictions on certain forms of employment; minimum paid-up
capital	 and  reserves;	 regulation  of	 voting	 rights	  of
shareholders and election of Board of Directors; prohibition

to  and for trial of proceedings against the Banks  and	 for
speedy disposal of winding up proceedings of Banks.
<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_217">The Banking Regulation Act</a> was amended by Act 58 of 1968, to
give   effect  to  the	policy	of  "social  control"	over
commercial   banks.    Act   58	  of   1968   provided	 for
reconstitution	of  the Boards of  Directors  of  commercial
banks  with a Chairman who had practical experience  of	 the
working	 of  a	Bank or	 financial,  economic  and  business
administration,	 and  with a membership not  less  than	 51%
consisting of persons having special knowledge or  practical
experience  in accountancy, agriculture and  rural  economy,
banking,  cooperation,	economics, finance, law	 and  small-
scale  industry.  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_218">The Act</a> also provided that no loans  shall
be granted to any director of the Bank or to any concern  in
which  he  is  interested  as  Managing	 Director,  Manager,
employee,  or  guarantor  or partner or in  which  he  holds
substantial  interest.	The Reserve Bank was  invested	with
power to give directions to commercial banks and to  appoint
directors  or  observers in the interest  of  depositors  or
proper	management  of	the Banking  Companies,	 or  in	 the
interest of Banking policy (which expression was defined  by
s.  5  (ca) as "any policy which is specified from  time  to
time  by  the Reserve Bank in the interest  of	the  banking
system	or  in the interest of monetary stability  or  sound
economic  growth, having due regard to the interests of	 the
depositors,  volume of deposits and other resources  of	 the
bank  -and  the	 need  for  equitable  allocation  and	 the
efficient use of these deposits and resources".	 The Reserve
Bank  was also invested with power to remove managerial	 and
other  personnel  from	office	and  to	 appoint  additional
directors,  and	 to  issue  directions	prohibiting  certain
activities  in relation to Banking Companies.	The  Central
Government  was given power to acquire the business  of	 any
Bank  if it failed repeatedly to comply with  any  direction
issued by the Reserve Bank under certain specific  provision
in  regard to any matter concerning the affairs of the	Bank
and  if acquisition of the Bank was considered necessary  in
the  interest  of the depositors or in the interest  of	 the
banking	 policy	 or  for  the  better  provision  of  credit
generally  or  of credit to any particular  section  of	 the
community or in a particular area.
</p><p id="p_15">During the last two decades the Reserve Bank reorganised the
banking structure.  A number of units which accounted for  a
small  section	of the banking	business  were,	 amalgamated
under  directions of the Reserve Bank.	The total number  of
commercial banking institutions was reduced from 566 in 1951
to 89 in 1969, 73 scheduled and 16 non-scheduled.

law of any foreign country, the provisions of the  Ordinance
by themselves do not effectively transfer or vest any  asset
or  liability situated in that country in the  corresponding
new bank, the affairs of the named bank in relation to	such
asset  or  liability  shall stand  entrusted  to  the  chief

reference to the corresponding new bank in relation to it.
(3)  The  Central  Government shall have power	to  frame  a
scheme	for carrying out the provisions of the Act, and	 for
that  purpose to make provisions for the  corresponding	 new
banks  relating	 to capital structure, constitution  of	 the
Board of Directors, manner of payment of compensation to the

become officers or other employees of the corresponding	 new
banks.	Every named bank shall stand dissolved on such	date
as the Central Government may by notification in that behalf

named  banks determined according to the principles set	 out
in Second Schedule, that is to say,-

period	of three months from the date on which	the  Central
Government and the existing bank fail to reach an  agreement
regarding the amount of compensation.
</p><p id="p_38">Compensation so determined shall be paid to each named	bank

Under  the Ordinance the entire undertaking of	every  named
commercial  bank  was taken over by  the  corresponding	 new
bank,  and  all	 assets	 and  contractual  rights  and	 all
obligations  to	 which	the named  bank	 was  subject  stood
transferred to the corresponding new bank.  The Chairman and
the   Directors	 of  the  Banks	 vacated  their	  respective
officers.   To	the named banks survived only the  right  to
receive	  compensation	to  be	determined  in	the   manner
prescribed.  Compensation, unless settled by agreement,	 was
to  be	determined by the Tribunal, and was to be  given  in
marketable  Government securities.  The entire	business  of
each  named  bank  was accordingly  taken  over,  its  chief
executive  officer  ceased to hold office  and	assumed	 the
office	of  Custodian  of the corresponding  new  bank,	 its
directors  vacated  office;  and the  services	of  the	 ad-
ministrative  and  other  staff	 stood	transferred  to	 the
corresponding  new bank.  The named bank had  thereafter  no
assets,	 no business, and no managerial,  administrative  or
other  staff, it was incompetent to use the word  "Bank"  in
its name, because of the provisions contained in<a href="/doc/113739/" id="a_232"> s. 7</a> (1) of
the  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_233">Banking  Regulation  Act</a>, 1949, and was  liable  to  be

and  transfer  of  undertakings of the	existing  banks	 was
introduced  in the Parliament, and was enacted on August  9,
1969, as "The Banking Companies (Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_234">Transfer of
Undertakings)  Act</a> 22 of 1969".	 The long title of  the	 Act
was in terms identical with the long title of the Ordinance.
By  sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/1076018/" id="a_235"> s. 27</a> of the Act, Ordinance 8 of 1969	 was
repealed.  In the First Schedule were included the-names  of
the  14 banks named in the Ordinance in	 juxtaposition	with
the names of the corresponding new banks.  By sub-s. (2)  of
s.  1,	the Act came into force on July 19,  1969,  and	 the
undertaking of every named bank was deemed, with effect from
that  date, to have, vested in the corresponding  new  bank.
By<a href="/doc/1076018/" id="a_236"> s. 27</a> (2), (3) and (4) actions taken or things done under
the  Ordinance inconsistent with the provisions of  the	 Act
were  not  to  be  of any force or  effect,  and  no  right,
privilege, obligation or liability was to be deemed to	have
been acquired, accrued or incurred under the Ordinance.
The general scheme of the Ordinance relating to the transfer
to  and	 vesting  in  the  corresponding  new  bank  of	 the
undertaking of each named bank, payment of compensation, and
management   of	  the  corresponding  new   bank,   remained
unaltered.   <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_237">The Act</a> departed from the Ordinance in  certain
matters :
</p><p id="p_41">(1)  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_238">Under  the Act</a> the named banks remain in existence	 for
certain purposes and they are not liable to be dissolved  by
order of the Government.  If under the laws in force in	 any
foreign country it is not permissible for a banking company-
,  owned  or  controlled  by Government,  to  carry  on	 the
business  of  banking in that country, the  assets,  rights,
powers, authorities and privileges and property, movable and
immovable,  cash balances and investments of any named	bank
operating   in	 that  country	shall  not   vest   in	 the
corresponding  new bank.  The directors of the	named  banks
shall  remain  in  office  and	may  register  transfers  or
transmission  of, shares; arrive at an agreement  about	 the
amount	of compensation payable under the Act  or  appearing
before the Tribunal for obtaining a determination as to	 the
amount	of  compensation;  distribute  to  shareholders	 the
amount	of compensation received by the Bank under  the	 Act
for  the  acquisition  of  its	undertaking;  carry  on	 the
business  of banking in any country outside India  if  under
the  law  in  force  in that  country  any  bank,  owned  or
controlled by Government, is prohibited from carrying on the
business  of banking there; an carry on any  business  other
than  the business of banking.	The Central  Government	 has
power to authorise the corresponding new bank to advance the
amount	required  by the named bank in connection  with	 the
functions which the directors may perform.  Reference to any
named bank in any law, or in any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">554</span>
contract  or  other  instrument	 shall	be  construed  as  a
reference  to the corresponding new bank in relation to	 it,
but  not  in  cases where the named bank may  carry  on	 any
business and in relation to that business.
(2)  Principles	 for determination of compensation  and	 the
manner of payment are modified.	 Interim compensation may be
paid  to  a  named bank if it agrees to	 distribute  to	 its
shareholders in accordance with their rights and  interests.
A  major  change is made in the principles  for	 determining
compensation  set out in Sch. 11.  By Explanation I  to	 cl.
</p><p id="p_42">(e)  of	 Part  I  of Sch.  II, the  value  of  any  land  or
buildings to be taken into account in valuing the assets  is
to  be the market value of the land or buildings, but  where
such  market  value exceeds the	 "ascertained  value",	that
"ascertained  value"  is to be taken into  account,  and  by
Explanation  II	 the  "ascertained value"  of  any  building
wholly	occupied on the date of the commencement of the	 Act
is  to be twelve times the amount of the annual rent or	 the
rent for which the building may reasonably be expected to be
let  out from year to year, and reduced by one-sixth of	 the
amount	of the rent on account of maintenance  and  repairs,
annual	premium paid to insure the building against risk  of
damage	or  destruction,  annual  charge,  if  any,  on	 the
building,  ground  rent, interest on any mortgage  or  other
capital charge on the building, interest on borrowed capital
if  the building has been acquired,  constructed,  repaired,
renewed	 or  re-constructed with borrowed capital,  and	 the
sums  paid  on	account of land revenue or  other  taxes  in
respect of such building.
</p><p id="p_43">(3)  The Central Government may reconstitute any correspond-
ing  new bank into two or more corporations; amalgamate	 any
corresponding  new  bank with another  banking	institution;
transfer  the  whole  or any part of the  undertaking  of  a
corresponding new bank to any other banking institution;  or
transfer  the  whole or any part of the undertaking  of	 any
other banking institution to a corresponding new bank.	 The
Board  of  Directors of the corresponding new banks  are  to
consist	  of  representatives  of  the	depositors  of	 the
corresponding  new bank, employees of such  banks,  farmers,
workers and artisans to be elected in the prescribed  manner
and of other persons as the Central Government may appoint.
(4)  The  profits remaining after making provision  for	 bad
and doubtful debts, depreciation in assets, contributions to
staff  and  superannuation funds and all other	matters	 for
which	provision   is	 necessary  under   any	  law,	 the
corresponding new bank shall transfer the balance of profits
to the Central Government.
</p><p id="p_44">(5)  Provision of law relating to winding up of corporations
do  not	 apply	to  the	 corresponding	new  banks,  and   a
corresponding new bank may be ordered to be liquidated	only
by the order of the Central Government.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">555</span>
<p id="p_45">The petitioner challenges the validity of the Ordinance	 and
the Act on the following principal grounds :
</p><p id="p_46">(i)  The  Ordinance  promulgated in exercise  of  the  power
under <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_239">Art. 123</a> of the Constitution was invalid, because	 the
condition  precedent  to the exercise of the power  did	 not
exist;
</p><p id="p_47">(ii) That in enacting the Act the Parliament encroached upon
the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the  Constitution,
and  to	 that  extent the Act  is  outside  the	 legislative
competence of the Parliament;
</p><p id="p_48">(iii)	  That	by enactment of the Act, fundamental  rights
of  the	 petitioner guaranteed by  the	Constitution-  under
Arts. 14, 19 (1) (f) &amp; (g) and 31(2) are impaired;
</p><p id="p_49">(iv) That by the Act the guarantee of freedom of trade under
<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_240">Art. 301</a> is violated; and
</p><p id="p_50">(v)  That in any event retrospective operation given to	 Act
22  of	1969  is  ineffective,	since  there  was  no  valid
Ordinance   in	 existence.   The  provision  in   the	 Act
retrospectively	 validating infringement of the	 fundamental
rights	of  citizens was not within the	 competence  of	 the
Parliament.  That sub-sections (1) &amp; (2) of<a href="/doc/1724061/" id="a_241"> s. 11</a> and<a href="/doc/1130240/" id="a_242"> s.  26</a>
are invalid.
</p><p id="p_51">The  Attorney-General contended that the petitions  are	 not
maintainable, because no fundamental right of the petitioner
is,' directly impaired by the enactment of the Ordinance and
the  Act, or by any action taken thereunder.   He  submitted
that the petitioner who claims to be a shareholder, director
and holder of deposit and current accounts with the Banks is
not the owner of the property of the undertaking taken	over
by  the	 corresponding	new banks and  is  on  that  account
incompetent  to maintain the petitions complaining that	 the
rights	guaranteed  under  Arts.  14,  19  and	31  of	 the
Constitution were impaired.
</p><p id="p_52">A  company  registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_243">Companies Act</a>	is  a  legal
person,	 separate and distinct from its individual  members.
Property  of  the  Company  is	not  the  property  of	 the
shareholders.	A shareholder has merely an interest in	 the
Company arising under its Articles of Association,  measured
by  a  sum of money for the purpose of liability, and  by  a
share  in  the	profit.	 Again a director of  a	 Company  is
merely its agent for the purpose of management.	 The  holder
of  a deposit account in a Company is its creditor :  he  is
not  the owner of any specific fund lying with the  Company.
A
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">556</span>
shareholder, a depositor or a director may not therefore  be
entitled  to move a petition for infringement of the  rights
of  the Company, unless by the action impugned by  him,	 his
rights are also infringed.
</p><p id="p_53">By  a  petition praying for a writ against  infringement  of
fundamental  rights, except in a case where the petition  is
for a writ of habeas corpus and probably for infringement of
the guarantee under Arts. 17, 23 and 24, the petitioner	 may
seek relief in respect of his own rights and not of  others.
The shareholder of a ,Company, it is true, is not the  owner
of  its assets; he has merely a right to participate in	 the
profits of the Company subject to the ,contract contained in
the  Articles  of  Association.	 But  on  that	account	 the
petitions will not fail.  A measure executive or legislative
may  impair the rights of the Company alone, and not of	 its
shareholders;  it may impair the rights of the	shareholders
and  not  of the Company : it may impair the rights  of	 the
shareholders as well as of the Company.	 Jurisdiction of the
Court to grant relief cannot be denied, when by State action
the  rights of the individual shareholder are  impaired,  if
that action impairs the rights of the Company as well.	 The
test  in  determining  whether the  shareholder's  right  is
impaired  is not formal: it is essentially  qualitative:  if
the  State action impairs the right of the  shareholders  as
well  as to the Company, the Court will	 not,  concentrating
merely	upon  the technical operation of  the  action,	deny
itself jurisdiction to grant relief.
</p><p id="p_54">The  petitioner claims that by the Act and by the  Ordinance
the  rights guaranteed to him under Arts. 14, 19 and  31  of
the Constitution are impaired.	He says that the Act and the
Ordinance  are without legislative competence in  that	they
interfere with the guarantee of freedom of trade and are not
made  in  the public interest; that the	 Parliament  had  no
legislative  competence, to enact the Act and the  President
had  no	 power	to promulgate  the  Ordinance,	because	 the
subject-matter of the Act and the Ordinance is (partially at
least) within the State List; and that the Act and Ordinance
are  invalid because they vest the undertaking of the  named
banks  in the new corporations without a public purpose	 and
without	  setting   out	 principles  and   the	 basis	 for
determination and payment of a just equivalent for the	pro-
perty  expropriated.   He says that in	consequence  of	 the
hostile	 discrimination practised by the State the value  of
his  investment in the shares is substantially reduced,	 his
right  to receive dividend from his investment	has  ceased,
and he has suffered great financial loss, he is deprived  of
the right as a shareholder to carry on business through	 the
agency	of the Company, and that in respect of the  deposits
the obligations of the-- corresponding new banks -not of his
choice are substituted without his consent.

Co.  Ltd.  and Others</a>(1) this Court held that  a  preference
shareholder  of	 a company is competent to maintain  a	suit
challenging  the  validity  of the  "Sholapur  Spinning	 and
Weaving Company (Emergency Provisions) Ordinance" 2 of	1950
(which was later replaced by Act 27 of 1950), which deprived
the Company of its property without payment of	compensation
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_245">Art. 31.</a>	Mahajan, J., observed :
"The plaintiff and the other preference shareholders are  in
imminent  danger of sustaining direct injury as a result  of
the  enforcement of this Ordinance, the direct injury  being
the amount of the call that they are called upon to pay	 and
the consequent forfeiture of their shares."
Das, J., in the same case examined the matter in some detail
and observed at p. 722 :
</p><p id="p_56">"The impugned Ordinance,......the preference shareholders by
imposing  on  them this liability, or the risk- of  it,	 and
gives  them a sufficient interest to challenge the  validity
of  the	 Ordinance, . . . . Certainly he can show  that	 the
Ordinance under which these persons have been appointed	 was
beyond	the  legislative competence of the  authority  which
made it or that the Ordinance had not been duly promulgated.
If  he can, with a view to destroy the locus standi  of	 the
persons	 who have made the call, raise the question  of	 the
invalidity  of the Ordinance .... I can see no valid  reason
why,  for the self same purpose, he should not be  permitted
to challenge the validity of the Ordinance on the ground  of
its  unconstitutionality for the breach of  the	 fundamental
rights of the company or of other persons."
A  similar view was also taken in <a href="/doc/4354/" id="a_246">Chiranjit Lal Chowduri  v.

petitions.  In a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_253">Art. 32</a>, of the Constitution
filed by a Company challenging the levy of sales-tax by	 the
State  of  Bihar, two shareholders were	 also  impleaded  as
petitioners.   It  was urged on behalf of  the	shareholders
that  in substance the interests of the Company and  of	 the
shareholders  were  identical  and  the	 shareholders	were
entitled to maintain the petition.  The Court rejected	that
contention,  observing	that  what  the	 Company  could	 not
achieve directly, it could not relying upon the "doctrine of
lifting the veil" achieve indirectly.  The petitioner  seeks
in this case to challenge the infringement of his own rights
and  not  of the Banks of which he is a	 shareholder  and  a
director and with which he has accounts-, current and  fixed
deposit.
</p><p id="p_59">It  was urged that in any event the guarantee of freedom  of
trade  does not occur in Part III of the  Constitution,	 and
the  petitioner is not entitled to maintain a  petition	 for
breach of that guarantee in this Court.	 But the  petitioner
does not seek by these petitions to enforce the guarantee of
freedom of trade and commerce in Art 301: he claims that  in
enacting   the	 Act   the   Parliament	  has	violated   a
constitutional	restriction  imposed  by Part  XIII  of	 its
legislative power and in determining the extent to which his
fundamental  freedoms  are impaired, the statute  which	 the
Parliament is incompetent to enact must be ignored.
It is not necessary to consider whether <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_254">Art. 31</a> A ( 1 )	 (d)
of  the Constitution bars the petitioner's claim to  enforce
his  rights  as a director.  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_255">The Act</a> prima  facie  does	 not
(though	 the Ordinance purported to) seek to  extinguish  or
modify the right of the petitioner as a director : it  seeks
to take away expressly the right of the named Banks to carry
on banking business, while reserving their right to carry on
business  other	 than  banking.	 Assuming  that	 he  is	 not
entitled  to  set  up his right to  enforce  his  guaranteed
rights as a director, the petition will not still fail.	 The
preliminary objection raised by the Attorney-General against
the maintainability of the petitions must fail.
I.   Validity of Ordinance 8 of 1969-
</p><p id="p_60">Power to issue Ordinance is by <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_256">Art. 123</a> of the Constitution
vested in the President.  <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_257">Article 123</a> provides :
"(1)  If at any time, except when both Houses of  Parliament

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">559</span>
<p id="p_61">circumstances  exist  which render it necessary for  him  to
take  immediate action, he may promulgate such Ordinance  as
the circumstances appear to him to require.
(2)  An Ordinance promulgated under this Article shall	have
the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament, but every
such Ordinance-
</p><p id="p_62">(a)  shall  be	laid before both Houses	 of  Parliament	 and
shall  cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks	from
the re-assembly of Parliament, or, if before the  expiration
of  that  period resolutions disapproving it are  passed  by
both Houses, upon the passing of the second of those resolu-
tions; and
</p><p id="p_63">(b)  may be withdrawn at any time by the President.
Explanation.-Where the Houses of Parliament are summoned  to
reassemble on different dates, the period of six weeks shall
be  reckoned from the later of those dates for the  purposes
of this clause.
</p><p id="p_64">(3)  If and so far as an Ordinance under this article  makes
any   provision	 which	Parliament  would  not	under	this
Constitution be competent to enact, it shall be void."
Under	the   Constitution,   the   President	being	 the
constitutional head, normally acts in all matters  including
the  promulgation  of  an Ordinance on	the  advice  of	 his
Council of Ministers.  Whether in a given case the President
may  decline  to be guided by the advice of his	 Council  of
Ministers  is  a  matter  which need  not  detain  us.	 The
Ordinance is promulgated in the name of the President and in
a  constitutional sense on his satisfaction: it is in  truth
promulgated on the advice of his Council of Ministers and on
their satisfaction.  The President is under the Constitution
not  the repository of the legislative power of	 the  Union,
but  with a view to meet extraordinary situations  demanding
immediate  enactment  of  laws, provision  is  made  in	 the
Constitution investing the President with power to legislate
by promulgating Ordinances.
</p><p id="p_65">Power  to  promulgate such Ordinance  as  the  circumstances
appear	to  the President to require is	 exercised-(a)	when
both  Houses  of  Parliament are not  in  session;  (b)	 the
provision  intended to be made is within the  competence  of
the Parliament to enact; and (c) the President is  satisfied
that  circumstances exist which render it necessary for	 him
to take immediate action.  Exercise of the power is strictly
conditioned.  The clause relating to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">560</span>
the  satisfaction is composite: the satisfaction relates  to
the existence of circumstances, as well as to the  necessity
to take immediate action on account of those  circumstances.
Determination  by  the.	  President  of	 the  existence	  of
circumstances and the necessity to take immediate action  on
which the satisfaction depends, is not declared final.
The Attorney-General contended that the condition of  satis-
faction	 of  the President in both the	branches  is  purely
subjective and the Union of India is under no obligation  to
disclose  the existence of, or to justify the  circumstances
of  the necessity to take immediate action.  He relied	upon
the  decisions of the Judicial Committee in Bhagat Singh  v.
The  King Emperor(1); King Emperor v. Benoari Lal  Sarma(2).
and  upon a decision of the Federal Court in  <a href="/doc/1394213/" id="a_258">Lakhi  Narayan
Das  v.	 The  Province of Bihar</a>(2),  which  interpreted	 the
analogous  provisions of the Government of India Act,  1935,
conferring upon the GovernorGeneral in the first two  cases,
and upon the Governor of a Province in the last case,  power
to  issue Ordinances.  He also relied upon the	judgment  of
the,  Judicial Committee in <a href="/doc/266087/" id="a_259">Hubli Electricity Co.   Ltd.  v.
Province of Bombay</a>(3).
</p><p id="p_66">The  Attorney-General  said that investment  of	 legislative
power  upon the President being an incident of the  division
of  sovereign functions of the Union and a "matter  of	high
policy",  the  expression "the President is  satisfied	that
circumstances  exist  which render it necessary for  him  to
take immediate action" is incorporated as a guidance and not
as  a  condition of the exercise of power.  He	invited	 our
attention to the restraints inherent in the Constitution  on
the  exercise of the power to promulgate Ordinance  in	cls.
(1)  &amp;	(2) of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_260">Art. 74;</a> cls. (3) &amp; (4) of <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_261">Art. 75</a>  and	<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_262">Art.
361</a>, and submitted that the rule applicable to the interpre-
tation	of parliamentary statutes conferring authority	upon
officers of the State to act in a prescribed manner on being
satisfied  about the existence of certain  circumstances  is
inept  in determining the true perspective of the  power  of
the head of the State in situations of emergency.
,On the other hand, Mr. Palkhivala contended that the Presi-
dent  is  not  made by <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_263">Art. 123</a> the  final  arbiter  of	 the
existence of the conditions on which the power to promulgate
an  Ordinance  may  be exercised.  Power  to  promulgate  an
Ordinance  being conditional, counsel urged, this  Court  in
the  absence of a provision-express or necessarily  implicit
in  the	 Constitution-to  the  contrary,  is  competent	  to
determine  whether  the	 power	was  exercised	not  for   a
collateral purpose, but on relevant circumstances

<p id="p_70">which,	 prima	facie,	establish  the	necessity  to	take
immediate   action.   Counsel  submitted  that	 the   rules
applicable  to	the interpretation  of	statutes  conferring
power	exercisable   on  satisfaction	of   the   specified
circumstances  upon the President and upon officers  of	 the
State,	are  not  different.  The nature  of  the  power  to
perform an official act where the authority is of a  certain
opinion, or that in his view certain circumstances exist  or
that  he has reasonable grounds to believe, or that  he	 has
reasons to believe, or that he is satisfied, springing	from
a constitutional provision is in no manner different from  a
similar power under a parliamentary statute, and no  greater
sanctity  may  attach to the exercise of  the  power  merely
because	 the source of the power is in the Constitution	 and
not  in	 a parliamentary statute.  There is, it	 was  urged,
nothing,  in  the constitutional scheme which  supports	 the
contention that the clause relating to satisfaction is not a
condition of the exercise of the power.

from  the provision of <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_267">Art. 123</a>, that the decision in  Lakhi

the Judicial Committee and since the status of the President
under the Constitution qua the Parliament is not the same as
the constitutional status of the Governor-General under	 the

bearing on the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_268">Art. 123.</a>
The  Ordinance has been repealed by Act 22 of 1969, and	 the
question  of  its validity is now academic.  It	 may  assume
significance  only if we hold that Act 22 of 1969 is  valid.
Since  the  Act	 is,  in  our  view,  invalid  for   reasons
hereinafter  stated,  we  accede to the	 submission  of	 the
Attorney-General  that	we need express no opinion  in	this
case  on  the  extent of the jurisdiction of  the  Court  to
examine	 whether the condition relating to  satisfaction  of
the President was fulfilled.

</pre><p id="p_75">II Authority of Parliament to enact Act 22 of 1969--
On behalf of the petitioner it is urged that the Act is	 not
within the legislative power of the Parliament and that,  in
any  event,  to	 the  extent  to  which	 it  vests  in	 the
corresponding  new banks the assets of business	 other	than
banking,  it  trenches	upon  the  authority  of  the  State
Legislature,  and  is on that account  void.   The  relevant
legislative entries in the Seventh Schedule and the  consti-
tutional provisions which have a bearing on the question  of
acquisition  and  taking over of undertaking of a  bank	 may
first be read.
</p><p id="p_76">The Parliament has exclusive legislative power with  respect
to "Banking" Entry 45 List I; "Incorporation, regulation and
winding	 up  of	 trading  Corporations	including   banking,
insurance and financial corporations, but not including	 co-
operative societies" : Entry 43 List I; and  "Incorporation,
regulation  and winding up of corporations, whether  trading
or  not,  with objects not confined to one  State,  but	 not
including Universities" : Entry 44 List I.
The States have exclusive legislative authority with respect
to the following subjects in List II :
</p><p id="p_77">Entry  26-"Trade and commerce within the Stale,	 subject  to
the provisions of entry 33 of List III;"
</p><p id="p_78">Entry	30-"Money-lending  and	money-lenders;	 relief	  of
agricultural indebtedness."
</p><p id="p_79">The  Parliament and the States have  concurrent	 legislative
authority with respect to the following subjects in List III
:
</p><p id="p_80">Entry 33-"Trade and commerce in, and the production,  supply
and distribution of,-
</p><p id="p_81">(a)  the products of any industry where the control of	such
industry by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be
expedient in the public interest, and imported goods of	 the
same kind as such products;
</p><p id="p_82">(b)  foodstuffs, including edible oil-seeds and oils;
</p><p id="p_83">(c)  cattle  fodder,  including	 oilcakes  and	other	con-
centrates;

and
</p><p id="p_85">(e)  raw jute."
</p><p id="p_86">Entry 42-"Acquisition and requisition of property."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">563</span>
<p id="p_87">The argument raised 'by Mr. Setalvad, intervening on  behalf
of  the	 State	of Maharashtra and the State  of  Jammu	 and
Kashmir, that the Parliament is competent to enact Act 22 of
1969, because the subject-matter of the Act is "with respect
to"   regulation   of  trading	corporations   and   matters
subsidiary  and incidental thereto, and on that	 account  is
covered	 in its entirety by Entries 43 and 44 of List  I  of
the Seventh Schedule cannot be upheld.	Entry 43 deals	with
incorporation,	 regulation  and  winding  up	of   trading
corporations  including banking companies.   Law  regulating
the  business of a corporation is not a law with respect  to
regulation  of a corporation.  In List I  entries  expressly
relating  to trade and commerce are Entries 41 &amp; 42.   Again
several entries in List I relate to activities commercial in
character.  Entry 45 "Banking"; Entry 46 "Bills of exchange,
cheques, promissory notes and other like instruments;  Entry
47  "Insurance";  Entry	 48  "Stock  exchanges	and   future
markets"; Entry 49 "Patents, inventions and designs".  There
are  several  entries relating to activities  commercial  as
well  as  non-commercial in List  II-Entry  21	"Fisheries".
Entry 24 "Industries . . . ."; Entry 25 "Gas and Gas works":
Entry  26 "Trade and commerce"; Entry 30 "Money lending	 and
money-lenders";	 Entry 31 "Inns and Inn-keeping";  Entry  33
"Theatres  and dramatic performances, cinemas etc.". We	 are
unable to accede to the argument that the State Legislatures
are competent to legislate in respect of the  subject-matter
of  those  entries only when the commercial  activities	 are
carried	 on by Individuals and not when they are carried  on
by corporations.
</p><p id="p_88">The object of Act 22 of 1969 is to transfer the	 undertaking
of  each named bank and to vest it in the corresponding	 new
bank  set  up with authority to carry on banking  and  other
business.  Each such corresponding new bank is controlled by
the  Central  Government of which the entire capital  is  to
stand vested in and allotted to the Central Government.	 The
principal provisions of the Act which effectuate that object
relate	to-setting  up	of  "corresponding  new	 banks"	  as
statutory corporations to carry on and transact the business
of banking as defined in<a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_269"> s. 5</a> (b) of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_270">Banking  Regulation
Act</a>, 1949, and one or more other forms of business specified
in <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_271"> s.	6</a> (1) of that Act, with power to  acquire  and	hold
property for the purpose of the business, and to dispose  of
the  same; administration of the corresponding pew banks  as
institutions  carrying	on banking and other  business;	 the
undertaking  of	 each  named bank  in  its  entirety  stands
transferred  to and vested in a new corporation set  up	 for
that  purpose; principles for determination of	compensation
and  method  of	 payment  thereof to  each  named  bank	 for
transfer of its undertaking; and that the named bank may not
carry on banking business, but may carry out business  other
than banking.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">564</span>
<p id="p_89">Mr.  Palkhivala submitted that the Parliament may  legislate
in respect of the business of banking as defined in<a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_272"> S. 5</a> (b)
of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_273">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949, and matters  incidental
thereto,  and  also  for acquisition of	 that  part  of	 the
undertaking of each named bank which relates to the business
of  banking,  but not in respect of any other  business	 not
incidental  to banking in which the named bank	was  engaged
prior  to  July	 19, 1969, for the  power  to  legislate  in
respect of such other business falls within Entry 26 of List
II.  As a corollary thereto, counsel submitted that power to
legislate  in respect of acquisition under Entry 42 of	List
III may be exercised by the Parliament only for effectuating
legislation  under a head falling in List I or List  III  of
the Seventh Schedule.
</p><p id="p_90">It is necessary to determine the true scope of "banking"  in
Entry  45 List I, the meaning of the expression	 "property",
and  the  limitations  on the power  of	 the  Parliament  to
legislate in respect of acquisition of property in Entry, 42
List III.  Matters not in contest may be eliminated.   Power
to legislate for setting up corporations to carry on banking
and  other  business  and to acquire, hold  and	 dispose  of
property   and	 to  provide  for  administration   of	 the
corporations is conferred upon the Parliament by Entries 43,
44 and 45 of the first list.  Power to enact that the  named
banks  shall not carry on banking business (as defined	ins.
5(b)  of  the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_274">Banking Regulation Act</a>) is incidental  to	 the
power  to  legislate  in  respect  of  banking.	  Power	  to
legislate  for determination of compensation and  method  of
payment	 of compensation for compulsory acquisition  of	 the
assets	of  the	 named banks, in so far	 as  it	 relates  to
banking business is also within the power of the Parliament.
The  expression	 "banking"  is not  defined  in	 any  Indian
statute except the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_275">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949.  It may  be
recalled  that by<a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_276"> s. 5(b)</a> of that Act "banking"	 means	"the
accepting  for	the  purpose of	 lending  or  investment  of
deposits  of  money from the public repayable on  demand  or
otherwise, and withdrawable by cheque, draft or	 otherwise".
The  definition did not include other commercial  activities
which a banking institution may engage in.
In support of his contention Mr. Palkhivala relied upon	 the
observation  of Lord Porter in Commonwealth of Australia  v.
Bank  of  New  South Wales(1)that banking  consists  of	 the
creation  and  transfer	 of credit,  the  making  of  loans,
purchase  and  disposal	 of investments	 and  other  kindred
transactions;  and upon the statement in Halsbury's Laws  of
England, 3rd Edn., Vol 2, <a href="/doc/1465729/" id="a_277">Art. 270</a> at pp. 150 &amp; 151 that :
(1)  L.R. [1950] A. C. 235.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">565</span>
<p id="p_91">"A  'banker'  is an individual partnership  or	corporation,
whose sole or predominating business is banking, that is the
receipt	 of  money  on current or deposit  account  and	 the
payment	 of cheques drawn by and the collection	 of  cheques
paid by a customer",
and in the foot-note (g) at p. 151 that
"Numerous other functions are undertaken at the present	 day
by banks such as the payment of domiciled bills, custody  of
valuables, discounting bills, executor and trustee business,
or  acting in relation to stock exchange  transactions,	 and
banks	 have	 functions    under    certain	   financial
legislation,  .	 .  . . These  functions  are  not  strictly
banking business."
</p><p id="p_92">The  Attorney-General said that the expression "banking"  in
Entry 45 List I means all forms of business which since	 the
introduction of western methods of banking in India, banking
institutions have been carrying on in addition to banking as
defined	 in <a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_278"> s. 5(b)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act,  and  on
that  account all forms of business described in<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_279"> s. 6(1)</a>  of
the  Banking  Regulation  Act in cls. (a)  to  (n)  are,  if
carried	 on  in	 addition  to  the  "hardcore  of  banking",
banking,  and  the Parliament is competent to  legislate  in
respect	 of that business under Entry 45 List I. In  support
of his contention that apart from the business of  accepting
money  from the public for lending or investment, and  with-
drawable  by  cheque, draft or otherwise,  banking  includes
many  allied business activities which banking	institutions
engaged	 in, the Attorney-General invited our  attention  to
cl. 21 of the Charter of the Bank of Bengal (Act VI of 1839)
: <a href="/doc/1076018/" id="a_280"> s. 27</a> of Act 4 of 1862; to ss. 36 &amp; 37 of the  Presidency
Banks  Act  XI of 1876; to s. 91(15) of	 the  British  North
America	 Act; to Paget's Law of Banking, 7th Edn., at p.  5;
to  the	 standard  form of memorandum of  association  of  a
Banking Company in Palmer's Company Precedents Form 138; and
to  the statement of objects and reasons in support  of	 the
Bill  which was enacted as the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_281">Indian Companies	 (Amendment)
Act</a>, 1936.
</p><p id="p_93">The Charter of the Bank of Bengal, the Presidency Banks	 Act
4  of 1862, Ch.	 X-A of the Indian Companies Act,  1913,  as
incorporated by the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_282">Indian Companies (Amendment) Act</a>,  1936,
merely	described the business which a	banking	 institution
could  carry  on.  It was not intended	thereby	 to  include
those activities within the expression "banking".  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_283">The	Act</a>s
enacted after the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_284">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949, also support
that inference.	 Under<a href="/doc/1108218/" id="a_285"> s. 33</a> of the State Bank of India Act,
1955,  the  State  Bank	 is entitled  to  carry	 on  diverse
business  activities  beside banking.  Similarly  the  Banks
subsidiary to the State Bank were by<a href="/doc/389896/" id="a_286"> s. 36</a>
<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_287"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">566</span></a>
,of  Act 38 of 1959 to act as agents of the State Bank,	 and
also to carry on and transact business of banking as defined
in <a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_288"> S.	5(b)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,  and	were
also competent to engage in such one or more other forms  of
business  specified  in	<a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_289"> s.  6</a>	(1)  of	 that  Act.    These
provisions  do not aid in construing the Entry "Banking"  in
Entry 45 List I.
</p><p id="p_94">In modern times in India as elsewhere, to attract  business,
banking	 establishments render, and compete in rendering,  a
variety	 of miscellaneous services for	their  constituents.
If  the	 test for determining what "banking"  means  in	 the
constitutional	entry  is  any	commercial  activity   which
bankers	 at a given time engage in, great obscurity will  be
introduced in the content of that expression.  The  coverage
of  constitutional  entry in a	Federal	 Constitution  which
carves	out a field of legislation must depend upon  a	more
satisfactory basis.
</p><p id="p_95">The legislative entry in List I of the ;Seventh Schedule  is
"Banking"  and not "Banker" or "Banks".	 To  include  within
the connotation of the expression "Banking" in Entry 45 List
I,   power  to	legislate  in  respect	 of-all	  commercial
activities  which  a  banker by the  custom  of	 bankers  or
authority  of law engages in would result in re-writing	 the
Constitution.	Investment  of	power  to  legislate  on   a
designated topic covers all matters incidental to the topic.
A  legislative entry being expressed in a broad	 designation
indicating the contour of plenary power must receive a mean-
ing  conducive to the widest amplitude, subject	 however  to
limitations inherent in the federal scheme which distributes
legislative  power  between the Union  and  the	 constituent
units.	 But the field of "banking" cannot be  extended	 to,
include	 trading  activities which not being  incidental  to
banking encroach upon the substance of the entry "trade	 and
commerce" in List II.
</p><p id="p_96">Rejection  of the argument of the Attorney-General does	 not
lend any practical Support to the argument of Mr. Palkhivala
that  Act 22 of 1969, to the extent it makes  provisions  in
respect	 of the undertaking of the named banks	relating  to
non-banking business, is ultra vires the Parliament.  In the
first  instance	 there is no evidence that the	named  banks
were before July 19, 1969, carrying on non-banking  business
distinct  and independent of the banking business,  or	that
the banks held distinct assets for any non-banking business,
apart  from  the assets of the banking business.   Again  by
Act-22	of  1969  the corresponding banks  are	entitled  to
engage	in  business of banking and  non-banking  which	 the
named banks were engaged in or competent to engage in  prior
to July 19, 1969, and the named banks are entitled to engage
in  business other than banking as di.-fined in<a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_290"> s.  5(b)</a>  of
the Banking Regulation Act, but not the business of banking.
By  enacting that the corresponding new banks may  carry  on
business
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">567</span>
specified in<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_291"> s. 6(1)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act and	that
the  named  banks  shall not carry on  banking	business  as
defined	 in<a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_292"> s. 5</a> (b) of that Act, the impugned Act  did	 not
encroach upon any entry in the State List.  By<a href="/doc/842227/" id="a_293"> s. 15</a> (2) (e)
of the impugned ,Act the named banks are expressly  reserved
the right to carry on business other than banking, and it is
not claimed that thereby there is any encroachment upon	 the
State  List.   Exercise	 of  the  power	 to  legislate	 for
acquisition of the undertaking of the named banks also	does
not trespass upon the State List.
</p><p id="p_97">Before	the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act,  Entry  33
List I invested the Parliament with power to enact laws with
respect to acquisition or requisitioning for the purpose  of
the  Union,  and Entry 36 List II conferred upon  the  State
Legislature   the  power  to  legislate	 with	respect	  to
acquisition  or requisitioning for the	remaining  purposes.
Those  entries are now deleted, and a single Entry  42	List
III  invests the Parliament and the State Legislatures	with
power	to  legislate  with  respect  to  "acquisition	 and
requisitioning" of property.  By Entry 42 in the  Concurrent
List power \was conferred upon the Parliament and the  State
Legislatures  to  legislate with respect to  "Principles  on
which  compensation for property acquired  or  requisitioned
for the purpose of the Union or for any other public purpose
is to be determined, and the form in which such compensation
is  to	be given".  Power to legislate	for  acquisition  of
property is exercisable only under Entry 42 of List III, and
not as an incident of the power to legislate in respect of a
specific  head	of legislation in any of the three  lists  :
<a href="/doc/286982/" id="a_294">Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corporation Ltd. v. The State of
Andhra</a>(1).  Under that entry "property" can be	compulsorily
acquired.   In its normal connotation "property"  means	 the
"highest right a man can have to anything, being that  right
which one has to lands or tenements, goods or chattels which
does  not  depend  on  another's  courtesy  :  it   includes
ownership,  estates and interests in corporeal	things,	 and
also  rights  such as trade-marks, copyrights,	patents	 and
even rights in personam capable of transfer or transmission,
such  as  debts; and signifies a beneficial right  to  or  a
thing considered as having a money value, I especially	with
reference  to transfer or succession, and to their  capacity
of being injured".  The expression "undertaking" in<a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_295"> s. 4</a>  of
Act  22 of 1969 clearly means a going concern with  all	 its
rights, liabilities and assets-as distinct from the  various
rights	and assets which compose it.  In Halsbury's Laws  of
England,  3rd Edn., Vol. 6, <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_296">Art. 75</a> at p. 43, it  is  stated
that  "Although	 various  ingredients  go  to  make  up	  an
undertaking, the term describes not the ingredients but	 the
completed work from which the earnings arise."
(1)  [1954] S.C.R. 779 at p. 785.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">568</span>
<p id="p_98">Transfer  of  and vesting in the State Corporations  of	 the
entire	undertaking  of a going concern is  contemplated  in
many  Indian Statutes: e.g., <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_297">Indian  Electricity Act</a>,  1910,
ss.  6,	 7  &amp; 7A; <a href="/doc/979883/" id="a_298">Air Corporation Act</a>, 1953,<a href="/doc/1012040/" id="a_299"> ss.  16</a>  &amp;	 <a href="/doc/569017/" id="a_300">17</a>;

S. 36 AE; and Cotton Textile Companies Act, 1967,<a href="/doc/989772/" id="a_307"> ss.  4-(1)</a>
&amp; <a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_308">5(1)</a>.	 Power to legislate for acquisition of "property" in
Entry 42 List III therefore includes the power to  legislate
for   acquisition   of	an  undertaking.   But,	  says	 Mr.
Palkhivala,  liabilities of the banks which are included  in
the  connotation of the expression "undertaking", cannot  be
treated	 as " property".  It is however the  assets,  rights
and  obligations  of a going concern  which  constitute	 the
undertaking: the obligations and liabilities of the business
form an integral part of the undertaking, and for compulsory
acquisition  cannot be divorced from the assets, rights	 and
privileges.  The expression "property" in Entry 42 List	 III
has a wide connotation, and it includes not only assets, but
the  organisation,  liabilities and obligations of  a  going
concern	 as  a unit.  A law may, therefore, be	enacted	 for
compulsory acquisition of an undertaking as defined in<a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_309"> s.  5</a>
of Act 22 of 1969.
</p><p id="p_99">The contention raised by Mr. Palkhivala that the  Parliament
is  incompetent	 to legislate for acquisition of  the  named
banks  in so far as it relates to assets of the	 non-banking
business fails for two reasons-(i) that there is no evidence
that the named banks held, any assets for any distinct	non-
banking business; and (ii) that the acquisition is not shown
to fall within an entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule.
III.	Infringement  of  the  fundamental  rights  of	 the
petitioner-
</p><p id="p_100">Clauses (1) &amp; (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_310">Art. 31</a> subordinate the exercise of the
power of the State to the basic concept of the rule of	law.
Deprivation  of	 a  person of his  property  and  compulsory
acquisition may be effectuated by the authority of law.	  It
is superflous to add that the law limiting the authority  of
the  State must be within the competence of the	 Legislature
enacting   it,	and  not  violative  of	  a   constitutional
prohibition,  nor impairing the guarantee of  a	 fundamental
right.	This Court held in <a href="/doc/1431786/" id="a_311">Kavalappara Kottarathil Kochuni &amp;
Others	v.  The State of Madras and Others</a>(1);	<a href="/doc/935369/" id="a_312">Swami  Motor
Transport  Company (P) Ltd. v. Sri Sankaraswamigal Mutt</a>	 (2)
and Maharana Shri Jayavantsingji v. The State of Gujarat (3)
that a person may. be deprived of his property by  authority
of a statute only if it does not impair the fundamental

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">569</span>
<p id="p_102">rights	guaranteed  to him.  It is again  not  contested  on
behalf of the Union that the law authorising acquisition  of
property  must	be within the competence of  the  law-making
authority and must not violate a constitutional	 prohibition
or impair the guarantee of any of the fundamental rights  in
Part 111.  But it is claimed that since <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_313">Art. 31(2)</a> and	<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_314">Art.
19(1) (f)</a> while operating on the same field of the right  to
property  are mutually exclusive, a law	 directly  providing
for  acquisition of property for a public purpose cannot  be
tested	for  its  validity  on	the  plea  that	 it  imposes
limitations   on  the  right  to  property  which  are	 not
reasonable.
</p><p id="p_103">By Arts. 31 ( 1 ) &amp; (2) the right to property of individuals
is  protected  against specific invasions by  State  action.
The function of the two clauses-cls. (1) &amp; (2) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_315">Art. 31-is</a>
to  impose  limitations	 on the power of the  State  and  to
declare the corresponding guarantee of the individual to his
right to property.  Limitation on the power of the State and

Protection  of the guarantee is ensured by declaring that  a
person	may  be deprived of his property  by  "authority  of
law":  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_316">Art.  31	 (  1</a>  and  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_317">that  private  property  may  be

declaration  in	 the widest terms of the right	to  acquire,
hold and dispose of property, subject to restrictions (which
may assume the form of limitations or complete	prohibition)
imposed by law in the interests of the general public.	 The
guarantee under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_321">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> does not protect merely an ab-
stract	right to property: it extends to concrete rights  to
property  as  well   Swami Motor Transport  Co.	 (P)  Ltd.'s

</p><p id="p_104">The constitutional scheme declares the right to property  of
the  individual	 and  then  delimits  it  by  two  different
provisions : <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_322">Art. 19(5)</a> authorizing the State to make  -laws

the  guarantee	under  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_327">Art.  31</a>	 does  not  after  the	true
character of the right it protects.  <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_328">Article 19(5)</a> and	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_329">Art.

exercise of the right to hold property.
</p><p id="p_106">Under the Constitution, protection against impairment of the
guarantee of fundamental rights is determined by the  nature
of  the right, the interest of the aggrieved party  and	 the
degree of harm resulting from the State action.	  Impairment
of  the	 right of the individual and not the object  of	 the
State  in  taking  the impugned action, is  the	 measure  of
protection.  To concentrate merely on power of the State and
the  object of the State action in exercising that power  is
therefore to ignore the true intent of the Constitution.  In
this Court, there is, however, a body of authority that	 the
nature	and  extent  of the protection	of  the	 fundamental
rights is measured not by the operation of the State  action
upon  the  rights  of the individual,  but  by	its  object.
Thereby the constitutional scheme which makes the guaranteed
rights subject to the permissible restrictions within  their
allotted  fields, fundamental, got blurred and gave  impetus
to a theory that certain Articles of the Constitutions enact
a code dealing exclusively with matters dealt with  therein,
and  the protection which an aggrieved person may  claim  is
circumscribed by the object of the State action.
Protection  of the right to property or personal freedom  is
most  needed when there is an actual threat.  To argue	that
State	action	which  deprives	 a  person  permanently	  or
temporarily  of his right to property, or personal  freedom,
operates to extinguish the right or the remedy is to  reduce
the guarantee to an empty platitude.	Again  to hold	that
the   extent  of,  and	the  circumstances  in	which,	 the
guarantee of protection is available depends upon the object
of   the   State   action,  is	to   seriously	 erode	 its
effectiveness. Examining the problem not merely in semantics
but  in	 the  broader and more appropriate  context  of	 the
constitutional scheme which aims at affording the Individual
the  fullest  protection  of his basic rights  and  on	that
foundation  to	erect  a structure  of	a  truly  democratic
polity, the conclusion, in our judgment, is inevitable	that
the  validity  of the State action must be adjudged  in	 the
light of its operation upon the rights of the individual and
groups of individuals in all their dimensions.
But  this  Court  has held in some  cases  to  be  presently
noticed	 that <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_331">Art. 19 (1) (f)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_332">Art. 31 (2)</a>  are  mutually
exclusive.
</p><p id="p_107">Early  in the history of this Court the question  of  inter-
relation  between  the	diverse	 provisions  affording	 the
guarantee  of  fundamental  rights in Part III	fell  to  be
determined.  <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_333">In A. K. Gopalan
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">571</span>
v.   The State of Madras</a>(1) a person detained pursuant to an
order  made  in	 exercise  of the  power  conferred  by	 the
Preventive Detention Act 4 of 1950 applied to this Court for
a  writ of habeas ,corpus claiming that the Act	 contravened
the  guarantee under Arts. 19, 21 &amp; 22 of the  Constitution.
The majority of the Court (Kania C.J., and Patanjali Sastri,
Mahajan,  Mukherjea  &amp; Das, JJ) held that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_334">Art.	22</a>  being  a
complete code relating to preventive detention, the validity
of  an	order  of  detention  must  be	determined  strictly
according  to the terms and "within the four comers of	that
Article".   They held that a person detained may  not  claim
that  the  freedom guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_335">Art.  19(1)(d)</a>  was	 in-
fringed	 by  his  detention, and that validity	of  the	 law
providing for making orders of detention will not be  tested
in  the	 light	of the reasonableness  of  the	restrictions
imposed	 thereby  on  the freedom of movement,	nor  on	 the
ground	that  his  right to personal  liberty  is  infringed
otherwise  than	 according to the procedure  established  by
law.   Fazl Ali, J., expressed a contrary view.	  This	case
has formed the nucleus of the theory that the protection  of
the  guarantee of a fundamental freedom must be adjudged  in
the 'light of the object of State action in relation to	 the
individual's  right  and  not upon its	influence  upon	 the
guarantee  of  the fundamental freedom. and as	a  corollary
thereto,  that the freedoms under Arts. 19, 21, 22 &amp; 31	 are
exclusive-each	 article   enacting  a	code   relating	  to
protection of distinct rights.
</p><p id="p_108">Kania, C.J., proceeded on the theory that different articles
guarantee distinct rights.  He observed at p. 100
"......	 it (<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_336">Art. 19</a>) .... means that the legislation to  be
examined  must be directly in respect of one of	 the  rights
mentioned  in  the sub-clauses.	 If there is  a	 legislation
directly attempting to control a citizen's freedom of speech
or  expression',  or  his right to  assemble  peaceably	 and
without arms, etc., the question whether that legislation is
saved  by  the	relevant saving clause of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_337">article  19</a>	will
arise.	 If,  however, the legislation is  not	directly  in
respect	 of  any of these subjects, but as a result  of	 the
operation of other legislation, . . . . the question of	 the
application of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_338">article 19</a> does not arise.  The true approach
is  only to consider the directness of the  legislation	 and
not  what  will	 be the result of  the	detention  otherwise
valid, on the mode of the detenue's life."
</p><p id="p_109">The learned Chief Justice also observed that <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_339">Art. 19 (1) (d)</a>
had  nothing to do with detention, preventive  or  punitive,
and  I	the  concept of personal liberty in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_340">Art.  21</a>  being
entirely different
(1)  [1950] S.C.R. 88.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">572</span>
<p id="p_110">from the concept of the right to move freely throughout	 the
territory of India, <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_341">Art. 22</a> was a complete code dealing with
preventive detention.
</p><p id="p_111">Patanjali Sastri, J., observed at p. 191
"....	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_342">article  19</a>  seems	 to  pre-suppose  that	 the
citizens to whom the possession of these fundamental  rights
is  secured  retains the substratum of personal	 freedom  on
which alone the enjoyment of these rights necessarily  rests
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_343">article	 19</a>  guarantees	 to the citizens  the  enjoyment  of
certain civil liberties while they are free, while  articles
20-22	  secure     to	    all	    persons-citizens	 and
non-citizens--certain constitutional guarantees in regard to
punishment and prevention of crime."
</p><p id="p_112">Mahajan,  J.,  was  of the view that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_344">Art.  22</a>  was  "  self-
contained  in respect of laws on the subject  of  preventive
detention".  Mukherjea, J., observed (at p. 254) that  there
was no conflict between <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_345">Art. 19 (1) (d)</a> and <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_346">Art. 22</a>, for the
former	did  not contemplate freedom from  detention  either
punitive or preventive, but speaks of a different aspect  or
phase of civil liberty.	 In his view Arts. 20 to 22 embodied
the  entire  protection guaranteed by  the  Constitution  in
relation  to deprivation of life and personal  liberty	with
regard	to  substantive	 as  well  as  procedural  law.	  He
proceeded to observe at p. 261 :
</p><p id="p_113">"....by reason of preventive detention, aman   may    be
prevented from exercising the right offree movement within
the territory of Indiabut  that	 is merely incidental  to
or consequential uponloss of liberty resulting from  the
order of detention."
</p><p id="p_114">But the learned Judge observed at p. 263
"  It may not, I think, be quite accurate to state that	 the
operation  of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_347">article 19</a> of the Constitution is	 limited  to
free  citizens only and that the rights have been  described
in that article on the pre-supposition that the citizens are
at liberty.  The deprivation of personal liberty may  entail
as  a  consequence the loss or abridgement of  many  of	 the
rights	described  in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_348">article 19</a>, but that  is	because	 the
</p><p id="p_115">-nature	 of these rights is such that free exercise of	them
is not possible in the absence of personal liberty.
Das, J. observed at p. 304 :
</p><p id="p_116">"  Therefore, the conclusion is irresistible that the
rights protected by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_349">article 19(1</a>), in so far as they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">573</span>
relate	to rights attached to the person, i.e.,	 the  rights
referred  to in sub-clauses (a) to (e) and (g),	 are  rights
which only a free citizen, who has the freedom of his person
unimpaired, can exercise.
</p><p id="p_117">  The learned Judge further observed
a lawful detention, whether punitive or preventive, does not
	      offend  against the protection confer  red  by
	      <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_350">article  19 (1) (a)</a> to (e) and (g), for
	      those  rights must necessarily cease when	 the
	      freedom of the person is lawfully taken  away.
	      In  short, those rights end where	 the  lawful
	      detention	 begins.  So construed,	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_351">article  19</a>
	      and  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_352">article  21</a>	may,  therefore,  easily  go
	      together and there is, in reality, no conflict
	      between them."
</p><p id="p_118">Fazl  Ali,  J., struck a different note: he observed  at  p.
148:
</p><p id="p_119">rights does not contemplate ... that each article is a	code

arrest and detention in custody before trial are  concerned.
Preventive  detention,	which is dealt with in	<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_356">article	 22</a>,
also  amounts  to deprivation of personal liberty  which  is
referred  to in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_357">article 21</a>, and is a violation of the  right
	      of  freedom of movement dealt with in  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_358">article

At p. 149 the learned Judge observed
" The words used in <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_359">article 19 (1) (d)</a> must be, construed as
	      they stand, and we have to decide upon

	      detention the right under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_360">article 19 (1 )	 (d)</a>
	      is or is not infringed.  But, . . .,  however,
	      literally	 we may construe the words  used  in

	      be  the  meaning	we may	attribute  to  those
	      words, there can be no escape from the conclu-
	      sion  that  preventive detention is  a  direct
	      infringement   of	 the  right  guaranteed	  in
	      <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_362">article 19(1)(d)."</a>
</p><p id="p_120">At p. 170 he observed :

read  subject  to  those two articles, in the  same  way  as
articles 19 and 21 must be read subject to <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_365">article 22.</a>	 The
correct position is that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_366">article 22</a> must prevail in

so  far as there are specific provisions  therein  regarding
preventive  detention, but, where there are no	such  provi-
sions  in that article, the operation of articles 19 and  21
cannot be excluded.  The mere fact that different aspects of
the  same  right  have been dealt with	in  three  different
articles will not make them mutually exclusive except to the
extent I have indicated."
</p><p id="p_122">The view expressed in A. K. Gopalan's case(1) was reaffirmed
in <a href="/doc/40472258/" id="a_367">Ram Singh and Others v. The State of Delhi</a> (2) .
The  principle underlying the judgment of the  majority	 was
extended  to  the protection of the freedom  in	 respect  of
property, and it was held that <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_368">Art. 19 ( 1) (f)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_369">Art.  31
(2)</a>  were. mutually exclusive in their operation.  In A.  K.
Gopalan's  case(3), Das, J., suggested that if the  capacity
to  exercise  the  right to property was  lost,	 because  of
lawful compulsory acquisition of the subject of that  right,
the owner ceased to have that right for the duration of	 the
incapacity.   In Chiranjit Lai Chowduri's case(4), Das,	 J.,
observed at p. 919 :
</p><p id="p_123">"...the	 right	to property guaranteed by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_370">Art.	19(  1)	 (f)</a>

Bhanji	Munji's,  case, it must be remembered,	arose  under
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_379">Art.  31</a> before it was amended by the  Constitution  (Fourth

subjectmatter, i.e. compulsory acquisition of property;: see
Subodh	Gopal's case(3) and Dwarkadas  Shriniwas's  case(4).
But   since  the  amendment  by	 the  Constitution   (Fourth

proceeded  to  hold that the expression "authority  of	law"
means authority of a valid law, and on that account validity
of  the law seeking to deprive a person of his	property  is
open  to  challenge on the ground that	it  infringes  other
fundamental  rights,  e.g., under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_383">Art. 19(1)  (f).</a>   It	 was

not  deal with the validity of a law relating to  compulsory
acquisition.   With the decision in Kavalappara	 Kottarathil
Kochuni's  case(1)  there  arose  two  divergent  lines	  of
authority (1) "authority of law" in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_384">Art. 31 (1)</a> is liable to

the  eminent Judges who gave shape to the concept  that	 the
extent	of protection of important guarantees, such  as	 the
liberty	 of person, and right to property, depends upon	 the
form and object of the State action, and not upon its direct
operation upon the individual's freedom.  But it is not	 the
object	of the authority making the law impairing the  right
of  a citizen, nor the form of .action that  determines	 the
protection he can claim: it is the effect of the law and  of
the action upon the right which attract the jurisdiction  of
the Court to grant relief.  If this be the true view, and we
think it is, in determining the impact of State action	upon
constitutional guarantees which are fundamental, it  follows
that  the  extent  of protection  against  impairment  of  a
fundamental  right  is determined not by the object  of	 the
Legislature nor by the form of the action, but by its direct
operation upon the individual's rights.
</p><p id="p_130">We are of the view that the theory that the object and	form
of  the,  State action determine the  extent  of  protection
which  the aggrieved party may claim is not consistent	with
the  constitutional  scheme.   Each  freedom  has  different
dimensions.   <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_393">Article 19 (1 ) (f )</a> enunciates the  right  to
acquire,  hold and dispose of property: cl. (5) of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_394">Art.  19</a>
authorize   imposition	of  restrictions  upon	the   right.
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_395">Article	 31</a>  assures  the  right  to  property	and   grants
protection  against  the exercise of the  authority  of	 the
State.	Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_396">Art. 19</a> and cis. (1) &amp; (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_397">Art.  31</a>
prescribe  restrictions upon State action, subject to  which
the right to property may be exercised.	 <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_398">Article 19(5)</a> is  a
broad generalization dealing with the nature of	 limitations
which  may be placed by law on the right to  property.	 The
guarantees  under  Arts.  31  (1) &amp; (2)	 arise	out  of	 the
limitations imposed on the authority of the State by law  to
take over the individual's property.  The true character  of
the  limitations under the two provisions is not  different.
Clause	(5)  of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_399">Art. 19</a> and cls. (1) &amp; (2) of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_400">Art.  31</a>	 are
parts  of a single pattern : <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_401">Art. 19 ( 1 ) (f  )</a>  enunciates
the, basic right to property of the citizens and <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_402">Art.  19(5)</a>
and cis. (1) &amp; (2)  of	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_403">Art. 31</a> deal with limitations  which
may be placed by law,	 subject to which the rights may  be
exercised.
</p><p id="p_131">Limitations  prescribed	 for ensuring due  exercise  of	 the
authority  of the State to deprive a person of his  property
and of the
(1)  [1968] 3S.C.R.489.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">577</span>
<p id="p_132">power  to compulsorily acquire his property are,  therefore,
specific  classes  of limitations on the right	to  property
falling within <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_404">Art. 19(1) (f).</a>	Property may be compulsorily
acquired only for a public purpose.  Where the law  provides
for compulsory acquisition of property for a public  purpose
it may be presumed that the acquisition or the law  relating
thereto imposes a reasonable restriction in the interest  of
the  general  public.	If there is  no	 public	 purpose  to
sustain compulsory acquisition, the law violates <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_405">Art. 31(2).</a>
If  the	 acquisition is for a  public  purpose,	 substantive
reasonableness of the restriction which includes deprivation
may, unless otherwise established, be presumed, but  enquiry
into reasonableness of the procedural provisions will got be
excluded.   For instance if a tribunal is authorised  by  an
Act  to	 determine compensation	 for  property	compulsorily
acquired, without hearing the owner of the property, the Act
would be liable to be struck down under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_406">Art. 19 (1 ) (f ).</a>
In dealing with the argument that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_407">Art. 31 (2)</a> is a  complete
code  relating to infringement of the right to	property  by
compulsory  acquisition, and the validity of the law is	 not
liable	to be tested in the light of the  reasonableness  of
the restrictions imposed thereby, it is necessary to bear in
mind the enunciation of the guarantee of fundamental  rights
which  has  taken different forms.  In some cages it  is  an
express	 declaration  of a guaranteed right :  Arts.  29(1),
30(1),	26,  25	 &amp; 32; in others  to  ensure  protection  of
individual  rights they take specific forms of	restrictions
on State action-legislative or executive--Arts. 14, 15,	 16,
20, 21, 22(1), 27 and 28; in some others, it takes the	form
of a positive declaration and simultaneously enunciates	 the
restriction there on : Arts. 19(1) and 19(2) to (6); in some
cases, it arises as an implication from the delimitation  of
the authority of the State, e.g., Arts. 31(1) and 31(2);  in
still  others,	it takes the form of a	general	 prohibition
against	 the  State as well as others : Arts. 17, 23  &amp;	 24.
The  enunciation of rights either express or by	 implication
does  not  follow a uniform pattern.  But  one	thread	runs
through	 them  :  they seek to protect	the  rights  of	 the
individual or groups of individuals against infringement -of
those  rights  within  specific limits.	  Part	III  of	 the
Constitution  weaves a pattern of guarantees on the  texture
of   basic  human  rights.   The  guarantees   delimit	 the
protection of those rights in their allotted fields: they do
not -attempt to enunciate distinct rights.
We  are therefore unable to hold that the challenge  to	 the
validity  of the provision for acquisition is liable  to  be
tested only on the ground of non-compliance with <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_408">Art. 31(2).</a>
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_409">Article 31(2)</a> requires that property must be acquired for  a
public purpose and that it must be acquired under a law with
characteristics set out in that Article.  Formal  compliance
with the conditions under
L8Sup.CI/70
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">578</span>
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_410">Art.  31(2)</a> is not sufficient to negative the protection  of
the guarantee of the right to property.	 Acquisition must be
under the authority of a law and the expression "law"  means
a law which is within the competence of the Legislature, and
does not impair the guarantee of the rights in Part Ill.  We
are unable, therefore, to agree that Arts. 19 ( 1 ) (f ) and
31 (2) are mutually exclusive.
</p><p id="p_133">The area of protection afforded against State action by	 the
freedom	 under	<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_411">Art. 19 (1) (f)</a> and by the exercise  of	 the
power  of  the State to acquire property of  the  individual
without	 his consent must still be reconciled.	If  property
is  compulsorily acquired for a public purpose, and the	 law
satisfies  the requirements of Arts. 31(2) and 31 (2A),	 the
Court  may  readily  presume  that  by	the  acquisition   a
reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right to	hold
property is imposed in the interests of the general  public.
But  that is not because the claim to plead infringement  of
the  fundamental right under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_412">Art. 19 (1) (f)</a> does not  avail
the   owner;  it  is  because  the  acquisition	 imposes   a
permissible  restriction on the, right of the owner  of	 the
property compulsorily acquired.
</p><p id="p_134">We  have found it necessary to examine the rationale of	 the
two  lines  of	authority and  determine  whether  there  is
anything in the Constitution which justifies this apparently
inconsistent  development of the law.  In our judgment,	 the
assumption in A. K. Gopalan's case(1) that certain  articles
in  the Constitution exclusively deal with specific  matters
and  in	 determining whether there is  infringement  of	 the
individual's  guaranteed rights, the object and the form  of
the State action alone need be considered, and effect of the
laws  on  fundamental rights of the individuals	 in  general
will be Ignored cannot be accepted as correct.	We hold that
the  validity  "of  law"  which	 authorises  deprivation  of
property and "a law" which authorises compulsory acquisition
of  property  for a public purpose must be adjudged  by	 the
application  of the same tests.	 A citizen may claim  in  an
appropriate   case  that  the  law  authorising	  compulsory
acquisition  of property imposes fetters upon his  right  to
hold  property which are not reasonable restrictions in	 the
interests of the general public.  It is immaterial that the,
scope  for such challenge. may be attenuated because of	 the
nature of the law of acquisition which providing as it	does
for expropriation of property of the individual for'  public
purpose may be presumed to impose reasonable restrictions in
the interests of the general public.

It  may be recalled that by Act 22 of 1969 the	named  banks
cannot	engage in business of banking as defined in<a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_421"> s.	5(b)</a>
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, but may engage in other

organization deprived of its entire assets and	undertaking,

reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in	 the
interests,  of the general public.  Counsel urged  that	 the
law imposing restrictions upon the exercise of the right  to
carry on any occupation, trade or business is subject to the
test of reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests  of
the   general  public,	likewise,  the	particular   classes
specified  in  the second part of the Article must  also  be
regarded  as  liable to be tested in the light of  the	same
limitations.   Counsel strongly relied upon the decision  of
the  House of Lords in Earl Fitzwilliam's Wentworth  Estates
Co. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government and  Anr.(1)
The House of Lords in that case did not lay down any general
proposition.  They were only dealing with the meaning of the
words "in particular" in the context in which they occurred,
and it was held that the expression "in particular" was	 not
intended  to  confer a separate and  distinct  power  wholly
independent of that contained in the first limb.  It  cannot
be  said that the expression "in particular" used  in  Art,.
19(1)(g)   is  intended	 either	 to  particularise   or	  to
illustrate the general law set out in the first limb.
It  was observed in <a href="/doc/1822801/" id="a_433">Saghir Ahmad v. The State of  U.P.	and'

monopoly will vary with the nature of the trade or  business
in which the monopoly is created.  They will depend upon the
nature of the commodity, the nature of trade in which it  is
involved    and	  other	  Circumstances.    At	  p.	707,
Gajendragadkar, J. speaking for the Court, observed :
.lm15
"  'A  law  relating to' a State monopoly  cannot,  in	the,
context,  include all the provisions contained in  the	said
law  whether they have direct relation with the creation  of
the  monopoly or not.  In our opinion, the  said  expression
should be construed to mean the law relating to the monopoly
in  its absolutely essential features.	If a law  is  passed
creating  a State, monopoly, the Court should  enquire	what
are  the provisions of the said law which are basically	 and
essentially  necessary for creating the State monopoly.	  It
is  only  those	 essential and basic  provisions  which	 are
protected  by the latter part of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_441">Art. 19(6).</a>  If  there	 are
other  provisions  made	 by the Act  which  are	 subsidiary,
incidental or helpful to the operation of the monopoly, they
do not fall under the first part of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_442">Art. 19(6).</a>
</p><p id="p_148">-He also observed at p. 705 :
</p><p id="p_149">that State monopoly in respect of any trade or business must
be presumed to be reasonable and in the interests of general
public, so far as <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_443">Art. 19 (1) (g)</a> is concerned."

however, satisfy the test of the main limb.
The law which prohibits after July 19, 1969, the named banks
from  carrying	on  banking  business,	being  a   necessary
incident of the right assumed by the Union, is not liable to
be  challenged because of Art' 19 (6) (ii) in so far  as  it
affects the right to carry on business.
</p><p id="p_155">There  is no satisfactory proof in support of the plea	that
the  enactment	of  Act 22 of 1969 was	not  in	 the  larger
interest  of the nation, but to serve political	 ends,	i.e.
not with the object to ensure better banking facilities,  or
to  make them available to a wider public, but only to	take
control	 over  the  deposits of the public  with  the  major
banks,	and  to	 use  them  as	a  political  lever  against
industrialists	who  had built up industries by	 decades  of
industrial planning and careful management.  It is true that
social	control	 legislation  enacted by  the  Banking	Laws
(Amendment)  Act 58 of 1968 was in operation and  the  named
banks  were  subject to rigorous control which	the  Reserve
Bank  was competent to. exercise and did in  fact  exercise.
Granting  that the objectives laid down by the Reserve	Bank
were  being carried out, it cannot be said that the Act	 was
enacted	 in abuse of legislative power.	 Our  attention	 was
invited	 to  a	mass of evidence from the  speeches  of	 the
Deputy	Prime Minister, and of the Governor and	 the  Deputy
Governor  of  the Reserve Bank, and also extracts  from	 the
Reserve	 Bank Bulletins issued from time to time  and  other
statistical  information collected from official sources  in
support of thesis of the petitioner that the performance  of
the  named  banks  exceeded the targets	 laid  down  by	 the
Reserve	 Bank  in its directives; that the named  banks	 had
effectively complied with the requirements of the law;	that
they had served the diverse interests including	 small-scale
sector,	 and  had  been instrumental in	 bringing  about  an
increasing tempo of industrial and commercial activity; that
they had discouraged speculative holding of commodities, and
had   followed	 essential  priorities	 in   the   economic
development of the nation coupled with a vigorous  programme
of branch development in the rural sector, bringing about  a
considerable  expansion in deposits, and large	advances  to
the small-scale business and industry.	Mr. Palkhivala urged
that under the scheme of social control the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">584</span>
commercial  banks had achieved impressive results  comparing
favourably  with the performance of the State Bank of  India
and  its  subsidiaries in the public sector,  and  that	 the
performance  of	 the named banks could not be  belittled  by
referring to the banking structure and development in highly
developed  countries  like  Canada,  Japan,  France,  United
States	and  the  United Kingdom.  On the  other  hand,	 the
Attorney-General  said that the commercial banks followed  a
conservative  policy because they had to look- primarily  to
the interests of the shareholders, and on that account could
not  adopt bold policies or schemes for financing the  needy
and  worthy  causes; that if the resources  of	the  banking
industry  are properly utilised for the weaker	sections  of
the  people  economic  regeneration of	the  nation  may  be
speedily  achieved, that 28% of the towns in India were	 not
served	by  commercial banks; that there  had  been  unequal
development of facilities in different parts of the  country
and  deserving sections were deprived of the benefit  of  an
important   national   resource	  resulting   in    economic
disparities,  especially because the major banks catered  to
the large-scale industries. ,
This  Court  is	 not the forum in  which  these	 conflicting
claims may be debated.	Whether there is a genuine need	 for
banking facility in the rural areas, whether certain classes
of  the	 community  are	 deprived  of  the  benefit  of	 the
resources of the banking industry, whether administration by
the  Government	 of the commercial banking sector  will	 not
prove beneficial to the community and will lead to  rigidity
in the administration, whether the Government administration
will eschew the profit-motive, and -even if it be  eschewed,
there  will  accrue  substantial  benefits  to	the  public,
whether	 an  undue accent on banking as a  means  of  social
regeneration,  especially  in  the,  backward  areas,  is  a
doctrinaire approach to a rational order of priorities	-for
attaining   the	  national  objectives	enshrined   in	 our
Constitution,  and  whether  the  policy  followed  by	 the
Government  in	office	or  the	 policy	 propounded  by	 its
opponents may reasonably attain the national objectives	 are
matters	 which	have  little relevance	in  determining	 the
legality of the measure.  It is again not for this Court  to
consider  the  relative merits of  the	different  political
theories  or  economic policies.  The Parliament  has  under
Entry 45 List I the power to legislate in respect of banking
and   other  commercial	 activities  of	 the   named   banks
necessarily   incidental  thereto;  it	has  the  power	  to
legislate  for acquiring the undertaking of the named  banks
under  Entry  42 List III.  Whether by the exercise  of	 the
power vested in the Reserve Bank under the preexisting laws,
results could be achieved which it is the object of the	 Act
to  achieve,.  is. in our judgment, not relevant  in  consi-
dering	whether	 the  Act amounts to  abuse  of	 legislative
power.

<p id="p_156">This Court has the power to strike down a law on the  ground
of  want of authority, but the Court will not sit in  appeal
over  the policy of the Parliament in enacting a  law.	 The
Court  cannot find fault with the Act merely on	 the  ground
that it is inadvisable to take over the undertaking of banks
which, it is said by the petitioner, by thrift and efficient
management  had set up an impressive and efficient  business
organization serving. large sectors of industry.
By<a href="/doc/842227/" id="a_449"> s. 15</a> (2) (e) of the Act the Banks are entitled to engage
in  business other than banking.  But by the  provisions  of
the Act they are rendered practically incapable of  engaging
in any business.  By the provisions of the Act, a named bank
cannot	even use its name, and the compensation which is  to
be given will, in the absence of agreement, be determined by
the  Tribunal and paid in securities which will	 mature	 not
before	ten  years.   A	 named bank  may  if  it  agrees  to
distribute among the shareholders the compensation which  it
may receive, be paid in securities an amount equal to,	half
the  paid-up share capital, but obviously the fund will	 not
be  available to the, Bank.  It is true that under s.  15(3)
of  the	 Act  the  Central  Government	may  authorise	 the
corresponding new banks to make advances to the named  banks
for any of the purposes mentioned in<a href="/doc/852188/" id="a_450"> s. 15(2)</a>.	But that  is
a  matter  which  rests only upon the will  of	the  Central
Government and no right can be founded upon it.
Where  restrictions imposed upon the carrying on of a  busi-
ness  are so stringent that the business cannot in  practice
be  carried on, the Court will regard the imposition of	 the
restrictions as unreasonable.. <a href="/doc/154519/" id="a_451">In Mohammad Yasin v. The Town
Area   Committee,  Jalalabad  and  Another</a>(1)	this   Court
</p><p id="p_157">-observed  that	 under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_452">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> of the  Constitution  a
citizen	 has the right to carry on any occupation, trade  or
business  and  the only restriction on 'this  right  is	 the
authority  of  the  State  to make a  law  relating  to	 the
carrying  on  of  such	occupation,  trade  or	business  as
mentioned  in  cl.  (6) of that Article as  amended  by	 the
Constitution  (First  Amendment)  Act,	1951.  In   Mohammad
Yasin's	 case by the, bye--laws of the Municipal  Committee,
it  was provided that no person shall sell or  purchase	 any
vegetables or fruit within the limits of the municipal	area
of  Jalalabad, wholesale or by auction, without	 paying	 the
prescribed  fee.   It  was urged on behalf  of	a  wholesale
dealer 'in vegetables that although there was no prohibition
against	 carrying on business, in vegetables by anybody,  in
effect	the bye-laws brought about a total stoppage  of	 the
wholesaler's business in a commercial sense, for, he had  to
pay prescribed fee to the contractor, and under the bye-laws
the wholesale dealer could not charge a

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">586</span>
<p id="p_158">higher	 rate  of  commission  than  the  contractor.	 The
wholesale  ,dealer, therefore, could charge the	 growers  of
vegetables  and fruit only the commission permissible  under
the bye-laws, and he had to make over the entire  commission
to  the contractor without retaining any part thereof.	 The
wholesale  dealer  was -thereby converted into a  mere	tax-
collector  for	the contractor or the  Town  Area  Committee
without any remuneration The bye-laws in this situation were
struck down as impairing the freedom to carry on business.
In  Dwarkadas Shrinivas's(1) case the Sholapur Spinning	 and
Weaving	 Company  " (Emergency Provisions) Ordinance  11  of
1950 and Act 28 of 1950 passed by the Parliament to  replace
the  Ordinance	were challenged.  Under	 the  Ordinance	 the
managing agent and the elected directors were dismissed	 and
new directors were appointed by the State.  The Company	 was
denuded of possession of its property and all that was	left
to the Company was a bare legal title.	In an appeal arising
out of a suit challenging the validity of the Ordinance	 and
the  Act  which	 replaced  it,	this  Court  held  that	 the
Ordinance and the Act violated the fundamental rights of the
Company	 and of the plaintiff a preference shareholder	upon
whom  a demand was made for payment of unpaid  calls.	This
Court held that the Ordinance and the Act in effect deprived
the  Company of its property within the meaning of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_453">Art.  31</a>
without compensation.  It was observed by Mahajan, J.,	that
practically  all incidents of ownership were taken  over  by
the State and nothing was left with the Company but the mere
husk of title, and on that account the impugned statute' had
overstepped   the  limits  of  legitimate   social   control
legislation.
</p><p id="p_159">If compensation paid is in a form that it is not immediately

classification	in  making laws.  The  test  of	 permissible

conditions  :  (i)  classification under  the  Act  must  be
founded	  on  an  intelligible	differentia   distinguishing
persons, transactions or things grouped together from others
left  out  of  the group; and (ii)  the	 differentia  has  a
rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the
Act   :	 there	must  be  a  nexus  between  the  basis	  of
classification	and  the object of the Act :  Chiranjit	 Lal
Chowduri's case(1); <a href="/doc/334293/" id="a_456">The State of Bombay v. F. N. Balsara</a>(2);

Kishan	 Dalmia	 v.  Shri  Justice  S.	R.   Tendolkar</a>	 and
Others,(2); and State of Rajasthan v. Mukandchand &amp; Ors.
The Courts recognize in the Legislature some degree of elas-
ticity	in  the matter of making  a  classification  between
persons,    objects   and   transactions.    Provided	 the
classification	is  based on some intelligible	ground,	 the
Courts will not strike down that classification, 'because in
the view of the Court it should have proceeded on some other
ground	or  should have included in the class  selected	 for
special	  treatment   some   other   persons,	objects	  or
transactions which are not included by the Legislature.	 The
Legislature  is free to recognize the degree of harm and  to
restrict  the operation of a law only to those	cases  where
the  need is the clearest.  The Legislature need not  extend
the regulation of a law to all cases it may possibly  reach,
and  may make a classification founded on practical  grounds
of  convenience.  Classification to be valid must,  however,
disclose  a  rational  nexus with the object  sought  to  be
achieved   by  the  law	 which	makes  the   classification.
Validity  of  a classification will be upheld only  if	that
test is independently satisfied.  The Court in examining the
validity of a statute challenged as infringing the  equality
clause	makes  an  assumption that  there  is  a  reasonable
classification	and that the classification has	 a  rational
relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute.
By the definition of "existing bank" in<a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_460"> s. 2(d)</a> of the	Act,
fourteen named banks in the First Schedule are, out of	many

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">588</span>
<p id="p_164">abroad banking business and the Act operates in practice  to
prevent those banks engaging in business other than banking.
By  reason of the transfer of the undertaking of  the  named
banks,	the interests of the banks and the shareholders	 are
vitally affected.  Investment in bank-shares is regarded  in
India,	especially in the shares of larger banks, as a	safe
investment  on	attractive terms with a	 steady	 return	 and
fluidity  of  conversion.  Mr. Palkhivala has  handed  in  a
statement  setting out the percentage return of dividend  on
market-rates in 1968.  The rate works out at more than,	 10%
in  the case of. the shares of Bank of Baroda, Central	Bank
of  India,  Dena Bank, Indian Bank, United Bank	 and  United
Commercial  Bank; and at more than 9% in the case of  shares
of  Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Canara Bank,  Indian
Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and United Bank of India.  In the
case of Allahabad Bank it worked out at 5%, and in the	case
of  shares  of Punjab National Bank and Syndicate  Bank	 the
rates are not available.  This statement is not	 challenged.
Since the taking over of the undertaking, there has resulted
a  steep fall in the ruling market quotations of the  shares
of  a  majority of the named banks.  The  market  quotations
have slumped to less than 50% in the case of Bank of  India,
Central	 Bank, Bank of Baroda and even at the  quoted  rates
probably there are no transactions.  Dividend may no  longer
be distributed, for the banks have no liquid assets and they
are not engaged in any commercial activity. It may take many
years before the compensation payable to the banks may	even
be  finalized,	and  be available to  the  named  banks	 for
utilising  it  in any commercial venture open to  the  banks
under  the  Act.   Under  the  scheme  of  determination  of
compensation, the total amount payable to the banks will  be
a  fraction  of	 the value of their  net  assets,  and	that
compensation will not be available to the banks immediately.
The  ground  for select-ion of the 14 banks  is	 that  those
banks  held deposits, as shown in the return as on the	last
Friday	of June 1969 furnished to the Reserve Bank under <a href="/doc/1076018/" id="a_461"> s.
27</a>  of	the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, of not  less	than
rupees fifty crores.
</p><p id="p_165">The object of Act 22 of 1969 is according to the long  title
to   provide  for  the	acquisition  and  transfer  of	 the
undertakings of certain banking companies in order to  serve
better the needs of development of the economy in conformity
with  the  national policy and objectives  and	for  matters
connected  therewith  or incidental thereto.   The  national
policy may reasonably be taken to be the policy contained in
the  directive principles of State policy, especially  Arts.
38 &amp; 39 of the Constitution.  For achieving the need s of  a
developing economy in conformity with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">589</span>
the  national  policy and objectives, the resources  of	 all
banks  foreign	as well as Indian-are  inadequate.   of	 the
total deposits with commercial banks 27% are with the  State
Bank  of India and its subsidiaries : the  named  commercial
banks	of  which  the	undertaking  is	 taken	 over	hold
approximately 56% of the deposits.  The remaining 17% of the
deposits  are  shared  by the foreign banks  and  the  other
scheduled  and	non-scheduled commercial banks. 83%  of	 the
total  resources  may  obviously not  meet  wholly  or	even
substantially the needs of development of the, economy.
In  support of the plea that there is a reasonable  relation
between	 the differentia-ground for making  the	 distinction
between	 the  named  banks and the other  banks	 Indian	 and
foreign-and  the  object of the Act, it is  urged  that	 the
policy	of  the	 Union is to control  the  concentration  of
private	 economic  resources to ensure	achievement  of	 the
directive principles of State policy, and for that  purpose,
selection  has	been made "with an eye, inter alia,  to	 the
magnitude  and	concentration of the economic  resources  of
such  enterprises  for	inclusion in such law  as  would  be
essential or- substantially conducive to the achievement  of
the  national  objectives  and	policy".  it  is  apparently
claimed that the object of the Government-not of  statute-is
to  acquire ultimately all banking institutions, but the  14
named  banks are selected for acquisition because they	have
"larger	 business  and wider coverage"	in  comparison	with
other banks not selected, and had also larger organization,
better managerial resources and employees better trained and
equipped.   These are primarily grounds	 for  classification
and   not   for	  explaining  the   relation   between	 the
classification	and  the  object of the	 Act.	But  in	 the
absence	 of any reliable data, we do not think it  necessary
to  express an opinion on the question whether selection  of
the  undertaking of some out of many  banking  institutions,
for  compulsory acquisition, is liable to be struck down  as
hostile	 discrimination,  on  the ground that  there  is  no
reasonable  relation between the differentia and the  object
of the Act which cannot be substantially served even by	 the
acquisition  of	 the undertakings of all the  banks  out  of
which the selection is made.
</p><p id="p_166">It is claimed that the depositors with the named banks	have
also a grievance.  Those -depositors who had made  long-term
deposits, taking into account the confidence they had in the
management of the banks and the- service they rendered,	 are
now  called  upon  to trust the management  of	a  statutory
corporation not selected by them, without an opportunity  of
being  placed in the same position in which they would	have
been  if  they	were permitted to  transfer  their  deposits
elsewhere.  The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">590</span>
argument  is  based on several imponderables  and  does	 not
require any detailed consideration.
</p><p id="p_167">But  two other grounds in support of the plea of  impairment
of  the guarantee of equality clause require to be  noticed.
The  fourteen  named banks are prohibited from	carrying  on
banking	 business--a  disability  for  which  there  is	  no
rational explanation.  Banks other than the named banks	 may
carry  on banking business in India and abroad :  new  banks
may  be	 floated for carrying on banking business,  but	 the
named	banks  are  prohibited	from  carrying	on   banking
business.  Each named bank had, even as claimed on behalf of
the  Union,  by	 its  superior	management  established	  an
extensive business organization, and each bank had  deposits
exceeding Rs. 50 crores.  The undertakings of the banks	 are
taken  over  and  they are  prohibited	from  doing  banking
business.  In the affidavit filed on behalf of the Union  no
serious	 attempt  is  made to explain why  the	named  banks
should	be  specially selected for being subjected  to	this
disability.
</p><p id="p_168">The  petitioner	 also contended that the  classification  is
made  on  a  wholly  irrational	 ground,  viz.,	  penalizing
efficiency and good management, for the major fourteen banks
had made a sustained effort an had exceeded the Reserve Bank
target and had fully complied with the directives under	 the
social control legislation.  This, it is said, is a reversal
of  the policy underlying<a href="/doc/258343/" id="a_462"> s. 36AE</a> of the Banking  Regulation
Act  under  which  inefficient and  recalcitrant  banks	 are
contemplated  to be taken over by the Government.   We	need
express	 no opinion on this part of the argument.   But	 the
petitioner is on a firm ground in contending that when after
acquiring  the assets, undertaking,  organization,  goodwill
and  the names of the named Banks they are  prohibited	from
carrying on banking business, whereas other banks-Indian  as
well as foreign-are permitted to carry on banking  business,
a  flagrantly hostile discrimination is practised.   <a href="/doc/852188/" id="a_463">Section
15(2)</a> of the Act which by the clearest implication prohibits
the  named  banks  from carrying  on  banking  business	 is,
therefore,  liable  to	be struck down.	  It  is  immaterial
whether	 the  entire  sub-s.  (2)  is  struck  down,  or  as
suggested  by  the  Attorney-General that  only	 the  'words
"other	than  the  business of banking" in <a href="/doc/852188/" id="a_464"> s.	15(2)(e)</a>  be
struck	down.  Again, in considering the validity of <a href="/doc/842227/" id="a_465"> s.  15</a>
(2) (e) in its relation to the guarantee of freedom to carry
on business other than banking, we have already pointed	 out
that  the  named  banks	 are  also,  (though  theoretically,
competent)  in	substance prohibited from carrying  on	non-
banking	 business.   For reasons set out by us	for  holding
that  the restriction is unreasonable, it must also be	held
that the guarantee of equality is impaired by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">591</span>
preventing the named banks carrying on the non-banking busi-
ness.
</p><p id="p_169">Protection of the guarantee under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_466">Art. 31(2)-</a>
The  guarantee under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_467">Art. 31(2)</a> arises directly out of	-the
restrictions imposed upon the power of the State to  acquire
private	 property,  without the consent of the owner  for  a
public	purpose.  Upon the exercise of the power to  acquire
or  requisition	 property, by cl. 2)  two  restrictions	 are
placed	: (a) power to acquire shall not be  exercised	save
for a public purpose; and (b) that it shall not be exercised
save  by authority of a law which provides for	compensation
for  the property acquired or requisitioned, and  fixes	 the
amount of compensation or specifies the principles on  which
and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined
and   given.   Sub-clause  (2A)	 in  substance	provides   a
definition  of "compulsory acquisition or requisitioning  of
property".  Existence of a public purpose and provision	 for
giving	compensation for compulsory acquisition of  property
of  an	individual  are conditions of the  exercise  of	 the
power.	 If either condition be absent, the guarantee  under
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_468">Art.   31(2)</a>  is  impaired,  and  the  law   providing	 for
acquisition will be invalid.  But jurisdiction of the  Court
to question the law on the ground that compensation provided
thereby is not (adequate is expressly excluded.
In the case before us we need not express any opinion on the
question  whether  a composite undertaking of  two  or	more
distinct lines of business -may be acquired where, there  is
a  public  purpose for acquisition of the assets of  one  or
more lines of business, but not in respect of all the  lines
of  business.	As  we have already observed,  there  is  no
evidence  that	the  named  banks  carried  on	 non-banking
business, distinct from banking business, and in respect  of
such  non-banking -business the banks owned distinct  assets
apart from the assets of the banking business.
The law providing for acquisition must again either fix	 the
amount	of compensation or specify the principles on  which,
and  the  manner  in  which,  the  compensation	 is  to	  be
determined   and  given.   The	owner  whose   Property	  is
compulsorily  acquired is 'guaranteed the right	 to  receive
compensation  and the amount of compensation must either  be
fixed  by  the	law  or	 be  determined	 according  to	 the
principles and in the manner specified by the law.  The	 law
which  does not ensure the guarantee will, except where	 the
grievance  only is that the compensation provide the law  is
inadequate, be declared void.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">592</span>
<p id="p_170">The petitioner says that the expression "compensation" means
a  "just equivalent" in -money of the property acquired	 and
that the law providing for compulsory acquisition must "aim"
at a just equivalent to the expropriated owner : if the	 law
so  aims at, it will not be deemed to impair  the  guarantee
merely	on  the ,ground that the compensation  paid  to	 the
owner is inadequate.  The Attorney-General on the other hand
says that "compensation" in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_469">Art. 31(2)</a> does not mean a	just
equivalent,  and it is not predicated of the validity  of  a
law relating to compulsory ,acquisition that it must aim  at
awarding  a  just  equivalent,	for,  if  the  law  is	 not
confiscatory,  or  the	principles  for	 determination	 ,of
compensation are not irrelevant, "the Courts cannot go 'into
the   propriety	  of   such  principles	  or   adequacy	  or
reasonableness of the compensation".
</p><p id="p_171">Two questions immediately arise for determination.  What  is
the true meaning of the expression "compensation" as used in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_470">Art.  31(2</a>), and what is the extent of the, jurisdiction  of
the  Court  when  the  validity	 of  a	law  providing	 for
compulsory  acquisition of property for a public purpose  is
challenged ?
</p><p id="p_172">In  -its  dictionary meaning "compensation"  means  anything
given  to make things equal in value : anything given as  an
equivalent,  to	 make  amends for loss or  damage.   In	 all
States	where  the  rule  of  law  prevails,  the  right  to
compensation  is guaranteed by the Constitution or  regarded
as inextricably involved in the right to property.
By  the 5th Amendment in the Constitution of the U.S.A.	 the
right  of  eminent  domain  is	expressly  circumscribed  by
providing  "Nor shall private property be taken	 for  public
use, without just, compensation".  Such a provision is to be
found also in every State Constitution in the United  States
: Lewis Eminent Domain, 3rd Edn., (pp. 28-50).	The Japanese
Constitution, 1946, by <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_471">Art. 25</a> provides a similar guarantee.
Under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, 1900,	 the
Commonwealth  Parliament  is  invested	with  the  power  of
acquisition of property on "just terms" : s. 57 (XXXI).
Under the Common Law of England, principles for payment	  of

"So  great  moreover is the regard of the  law	for  private
property, that it will not authorize the least violation  of
it;  no,  not  even  for  the  general	good  of  the  whole
community........  Besides,  the public good is	 in  nothing

the  protection	 of. every individual's private	 rights,  as
modelled  by the municipal law.	 In this and  similar  cases
the  legislature  alone	 can, and  indeed  frequently  does,
interpose, and compel the individual to, acquiesce.  But how
does  it interpose and compel ? Not by absolutely  stripping
the  subject  of his property in an  arbitrary	manner;	 but
giving	him  a full indemnification and equivalent  for	 the
injury thereby sustained The public is now considered as  an
individual,  treating  with an individual for  an  exchange.
All  that  the legislature does, is to oblige the  owner  to
alienate his possession for a reasonable price......."
The  British  Parliament is supreme and its powers  are	 not
subject to any constitutional limitations.  But the  British
Parliament  has rarely, if at all, exercised power  to	take
property  without payment of the cash value of the  property
taken.	In AttorneyGeneral v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel(1) the
House  of  Lords held that the Crown is not entitled  as  of
right  either  by  virtue of its prerogative  or  under	 any
statute,  to  take possession of the land or building  of  a
subject	 for administrative purposes in connection with	 the
defence of the realm, without compensation for their use and
occupation.

In Ranojirao Shinde's case(1) dealing with a case under	 the

was  observed that the compensation referred to in  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_486">Art.  31

But  this Court in <a href="/doc/673450/" id="a_487">State of Gujarat v.	Shantilal  Mangaldas
and   Others</a>(1)	 observed  that	 compensation  payable	 for
compulsory   acquisition   of  property	 is  not,   by	 the
application  of	 any principles, determinable as  a  precise
sum,  and  by calling it a "just" or "fair"  equivalent,  no
definiteness  could be attached thereto; that  valuation  of
lands,	buildings and incorporeal rights has to be  made  on
the application of different principles, e.g. capitalization
of   net   income  at  appropriate   rates,   reinstatement,
determination  of  original value reduced  by  depreciation,
break-up  value	 of  properties	 which	had  outgrown  their
utility;  that the rules relating to determination of  value
of lands, buildings, machinery and other classes of property
differ, and the application of several methods or principles
lead to widely divergent amounts, and since compensation  is
not  capable of precise determination by the application  of
recognized    rules,	by   qualifying	   the	  expression
"compensation"	by the adjective "just",  the  determination
was  made  more	 controversial.	 It was	 observed  that	 the
Parliament amended the Constitution by the Fourth  Amendment
Act  declaring	that adequacy of compensation fixed  by	 the
Legislature as amended according to the principles specified
by   the   Legislature	for  determination   will   not	  be
justiciable.  It was then observed that
"The  right  declared  by  the	Constitute  guarantees	that
compensation shall be given before a person is	compulsorily
expropriated of his property for a public purpose.  What  is
fixed  as compensation by statute, or by the application  of

guaranteed  : it does not mean however that something  fixed

which  is  illusory  or	 can in	 no  sense  be	regarded  as
compensation  must be upheld by the Courts, for, to  do	 so,
would  be to grant a charter of arbitrariness, and permit  a

they  are irrelevant to the determination  of  compensation,
but not on the plea that what is awarded as a result of	 the
application  of	 those	principles  is	not  just  or	fair
compensation.  A challenge to a statute that the  principles
specified  by it do not award a just equivalent will  be  in
clear  violation  of  the  constitutional  declaration	that
inadequacy of compensation provided is not justiciable."
This Court held in Mrs. Bela Banerjee's case(1) that by	 the
guarantee  of  the  right  to  compensation  for  compulsory
acquisition  under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_488">Art. 31(2</a>), before it was amended by	 the
Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, the owner was  entitled
to  receive a "just equivalent" or  "full  indemnification".
In  P.	Vajravelu Mudaliar's case(2) this  Court  held	that
notwthstanding	 the   amendment  of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_489">Art.  31(2)</a>   by	 the
Constitution  (Fourth  Amendment) Act, and  even  after	 the
addition  of the words "and no such law shall be  called  in
question  in any Court on the ground that  the	compensation
provided  by  that  law is  not	 adequate",  the  expression
"compensation"	occuring  in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_490">Art. 31 (2)</a> after	the  Consti-
tution	(Fourth	 Amendment) Act continued to have  the	same
meaning	 as it had in S. 299(2) of the Government  of  India
Act, 1935, and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_491">Art. 31(2)</a> before it was amended, viz.  "just
equivalent" or "full indemnifications.
</p><p id="p_191">There  was apparently no dispute that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_492">Art. 31(2)</a> before	 and
after it was amended guaranteed a right to compensation	 for
compulsory acquisition of property and that by giving to the
owner,	 for   compulsory  acquisition	of   his   property,
compensation  which  was  illusory,  or	 determined  by	 the
application   of  principles  which  were  irrelevant,	 the
constitutional	guarantee of compensation was  not  complied
with.  There was difference of opinion on one matter between
the  decisions	in  P.	Vajravelu  Mudaliar's  case(1)	 and
Shantilal  Mangaldas's case(2).	 In the former case  it	 was
observed  that	the constitutional guarantee  was  satisfied
only  if a just equivalent of the property was given to	 the
owner  : in the latter case it was held that  "compensation"
being  itself  incapable of any	 precise  determination,  no
definite connotation could be attached thereto by calling it
"just equivalent" or "full indemnification", and under	Acts
enacted after the amendment of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_493">Art. 31 (2)</a> it is not open to
the  Court  to	call  in  question  the	 law  providing	 for
compensation  on the ground that it is	inadequate,  whether
the  amount of compensation is fixed by the law or is to  be
determined  according to principles specified  therein.	  It

case(3):

"Whatever  may	have  been the	meaning	 of  the  expression
"compensation"	under the unamended <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_494">Article 31(2</a>), when	 the
Parliament  has expressly enacted under the  amended  clause
that  "no such law shall be called in question in any  court
on the ground that the compensation provided by that law  is
not  adequate", it was intended clearly to exclude from	 the
jurisdiction  of the court an enquiry that what is fixed  or
determined by the application of the principles specified as
compensation  does not award to the owner a just  equivalent
of what he is deprived."
</p><p id="p_194">In  P.	Vajravelu  Mudaliar's case(1)  again  the  Court  in
dealing	 with  the effect of the amendment observed  (at  p.
</p><p id="p_195">627)
"Therefore, a more reasonable interpretation is that neither
the  principles	 prescribing the "just equivalent"  nor	 the
"just  equivalent"  can be questioned by the  court  on	 the
ground	of  the	 inadequacy of	the  compensation  fixed  or
arrived at by the working of the principles.  To  illustrate
: a law is made to acquire a house; its value at the time of
acquisition  has  to  be  fixed; there	are  many  modes  of
valuation, namely, estimate by an engineer, value  reflected
by  comparable	sales, capitalisation of  rent	and  similar
others.	 The application of different principles may lead to
different results.  The adoption of one principle may give a
higher value and the adoption of another principle may	give
a  lesser  value.  But nonetheless they	 are  principles  on
which  and the manner in which compensation  is	 determined.
The  Court  cannot obviously say that the  law	should	have
adopted one principle and not the other, for it relates only
to  the question of adequacy.  On the other hand, if  a	 law
lays down principles which are not relevant to the  property
acquired(  or to the value of the property at or  about	 the
time  it  is  acquired, it may be said	that  they  are	 not
principles contemplated by <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_495">Art. 31 (2)</a> of the Constitution."
The  Court then applied that principle to the facts  of	 the
case  and held that the Land Acquisition (Madras  Amendment)
Act,  1961,  which  provided  that-(i)	the  owner  of	land
acquired for housing shall get only the value of the land at
the  date  of  the notification under<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_496"> s. 4(1)</a>  of  the	Land
Acquisition  Act,  1894,  or an	 amount	 equivalent  to	 the
average market value of the land during the last five  years
immediately  preceding such date, whichever was	 less;	(ii)

<p id="p_198">ty  or adaptability for any use other than the use to  which
the  land was put at the date of the notification  under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_497"> s.
4(1)</a>  of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, shall not be  taken
into  consideration,  did not impair the  right	 to  receive
compensation.  The Court observed at p. 631 :
"In awarding compensation if the potential value of the land
is excluded, it cannot be said that the compensation awarded
is  the just equivalent of what the owner has been  deprived
of.   But such an exclusion only pertains to the  method  of
ascertaining  the  compensation.  One of the  elements	that
should	properly  be  taken  into  account  in	fixing	 the
compensation is omitted : it results in the adequacy of	 the
compensation,  .  .  .	... We,	 therefore,  hold  that	 the
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_498">Amending   Act</a>	 does  not  offend  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_499">Art.  31  (2)</a>   of	 the
Constitution."
</p><p id="p_199">The  compensation provided by the Madras Act,  according  to
the  principles specified, was not the full market value  at
the  date  of  acquisition.   It did  not  amount  to  "full
indemnification"  of the owner : the Court still  held	that
the  law  did not offend the guarantee under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_500">Art.  31(2)</a>  as
amended,  because the objection was only as to the  adequacy
of  compensation.   In Shantilal  Mangaldas's  case(1),	 the
Court  held  that the Constitution (Fourth  Amendment)	Act,
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_501">Art.  31(2)</a> guarantees a right to receive  compensation	 for
loss  of  property compulsorily acquired,  but	compensation
does  not  mean	 a  just equivalent  of	 the  property.	  If
compensation  is  provided  by	law  to	 be  paid  and	 the
compensation  is not illusory or is not determinable by	 the
application of irrelevant principles, the law is not open to
challenge   on	the  ground  that  compensation	  fixed	  or
determined to be paid is inadequate.
</p><p id="p_200">Both the lines of thought which converge in the ultimate re-
sult,  support the view that the principle specified by	 the
law for determination of compensation is beyond the pale  of
challenge,  if	it  is	relevant  to  the  determination  of
compensation and is a recognized principle applicable in the
determination  of  compensation	 for  property	compulsorily
acquired and the principle is appropriate in determining the
value  of the class of property sought to be -acquired.	  On
the  application  of  the view	expressed  in  P.  Vajravelu
Mudaliar's  case(1)  or in Shantilal Mangal's  case("')	 the
Act,  in  our judgment, is liable to be struck	down  as  it
fails  to  provide to the  expropriated	 banks	compensation
determined  according to relevant principles.  <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_502">Section 4</a>  of
the Act transfers the undertaking of every named bank to and
vests  it  in  the corresponding  new  bank.   <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_503">Section	6(1)</a>

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">599</span>
<p id="p_203">tion  is to be determined in accordance with the  principles
specified  in  the  Second  Schedule.	<a href="/doc/392253/" id="a_504">Section	 6(2)</a>	then
provides that though separate valuations are made in respect
of the several matters specified in Sch.  II of the_Act, the
amount	of  compensation  shall be deemed  to  be  a  single
compensation.  Compensation being the equivalent in terms of
money  of the property compulsorily acquired, the  principle
for  determination of compensation is intended to  award  to
the  expropriated owner the value of the property  acquired.
The  science  of valuation of  property	 recognizes  several
principles  or methods for determining the value to be	paid
as  compensation  to the owner for loss of  his	 property  :
there are different methods applicable to different  classes
of property in the determination of the value to be paid  as
recompense  for loss of his property.  A method	 appropriate
to  the determination of value of one class of property	 may
be wholly inappropriate in determining the -value of another
class  of property.  If an appropriate method  or  principle
for determination of compensation is applied, the fact	that
by  the	 application  of another, principle  which  is	also
appropriate,  a different value is reached, the	 Court	will
not be justified in entertaining the contention that out  of
the two appropriate methods, one more generous to the  owner
should have been applied by the Legislature.
We are unable to hold that a principle specified by the Par-
liament	 for determining compensation of the property to  be
acquired  is  conclusive.   If that view  be  accepted,	 the
Parliament will be invested with a charter of  arbitrariness
and  by	 abuse of legislative  process,	 the  constitutional
guarantee  of  the  right to compensation  may	be  severely
impaired.   The principle specified must be  appropriate  to
the  determination of compensation for the particular  class
of  property sought to be acquired.  If	 several  principles
are appropriate and one is selected for determination of the
value  of  the property to be acquired,	 selection  of	that
principle  to the exclusion of other principles is not	open
to  challenge, for the selection must be left to the  wisdom
of the Parliament.
</p><p id="p_204">The broad object underlying the principle of valuation is to
award to the owner, the equivalent of his property with	 its
existing advantages and its potentialities.  Where there  is
an established market for the property acquired, the problem
of valuation presents little difficulty.  Where there is  no
established  market  for  the property, the  object  of	 the
principle of valuation must be to pay to the owner for	what
he has lost, including the benefit of advantages present  as
well  as future, without taking into account the urgency  of
acquisition,  the disinclination of the owner to  part	with
'the property, and the benefit which the acquirer is  likely
to  obtain by the acquisition.	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_505">Under the  Land	 Acquisition
Act</a>s  compensation paid is the value to the  owner  together
with all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">600</span>
its potentialities and its special adaptability if the	land
is peculiarly suitable for a particular use, if it gives  an
enhanced value at the date of acquisition.
The  important methods of determination of compensation	 are
</p><p id="p_205">-(i)  market  value  determined	 from  sales  of  comparable
properties,  proximate in time to the date  of	acquisition,
similarly  situate,  and  possessing  the  same	 or  similar
advantages and subject to the same or similar disadvantages.
Market value is the price the property may fetch in the open
market if sold by a willing seller unaffected by the special
needs of a particular purchase; (ii) capitalization of	the,
net  annual  profit out of the property at a rate  equal  in
normal	cases  to  the return  from  gilt-edged	 securities.
Ordinarily  value  of  the property  may  be  determined  by
capitalizing  the net annual value obtainable in the  market
at  the date of the notice of acquisition; (iii)  where	 the
property  is a house, expenditure likely to be incurred	 for
constructing   a   similar  house,  and	  reduced   by	 the
depreciation   for  the	 number	 of  years  since   it	 was
constructed;  (iv) principle of reinstatement, where  it  is
satisfactorily established that reinstatement in some  other
place  is bona fide intended, there being no general  market
for  the  property for the purpose for which it	 is  devoted
(the  purpose  being  a	 public	 purpose)  and	would	have
continued  to  be devoted, but for  compulsory	acquisition.
Here   compensation  will  be  assessed	 on  the  basis	  of
reasonable cost of reinstatement; (v) when the property	 has
outgrown  its  utility	and it is  reasonably  incapable  of
economic  use,	it may be valued as land plus  the  break-up
value of the structure.	 But the fact that the acquirer does
not  intend to use the property for which it is used at	 the
time of acquisition and desires to demolish it or use it for
other  purpose	is irrelevant; and (vi) the property  to  be
acquired has ordinarily to be valued as a unit.	 Normally an
aggregate  of the value of different components will not  be
the value of the unit.
</p><p id="p_206">These  are,  however, not the only methods.  The  method  of
determining  the value of property by the application of  an
appropriate multiplier to the net annual income or profit is
a satisfactory method of valuation of lands with buildings,'
only  if the land is fully developed, i.e., it has been	 put
to   full   use	  legally   permissible	  and	economically
justifiable,  and  the	income out of the  property  is	 the
normal	commercial and not a controlled return, or a  return
depreciated  on	 account of special circumstances.   It	 the
property  is  not  fully developed, or	the  return  is	 not
commercial the- method may yield a misleading result.
The  expression "property" in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_506">Art. 31(2)</a> as in Entry  42  of
List  II  is wide enough to include an undertaking,  and  an
undertaking  subject  to  obligations  may  be	compulsorily
acquired under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">601</span>
a  law	made in exercise of power under Entry 42  List	III.
The  language of the amended clause (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_507">Art. 31</a>  compared
with the language of the clause before it was amended by the
Constitution  (Fourth  Amendment)  Act leaves  no  room	 for
doubt.	 Before	 it was amended, the guarantee	covered	 the
acquisition of "property movable or immovable including, any
interest  in,  or in any company owning	 any  commercial  or
industrial  undertaking".   In the amended clause  only	 the
word "property" is used, deleting the expressions which	 did
not  add  to its connotation.  But when	 an  undertaking  is
acquired  as  a	 unit the principles  for  determination  of
compensation  must be relevant and also appropriate  to	 the
acquisition  of the entire undertaking.	 In determining	 the
appropriate  rate of the net profits the return	 from  gilt-
edged	securities  may,  unless  it  is   otherwise   found
unsuitable, be adopted.
</p><p id="p_207">     Compensation  to  be determined under the	Act  is	 for
acquisition  of	 the  undertaking, but the  Act	 instead  of
providing  forvaluing  the  entire  undertaking	 as  a	unit
provides  for  determining  the value of some  only  of	 the
components, which constitute the undertaking, and reduced by
the  liabilities.   It also provides  different	 methods  of
determining compensation in respect of each, such component.
This method for determination of compensation is prima facie
not  a method relevant to the determination of	compensation
for acquisition of the undertaking.  Aggregate of the  value
of  components is not necessarily the value of the  entirety
of a unit of property acquired, especially when the property
is,  a going concern, with an organized business.   On	that
ground alone, acquisition of the undertaking is liable to be
declared   invalid,  for  it  impairs	the   constitutional
guarantee  for	payment of compensation for  acquisition  of
property by law.  Even if it be, assumed that the  aggregate
value of the different components will be equal to the value
of the undertaking of the named bank as a going concern	 the
principles  specified, in our judgment, do, not give a	true
recompense  to the banks for the loss of  the  under-taking.
Schedule 11 by cl. (1) provides
	      "The  compensation  . . . in  respect  of	 the
	      acquisition  of the undertaking thereof  shall
	      be  an  amount equal to the sum total  of	 the
	      value of the assets of the existing bank as on
	      the  commencement of this Act,  calculated  in
	      accordance with the provisions of Part 1, less
	      the sum-total of the liabilities computed	 and
	      obligations of the existing bank calculated in
	      accordance with the provisions of Part IT."
For  the  purpose of Part 1 "assets" mean the total  of	 the
heads(a) to (h) and the expression "liabilities" is  defined
as  meaning  the  total amount of  all	outside	 liabilities
existing at the commence-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">602</span>
<p id="p_208">ment  of  the  Act  and	 contingent  liabilities  which	 the
corresponding  new  bank may reasonably be  expected  to  be
required  to  meet out of its own  resources.	Compensation
payable	 to the named banks is accordingly the aggregate  of
some  of the components of the undertaking, reduced  by	 the
aggregate  of liabilities determined in the manner  provided
in  the Schedule.  It appears clear that in determining	 the
compensation  for undertaking-(i) certain important  classes
of  assets are omitted from the heads (a) to (h);  (ii)	 the
method specified for valuation of lands and buildings is not
relevant  to  determination of compensation, and  the  Value
determined  thereby in certain circumstances is illusory  as
compensation;  and (iii) the principle for determination  of
the aggregate value of liabilities is also irrelevant.
    The	 undertaking  of a banking company taken over  as  a
going concern would ordinarily include the goodwill and	 the
value  of  the unexpired period of long-term leases  in	 the
prevailing  conditions in urban areas.	But goodwill of	 the
banks is not one of the items in the assets in the Schedule,
and in cl. (f) though provision is made for including a part
of  the	 premium  paid in respect  of  leasehold  properties
proportionate  to  the	unexpired period, no  value  of	 the
leasehold interest for the unexpired period is given.
    Goodwill  of a business is an intangible asset :  it  is
the whole advantage of the reputation and connections formed
with  the customers together with the  circumstances  making
the  connection durable.  It is that component of the  total
value  of  the	undertaking which  is  attributable  to	 the
ability	 of  the concern lo earn profits over  a  course  of
years  or  in  excess  of  normal  amounts  because  of	 its
reputation, location and other features : Trego v.  Hunt(').
Goodwill  of  an undertaking therefore is the value  of	 the
attraction   to	 customers  arising  from  the	 name,	 and
reputation   for   skill,  integrity,	efficient   business
management, or efficient service.
</p><p id="p_209">    Business  of  banking  thrives  on	its  reputation	 for
probity	 of  its  ,dealings, efficiency of  the	 service  it
provides,  courtesy and promptness of the staff, and  above-
all the confidence it inspires among the customers for	the)
safety	of  the funds entrusted.  The Reserve  Bank,  it  is
true,  exercises  stringent control  over  the	transactions
which  banks carry on in India.	 Existence of  these  powers
and  exercise thereof may and do ensure to a certain  extent
the  safety  of the funds entrusted to the Banks.   But	 the
business  which	 a  bank attracts  still  depends  upon	 the
confidence which the depositor reposes in the management.  A
bank  is  not  like a grocer's shop : a	 customer  does	 not
extend his patronage to a
(1) L.R. [1896] A.C. 7.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">603</span>
<p id="p_210">bank  merely  because it has a branch easily  accessible  to
him.   Outside	the  public  sector,  there  are  50  Indian
</p><p id="p_211">-scheduled banks, 13 foreign banks, beside 16  non-scheduled
banks.	 The deposits in the banks not taken over under	 the
Act range between Rs. 400 crores and a few lakhs of  rupees.
Deposits attracted by the major private commercial banks are
attributable  largely  to  the	personal  goodwill  of	 the
management.   The  regulatory  provisions  of  the   <a href="/doc/444965/" id="a_508">Banking
Companies  Act</a>	and  the  control  which  the  Reserve	Bank
exercises over the banks may to a certain extent reduce	 the
chance	of the resources of the banks being misused,  but  a
banking company for its business still largely depends	upon
the  reputation of its management.  We are unable  to  agree
with  the contention raised in the Union's affidavit that  a
banking	 establishment has no goodwill, not are we  able  to
accept	the  plea raised by the	 Attorney-General  that	 the
value of the goodwill of a bank is insignificant and it	 may
be ignored in valuing the undertaking as a going concern.
   Under cl. (f) of Sch.  II provision is made for valuing a
proportionate  part  of the premium paid in respect  of	 all
leasehold  properties  to  the	unexpired  duration  of	 the
leases,	 but  there  is no provision  made  for	 payment  of
compensation for the unexpired period of the leases.  Having
regard	to the present-day conditions it is clear that	with
rent  control  on  leases operating in	various	 States	 the
unexpired period of lease has also a substantial value.
    The	 value determined by excluding important  components
of  the undertaking, such as the goodwill and value  of	 the
unexpired  period of leases, will not, in our  judgment,  be
compensation for the undertaking.
</p><p id="p_212">    The	 other	defects in the method of valuation,  it	 was
claimed	 by  Mr. Palkhivala, are the  inclusion	 of  certain
assets	such as cash, choses in action and  similar  assets,
which  under  the law are not regarded as capable  of  being
acquired  as  property.	 This inclusion,  it  is  contended,
vitiates  the scheme of acquisition.  Under cl. (a) of	Part
1-Assets-the  amount  of cash in hand and with	the  Reserve
Bank and the State Bank of India (including foreign currency
notes  which  shall  be	 converted at  the  market  rate  of
exchange) are liable to be included.  Cash in hand is not an
item  which is capable of being compulsorily  acquired,	 not
because it is not property, but because taking over the cash
and providing for acquisition thereof, compensation  payable
at  some future date amounts to levying a "forced  loan"  in
the  guise of acquisition.  This Court in <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_509">State of Bihar  v.
Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and Ors</a>.(1)
held  that  cash  and choses in action are  not	 capable  of
compulsory acquisition.	 That
(1) [1952] S.C.R. 889.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">604</span>
<p id="p_213">view was repeated by this Court in Bombay Dyeing &amp;  Manufac-
turing	Cc,.   Ltd.  v. State  of  Bombay(')  and  Ranojirao
Shinde's case(') We do not propose to express our opinion on
the question whether in adopting the method of determination
of  compensation, by aggregating the value of  assets  which
constitute the undertaking, the rule that cash and choses in
action	are  incapable	of  compulsory	acquisition  may  be
applied.
</p><p id="p_214">    Under item (e) the value of any land or buildings is one
of the assets.	The first Explanation provides that for	 the
purpose of this clause (cl. (e) ) "value" shall be deemed to
be the market value of the land or buildings, but where such
market	value exceeds the "ascertained value" determined  in
the  manner specified in Explanation 2, the value  shall  be
deemed to mean such " ascertained value".  The value of	 the
land  and  buildings is therefore the market  value  or	 the
"ascertained value" whichever is less.	Under Explanation 2,
cl.  (1) "ascertained value" in respect of  buildings  which
are  wholly occupied on the date of the commencement of	 the
Act  is	 twelve times the amount of the annual rent  or	 the
rent for which the building may reasonably be expected to be
let  from  year to year reduced by certain  specific  items.
This  provision,  in  our  judgment, does  not	Jay  down  a
relevant  principle  of value of buildings.   In  the  first
place, making a provision for payment of capitalised  annual
rental	at.......... twelve times the amount of rent  cannot
reasonably  be	regarded as payment of	compensation  having
regard	to  the conditions prevailing in the  money  market.
Capitalization	of annual rent which is generally  based  on
controlled  rent under some <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_510">State Act</a>s at rates pegged	down
to  the	 rates prevailing in 1940 and on  the  footing	that
investment  in	buildings yields 8-1/3% return	furnishes  a
wholly	 misleading   result   which   cannot	be    called
compensation.	Value  of immovable property  has  spiralled
during	the  last few years and the rental which  is  mostly
controlled  does  not bear any reasonable  relation  to	 the
economic  return from property.	 If the building  is  partly
occupied  by  the Bank itself and partly by  a	tenant,	 the
ascertained  value  will be twelve times the  annual  rental
received, and the rent for which the remaining part occupied
by  the Bank may reasonably be expected to be let  out.	  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_511">By
the  Act</a>  the  corresponding  new  banks  take	over  vacant
possession of the lands and buildings belonging to the named
banks.	 There	is in the  present  conditions	considerable
value  attached to vacant business premises in urban  areas.
True compensation for vacant premises can be ascertained  by
finding	 out the market value of comparable premises  at  or
about the time of the vesting of the undertaking and not  by
capitalising   the  rental-actual  or	estimated.    Vacant
premises, have a considerably larger value than
(1) [1958] S.C.R. 1122.
</p><p id="p_215">(2) [1968] 3 S.C.R. 489.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">605</span>
<p id="p_216">business  premises which are occupied by tenants.   <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_512">The	 Act</a>
instead' of taking into account the value of the premises as
vacant premises adopted a method which cannot be regarded is
relevant.   Prima  facie, this would not give  any  reliable
basis  for  determining the compensation for  the  land	 and
buildings..
</p><p id="p_217">    Again in determining the compensation under cl. (e), the
annual rent is reduced by several outgoings and the  balance
is capitalized.	 The first item of deduction is one-sixth of
the  amount thereof on account of maintenance  and  repairs.
Whether	 the building is old or new, whether it requires  or
does not require maintenance or repairs 16-2/3% of the total
amount of rent is liable to be deducted towards	 maintenance
and  repairs.	The vice of items (v) &amp; (vi) of cl.  (1)  of
Explanation  2	is  that they provide for  deduction,  of  a
capital	 charge out of the annual rental which according  to
no rational system of valuing property by capitalization  of
the  rental method is admissible.  Under item (v) where	 the
building  is subject to a mortgage or other capital  charge,
the amount of interest on such mortgage or charge, and under
item (vi) where the building has been acquired, constructed,
repaired,  renewed or re-constructed with borrowed  capital,
the  amount  of any interest payable on	 such  capital,	 are
liable to be deducted from the annual rental for determining
the  ascertained value.	 These encumbrances are also  liable
to  be	deducted  under the head  "liabilities".   A  simple
illustration  may  suffice to pinpoint the inequity  of	 the
method.	  In  respect of a building owned by a bank  of	 the
value  of  Rs. 10 lakhs and mortgaged for say  Rs.  7,50,000
interest  at  the rate of 8% (which may be regarded  as	 the
current	 commercial rate) would amount to Rs.  60,000.	 The
estimated  annual rental which would ordinarily	 not  exceed
Rs.  60,000  has under cl. (e) to be reduced  in  the  first
instance  by other outgoing.  The assets would show a  minus
figure as value of the building, and on the liabilities side
the  entire amount of mortgage liability would	be  debited.
The  method provided by the Act permits the annual  interest
on  the	 amount	 of the encumbrance to	be  deducted  before
capitalization,	 and the capitalized value is again  reduced
by the amount of the encumbrance.  In effect, a single	debt
is, in determining the compensation debited twice, first, in
computing  the value of assets, and again, in computing	 the
liabilities.
</p><p id="p_218">     We	 are  unable to accept the argument  raised  by	 the
AttorneyGeneral that under the head "liabilities" in Part II
only those mortgages or capital charges in respect of  which
the  amount has fallen due are liable to be included on	 the
liabilities  side.  Under the head "liabilities"  the  total
amount	 of   all  outside  liabilities	 existing   at	 the
commencement  of  the Act, and	all  contingent	 liabilities
which the corresponding new bank may reasonably be expected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">606</span>
to be required to meet out of its own resources on or  after
the  date  of  commencement  of the  Act  will	have  to  be
included.  When even contingent liabilities are included  in
the total amount of all outside liabilities, a mortgage debt
or capital charge must be taken into account in	 determining
the  liabilities  by  which the aggregate of  the  value  of
assets is to be reduced, even if the period of the  mortgage
or  capital charge has not expired.  The liability  under  a
mortgage  or  capital  charge  exists  whether	the   period
stipulated  under  the	deed creating  the  encumbrance	 has
expired or not.
</p><p id="p_219">      Under  cl. (2) of Explanation 2, it. is provided	that
buildings which are partly occupied, the valuation shall  be
made  on  the  basis  of  the  "plinth	area"  occupied	 and
multiplying  it by the proportion which that area  bears  to
the  total  plinth area of the buildings.  The	use  of	 the
expression  "plinth area" appears to be	 unfortunate.	What
was  intended  is "floor area".	 If the	 expression  "plinth
area"  is understood to mean "floor area", no fault  may  be
found  with the principle underlying cl. (2) of	 Explanation
</p><p id="p_220">2.
      Under  cl. (3) of Explanation 2, where there  is	open
land which has no building erected thereon, or which is	 not
appurtenant  to any building, the value is to be  determined
"with reference to the prices at which sales or purchases of
similar or comparable lands have been made during the period
of  three  years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of	 the
commencement  of"  the Act.  Whereas the value of  the	open
land  is to be the market value, the value of the land	with
buildings  to be taken into account is the value  determined
by  the	 method of capitalization of annual rent  or  market
value whichever is less.  The Explanation does not take into
account whether the construction on the land fully  develops
the land, and the rental is economic.
</p><p id="p_221">     We	 are,  therefore,  unable  to  hold  that  item	 (e)
specifies   a  relevant	 principle  for	  determination	  of
compensation  for lands and buildings.	It is  not  disputed
that the major Banks occupy their own buildings in important
towns, and investments in buildings constitute a part of the
assets	of the Bank which cannot be treated  as	 negligible.
By providing a method of valuation of buildings which is not
relevant  the  amount  determined  cannot  be  regarded	  as
compensation.
</p><p id="p_222">We  have already referred to item (f) under which a  propor-
tionate part of the premium paid is liable to be included in
the assets but not the value for the unexpired period of the
leases.	  Item (h) provides for the inclusion of the  market
or realizable value, as may be appropriate, of other  assets
appearing on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">607</span>
the   books  of	 the  bank,  no	 value	being  allowed	 for
capitalized  expenses,	such  as  share-selling	 commission,
organizational	expenses and brokerage, losses incurred	 and
similar other items.
</p><p id="p_223">    Mr.	 Palkhivala urged that certain assets which  do	 not
appear in the books of account still have substantial value,
and  they  are omitted from consideration in  computing	 the
aggregate  of the value of assets.  Counsel said that  every
bank  is permitted to have secret reserve and  those  secret
reserves  may  not  appear in the books of  account  of	 the
banks.	We are unable to accept that contention.  A  banking
company	 is entitled to withhold from the balance-sheet	 its
secret reserve, but there must be some account in respect of
those  secret reserves.	 The expression "books of the  Bank"
may  not be equated with the balancesheets or the  books  of
account only.
</p><p id="p_224">     The   expression	"liabilities"	existing   at	 the
commencement of the Act includes "all debts due or to become
due."  Under the head "liabilities"  contingent	 liabilities
which the corresponding new bank may reasonably be  expected
to be required to meet out of its own resources on or  after
the date of commencement of the Act are to be debited.	 The
clause	 is  badly  drafted.   The  present  value  of	 the
contingent  liabilities at the date of the  acquisition	 and
not  the  total contingent liabilities may on  any  rational
system of accounting be debited against the aggregate  value
of the assets.	For instance, if a banking company is liable
to  pay to its emlpoyees gratuity, the present value of	 the
liability  to  pay gratuity at the date of  the	 acquisition
made  on acturial calculation may alone be debited, and	 not
the total face-value of the liability.
</p><p id="p_225">     The   Attorney-General  contended	that  even  if	 the
goodwill  of a banking company is of substantial value,	 and
inclusion of the goodwill is not provided for, or the  value
of  buildings  and lands is not the market  value,  or	that
there	is  a  departure  from	recognized  principles	 for
determination  of compensation, the deficiencies in the	 Act
result merely in inadequate compensation within the  meaning
of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_513">Art.  31(2)</a> of the Constitution and the Act	 cannot	 on,
that  account  be challenged as invalid.  We are  unable  to
agree  with that contention.  The Constitution guarantees  a
right to compensation-an equivalent in money of the property
compulsorily  acquired.	 That is the basic  guarantee.	 The
law must therefore provide compensation, and for determining
compensation relevant principles must be specified : if	 the
principles are not relevant the ultimate value determined is
not compensation.
</p><p id="p_226">     The   Attorney-General  also  contended  'that  if	  in
consequence  of the adoption of the method of valuation,  an
amount determined
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">608</span>
as  compensation  is  not  illusory,  the  Courts  have	  no
jurisdiction to question the validity of the law, unless the
law  is	 expropriatory, for, in the  ultimate  analysis	 the
grievance  relates  to	the adequacy  of  compensation.	  He
contended  that	 the  exclusion of one of  the	elements  in
fixing the compensation, or application of a principle which
is not a recognized principle, results in inadequate  price,
and is not open to challenge, and relied in support upon the
observations made in P. Vajravelu Mudaliar's case('), (at p.
</p><p id="p_227">631),  which  we have already quoted in another	 context  in
relation  to  the  challenge to the  validity  of  the	Land
Acquisition (Madras Amendment) Act, 1961, which excluded  in
determining  compensation, the potential value of the  land.
The Court held that exclusion of potential value amounted to
giving inadequate compensation and was not a fraud on power.
The principle of that case has no application when valuation
of  a  undertaking is sought, to be made by breaking  it  up
into  several  heads  of assets, and  important	 -heads	 are
excluded and others valued by the application of  irrelevant
principles,  or	 principles  of which  the  only  claim	 for
acceptance  is their novelty.  The  Constitution  guarantees
that  the expropriated owner must be given the value of	 his
property,   i.e.,  what	 may  be  regarded   reasonably	  as
compensation  for  loss	 of  the  property  and	 that	such
compensation  should not be illusory and not reached by	 the
application   of  irrelevant  principles.   In	 our   view,
determination of compensation to be paid fox the acquisition
of an undertaking as a unit after awarding compensation	 for
some items which go to make up the undertaking and  omitting
important items amounts to adopting an irrelevant  principle
in  the determination of the value of the  undertaking,	 and
does not furnish compensation to the expropriated owner.
</p><p id="p_228">     The Attorney-General contended that the total value  of
the undertaking of the named banks even calculated according
to the method provided in Sch.	II exceeded the total market
value of the shares, and on that account there is no  ground
for  holding that the law providing for compensation  denies
to   the  shareholders	the  guarantee	of  the	  right	  to
compensation under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_514">Art. 31(2).</a>	But there is no evidence  on
this part of the case.
</p><p id="p_229">     Compensation may be provided under a statute, otherwise
than in the form of money : it may be given as equivalent of
money, i.e. a bond.  But in judging whether the law provides
for   compensation,   the  money  value	 at  the   date	  of
expropriation  of  what is given as  compensation,  must  be
considered.   If  the  rate of interest	 compared  with	 the
ruling	commercial rate is low, it will reduce	the  present
value  of the bond.  The Constitution guarantees a right  to
compensation-an equivalent of the property
(1) [1965] 1 S.C.R 614.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">609</span>
<p id="p_230">expropriated  and  the	right  to  compensation	 cannot	  be
converted  into a loan on terms which do not fairly  compare
with  the  prevailing commercial terms.	 If the	 statute  in
providing  for compensation devises a scheme for payment  of
compensation  by  giving it in the form of  bonds,  and	 the
present	 value of what is determined to be given is  thereby
substantially reduced, the statute impairs the guarantee  of
compensation.
</p><p id="p_231">A  scheme for payment of compensation may take	many  forms.
If   the   present  value  of  what  is	  given	  reasonably
approximates to what is determined as compensation according
to  the principles provided by the statute, no fault may  be
found.	 But  if the law seeks to convert  the	compensation
determined  into a forced loan, or to give  compensation  in
the form of a bond of which the market value at the date  of
expropriation does not approximate the amount determined  as
compensation, the Court must consider whether what is  given
is in truth compensation which is inadequate, or that it  is
not compensation at all.  Since we are of the view that	 the
scheme	in Sch. 11 of the Act suffers from the vice that  it
does  not  award compensation according	 to  any  recognized
principles, we need not dilate upon this matter further.  We
need  only observe that by giving to the expropriated  owner
compensation  in  bonds	 of the face-,value  of	 the  amount
determined maturing -after many years and carrying a certain
rate  of  interest,  the  constitutional  guarantee  is	 not
necessarily complied with.  If the market value of the bonds
is   not   approximately  equal	 to  the   face-value,	 the
expropriated owner may raise a grievance that the  guarantee
under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_515">Art. 31(2)</a> is impaired.
</p><p id="p_232">    We	are  of	 the view that by  the	method	adopted	 for
valuation of the undertaking, important items of assets have
been  excluded, and principles some of which are  irrelevant
and some not recognised are adopted.  What is determined  by
the adoption of the method adopted in Sch. 11 does not award
to   the  named	 banks	compensation  for  loss	  of   their
undertaking.  The ultimate result substantially impairs	 the
guarantee  of compensation, and on that account the  Act  is
liable to be struck down.

acquisition  and  transfer of the  undertakings	 of  certain
banking	 companies  in order to serve better  the  needs  of
development  of	 the  economy in  conformity  with  national
policy and objectives and for matters connected therewith or

present matter to refer to the same.
</p><p id="p_249">     Broadly  stated,  as  a  result of	 the  1969  Act	 the
undertaking  of every existing bank was transferred  to	 and

corresponding  new  banks mean the banks  mentioned  in	 the
First  Schedule	 to  the 1969 Act in  which  is	 vested	 the
undertakings  of the existing banks.  <a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_536">Section 5</a> of the	1969
Act   deals  with  the	effect	of  vesting.	First,	 the

all other rights and interests arising out of such  property
as  were immediately before the commencement of the  Act  in
the; ownership, possession, power or control of the existing
banks  in  relation to the under'taking, whether  within  or

Secondly,  the undertaking shall also be deemed	 to  include
all    borrowings,   liabilities    (including	  contingent
liabilities)   and   obligations  of  whatever	 kind	then
subsisting   of	 the  existing	bank  in  relation  to	 the

themselves  are not effective to transfer or vest any  asset
or  liability situated in that country which forms  part  of
the  undertaking  of  an  existing  bank  to,  or  in,	 the
corresponding new bank, the affairs of the existing bank  in

all contracts, deeds, bonds, agreements, powers of attorney,
grants	of  legal representation and  other  instruments  of
whatever  nature,  subsisting or having	 effect	 immediately
before	the  commencement of the 1969 Act and to  which	 the

provisions that suits, appeals, or other proceedings pending

of  the Central Bank of India Ltd. and of 3  other  existing

The  petitioner	 has  challenged the validity  of  the	1969
Ordinance  and	the  1969 Act and  has	contended  that	 his
fundamental  rights under Articles 14, 19 and 31  have	been
infringed by these measures.
</p><p id="p_252">     Mr.  Palkhivala, counsel for the petitioner,  contended
that the Act of 1969 was effective only from 9 August, 1.969
and could not have any effect on or from 19 July, 1969 until
9 August, 1969 because there could not be any  retrospective
effect given to any piece of legislation which affected	 the
fundamental  right  to	property.   It	was  said  that	 the
validation would be effective as from the date when the	 law
was  actually  passed  and any	retrospective  effect  would
offend <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_547">Article 31(2)</a> of the Constitution.  It was said	that
acquisition  under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_548">Article 31(2)</a> could only be by  authority
of  law and authority of law could only mean a law in  force
at  the date of the taking.  It was emphasised that the	 law
must  be in existence at the material time and there was  no
difference  between  a law under <a href="/doc/1501707/" id="a_549">Article 20(1)</a>	and  law  in
relation   to  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_550">Article	31(1)</a>  or  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_551">Article  31(2)</a>   of	 the

forefront  in appreciating the soundness of the	 proposition
that retrospective legislation as to acquisition of property
does not violate <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_563">Article 31(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_257">     In the case of M/s.  West Ramnad Electric	Distribution
Company(1)  the	 1954  Madras  Act  incorporated  the	main
provisions  of the earlier Madras Act of 1949 in  validating
actions taken under the earlier 1949 Act.  The 1949 Act	 had
been challenged in earlier proceedings when this Court	held
the  1949  Act to be ultra vires.  <a href="/doc/79726/" id="a_564">Section 24</a>  of  the	1954
Madras	Act  was  intended to  validate	 a  notification  of
acquisition  of	 undertaking issued on	21  September,	1951
under the, 1949 Act by providing that orders made, decisions
or  directions given, notifications, issued, if	 they  would
have  been validly made under the 1949 Act were declared  to
have been validly made except the extent to which the  order
was  repugnant to the provisions of the later 1954 Act.	  In
the Madras case it was contended that the notification under
the  1949  Act	in the year 1951 was not  supported  by	 any
authority or any pre-existing law because there was no valid
law.  That contention was repelled by Gajendragadkar, J. who
spoke  for  the	 Court,	 "<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_565">If the  Act</a>  is  retrospective  in
operation and <a href="/doc/79726/" id="a_566">section 24</a> has been enacted for the purpose of
retrospectively	  validating   actions	 taken	 under	 the
provisions  of the earlier Act, it must follow by  the	very
retrospective  operation of the relevant provisions that  at
the  time when the impugned notification was  issued,  these
provisions were in existence.  That is the plain and obvious
effect	of  the	 retrospective	operation  of  the  statute.
Therefore  in  considering whether <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_567">Article  31(1)</a>  has	been
complied  with	or  not,  we must  assume  that	 before	 the
notification was issued, the relevant provisions of the	 Act
were  in existence and so, <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_568">Article 3 1 (1)</a> must be  held  to
have been complied with in that sense".
</p><p id="p_258">     <a href="/doc/1501707/" id="a_569">Article  20(1)</a>  cannot  by	 its  own  terms  have	 any
retrospective  operation whereas <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_570">Article 31(2)</a> can and	that
is  a vital distinction between the two Articles.   That  is
why there cannot be a retrospective legislation with  regard
to  creation  of an offence.  If people at the time  of	 the
commission  of an act did not know that it was	an'  offence
retrospective creation of a new offence in regard to such an
act would put people to new peril which was not in existence
at  the time of the commission of the act.  Counsel for	 the

with  section 5 of the Punjab Alienation Act which  provided
for   the  avoidance  of  benami  transactions	as   therein
specified which were entered into either before or after the
commencement of the Act of 1938 held that the same was ultra
vires the Provincial Legislature because it would operate as
a   prohibition	 to  affect  the  past	transactions.	 The
retrospective  element however was severed in that  case  by
the deletion of the words "either before or" in the  section
and  the  rest	of  the	 provisions  were  left	 to  operate
prospectively  and  validly.  The ratio of the	decision  is
that past transactions which had been closed and title which
had  been acquired were sought to be reopened or  set  aside
and the same could not be within the legislative  competence
of  section 298 of the Government of India Act,	 1935  which
conferred  power  to  prohibit	the  sale  or  mortgage	  of
transactions.	The  words 'prohibit sale  or  mortgage'  in
section	 298  of  the Government of  India  Act,  1935	were

relation  to validation of certain acquisition of lands	 and

that  all acquisition, proceedings, notifications or  orders

Act validated all past actions notwithstanding any breach of

<p id="p_263"><a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_577">Validating  Act</a>	 removes altogether from  consideration	 any
implication  arising from Chapter III or <a href="/doc/447410/" id="a_578">section 52</a>  of	 the

passed".   The	correct legal position on the  authority  of
these  decisions of this Court is that a  legislation  which
has   retrospective   effect   affecting   acquisition	  or
requisition  of	 property  is not  unconstitutional  and  is
valid.	<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_579">The Act</a> of 1969 which is retrospective in  operation
does  not  violate  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_580">Article  31(2)</a>  because  it	 speaks	  of
authority  of  a  law without any  words  of  limitation  or
restriction as to law being in force at the time.
    Counsel  for  the  petitioner next	contended  that	 the
expression "authority of a law" in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_581">Article 31(2)</a> would	have
the  same  meaning as the expression "authority of  law"  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_582">Article	 31(1)</a> and therefore a law acquiring property  would
have  to satisfy the tests required in <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_583">Article	19(1)(f)</a>  of
the Constitution.  Both <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_584">Article 31(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_585">19(1)(f)</a> relate to
property.  Both appear in Part III of the Constitution under
fundamental  rights.   The Attorney General  contended	that
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_586">Article	 31(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_587">31(2A)</a> constituted a self contained	code
relating  to  acquisition and requisition of  property,	 and
once  a	 property had been acquired by a law  in  compliance
with  the requirements of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_588">Article 31(2)</a> there would  not  be
any  right left under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_589">Article 19(1)(f)</a> and the	validity  of
such  a	 law of acquisition of property for  public  purpose
could  not be examined again by the requirements of  <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_590">Article
19(5)</a> which is a relaxation of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_591">Article 19(1)(f).</a>
    The two requirements of a law relating to acquisition or
requisition  of	 property under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_592">Article 31(2)</a> are  :  first,
that the acquisition or requisition of property can' be made
only  for a public purpose, and secondly, it can only be  by
authority of a law which provides for compensation.  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_593">Article
31(2A)</a> further enacts that where a law does not provide	 for
the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of	 any
property  to  the  State  or  to  a  corporation  owned	  or
controlled  by the State, it shall not be deemed to  provide
for   the  compulsory  acquisition  or	 requisitioning	  of
property.

consideration  in  the	case of A. K. Gopalan  v.  State  of

Constitution  had  no  application to a	 law  which  related
directly to preventive detention even though as a result  of

<p id="p_266">Fazl  Ali,  J. however expressed a  contrary  opinion.	 The
consensus of opinion in Gopalan's case(') was that so far as
substantive   law   was	 concerned,  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_598">Article   22</a>   of	 the
Constitution  gave a clear authority to the  legislature  to
take   away  fundamental  rights  relating  to	arrest	 and
detention  which  were secured by the first two	 clauses  of
that Article.  Mukherjea, J. said about preventive detention
in  relation to right of freedom under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_599">Article	19.</a>   ','Any
legislation on the subject would only have to conform to the
requirements  of  clauses (4) to (7) and  provided  that  is
done,  there is nothing in the language employed nor in	 the
context	 in  which it appears which affords any	 ground	 for
suggestion that such law must be reasonable in its character
and that it would be reviewable by the Court on that ground.
Both  Articles	19  and 22 occur in the	 same  Part  of	 the
Constitution  and  both	 of them support  to  lay  down	 the
fundamental rights which the Constitution guarantees.  It is
well settled that the Constitution must be interpreted in  a
broad and liberal manner giving effect to all its parts	 and
the presumption would be that no conflict or repugnance	 was
intended by its framers".
</p><p id="p_267">    I shall now deal with some decisions of this Court as to
whether	 a law acquiring property under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_600">Article	 31(2)</a>	will
have  to comply with <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_601">Article 19 (1) (f )</a> or in	other  words
whether	 such  law  of acquisition of  property	 for  public
purpose must also according to <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_602">Article 19(5)</a> be a reasonable
restriction  on the right to hold property in the  interests
of the general public.	There are decisions of this Court to
the effect that acquisition of property under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_603">Article  31(2)</a>
as  it	stood prior to amendment in 1955 is an	instance  of
deprivation  of property mentioned in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_604">Article 31(1)</a> and	 the
two  clauses of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_605">Article 31</a> are to be read together with	 the
result that <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_606">Article 19(1)(f)</a> has no application where a	 law
amounts	 to  acquisition or requisition of  property  for  a
public purpose under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_607">Article 31(2).</a>  When <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_608">Article 31(2)</a>	 was
amended by the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act, 1955,	 the
decisions  of this Court on that Article held  that  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_609">Article

<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_610">Article	 31(1)</a> but not to a law of acquisition	of  property

having	been  imposed  on the right  of	 the  respondent  to

780 of the Report "It is enough to say that <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_618">Article 19(1)(f)</a>
read  with clause (5) postulates the existence	of  property
which can be enjoyed and over which rights can be  exercised
because	 otherwise the reasonable restrictions	contemplated
by  clause (5) could not be brought into play.	If there  is
no  property which can be acquired, held or disposed of,  no
restriction  can be placed on the exercise of the, right  to
acquire,   hold	 or  dispose  of  it,  and  as	clause	 (5)
contemplates  the placing of reasonable restrictions on	 the
exercise  of  those  rights  it	 must  follow  that  Article
postulates the existence of property over which these rights
can be exercised".  Bose, J. thereafter said that when every
form of enjoyment of and interest in property is taken	away

question  arose whether the Madras Marumakkathayam  (Removal

Constitution.	<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_621">The Act</a> was passed after the  Privy  Council

of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_629">Article 31</a> prior to the Amendment in 1955 were to be read
as an instance of deprivation of property within the meaning

<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_631">Article	 19.</a>   This is how the decision	 in  Bhanji  Munji's

with  the observation that "the decision in  Bhanji  Munji's
case(')	 no  longer holds the held  after  the	Constitution
Fourth	Amendment  Act, 1955".	It may be stated  here	that
Kochuni's case(') was decided after the amendment of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_632">Article

Sitabati's case(') was decided on 1 December, 1961 though it
was  reported much later in the Supreme Court  Reports.	  In
Smt.  Sitabati's case(') the question for consideration	 was
the  validity  of  the West  Bengal  Land  (Requisition	 and
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_639">Acquisition)  Act</a>, 1948.  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_640">The Act</a> provided  for	 requisition

the community and for other purposes mentioned therein.	 <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_641">The
Act</a> also provided for payment of compensation in respect  of

it was contended that the Act offended <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_642">Article 19(1) (f )</a> of
the Constitution as it put unreasonable restrictions on	 the
right  to hold property.  The High Court held that  the	 Act

that the High Court was right on both these points.  Sarkar,
J. pointed out that Kochuni's case(') dealt with <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_646">Article  31
(1)</a>  and it was not a case of acquisition or requisition  of
property  by  the State but was concerned with	the  law  by
which  deprivation  of property was brought about  in  other
ways  and  there <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_647">Article 19</a> of the Constitution	 had  to  be
complied with.	In Smt.	 Sitabati's case(') it was said that
the  observation  in Kochuni's case(') that  Bhanji  Munji's
case(') "no longer holds the field" was to be understood  as
meaning	 that it no longer governed the case of	 deprivation
of property by means other than requisition and	 acquisition
by  the State.	To my mind it appears that the view of	this
Court  in Kochuni's case(') and Smt.  Sitabati's case(')  is
that  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_648">Article 31(2)</a> after the Constitution Fourth  Amendment
Act. 1955 relates entirely to acquisition or requisition  of
property by the State and is totally distinct from the scope

valid law, i.e. it must be within the legislative competence

providing  for compensation for the property so acquired  or

<p id="p_286">right  to hold or dispose of property within the meaning  of

Devi's	 case(')  an  owner  of	 land  whose  property	 was
requisitioned  under the West Bengal Land  (Requisition	 and
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_660">Acquisition) Act</a>, 1948 questioned the validity of the Act by
a  writ petition filed in the High Court of Calcutta on	 the
plea that it offended <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_661">Article 19(1)(f)</a> of the  Constitution.
This  Court  unanimously held that the validity of  the	 Act
relating to acquisition and requisition cannot be questioned
on  the ground that it offended <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_662">Article 19(1)(f)</a> and  cannot
be decided by the criterion under <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_663">Article 19(5)".</a>
    In	my  opinion  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_664">Article  19(1)(f)</a>	does  not  have	 any
application to acquisition or  requisition of property for a
public	purpose under authority of a law which provides	 for
compensation  as  mentioned  in	 <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_665">Article  31(2)</a>	 for   these
reasons.   First, the provisions of the Constitution are  to
be interpreted in a harmonious manner.	No provision of	 the
Constitution	is    superfluous   or	  redundant.	(See
Gopalan'scase(2) at page 252 per Mukherjea,J.). It cannot be
suggested that acquisition of property for public purpose is
not  of the same content as acquisition for public  interest
or  in the interest of the public.  It will be	pedantry  to
say  that  acquisition	for public purpose  is	not  in	 the
interest of the public.	 Secondly, the contention on  behalf
of  the petitioner that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_666">Article.31(2)</a> will have to  be	read
along with <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_667">Article 19(1)(f)</a> for the purpose of deciding	 the
piece  of  legislation	on the anvil  of  reasonableness  of
restrictions in the interest of the general public will mean
that  acquisition or requisition for a public purpose  under
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_668">Article	 31  (2)</a> is embraced within <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_669">Article  19	 (5).</a>	That
would	be  not	 only  depriving  the  provisions   of	 the
Constitution of harmony but also making <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_670">Article 31(2)</a> otiose
and  a	dead  letter.  By harmonising  is  meant  that	each
provision  is rendered free to ,operate with full vigour  in
its own legitimate field.  If acquisition or requisition  of
property for a public purpose has to satisfy again the	test
of  reasonable	restriction in the interest of	the  general
public then harmony is repelled and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_671">Article 31(2)</a> becomes  a
mere repetition and meaningless.  It could not be said	that
when  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_672">Article 31(2)</a> was specifically enacted to deal with  a
case of acquisition or requisition of property for a  public
purpose the framers of the Constitution were not aware	that
it  was a form of public deprivation of property.   That  is
why  it	 is  important to  notice  the	distinction  between
deprivation  of	 property under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_673">Article 3 1 (1)</a>	 which	will
relate	to all kinds of deprivation of property	 other	than
acquisition  or requisition by the State and  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_674">Article  31(2)</a>
which  deals  only with such acquisition or  requisition  of
property.   Thirdly,  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_675">Article  31(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_676">31(2A)</a>	 is  a	self
contained  code because (a) it provides for  acquisition  or
requisition with authority

public purpose, (c) the law should provide for	compensation
by  fixing  the	 amount of compensation	 or  specifying	 the
principles   on	 which,	 and  the  manner  in	which,	 the
compensation is to be determined and given and (d)  finally,
it  enacts  that  adequacy  of compensation  is	 not  to  be
questioned.   In the case of acquisition or  requisition  of
property  for  public purpose with the authority  of  a	 law
providing  for compensation there is nothing more  to  guide
and govern the law for acquisition or requisition than those
crucial words occurring in clause (2).	Finally, the  amend-
ment of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_677">Article 31</a> indicates in bold relief the separate and
distinctive field of law for acquisition and requisition  by
the State of property for public purpose.

Darbhanga</a>(1)  spoke of public purpose in the  background  of
<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_679">Article	 39</a>  which  speaks  of	the  Directive	 Principles.
<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_680">Article 39</a> enacts that the State shall in particular  direct
its  policy towards securing that the ownership and  control
of   the  material  resources  of  the	community   are	  so
distributed  as	 best to subserve common good and  that	 the
operation  of  the economic system does not  result  in	 the
concentration of wealth and means of production to the	com-
mon  detriment.	 In the Darbhanga case(') land which was  in
the hands of few individuals was to be made available to the
public.	 The purpose behind the Bihar Land Reform Act was to
bring  general benefit to the community.  Mahajan,  J.	said
that "legislature is the best judge of what is good for	 the
community, by whose suffrage it comes into existence and  it
is  not	 possible for this Court to say that  there  was  no
purpose behind the acquisition contemplated by the  impugned
statute.   The purpose of the statute is in accordance	with
the letter of the Constitution of India, It is fallacious to
contend that the object of the Act is to ruin 5 1/2  million
people	in  Bihar........  It is difficult to  hold  in	 the
present	 day  conditions  of the  world	 that  the  measures
adopted	 for the welfare of the community and sought  to  be
achieved by process of legislation so far as to carry on the
policy of nationalization of land can fall on the ground  of
public	purpose.   The	phrase "public purpose"	 has  to  be
construed  according  to the spirit of the  times  in  which
particular  legislation is enacted and so  constructed,	 the
acquisition of the estates has to be held to have been	made
for public purpose".  The meaning of the phrase 'public pur-
pose'  is  predominantly a purpose for the  welfare  of	 the
general public.	 These 14 banks are acquired for the purpose
of  developing	the  national economy.	It  is	intended  to
confer	benefit on weaker sections and sectors.	 It  is	 not
that  the legislation win have; the effect of  denuding	 the
depositors in the 14 banks of their deposits.  The

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">624</span>
<p id="p_290">deposits will all be there.  The object of the Act according
to  the legislation is to use the deposits in  wider  public
interest.   What  was  true  of	 public	 purpose  when	 the
Constitution  was  ushered in the mid-century is  a  greater
truth  after  two decades.  One cannot be guided  either  by
passion	 for property on the one hand or  prejudice  against
deprivation  on the other.  Public purpose steers  clear  of
both passion and prejudice.
</p><p id="p_291">   In  regard  to property rights the  State  generally	 has
power to take away property and justify such deprivation  on
the ground of reasonable restriction in the interest of	 the
general	 public, but in case of deprivation of	property  by
acquisition  or requisition the Constitution  has  conferred
power  when  the law passed provides  compensation  for	 the
property  acquired by the State.  Therefore the	 acquisition
or   requisition  for  public  purpose	is   a	 restriction
recognised by the Constitution in regard to property rights.

Harries,  C.J. in the case of <a href="/doc/736329/" id="a_681">Iswari Prosad v. N. R.Sen</a>	 (2)
that  the  phrase 'in the interest of  the  general  public'

public	 and  therefore	 the  Welfare  State  is  given	  of

</p><p id="p_292">    Counsel  for  the  petitioner contended  that  the	word
'banking'  would have the same meaning as the definition  of
'banking'   occurring  in  <a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_682">section  5(b)</a>  of   the   Banking
Regulation Act of 1949 hereinafter referred to for the	sake
of  brevity as the 1949 Act.  This contention was  amplified
to exclude four types of business from the banking  business
and therefore, the Act of 1969 was said to be not within the
legislative competence of banking under Entry 45 in List  1.
These  four  types of business are : (1)  the  receiving  of
scrips or other valuables on deposit or for safe custody and
providing  of safe deposit vaults, (2) agency business,	 (3)
business of. guarantee, giving of indemnity and underwriting
and  (4)  business  of acting  as  executors  and  trustees.
'Banking' was defined for the first time in the 1949 Act  as
meaning	 the  acceptance  for  the  purpose  of	 lending  or
investments  of deposits of money from the public  repayable
on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft  or
otherwise.   In England there is no statutory definition  of
banking but the Courts have evolved a meaning and  principle
as to what the legitimate business of a bank is.

sub-section.  15 of the British North America  Act,  namely,
'banking,  incorporation  of Banks, and the issue  of  paper

comprehends  an expression which is, wide enough to  embrace
every transaction coming within the legitimate business of a
banker.	  In Palmer's Company Precedents, 17th Ed. page	 317
form No. 98 will be found the usual memorandum of object  of
a  bank.  These objects comprise business of banking in	 all
branches including the receiving. of money and valuables  on
deposit	 or for safe custody, or otherwise,  the  collecting
and  transmitting money and securities and  transacting	 all
kinds  of  agency business commonly transacted	by  bankers.
The  other objects in the form are to undertake and  execute
any  trusts the undertaking whereof may seem desirable,	 and
also  to  undertake the office of  executor,  administrator,
receiver,  treasurer, registrar or auditor.  In	 Banbury  v.
Bank  of  Montreal(')  the House  of  Lords  considered	 the
authority  of the bank to give advice as to investments	 and
Lord Finday, L.C. said that "the limits of banker's business
cannot	be  laid  down as a matter of law.   The  nature  of
business  is  a	 question of fact, on  which  the  jury	 are
entitled  to have-regard to thier own knowledge of  business

sidered.  It cannot be treated as if it was a matter of Pure
law".

purpose	 of lending or investment of deposits of money	from

withdrawable by cheque, draft order or otherwise.  <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_698">Section 6</a>
of the 1949 Act contains two sub-sections.  In	.sub-section
(1)  it	 is  enacted that in addition  to  the	business  of
banking, a banking company may engage in one or more of	 the
forms  of businesses mentioned therein.	 In sub-section	 (1)
there are clauses marked (a) to (o).  In sub-section (2)  of
<a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_699">section	 6</a>  of the 1949 Act it is encated  that	 no  banking

referred to in sub-section (1).	 Clause (a) of <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_700">section	6(1)</a>
enumerates  the various forms of business, inter  alia,	 the
borrowing,  raising  or taking up of money, the	 lending  or
advancing  of  money either upon or  without  security,	 the
drawing,  making,  accepting, discounting,  buying,  selling
collecting  and	 dealing  in bills  of	exchange,  hoondees,

the  carrying  on  of agency  business	of  any	 description
including  the clearing and forwarding of goods,  giving  of

therefore,  appear that under <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_701">section 6(1)</a> of the  1949	 Act
the  four  types  of business disputed by  counsel  for	 the
petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">627</span>
not to be within the businesses of a bank are recognised  by
the  statute  as letigimate forms of business of  a  banking
company.
</p><p id="p_299">     Keeping  valuables for safe custody, the  providing  of
safe  deposit  vaults occur in clause (a)  of  <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_702">section	6(1)</a>
along with various types of business like borrowing, raising
or taking up of money, or lending or advancing of money.  It
will appear from clause (n) of <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_703">section 6(1)</a> of the 1949	 Act
that  in  addition  to the forms of  business  mentioned  in
clauses	 (a) to (in) a banking company may engage in  "doing
all such other things as are incidental or conducive to	 the
promotion  or advancement of the business of  the  company".
The  words  'other  things' appearing in  clause  (n)  after
enumeration of the various types of business in clauses	 (a)
to  (m)	 point	to  one	 inescapable  conclusion  that	 the
businesses  mentioned  in  clauses  (a)	 to  (in)  are	 all
incidental  or conducive to the promotion or advancement  of
the business of the company.  Therefore these businesses are
not  only legitimate businesses of the banks but these	also
come  within  the normal business activities  of  commercial
banks of repute.  Entry 45 in List 1 of the 7th Schedule  of
the Constitution, namely, 'banking' will therefore have	 the
wide  meaning  to  include all legitimate  businesses  of  a
banking	 company referred to in <a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_704">section 5(b)</a> as well  as  in
<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_705">section	 6(1)</a> of the 1949 Act.	The contention on behalf  of
the  petitioner	 that the four disputed businesses  are	 not
banking businesses is not supportable either on logic or  on
principle  when businesses mentioned in the  sub-clauses  of
<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_706">section 6(1)</a> of the 1949 Act are recognised to be legitimate
business  activities  of a banking company  by	statute	 and
practice and usage fully supports that view.
    Clause (o) of <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_707">section 6</a> (1) of the 1949 Act contemplates
that  .the Central Government might by notification  specify
any  other  form of business and  therefore  the  Government
could ask a banking company to engage' in a form of business
which  is  not a usual type of business done  by  a  banking
company.  In the first place, it would not be reasonable  to
think that the Government would ask a bank to do business of
that  type.   Secondly, even if a bank were asked to  do  so
that  would  not. rob the other permissible  and  legitimate
forms  of business mentioned in <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_708">section 6(1)</a> of the  Act  of
their true character.  <a href="/doc/392253/" id="a_709">Section 6(2)</a> of the 1949 Act provides
that no banking company shall engage in any form of business
other  titan  those  referred to in  sub-section  (1).	 The
restriction  contained in sub-section (2)  establishes	that
the  various types of business mentioned in sub-section	 (1)
are  normal recognised legitimate businesses and  a  banking
company	 is  therefore not entitled to	participate  in	 any
other form of business.

<p id="p_300">    In	the case of Commonwealth of Australia and others  v.
Bank  of  New  South  Wales  and  others('),  the   Judicial
Committee  in  hearing	the appeal from the  High  Court  of
Australia  considered  the meaning and content	of  banking.
The  question  for  consideration  was	the  effect  of	 the
Australian  Banking  Act, 1947 and <a href="/doc/1747434/" id="a_710">section 46</a>  thereof.	  At
page  303  of the Report the Judicial  Committee  said	"the
business of banking, Consisting of the creation and transfer
of credit, the making of loans, the purchase and disposal of
investments  and other kindred activities is a part  of	 the
trade, commerce and intercourse of a modern society and.  in
so  far	 as  it	 is  carried  on  by  means  of	 inter-State
transactions,  is  within  the ambit of	 <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_711">section  92</a>".	 The
business  of a bank will therefore consist not only  of	 the
hard  core of banking business defined in the 1949  Act	 but
also  of  the diverse kinds of lawful  business	 which	have
grown  to be inextricably bound up in the form of  chain  or
string	transactions.	The words  'banker'  'banking'	have
different shades of meaning at different periods of  history
and  their meaning may not be uniform today in countries  of
different   habits   of	 life  and  different	degrees	  of
civilisation.  See Bank of Chettinad v. T. C. of  Colombo(2)
and United Dominions Trust Ltd. v. Kirkwood(3).

starting  from Act 6 of 1839 Bank of Bengal's Third  Charter
and  ending with the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_712">State Bank of India Act</a>, 1955  to	show
the meaning and content of the word 'banking'.	The Bank  of
Bengal's Third Charter of 1839 empowered the Bank of  Bengal
in  clauses  25 to 33 to do business  as  mentioned  therein
which included receiving deposits of goods and safe  keeping
of  the	 same.	Thereafter the Bank of	Bengal	Charter	 was
repealed  by Act 4 of 1862 which by clause 27 empowered	 the
bank to transact pecuniary business of agency on commission.
The  Presidency	 Banks	Act,  1876  by	<a href="/doc/389896/" id="a_713">section	 36</a>  thereof
empowered  the Presidency Banks. inter alia, to do  business

    <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_716">The	 Indian Companies Act</a>, 1913 did not  define  banking
company or banking business though various sections, namely,
4,  133,  136, 138 and 145 and Schedule Form G	referred  to
banking	 companies.  <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_717">The Indian Companies Amendment  Act</a>  in
1936 for the first time defined a banking company in <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_718">section
277F</a> as a company which carried on the principal business of
accepting  of  deposits	 on current  account  or  otherwise,
notwithstanding	 that it engaged in any one or more  of	 the
businesses as mentioned in clauses (1) to (17) thereof.	  It
may be stated here that clauses (1) to (17) in <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_719">section	277F</a>
of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 are similar to the various
forms  of  business mentioned in <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_720">section 6(1)</a>  of  the	1949
<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_721">Banking Regulation Act</a>.	 In 1942, the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_722">Indian Companies	Act</a>,
1913  was amended by Act 21 of 1942 and it will appear	from
the  statement	of  objects  and  reasons  there  that	 the
definition  of	banking	 companies in <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_723">section  277F</a>  of	 the
Indian	Companies  Act	created	 difficulties  in   deciding
whether	 a company was a banking company or not.  The  chief
difficulty  arose  out	of the use of  the  term  'principal
business'  in  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_724">section 277F</a>.  With the	object	of  removing
these  difficulties  a proposal was made  that	any  company
which used as part of its name the word 'bank', 'banker'  or
'banking'   shall  be  deemed  to  be  a   banking   company
irrespective  of whether the business of accepting  deposits
of  money  on  current	account	 or  otherwise	subject	  to
withdrawal  by	cheque,	 draft or order	 was  its  principal
business  or not.  In that context Ordinance No. 4  of	1946
was promulgated under section 72 of the Govt. of India	Act,
1935 empowering the Reserve Bank to cause inspection of	 any
banking	 company  and to do various other things by  way  of
prohibiting  a	banking	 company  from	receiving  deposits.
Thereafter   came  the	Banking	 Companies  Restriction	  of
Branches Act, 1946.  There a banking company was defined  as
a banking company defined in section 277F of the Indian Com-
panies	Act,  1913.  There was restriction  on	opening	 and
removal	 of branches and the Reserve Bank was  permitted  to
cause  inspection,  of banks.  It is in	 this  context	that
Ordinance No. 25 of 1948 was promulgated conferring power on
the  Reserve Bank to control advances given by	the  banking
companies.   In	 1948  a confidential note  on	the  banking
companies  Bill was prepared.  The necessity of	 legislation
was felt because there were insufficient paid up capital and
reserve	 and insufficient liquidity of	funds,	unrestricted
loans  to directors.  In that confidential note it was	said
that it was difficult to evolve any satisfactory  definition
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">630</span>
banking and difficulties arose because of the  incorporation
of  the, words 'Principal business' in relation to banks  in
<a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_725">section 277F</a> of the Indian Companies Act, 1913.
    In this background the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_726">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949	 was
enacted.   I  have  already referred to	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1223029/" id="a_727">sections  5</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_728">6</a>  of the  1949  Act	and  the  businesses
mentioned  in  <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_729">section 6(1)</a> and the  definition	 of  banking
business  in <a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_730">section 5(b)</a>.  A most noticeable  feature	with
regard	to all these types of business of a banking  company
is  that- a banking company engages not only in the  banking
business but other businesses mentioned in <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_731">section 6</a> of	 the
1949 Act with depositors' money.  The entire business is one
integrated whole.  The provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_732">section 6</a> (1)
of the 1949 Act are the statutory restatement of the gradual
evolution over a century of the various kinds of business of
banking companies which are similar to those to be found  in
the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_733">State  Bank of India Act</a>, 1955 hereinafter	 called	 the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_734">State  Bank  Act</a>.  The business with regard' to	 deposit  of
valuables and safe deposit vaults is to be found in  <a href="/doc/1221360/" id="a_735">section
3(viii)</a>	 of  the  State Bank Act,  the	agency	business  is
mentioned  in  <a href="/doc/1108218/" id="a_736">section 33(xii)</a> of the State Bank  Act.	 The
business  of guarantee, underwriting and indemnity is  found
in  <a href="/doc/1108218/" id="a_737">section  33(xi)(xii)(a)</a> of the State Bank  Act  and	 the
business  of  trusteeship and executorship  is	specifically
found  in  the	<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_738">Banking	 Regulation Act</a>,  1949	and  in	 the
previous Acts referred to hereinbefore.
</p><p id="p_305">    It	was suggested by counsel for the petitioner that  by
banking	 business is meant only the hard core of banking  as
defined in <a href="/doc/1920038/" id="a_739">section 5(b)</a> of the 1949 Act.  It is	 unthinkable
that  the business of banks is only confined to that  aspect
and  not  to  the various forms	 of  business  mentioned  in
<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_740">section	 6(1)</a>  of  the 1949  Act.   Receiving  valuables  on
deposit	 or for safe custody and providing for safe  deposit
vaults which are contemplated in clause (a) of <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_741">section	6(1)</a>
of  the 1949 Act cannot be dissociated from other  forms  of
unchallenged  business	of a bank mentioned in	that  clause
because	 any such severance would be illogical	particularly
when  deposit for safe custody and safe deposit	 vaults	 are
mentioned in the long catalogue of businesses in clause (a).
The  agency  business which is mentioned in  clause  (b)  of
<a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_742">section	 6(1)</a> is one of the recognised forms of business  of
commercial banks with regard to mercantile transactions	 and
payment	 or  collection	 of price.  Agency is  after  all  a
comprehensive	word   to  describe  the   relationship	  of
appointment of the bank as the constituent's representative.
The  forms of agency transactions may be varied.- It may  be
acting	as  collecting	agent  or  disbursing  agent  or  as
depository  of	parties.  The categories of  agency  can  be
multiplied  in	terms  of transactions.	  That	is  why	 the
business  of agency mentioned in clause (b) is first in	 the
general form of acting as an agent for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">631</span>
any  Government or local authority, secondly carrying on  of
agency	business of any description including  the  clearing
and  forwarding of goods and thirdly acting as	attorney  on
behalf	of the customers.  The business of guarantee  is  in
the   modern   commercial  word	  practically	indissolubly
connected  with a bank and forms a part of the	business  of
the bank.  It is almost commonplace for Courts to insist  on
bank  guarantee in regard to furnishing of security.   There
may  be so many instances of guarantee.	 As to the  business
of trusteeship and executorship it may be said that this  is
the  wish of the settler who happens to be a constituent  of
the bank appointing the bank as executor or trustee  because
of the utmost faith and confidence that the constituent	 has
in  the	 solvency  and stability of the	 bank  and  also  to
preserve  the  continuity  of the trustee  or  the  executor
irrespective  of any change by reason of death or any  other
incapacity.   It  is  needless	to  state  that	 these	four
disputed  forms of business all spring out of  the  relation
between	 the  bank on the one hand and the customer  on	 the
other and the bank earns commission on these transactions or
charges	 fees  for the services	 rendered.   Although  trust
accounts  may  be  kept in a  separate	account	 all  moneys
arising out of the trust money go to the general pool of the
bank  and the bank utilises the money and very	often  trust
moneys	may be kept in fixed deposit with the  trustee	bank
and  expenses  on account of the trust are met	out  of	 the
general	  funds	  of   the  trustee   bank.    Payments	  to
beneficiaries  are  made  by  crediting	 the  beneficiaries'
accounts   in  the  trustee  bank  and	if  they   are	 not
constituents other modes of payment through other banks	 are
adopted.   The position of the banks as executor is  similar
to  that of a trustee.	Whatever moneys the bank  may  spent
are  recouped by the bank out of the accounts of  the  trust
estate.
</p><p id="p_306">     After  the	 definition  of	 banking  company  had	been
introduced  for	 the  first  time  in  1936  in	 the  <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_743">Indian
Companies  Act</a>,	 1913 it appeared that the  banks  were	 not
being  managed	proprely  and the definition  of  a  banking
company	  gave	rise  to  administrative   difficulties	  in
determining whether a company was as banking company or not.
A  number  of  banking and loan	 companies  particularly  in
Bengal	claimed that they were not banking companies  within
the  scope  of the definition given in <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_744">section 277F</a>  of	 the
companies Act and in some cases their contention was  upheld
by  the	 Court.	 The failure of the  Travancore	 National  &amp;
Quilon	Bank Ltd. in 1938 and the subsequent banking  crisis
in  South India posed a big question as to the	desirability
of  better  legislation.  An attempt was made  to  prescribe
certain	 minimum  capital, the amount of  capital  depending
upon the area of them operation of the bank.  The banks were
also asked to maintain a percentage of their assets in	cash
or approved securities, Thereafter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">632</span>
the  <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_745">Indian Companies (Amendment) Act</a> was passed in 1942  by
which  a proviso I was added to <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_746">section 277F</a>. to the  effect
that  ;any ,company which used as part of its name the	word
'bank',	 'banker'  or  'banking' shall be  deemed  to  be  a
banking company notwithstanding the fact that the acceptance
of  deposits  on current account subject  to  withdrawal  by
cheque is not the principal business of the company.  In the
mid-forties  it became desirable that steps should be  taken
to   safeguard	the  banking  structure	  against   possible
repercussion  in the post war period and it  was  considered
necessary  that comprehensive banking legislation should  be
introduced.
</p><p id="p_307">    There are various provisions in the 1949 Act to indicate
that  a	 banking  company  cannot carry	 on  business  of  a
managing agent ,or Secretary and treasurer of a company	 and
that  it  cannot  acquire, construct,  maintain,  alter	 any
building  or works other than those necessary or  convenient
for  the purpose of the company.  A banking  company  cannot
acquire	 or  undertake	the  whole or  any  portion  of	 any
business unless such business is of one of these  enumerated
in  <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_747">section  6(1)</a> of the 1949 Act.  A bank  cannot  deal  in
buying or selling or bartering of goods except in connection
with  certain  purposes related to some	 of  the  businesses
enumerated in the aforesaid <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_748">section 6(1)</a>.  These  provisions
also establish that businesses mentioned in <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_749">section 6</a> of the
1949  Act are incidental and conducive to banking  business.
A bank cannot employ any person whose remuneration is in the
form  of  a  commission or a share in  the  profits  of	 the
banking	 company or whose remuneration is in the opinion  of
the  Reserve  Bank  excessive.	One of	the  most  important
provisions in <a href="/doc/222598/" id="a_750">section 35</a> of 1949 Act, which states that	 the
Reserve Bank at any time may and on being directed so to  do
by the Central Government cause an inspection to be made  by
one  or more of its officers of the books of account and  to
report	to the Central Government on any inspection and	 the
Central	 Government  thereafter if it is  of  opinion  after
considering  the  report  that the affairs  of	the  banking
company	 are  being  conducted	to  the	 detriment  of	 the
interests  of  its  depositors,	 may  prohibit	the  banking
,company from receiving fresh deposits or direct the Reserve
Bank  to  apply under <a href="/doc/896401/" id="a_751">section 38</a> of the winding	 up  of	 the
banking	 company.  Another important provision in  the	1949
Act  is	 found	in <a href="/doc/1076018/" id="a_752">section 27</a>  which  provides	for  monthly
returns in the prescribed form and manner showing assets and
liabilities.   The power of the Reserve Bank under  <a href="/doc/1076018/" id="a_753">sections
27</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/222598/" id="a_754">35</a> of the 1949 Act relates to the  affairs  of	 the
banking	 company  which	 comprehend  the  various  forms  of
business  of  the bank mentioned in sectiotn 6 of  the	1949
Act.   Then  again <a href="/doc/34973/" id="a_755">section 29</a> of the 1949  Act	contemplates
accounts relating to accounts of all business transacted  by
the  bank.  Section -35-A of the 1949 Act confers  power  on
the Reserve Bank to give
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">633</span>
directions  with  regard to the affairs of  a  bank.   These
provisions  indicate  beyond any measure of doubt  that	 all
forms of business mentioned in <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_756">section 6(1)</a> of the 1949	 Act
are  lawful, legitimate businesses of a bank as	 these	have
grown  along with increase of trade and commerce.  The	word
'banking'  has	never had any static meaning  and  the	only
meaning	 will  be the common understanding of  men  and	 the
established  practice in relation to banking.  That  is	 why
all  these  disputed  forms  of	 business  come	 within	 the
legitimate business of a bank.
</p><p id="p_308">     The  next	question is the	 legislative  competence  in
regard	to  the	 Act of 1969.  Counsol	for  the  petitioner
contended that the Act was for nationalisation of banks	 and
there was no legislative entry regarding nationalisation and
therefore  that was incompetent.  There is no merit in	that
contention.   <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_757">The  Act</a> is for acquisition of  property;	 the
undertaking   of  a  banking  company  is   acquired.	 The
legislative competence is under Entry 42 in List III of	 the
7th  Schedule and also under Entry 45 in List 1 of  the	 7th
Schedule.    Entry  42	in  List  III  is  acquisition	 and
requisitioning	 of  property.	 Entry	45  in	List  1	  is
'banking'.  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_758">The Act</a> of 1969 is valid under these entries.  A
question arose whether the Act. of 1969 pertains to Entry 43
in  List  1 which deals with incorporation,  regulation	 and
winding	 up of trading corporations including banks.  It  is
not  necessary	to  deal  with	that  entry  because  of  my
conclusion  as to enrties No. 42 in List III and No.  45  in
List 1. Counsel for the petitioner contended that the Act of
1969  trenched upon Entry 26 in List 11, namely,  trade	 and
commerce  within  the  State.  I am unable  to	accept	that
contention  for the obvious reason that the  legislation  is
for  acquisition of undertakings of banking companies.	 The
pith and substance of the legislation is to be found out and
meaning	 is  to	 be  given  to	the  entries  'banking'	 and
acquisition of property.  In the case of United Provinces v.
Mst.   Atiqa  Begum and others(1) Gwyer, C.J. said  that  it
would  be practically impossible to define each item in	 the
provincial  legislation	 as to make it	exclusive  of  every
other  item in that list and Parliament seems to  have	been
content to take a number of comprehensive categories and  to
describe each of them by a word of broad and general import.
The  doctrine of pith and substance used in  Union  Colliery
Company	  of  British  Columbia	 when  the  legislation	  is
referable to one or more entries the Courts try to find	 out
what  the pith and substance of the legislation is.  In	 the
present case the Act is beyond any doubt one for acquisition
of  property  and  is  also in	relation  to  banking.	 The
legislation
(1) [1940] F.C.R. 110.
</p><p id="p_309">(2) [1899] A. C. 580.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">634</span>
<p id="p_310">is  valid  with reference to the entries, namely,  Entry  42
(Requisition) in List 111, Entry 45 (Banking) in List 1.
    Counsel for the petitioner contended that undertaking of
banking	 companies  could  not	be  the	 subject  matter  of
acquisition  and  acquisition  of  all	properties  in	 the
undertaking  must satisfy public purpose as contemplated  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_759">Article	 31(2).</a>	 This contention was amplified to mean	that
undertaking  was not property capable of being acquired	 and
some assets like cash money could not be the subject  matter
of  acquisition.   The Attorney General on  the	 other	hand
contended  first  that undertaking is  property	 within	 the
meaning	 of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_760">Article  31(2</a>), secondly,	undertaking  in	 its
normal meaning refers to a going concern and thirdly it is a
complete unit as distinct from the ingredients composing  it
and  therefore it could not be said that acquisition of	 the
undertaking   was  an  infraction  of	any   constitutional
provision.    The   term  ,undertaking'	 is   explained	  in
Halsbury's  Laws of England, 3rd Ed. Vol. 6 paragraph 75  at
page 43 to mean not the various ingredients which go to make
up  an	undertaking but the completed work  from  which	 the
earnings  arise.   As an illustration reference is  made  to
mortgage of the undertaking of a company.
</p><p id="p_311">    In	Gardner v. London Chatham and Dover  Railway  Co.(')
the  undertaking of a railway company which was pledged	 was
held to be a railway which was to be made and maintained, by
which  tolls and profits were to be earned, which was to  be
worked and managed by a company, according to certain  rules
of  management, and under a certain responsibility.   In  an
undertaking  there  will  be money for the  working  of	 the
undertaking and money will be earned thereby.  Again in	 Re:
Panama,	 New Zealand and Australian Royal Mail	Company	 the
undertaking  of	 a steamship company was explained  to	have
reference not only to all the property of the company  which
existed at the date of the debenture but which might  become
the,  property	of  the company and further  that  the	word
'undertaking'  referred	 to the application of	funds  which
came  into the hands of the company in the usual  course  of
business.   Undertaking will therefore relate to the  entire
business although there may be separate ingredients or items
of work or assets in the undertaking.  The undertaking is  a
going  concern	and it cannot be broken up  into  pieces  to
create a security over the undertaking. (See Re : Portsmouth
(Kingston,  Fratton and Southsea) Tramway Co.(') and  H.  H.
Vivian and Company Ltd. (3).

that the company whether it has a plant or whether it has an

each  existing bank shall be deemed to include	all  assets,
rights, powers, authorities and privileges and all property,

investments  and all other rights and interests arising	 out
of such property as were immediately before the commencement
of  this Act in the ownership, possession, power or  control
of  the existing bank in relation to the undertaking.	This
Court accepted the meaning of property given by Rich, J.  in
the  Minister for State for the Army v. Dalziel(2) to  be  a
bundle of rights which the owner has over or in respect of a
thing,	tangible or intangible, or the word  'property'	 may
mean the thing itself over or in respect of which the  owner
may  exercise those rights.  In the case  of  <a href="/doc/1430396/" id="a_785">Commissioner,,
Hindu  Religious  Endowments,  Madras  v.  Sri	 Lakshmindra
Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt</a>("), this Court again gave

that  there is no reason why the word 'property' as used  in

liberal	 and wide connotation and would not be	extended  to

insignia  or characteristics of proprietary Tight.   In	 the
case  of J. K. Trust, Bombay M. The Commissioner  of  Income
Tax  Excess  Profits Tax, Bombay (4 ) this  Court  held	 the
managing agency business to be a property.  The	 undertaking

<p id="p_317">and the totality of undertaking is one concept which is	 not
divisible  into components or ingredients.  That is  why  in
relation  to  a company the word 'undertaking'	is  used  in
various statutes in order to reach every corner of property,
right, title and interest therein.  The decision in <a href="/doc/1963913/" id="a_787">State of
Madhya Pradesh v. Ranojirao Shinde &amp; Anr</a>.(1) is an authority
for  the  proposition that money cannot	 be  acquired  under
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_788">Article	 31(2).</a>	  The  impugned Act  in	 Ranojirao  Shinde's
case(')	 abolished  cash grants which the  respondents	were
entitled  to receive from the Government of Madhya  Pradesh,
but provided for the payment of certain compensation to	 the
grantees.  Ranojirao Shinde's(1) case did not deal with	 the
case  of an undertaking and has therefore no application  to
the  present  case.  The undertaking is an  amalgam  of	 all
ingredients  of	 property  and	is  not	 capable  of   being
dismembered.   That  would destroy the	essence	 and  innate
character of the undertaking.  In reality the undertaking is
a  complete  and  complex  weft and  the  various  types  of
business and assets are threads which cannot be taken  apart
from the weft.	I am, therefore, of opinion that undertaking
of  a  banking corn any is property which  can	be  ,validly
acquired under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_789">Article 31(2)</a> of the Constitution.
    The	 next question for consideration is whether  <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_790">Article
19(6)</a>  of  the Constitution is attracted.  Counsel  for	 the
petitioner  contended that as a result of  the	Constitution
First Amendment Act. 1951 <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_791">Article 19(6)</a> was clarified to the
effect	 that	the  word   'restrictions'   would   include
prohibition  or	 exclusion which was dealt with	 the  second
limb of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_792">Article 19(6).</a>	It may be stated here that prior  to
the amendment of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_793">Article 19(6)</a> the second limb spoke only of
law prescribing qualifications for practising any profession
or  carrying  on any occupation, trade or  business.   As  a
result of the amendment of the second limb of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_794">Article  19(6)</a>
consisted   of	two  sub-articles  the	first	sub-,article
relating  to  qualifications for  practising  profession  or
carrying on any occupation, trade or business and the second
sub-article  relating to carrying on by the State of  trade,
business  industry to the exclusion 'complete or partial  of

enlargement  of clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_795">Article 19</a> as a result of	 the

petitioner  was that the second limb of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_796">Article 19(6)</a>  after

was only an instance of the first limb of the Article.	 The

</p><p id="p_320">   In the case of <a href="/doc/1258563/" id="a_799">Akadasi Padhan v. State of Orissa</a>(')	this
Court considered the Orissa Kendu Leaves (Control of  Trade)
Act, 1961 by which the State acquired monopoly in the  trade
of  Kendu  leaves and put restrict-ions on  the	 fundamental
rights of the petitioner.  In that case, Gajendragadkar,  J.
speaking  for  the  Court referred to the  decision  of	 the
Allahabad  High Court in <a href="/doc/288909/" id="a_800">Motilal v. Government of  State  of
Uttar</a>  pradesh (2)  where a monopoly of transport sought  to
be  created  by the U.P. Government in favour of  the  State
operated  Bus Service known as the'Government Roadways'	 was
struck	down  as unconstitutional because  such	 a  monopoly
totally	 deprived the citizens of their rights and  that  is
why <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_801">Article 19(6)</a> came to be amended.  The necessity of	 the
amendment  of  <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_802">Article 19(6)</a> was explained in  the  case  of
Akadasi	 Padhan(1).   The view expressed by this  Court	 in,
that  case is that the two sub-articles of the	second	limb
deal  with  two different forms of legislation.	  The  first
sub-article  deals with restrictions on the exercise of	 the
right  to practise any profession or to carry on any  trade,
occupation  or business.  The second sub-article deals	with
carrying on by the State of any trade, business or  industry
to  the	 exclusion,  complete  or  partial  of	citizens  or
otherwise.  The effect of the amendment was stated by Gajen-
dragadkar, J. to be that a State monopoly in respect of	 any
trade  or business must be presumed to be reasonable and  in
the interest of the general public so far <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_803">Article  19(1`)(g)</a>
is  concerned'.	 The words 'in particular' in that  case  in
<a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_804">Article	 19(6)</a>	were  held  to	indicate  that	restrictions
imposed	 on  the  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  by	<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_805">Art.
19(1)(g)</a> which are reasonable and which are in the  interest
of  the	 general  public are saved by <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_806">Article  19(6)</a>  as  it
originally  stood and the validity of the. laws	 covered  by
the amendment would no longer be left to be tried in courts.
    Counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of the
House of  Lords in the case of Earl Fitzwilliam's  Wentworth
Estates	 Co.v.Minister of Housing and Local  Government	 and
another(3) in support of the proposition that the words	 'in
particular'  in <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_807">Article 19(6)</a> were used to place the  accent
on  reasonable	restrictions in that clause  as	 the  saving
feature of a law affecting <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_808">Article 19(1)(g).</a>  Section  43(1)
of  the	 Town  and  Country Planning  Act,  1947  which	 was

</p><p id="p_325">    It	was  held that the sub-section	conferred  a  single
power  on the Central Land Board and not two  powers,  viz.,
that the boards have. power to acquire land for the  purpose
connected  with the ,performance of their functions and	 the
words in the second limb ,of the section were no more than a
particular  instance of that which the legislature  regarded
as  part of the Board's functions.  The purpose referred  to
in  the second part of the sub-section there  introduced  by
the words 'in particular' was held to be a purpose connected
with  the performance of the function within the meaning  of
the first part of the sub-section.  The language of the sub-
section	 in the case before the House of Lords	is  entirely
different from the language in <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_809">Article 19(6).</a>  <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_810">Article 19(6)</a>

than banking would be empty and really amount to prohibition
of   carrying  ,on  of	the  business  because	the   assets
pertaining  to the four disputed businesses with  which	 the
business  could be carried on had been taken away.   I	have

businesses  are	 the  legitimate  businesses  of  a  banking
company as mentioned in <a href="/doc/863596/" id="a_817">section 6(1)</a> of the 1949 Act and are

power  on  the	State to have  a  valid	 monopoly  business.
<a href="/doc/852188/" id="a_821">Section	 15(2)</a> of the 1969 Act allows the existing banks  to
carry  on  business other than banking.	 If as a  result  of
acquisition,  the  bank will complain of lack  of  immediate
resources  to  carry on these businesses  the  Act  provides
compensation  and  the existing bank will  devise  ways	 and
means for carrying on the businesses.  Constitutionality  of
the  Act  cannot  be  impeached on the	ground	of  lack  of
immediate  resources to carry on business.  In	the  present
case,  the acquisition is not unconstitutional and the	bank
is  free to carry on all businesses other than banking.	  It
cannot	be  suggested  that.  after  compensation  has	been
provided for the State will have to provide moneys to enable
the existing bank to carry on these businesses.	 That  would
be   asking   for  something  beyond  the  limits   of	 the
Constitution.	If  the	 entire	 undertaking  of  a  banking
company is taken by way of acquisition the assets cannot  be
separated to distinguish those belonging to banking business
from  others  belonging to  "non-banking  business"  because
assets	 are  not  in  fact  divided  on  any  such   basis.
Furthermore   that  would  be  striking	 at  the   root	  of
acquisition of the entire undertaking.	It would be  strange
to  hold  in the teeth of express provisions in the  Act  of
1969  permitting the banks to carry on business	 other	than
banking	 that the same will amount to a prohibition  on	 the
bank  to carry on those businesses.  I find it difficult  to
comprehend  the contention of the petitioner that a  permis-
sive  provision	 allowing  the	banks  to  carry  on   these
businesses other than banking becomes unreasonable.  If that
provision  was not-there the businesses could be carried  on
and the argument would not be available at all.	 The express
making of the provision obviously for greater safety  cannot
change the position.  The petitioner's contention on <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_822">Article
19(6)</a> therefore fails.
</p><p id="p_327">    Counsel for the petitioner contended that <a href="/doc/1724061/" id="a_823">section 11</a>  of
the 1969 Act suffered from the vice of excessive  delegation
and there were no guidelines for reaching the objectives set
out  in	 the  Preamble	of  the	 Act  and  the	decision  of
Government  regarding policy involving public  interest	 was
made final and therefore it was unconstitutional.   Sect-ion
11 of the Act of 1969 is in two subsections.  The first sub-
section	 enacts	 that corresponding new bank shall,  in	 the
discharge of its functions, be guided by such directions  in
regard to matters of policy involving public interest as the
Central Government may, after consultation with the Governor
of  the Reserve Bank, give.  The second	 sub-section  enacts
that if any question arises whether a direction relates to a
matter	of  policy involving public interest,  it  shall  be
referred  to the Central Government and the decision of	 the
Central Government thereon shall be final.  <a href="/doc/1398406/" id="a_824">Section 25(1)(c)</a>

these directions can only be given by the Central Government

contain	  similar  provisions  of  exercise  of	  power	  or

that  where the Government acquires undertakings  of  indus-
tries,	the matters of policy involving public	interest  or
national  interest  should  be left to	be  decided  by	 the
Government.   There  is	 nothing  unconstitutional  in	such
provisions.
</p><p id="p_329">    The	 Preamble to the Act of 1969 states that the  object
of the Act is "to serve better the needs of the	 development
of  the	 economy  in conformity	 with  national	 policy	 and
objectives."   National	  policy  and  objectives   are	  in
accordance  with the Directive Principles in Part IV of	 the
Constitution.	It  is stated by the  respondents  in  their
affidavits  that there are needs of the development  of	 the
economy	 in  conformity with the  Directive  Principles	 and
these are to be achieved by a mobilisation of the savings of
the  community and employing the large resources of  the  14
banks  to  develop national economy in	several	 spheres  of
activity  by  a	 more  equitable  distribution	of  economic
resources, particularly, where there are large credit  gaps.
In  the case of Harishankar Bagla and Anr. v. The  State  of
Madhya	Pradesh('),  Mahajan, C.J. at pages  388-89  of	 the
report	said  "The Preamble and the body,  of  the  sections
sufficiently formulate the legislative policy and the  ambit
and  character of the Act is such that the details  of	that
policy	can  only  be worked out by  delegating	 them  to  a
subordinate authority within the framework of that  policy".
It  is manifest that in working the Act of  1969  directions
from  the  Central  Government are necessary  to  deal	with
policy	and  other matters to serve the	 needs	of  national
economy.
</p><p id="p_330">      Counsel  on  behalf of the petitioner  next  contended

</p><p id="p_332">    Counsel  for the-petitioner contended that the 1969	 Act
violated  the  provisions of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_872">Article 14</a> on these  grounds  :
First,	the  Act discriminated against 14 banks	 as  against
other Indian scheduled banks, secondly, the selection of  14
banks  has  no reasonable connection to the objects  of	 the
Act; thirdly, banks which may be described to be inefficient
and  which are liable to, be acquired under <a href="/doc/258343/" id="a_873">section 36AE</a>  of
the  1949  Act are not acquired whereas 14  banks  who	have
carried	 on  their  affairs with  efficiency  are  acquired;
fourthly under <a href="/doc/842227/" id="a_874">section 15</a> (2) (d) (e) of the 1969 Act the 14
banks  cannot do any banking business whereas  other  Indian
scheduled  banks  or any other new banking  company  can  do
banking business.
</p><p id="p_333">    In other to appreciate these contentions it is necessary
to  remember the background of growth of Indian	 banks.	  At
the beginning I referred to the position that State Bank  of
India  and its several subsidiaries and the 14 banks  occupy
today in contrast with foreign banks and other scheduled  or
non-scheduled  Indian banks.  These 14 banks are not in	 the
same class as other scheduled banks.  The classification  is
on the basis of the 14 banks having deposit of Rs. 50 crores
and  over.  The object of the Act is to control the  deposit
resources  for developing national economy and as  such	 the
selection  of  14  banks  having  regard  to  their   larger
resources,  their  greater coverage, their  managerial	-and
personnel    resources	  and	the    administrative	 and
organisational	 factors  involved  in	expansion  is	both
intelligible and related to the object of the Act.  There is
no  evidence  to show that the 14 banks are  more  efficient
than  the  others as counsel for the  petitioner  contended.
<a href="/doc/842227/" id="a_875">Section 15</a> (2) (d) (e) of the 1969 Act states that these  14
banks  after  acquisition are not to carry  on	any  banking
business for the obvious reason that these 14 banks are	 not
in the same class as the other Indian banks.  Besides, it is
also reasonable that the 14 banks should not be permitted to
carry  on banking business as the corresponding	 new  banks.
Therefore  the	classification of -the' 14 banks is  also  a
rational and intelligible classification for the purposes of
the Act.  The object of the 1969 Act was to meet credit gaps
and to have a wider distribution of economic resources among
the  weaker  sections of the economy,  namely,	agriculture,
small scale industry and retail trade.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">643</span>
<p id="p_334">    <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_876">The	 Act</a> of 1969 is for development of national  economy
with the aid of banks.	There are needs of various  sectors.
The  legislature is the best judge of what  should  subserve
public	 interest.   The  relative  need  is  a	 matter	  of
legislative  judgment.	 The legislature found 14  banks  to
have  special features, namely, large resources	 and  credit
structure  and good administration.  The  categorisation  of
Rs. 50 crores and over vis-a-vis other banks with less	than
Rs.  50 crores is not only intelligible but is also a  sound
classification.	  From the point of view of resources  these
14  banks are better suited than others and therefore  speed
and  efficiency	 which are necessary  for  implementing	 the
objectives of the Act can be ensured by such classification.
    In	the case of <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_877">Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri  Justice
S.  R.	Tendolkar &amp; Others</a>('), it was said  that  the  Court
would  take into consideration the history of the times	 and
could also assume the state of facts existing at the time of
legislation.   A  presumption  also  arises  in	 regard	  to
constitutionality  of -a piece of legislation.	In the	case
of <a href="/doc/695006/" id="a_878">P. V. Sivarajan v. The Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. (2) the <a href="/doc/174313249/" id="a_879">Coir
Industry  Act</a> was considered in relation to registration  of
dealers	 for export.  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_880">The Act</a> provided minimum	quantity  of
export	preceding 12 months the commencement of the  Act  as
one   of  the  qualifying  terms  for  registration.	This
quantitative test was held good.  The legislative policy  as
to the necessity is a matter of legislative judgment and the
Court will not examine the propriety of it.  The legislation
need  not be all embracing and it is for the legislature  to
determine  what	 categories will be embraced.	In  Dalmia's
case(')	 it  was said that the two tests  of  classification
were first that there should be an intelligible	 differentia
which  distinguished persons or things grouped	from  others
left  out and secondly the differentia must have a  rational
relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute.
There  has to. be a line of demarcation somewhere and it  is
reasonable  that  these	 14 banks which are in	a  class  by
themselves  because of their special features in  regard  to
deposit,  credit,  administration,  Organisation  should  be
prohibited from carrying on banking business.  These special
circumstances  are  the reasons	 for  classification.	This
distinction  between  the  14 banks  and  others  reasonably
justified  different treatment.	 An absolute symmetry or  an
accurate  classification is not possible to be	achieved  in
the   task  of	acquisition  of	 undertakings	Of   banking
companies.   It cannot, therefore, be said that companies  -
whose deposits were in the range of Rs. 45 to Rs. 50  crores
should have been taken.

fact  that after the Constitution Fourth Amendment  Act	 the
question  of adequacy of compensation is not justiciable  it
was  said  by  counsel	for the	 petitioner  that  the	only
question for Courts is whether the law aimed at just equiva-

this   Court  in  <a href="/doc/1634289/" id="a_890">Vajravelu  Mudaliar  v.   Special   Deputy
Collector, Madras&amp; Anr</a>. (1) and submitted that the  decision

</p><p id="p_346">     The Attorney General on the other hand contended  first
that after the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_892">Article 3 1
(2)</a>  enacted that no law shall be called in question on	 the
ground	that  the compensation provided by that law  is	 not
adequate  and therefore compensation in that  Article  could
not  mean  just equivalent.  It was also said  that  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_893">Article
31(2)</a>  refers to a law which provides for  compensation	 and
not  to a law which aims at just equivalent.   Secondly,  it
was said that the whole, of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_894">Article 31(2)</a> had to be read and
the meaning of the word 'compensation' in the first limb was
to be understood by reference to the second limb and if	 the
petitioner's arguments were accepted the Constitution  would
read that unless law provided for a just equivalent it shall
be  called  in	question.  It was, therefore,  said  by	 the
Attorney-General that if just equivalent was to be aimed  at
the  second limb of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_895">Article 31(2</a>), namely,  that  inadequacy
would	not   be  questioned  would  become   redunant	 and
meaningless.   If  the	law enjoined that there	 was  to  be
compensation  and  either  principle  for  determination  of
compensation or -amount of compensation was fixed the  Court
could not go into the question of adequacy or reasonableness
of  compensation  and the Court could not also go  into	 the
question of result of -application propriety of principle or
reasonableness of the compensation.
</p><p id="p_347">    In	Vajravelu Mudaliar's case(1) this Court referred  to

that compensation in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_896">Article 31(2)</a> meant just equivalent  or
full  indemnification.	In Vajravelu Mudaliar's	 case(')  it
was  contended	that the Land Acquisition  Madras  Amendment

schemes and laid down principles for compensation  different
from those prescribed in the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_897">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894	 and
thereby <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_898">Article 31-(2)</a> was infringed because the Act did not

<p id="p_350">interpretation it must be assumed that the term was used  in
the sense in which it had been judicially interpreted unless
a  contrary intention appeared.	 That is how  reference	 was
made  to  the  decision of this	 Court	in  Bela  Banerjee's
case(')	  to  emphasise	 that  a  law  for  requisition	  or
acquisition should provide for a just equivalent of what the
owner  has been deprived of.  Subba Rao, J. then dealt	with
the clause excluding the jurisdiction of the Court where the
word  'compensation' was used and said at page 627.  of	 the
Report	"The  argument that the	 word  "compensation"  means
'just equivalent' for the property acquired, and, therefore,
the Court can ascertain whether it is just equivalent or not
makes  the amendment of the Constitution nugatory.  It	will
be  arguing  in	 a circle.   Therefore,	 a  more  reasonable
interpretation	is that neither the  principles	 prescribing
the  "just  equivalent"	 nor the "just	equivalent"  can  be
questioned  by	the  Court on the ground  of  inadequacy  of
compensation  fixed  or	 arrived at by the  working  of	 the
principles".
</p><p id="p_351">     This Court then said that when value of a house at	 the
time  of acquisition had to be fixed there could be  several
methods of valuation, namely, estimate by engineer or  value
reflected by comparable sales or capitalisation of rent	 and
similar	 others	 with the result that the  adoption  of	 one
principle   might  give	 a  higher  value  but	they   would
nevertheless  be  principles  of the  manner  in  which	 the
compensation  has to be determined -and the Court could	 not
say  that the Act should have adopted one principle and	 not
the  other  because  it	 would relate  to  the	question  of
adequacy.  In that case it was said that if a law lays	down
principles  for	 determining  compensation  which  are	 not
relevant  to  the property acquired or to the value  of	 the
property  at  or about the time it is acquired it  might  be
said  that these are not principles contemplated by  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_900">Article
31  (2).</a>  This was illustrated by saying that if a law	says
that  though  a house is acquired it would be valued  as  an
agricultural land or though it is acquired in 1950 its value
in  1930 should be given and though 100 acres  are  acquired
only  50 acres will be paid for, these would not  enter	 the
question or area of adequacy of compensation.  Another	rule
which was laid down in Vajravelu Mudaliar's case(') is	that
the  law may prescribe compensation which is  illusory.	  To
illustrate, a property worth a lakh of rupees might be	paid
for  at the sum of Rs. 100 and the question in that  context
would  not  relate to the adequacy of  compensation  because
there was no compensation at all.
</p><p id="p_352">    Two broad propositions which were laid down in Vajravelu
Mudaliar's  case (2 ) are these.  First, if  principles	 are
not relevant to the property acquired or not relevant to the
value  of the property at or about the time it is  acquired,
these are not relevant principles.

   In  the  case of Shantilal Mangaldas(1) the	Bombay	Town
Planning  Act of 1950 which was repealed by the Bombay	Town

infringement of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_901">Article 31(2)</a> of the Constitution.   Section
53  of the Bombay Act contemplated transfer of ownership  by

was  reconstituted and out of that plot a smaller  area	 was
given  to the owner and the remaining area was utilised	 for
public	purpose	 the area so utilised vested  in  the  local
authority for a public purpose, but the Act did not  provide
for  giving compensation which was a just equivalent of	 the
land expropriated at the date of extinction of interest	 and
therefore <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_902">Article 31(2)</a> was infringed.	It was also  -argued
that  when  the	 final	scheme was framed  in  lieu  of	 the
ownership of the original plot and compensation in money was
determined  in	respect of the land appropriated  to  public
purpose	 such  a scheme for  compensation  violated  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_903">Article

provided  and secondly payment of compensation in money	 was
not  provided in respect of the land appropriated to  public
use.
</p><p id="p_357">     Shah,  J.	speaking  for  the  Court  in  the  case  of
Shantilal Mangaldas(1) said that the decision of this  Court
in  the cases of Bela Banerjee(2) and Subodh  Gopal  Bose(3)
"raised	 more problems than they solved", because the  Court
did not indicate the meaning of just equivalent and "it	 was
easier to state what was not just equivalent than to  define
what  a just equivalent was".  In this state of law  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_904">Article
31</a>  was amended by Constitution Fourth Amendment Act,  1955.
Shah,  J. said first that adequacy of compensation fixed  by
the legislature or awarded according to principles specified
by  the	 legislature is not justiciable and secondly  if  'I
'the amount of compensation is fixed it cannot be challenged
apart  from  a plea of abuse of	 legislative  power  because
otherwise  it  would  be  a challenge  to  the	adequacy  of
compensation.	In  Shantilal Mangaldas's case(')  Shah,  J.
also  said  that  the compensation fixed  or  determined  on
principles specified by the legislature cannot be challenged
on the indefinite plea that it is not a just or fair equiva-
lent.  Shah, J. further said that principles of compensation
could not be challenged on the plea that what was awarded as
a result

<p id="p_360">of the application of those principles was not just or	fair
compensation.
</p><p id="p_361">    If the quantum of compensation fixed by the	 legislature
is  not	 liable to be challenged before the  Court  on-	 the
ground	that  it  is not a just	 equivalent  the  principles
specified for determination of compensation will also not be
open  to  challenge  on	 the  plea  that  the	compensation
determined  by the application of these principles is not  a
just  equivalent.   The right declared by  the	Constitution
guarantees  compensation  before a  person  is	compulsorily
expropriated of the property for public purpose.  Principles
may  be challenged on the ground that they are not  relevant
to  the property acquired or the time of acquisition of	 the
property  but  not on the plea that the principles  are	 not
relevant  to the determination of a fair or just  equivalent
of the property acquired.  A challenge to the statute that a
principle  specified by it does not provide or award a	just
equivalent  will be a clear violation of the  constitutional
declaration that inadequacy of compensation provided for  is
not justiciable.
</p><p id="p_362">    Shah,  J. referred to the decision of this Court in	 the
case  of  <a href="/doc/602096/" id="a_905">Union of India v. The Metal Corporation  of  India
Ltd.  &amp;	 Anr</a>.  (1)  and	 expressed  disagreement  with	 the
following  view	 "pressed in the Metal	Corporation  case(')
"the law to justify itself has to provide a payment of	just
equivalent to the land acquired or lay down principles which
will  lead to that result.  If the principles laid down	 are
relevant  to  the--  fixation of compensation  and  are	 not
arbitrary  the adequacy of the resultant product  cannot  be
questioned  in	the  court  of law.   The  validity  of	 the
principles  judged by the above tests falls within  judicial
scrutiny  and  if they stand the test the  adequacy  of	 the
product falls outside justification".  In Metal	 Corporation
case(') compensation was to be equated to the cost price  in
the  case of unused machinery in good condition and  written
down  value  as understood in income-tax law was to  be	 the
value  of  the	used  machinery and both  were	said  to  be
irrelevant  to the fixation of the value of machinery as  on
the  date of acquisition.  Shah, J. speaking for  the  Court
expressed  inability to agree with the part of the  judgment
and  then said "the Parliament has specified the  principles
for determining compensation of undertaking of the  company.
The  principles	 expressly related to the  determination  of
compensation payable in respect of unused machinery in	good
condition  and	used  machinery.  The  principles  were	 not
irrelevant to the determination of compensation and the com-
pensation  was	not illusory".	If what is  specified  is  a
principle for determination of compensation the challenge to
that principle on the ground that a 'just equivalent is	 not
reached is barred by the plain words of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_906">Article 31(2)</a> of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_363">(1) [1967] 1 S.C.R. 255.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">649</span>
<p id="p_364">    These two decisions have one feature in common,  namely,
that  if compensation is illusory the Court will be able  to
go into it.  By the word 'illusory' is meant something which
is  obvious, patent and shocking.  If for a  property  worth
Rs.  1 lakh compensation is fixed at Rs. 100 that  would  be
illusory.   One	 need not be astute to find out as  to	what
would be -at sight illusory.  Furthermore, illusoriness must
be  in	respect of the whole property and  there  cannot  be
illusoriness as to part in regard to the amount fixed or the
result of application of principles laid down.
    When   principles  are  laid  down	in  a  statute	 for
determination of compensation all that the Court will see is
whether	 those principles are relevant for determination  of
compensation.	The relevancy is to compensation and not  to
adequacy.   I  am  unable to hold  that	 when  the  relevant
principle set out is ascertained value the petitioner  could
yet  contend that market value should be the principle.	  It
would  really  be  going into adequacy	of  compensation  by
preferring  the	 merits of the principle, to  those  of	 the
other  for  the	 oblique  purpose of  arriving	at  what  is
suggested  to  be  just	 equivalent.   To  my  mind  it	  is
unthinkable  that  the legislature  after  the	Constitution
Fourth	Amendment Act intended that the word  'compensation'
would mean just equivalent when the legislature put a bar on
challenge   to	 the   adequacy	  of   compensation.	Just
compensation  cannot  be inadequate and	 anything  which  is
impeached  as  unjust or unfair is  impinging  on  adequacy.
Therefore.  just  equivalent  cannot  be  the  criterion  in
finding	  out  whether	the  principles	 are   relevant	  to
compensation  or  whether  compensation	 is  illusory.	  In
Vajravelu  Mudaliar's case(1) the Court	 noticed  continuous
rise in land price but accepted an average price of 5  years
as a principle.	 An average price over 5 years in the  teeth
of  a  continued  rise	in  price  would  not  aim  at	just
equivalent  according to the petitioner's contention  there.
Again potential value of land which was excluded in the	 Act
in Vajravelu Mudaliar's case(') was said there to pertain to
the  method of ascertaining compensation and  its  exclusion
resulting  in inadequacy of compensation.  I am,  therefore,
of  opinion that if the amount fixed is not  obviously	-and
shockingly  illusory  or  the  principles  are	relevant  to
determination  of compensation, namely, they are  principles
in relation to property acquired or are principles  relevant
to  the	 time  of  acquisition	of  property  there  is	  no
infraction of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_907">Article 31(2)</a> and the owner cannot impeach  it

1 relates to assets and Part 1 relates to liabilities.	 The
compensation  to be paid shall be equal to the sum total  of
the  value  of	assets calculated  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of	Part  1 less the sum  total  of	 liabilities
computed and obligations of existing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">651</span>
banks  calculated in accordance with the provisions of	Part
II. in Part 1 assets are enumerated.
</p><p id="p_372">    Counsel for the petitioner contended that with regard to
assets	either there was no principle or the  principle	 was
irrelevant  or the compensation was illusory or it  was	 not
just equivalent.  As to securities, shares, debentures	Part
1  (c)	explanation (iv) was criticised on the	ground	that
there was no principle because period was not fixed and	 was
left   to   be	 determined  'by   some	  other	  authority.
Explanations  (iv) and (v) to Part 1 (c) will  be  operative
only  when  market  value  of  shares,	debentures  is	 not
considered reasonable by reason of its having been  affected
by   abnormal  factors	or  when  market  value	 of   shares
debentures  is not ascertainable.  In the -former  case	 the
basis of average market value over any reasonable period and
in  the	 latter case the dividend paid during  5  years	 and
other  relevant factors will be considered.  In	 both  cases
principles  have been laid down, namely, how valuation	will
be  made  taking  into account	various	 factors  and  these
principles are relevant to determination of compensation for
the property.
</p><p id="p_373">     Part  1(c) Explanation I was criticised by counsel	 for
the petitioner to be an instance of value being brought down
from 'just equivalent'.	 Part 1(c) Explanation I states that
value  shall  be  deemed  to be	 market	 value	of  land  or
buildings,   but  where	 such  market  value   exceeds	 the
ascertained  values  determined in the manner  specified  in
Explanation  2, it shall be deemed to mean such	 ascertained
value.	This criticism suggests that compensation should  be
just  equivalent meaning thereby that what is given  is	 not
just  and,  therefore,	indirectly  it	is  challenging	 the
adequacy.   In	Vajravelu  Mudaliar's case(')  there  was  a
provision for compensation on the basis of the market  value
on  the date of the notification or on the basis of  average
market	value during past 5 years ever ever was less.	That
principle  was not held to bad.The owner of the property  is
not  entitled to just equivalent.  Explanation I  lays	down
the  principle.	  Market value is not  the  only  principle.
That is why the Constitution has left the laying down of the
principles  to	the  legislature.  Ascertained	value  is  a
relevant and sound principle based on capitalisation  method
which is accepted for valuation of land and properties.
    It	was  next said by counsel for  the  petitioner	that
Explanation  2(1)  in  Part 1 was  an  irrelevant  principle
because	 it was -a concept borrowed from <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_917">Income Tax Act</a>	 for
calculating income and not capital value.  It was said	that
12  times the annual rent was not a relevant  principle	 and
was not an absolute rule and compensation might be illusory.
It  was also said that Explanation 2(1) would be  irrelevant
where 2 plots were side by side, one with building
(1) [1965] 1 S.C.R. 614.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">652</span>
<p id="p_374">and the other vacant land because the latter would get	more
than the former and in the former standard rent was  applied
and  the value of land was ignored and therefore it  was  an
irrelevant  principle.	 That  will  not  be  illusoriness.-
Standard  rent necessarily takes into account value of	land
on  which  the building is situated because no rent  can  be
thought	 of without a building situated on a plot  of  land.
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_918">Article	 31(2)</a> does not enjoin the payment of full  or	just
equivalent  or	the  payment of market	value  of  land	 and
buildings.-  There  should  be	a  relevant  principle	 for
determining   compensation   for  the	property   acquired.
Capitalisation method is not available for land because land
is  not generally let out.  If rental method be	 applied  to
land  the  value  may  be little.  In any  event,  it  is  a
principle   relevant  to  determination	  of   compensation.
Furthermore,  there was no case in the petition	 that  there
was land with building side by side with vacant land.
</p><p id="p_375">     Another criticism with regard to Explanation 2 (1)	 (i)
was  that  amount  required  for repairs  which	 was  to  be
deducted  in  finding ,out ascertained value should  not  be
deducted  against capital value.  I am unable to accept	 the
contention because this deduction on account of	 maintenance
and  repairs is essential in the capitalisation method.	  It
was next said by counsel for the petitioner that Explanation
2(1)  (ii)  which speaks of deduction of  insurance  premium
would  reduce the value.  Insurance would also be an  essen-
tial deduction in the capitalisation method and it could not
be  assumed  that the bank would insure for a  value  higher
than  what  was necessary.  Annual rent would also  vary  in
different buildings.  Amounts mentioned in Explanations 2(1)
</p><p id="p_376">(iii) and (iv) were said on behalf of the petitioner not  to
be deductible against capital value because annual charge or
ground	rent  would be paid from income.   These  relate  to
Municipal  tax	and ground rent which are  also	 taken	into
consideration  in capitalisation method.  Payment of fax  or
ground	rent  may  be out of income but	 these	have  to  be
provided for in ascertaining value of the building under the
capitalisation method.
</p><p id="p_377">    Explanation	 2(1)  (vi)  which speaks  of  deduction  of
interest  on  borrowed capital with which any  building	 was
constructed  was  said to be included twice,  namely,  under
Explanation 2 ( 1 ) (vi) and also under liabilities in	Part
</p><p id="p_378">11.   Explanation 2 in Part 1 which relates to	finding	 out
ascertained value of building enacts that where building  is
wholly	occupied  12 times the annual rent or  the  rent  at
which  the  building  may  be  expected	 to  let  out	less
deductions mentioned therein would be the ascertained value.
These  deductions  are made to arrive at the  value  of	 the
building  under	 the capitalisation method to find  out	 how
much  will be paid in the shape of interest on	mortgage  or
borrowed capital.  Interest on mortgage or borrowed ,capital
will be one of the deductions in calculating outgoings under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">653</span>
capitalisation	method.	  In Part 11,  the  liabilities	 are
those existing at the commencement of the Act and contingent
liabilities which the corresponding new bank may  reasonably
be expected to be required to meet out of its own  resources
on  or after the commencement of the Act.  Interest  payable
on mortgage or borrowed capital at or after the commencement
of  the	 Act  will not be taken into  account  as  outgoings
deducted under capitalisation method.
</p><p id="p_379">    Explanation	 2(2)  was  criticised by  counsel  for	 the
petitioner  on	the ground that plinth area related  to	 the
floor  area and if a floor was not occupied the plinth	area
thereof	 was  not  taken  into	account.   Explanation	2(1)
relates	 to  determination of compensation  by	finding	 out
ascertained  value in the case of building which  is  wholly
occupied.  Explanation 2(2) relates to the case of a  build-
ing which is partially occupied.  Explanation 2(3) refers to
land  on  which	 no  building is erected  or  which  is	 not
appurtenant  to	 any  building.	  In  the  case	 of  partial
occupation  Explanation	 2(2)  sets  out  the  principle  of
compensation  of  partially  occupied  building.   Again  in
Explanation  2(3) the criticism on behalf Of the  petitioner
that  if  there is a garage or one  storeyed  structure	 the
principle will not apply is explained on the ground that the
expression   'appurtenant'  means  land	 belonging  to	 the
premises.   If	there is a small garage or  a  one  storeyed
building  the land will not be appurtenant to the garage  or
building.
</p><p id="p_380">     Counsel  for  the petitioner contended that  Part	1(h)
which  spoke of market or resaleable value of  other  assets
did  not  include goodwill, benefit of	contract,  agencies,
claims	 in  litigation,  and,	therefore,  there   was	  no
compensation  for  these.   Part  1  (h)  is  'a   residuary
provision,  Whatever  appears in books	would  be  included.
Goodwill  does not appear in the books.	 Goodwill may  arise
when an undertaking is sold as a going concern.	 The conten-
tion  as  to exclusion of goodwill goes to the	question  of
adequacy  and  will not vitiate the principle  of  valuation
which  has  been  -laid	 down.	Reference  may	be  made  to
Schedule  VI of the Companies Act which refers	to  goodwill
under Fixed Assets but the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_919">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949 does
not contain goodwill under property and assets.
    Goodwill  in  the words of Lord Elden  in  Cruttwell  v.
</p><p id="p_381">-Lye(') means "the probability that tile old customers	will
resort to the old place".  The term 'goodwill' is  generally
used  to  denote  the benefit arising  from  connection	 and
reputation.   Whether  or not the, goodwill has	 a  saleable
value the question of fact is to be determined in each case.
Upon sale of a business there may be restriction as to	user
of the name of the business sold.  That is another aspect
(1) 17 Ves. 335.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">654</span>
<p id="p_382">of sale of goodwill of a business.  The 14 banks carried  on
business under licence by reason of <a href="/doc/195670/" id="a_920">section 22</a> of the Act of
1949.	The concept of sale in such a situation	 is  unreal.
Furthermore,   the   possibility   of	nationalisation	  of
undertakings like banks cannot be ruled out.  Possibility of
nationalisation will affect the value of ,goodwill.  In	 the
case of compulsory acquisition it is of grave doubt  whether
goodwill  passes to the acquiring authority.  No facts	have
been pleaded in the petition to show as to what goodwill the
bank has.  Goodwill is not shown in assets.  In the  present
case  the  names of the 14 banks and the  corresponding	 new
banks are not the same and it cannot therefore be said	that
any  goodwill  has been transferred.  The 14 banks  will  be
able  to  carry	 on business ,other than  banking  in  their
names.	 Again under the Act compensation is being paid	 for
the  assets  and secret reserves which are provided  for  by
depreciating  the  value of assets will also be	 taken	into
account.   Any	challenge as to	 compensation  for  goodwill
falls within the area of adequacy.
</p><p id="p_383">     As	 to  Part  II  of  the	Schedule  counsel  for	 the
petitioner said that liabilities not appearing in the  books
would  be  deducted  but in the case of	 assets	 only  those
appearing in the books will be taken into account.   Nothing
has 'been shown in the petition that there ,are assets apart
from  those  appearing	in  the	 books.	  It  would  not  be
appropriate to speak of liabilities like current income	 tax
liability,  gratuity, bonus claims as liabilities  appearing
in the books.
</p><p id="p_384">     It	 was said on behalf of the petitioner that  interest
from  the  date of acquisition was not provided	 for.	That
would  again  appertain	 to the	 adequacy  of  compensation.
Furthermore,  interest has been provided for  under  <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_921">section
6(3)</a>  (a)  (b) of the 1969 Act.	 It was also  said  that  if
there  was a large scale sale of promissory notes  or  stock
certificates  the  value would depreciate.   Possibility  of
depreciation	does   not   vitiate   the   principle	  or
constitutionality of a -measure.
</p><p id="p_385">      The principles which have been set out in the 1969 Act
'are relevant to the determination of compensation.  When it
is  said  that principles will have to be  relevant  to	 the
compensation,  the relevancy will not be as to	adequacy  of
compensation  but to the property acquired and the  time  of
acquisition.   It may be that adoption of one principle	 may
confer	lesser sum of money than another but that  will	 not
be, a ground for saying that the principle is not  relevant.
The criticism on behalf of the petitioner that	compensation
was illusory is utterly unmeritorious.
</p><p id="p_386">       The Attorney General contended that even if <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_922">Article 1
9 (1) (f) -or 19(1) (g)</a> applied the 1969 Act would be upheld
as a reasonable -restriction in the interest of the  general
public.	 It is said that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">655</span>
social control scheme is a constitutional way of  fulfilling
the Directive Principles of State Policy.  The 14 banks paid
a total of 4.35 crores of rupees as dividend in 1968.	This
amount is said in the affidavit of the respondent not to  be
of  great significance and that the bank should	 expand	 and
attract	 more deposits.	 The comparative position  of  India
along  with other countries is focussed in the	study  group
Report	 referred  to  in  the	affidavit   in	 opposition.
Commercial  bank  deposits  and	 credit	 as  proportion	  of
national  income  form hardly 14% and  10%  respectively  in
India  as  against  84% and 19% in Japan,  56%	and  36%  in
U.S.A., 49% and 29% in Canada whereas the average population
served in India by banks is as high as 73000 as against 4000
in  U.S.A. and Canada and 15,000 in Japan.  Then it is	said
that  more  than 4/5th of the credit goes  to  industry	 and
commerce, retail has about 2% and agriculture less than	 1%.
Small  borrowers it is said have no facilities.	 It is	said
that  institutional  credit  is	 virtually  non-existent  in
relation  to small borrowers.  The suggestion is that  there
is  flow of resources from smaller to larger population	 and
from  rural to urban centres.  There are many  places  which
have  no Banks.	 In different States there is uneven  spread
of  banking  offices.  There is greater expansion  in  urban
banking. 5 major cities are said to have 46 per cent deposit
but 65 per cent credit.	 Banks are more developed in  States
which  are economically and socially 'advanced but  even  in
such developed States banks are sparsely located.
</p><p id="p_387">     India  is a predominantly agricultural country and	 one
half  of  national income, viz. 53.2% is  from	agriculture.
Out of 5,64,000 villages only 5000 are served by banks.	 Net
even  1	 % have bank facilities.   Credit  requirements	 for
agriculture are of great importance.  Agriculturists have 34
per  cent credit from Co-operatives, 5 per cent	 from  banks
and the rest from money lenders.  The requirements are	said
to be Rs. 2,000 crores for agriculturists.  The small  scale
industries  are	 said  to  employ one  third  of  the  total
industrial population and 40% of the industrial workers	 are
in  small scale industries.  Banks will have to	 meet  their
needs.	 Small artisans and retail trade have all  need	 for
credit.	  It  is  said that barely 1.8% of  the	 total	bank
advances goes to small scale industries.  It is said in	 the
affidavit  that the policy of the Government is to  take  up
direct management of credit resources for massive  expansion
of   branches,	vigorous  principles  for  mobilisation	  of
deposits and wide range programme to fill the credit gaps of
agriculture, small scale industries, small artisans,  retail
trade and consumer credit.  This policy can be achieved only
by  direct  management	by State and not  merely  by  social
control.  Almost all the banks are in favour of large  scale
industry.  This direct control and expansion of bank  credit
is  intended to make available deposit resources and  expand
the  same  to serve the country in the	light  of  Directive
Principles.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">656</span>
<p id="p_388">     These are the various reasons which are rightly said by
the  Attorney General to be reasonable restrictions  in	 the
interest  of  the general public.  I wish to make  it  clear
that  in my opinion Articles 19 (1) (f ) and (g) do  not  at
all  enter  the	 domain	 of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_923">Article  3	 1  (2)</a>	 because   a
legislation for acquisition and requisition of property	 for
public	purpose	 is not required to be tested again  on	 the
touchstone   of	  reasonableness   of	restriction.	Such
reasonable  restriction is inherent and implicit  in  public
purpose.   That is why purpose is dealt with  separately  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_924">Article 31(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_389">     The validity of the Ordinance of 1969 was challenged by
contending  that  the satisfaction of  the  President  under
<a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_925">Article 123</a> was open to challenge in a court of law.  It was
said  that the satisfaction of the President  was  objective
and  not  subjective.	The power  of  the  President  under
<a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_926">Article 123</a> of the Constitution to promulgate Ordinances  is
when both the Houses of Parliament are not in session,	,and
this power is co-extensive with that of the legislature	 and
the  President	exercises this power when he  is,  satisfied
that  circumstances exist which render it necessary for	 him
to  take  immediate  action.   The  power  of	promulgating
Ordinance  is of historical antiquity and it has  undergone,
change from. time to 'time.  In the East India Company	Act,
1773 under section 36 the Governor General could  promulgate
Ordinance.   <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_927">The  Indian Councils Act</a>, 1861  by	 <a href="/doc/1910798/" id="a_928">section  23</a>
thereof	 provided  that	 the Governor  General	in  case  of
emergency may promulgate an Ordinance for the peace and good
Government of the territories.	The Government of India Act,
1915 provided in <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_929">section 72</a> that the Governor General  could
promulgate  Ordinances	for the peace and  good	 Government.
The Government of India Act, 1935 by <a href="/doc/1644231/" id="a_930">sections 42</a>, <a href="/doc/1995368/" id="a_931">43</a> -and 45
conferred  power  on  the  Governor  General  to  promulgate
Ordinances and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_932">sections 88</a> and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_933">89</a> conferred a similar  power
on the Governor.  <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_934">Article 123</a> of the Constitution, is really
based on section 42 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and
<a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_935">Article	 213</a> which relates to the power of the	Governor  in
the States is based on section 88 of the Government of India
Act, 1935.
</p><p id="p_390">     It	 has  been  held in several  decisions	like  Bhagat
Singh's	 case(')  and Sibnath Banerjee's  case(')  that	 the
Governor  General  is  the  sole  judge	 as  to	 whether  an
emergency exists or not.  The Federal Court in Lakhi  Narain
Singh's	 case(3)  took	a similar  view	 that  the  Governor
General	 was  the sole judge of the state of  emergency	 for
promulgating Ordinances.
</p><p id="p_391">     The sole question is whether the power of the President
in <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_936">Article 123</a> is open to judicial scrutiny.  It was said by

<p id="p_394">whether	 the  President	 was  satisfied	 that  circumstances
existed	 which	rendered it necessary for the  President  to
promulgate  an	Ordinance. Liversidge's case(1)	 was  relied
upon  by counsel for the petitioner.  That case	 interpreted
the words "reasonable cause to believe".  It is obvious that
when the words used are "reasonable cause to believe" it  is
to  be	found  out whether the cause itself  has  reason  to
support	 it  and  the  Court  goes  into  the  question	  of
ascertaining  reasons.	In Liversidge's case(') it was	said
that  the words "has reasons to believe" meant an  objective
belief	whereas the words "if it appears" or "if  satisfied"
would be a subjective satisfaction.
</p><p id="p_395">     The words 'if it appears' came up for consideration  in
two  English cases of Ayr Collieries(2) and the	 Carltona(3)
and the decision was that it was not within the province "of
the Court to enquire into the reasonableness of the policy.
</p><p id="p_396">     The interpretation of <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_937">Article 123</a> is to 'be made  first
on  the language of the Article and secondly the context  in
which that power is reposed in the President.  When power is
conferred  on  the President to	 promulgate  Ordinances	 the
satisfaction  of  the  President  is  subjective  for  these
reasons.   The	power  in  <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_938">Article  123</a>	 is  vested  in	 the
President  who is the executive head and  the  circumstances
contemplated in <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_939">Article 123</a> are a guide to the President for
exercise  of  such  power.  Parliament	is  not	 in  session

legislative  power of promulgating Ordinance is	 reposed  in

President  is  the  sole  judge whether	 he  will  make	 the

237</a> of the Companies Act and executive acts thereunder.	 The
language  used in that section is 'in the opinion  of',	 The
Judicial   Committee  in  the  Hubli   Electricity   case(')
interpreted the words "the Provincial Government may, if  in
its  opinion  the  public interest  so	requires,  revoke  a
licence	 in  any of the following cases" to  mean  that	 the
relevant matter was the opinion and not the ground on  which
the opinion was based.	This Court in the Barium Chemical's,
case(')	 however  found that there were	 no  materials	upon
which the authority could form the requisite opinion.  That,
is the ratio of the decision in Barium Chemicals case(-).
    In	order  to  entitle the Central	Government  to	take
action under <a href="/doc/727860/" id="a_956">section 237</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 there is
to  be the requisite opinion of the Central  Government	 and
the circumstances should exist to suggest that the company's
business was being conducted as laid down in sub-clause	 (1)
or that the persons mentioned in sub-clause (2) were  guilty
of  fraud,  misfeasance or misconduct.	The opinion  of	 the
Central	 Government was subjective but it was said that	 the
condition  precedent  to the formation of such	opinion	 was
that  there  should be circumstances in	 existence  and	 the
recitals  of  the existence of those circumstances  did	 not
preclude  the  court from going behind	those  recitals	 and
determining  whether in fact the circumstances	existed	 and
whether the Central Government in making the order had taken
into consideration any extraneous consideration.

<p id="p_404">     In the case of Rohtas Industries(') reference was	made
to  English,  Canadian	and  New  Zealand  decisions.	 The
Canadian decision related to power of the Liquor  Commission
to  cancel  the	 liquor licence and it was  held  to  be  an
exercise of discretion.	 The New Zealand decision related to
the power of the Governor General under the Education Act to
make  Regulation as "he thinks necessary to secure  the	 due
administration".   It  was  held that  the  opinion  of	 the
Governor General as to the necessity for such regulation was
not  reasonably tenable.  These decisions do not  deal	with
questions  as to whether the satisfaction is  subjective  or
objective.  Of the two English decisions one related to	 the
power of the Commissioner to make regulations providing	 for
any  matter  for  which	 provisions appear  to	them  to  be
necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions
of  the	 Act.	The nature of legislation  was	taxation  of
subjects.   It was held that the authority was not the	sole
judge of what its powers were, nor of the way in which	that
power  was  exercised.	 The  words  "reasonable  cause	  to
believe", ,'reasonable grounds to believe" occurring in	 the
</p><p id="p_405">-case  of  Liversidge(2) were relied on	 to  illustrate	 the
power  of  the,	 Court	to,  find  out	as  to	whether	 the
regulation was intravires in the English case.
</p><p id="p_406">     The  decision  of	the House of Lords  in	Padfield  v:
Minister  of,  Agriculture Fisheries and  Food(')  on  which
counsel	 for the petitioner relied turned on  interpretation
of  section  19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing  Act  which
contemplated  a committee of investigation, if the  Minister
so  directed, to consider and report to the Minister on	 any
report	made  by the consumer' committee and  any  complaint
made to the Minister as to the operation of any scheme which
in the opinion of the Minister could not be considered, by a
consumers' committee under one of the sub-sections in  that.
section.  The House of Lords held that the Minister had full
or  unfettered	discretion but he was bound to	exercise  it
lawfully  that. is to say not to misdirect himself  in	law,
nor  to	 take into account irrelevant  matters-nor  to	omit
relevant matters from consideration That was an instance  of
a  writ of mandamus directing exercising of'  discretion  to
act on the ground that it was a power coupled with. duty.
</p><p id="p_407">     The  only	way-in which the exercise of  power  by	 the
President can be challenged is by establishing bad faith  or
mala  fide and corrupt motive.	Bad faith will	destroy	 any
action.	 Such bad faith, will be a matter to be	 established
by  a  party propounding bad faith.  He	 should	 affirm	 the
state of facts.	 He is not only to allege the same but	also
to prove it.  In the present case there is no allegation
of Mala fide.

<p id="p_411">It  was said on behalf of the petitioner that the fact	that
Parliament would be in session on 21 July, 1969 and that the
Ordinance  was	promulgated on Saturday, 19 July,  1969	 was
indicative   of	 the  fact  that  the  Ordinance   was	 not
promulgated  legitimately  but	in a hasty  manner  and	 the
President  should have waited.	If the President  has  power
when the House is not in session he can exercise that  power
when  he  is satisfied that there is an	 emergency  to	take
immediate  action.   That emergency may take  place  even  a
short  time  before Parliament goes into session.   It	will
depend	 upon  the  circumstances  which  were	before	 the
President.   The fact that the Ordinance was passed  shortly
before	the Parliament session began does not show any	mala
fide.	It was said that circumstances were not set  out  in
the  affidavit	and  therefore the  Court  was	deprived  of
examining the same.  The Attorney General rightly  contended
that  it  was  not  for	 the  Union  to	 furnish  facts	 and
information  which were before President because first	such
information  might be a State secret, secondly, it  was	 for
the  party  who alleged non-existence  of  circumstances  to
prove  the  same and thirdly the respondent was	 not  called
upon to meet any case of mala fide.
</p><p id="p_412">It  was	 said that no reason was shown as to  what  mischief
could  have  happened if the Ordinance would not  have	been
promulgated  on	 the  date in question	but  no	 reason	 was
required to be shown.  The statement of objects and  reasons
shows that there was considerable speculation in the country
regarding    Government's   intention	with	regard	  to
nationalisation' of banks during few days immediately before
the  Ordinance.	 In the case of Barium Chemical's(1) it	 was
said  by this Court that if circumstances lead to  tentative
conclusion,  that the Court would not have drawn  a  similar
inference  would be irrelevant.	 The reason is obvious	that
in matters of policy just as Parliament is the master of its
province  similarly  the President is the supreme  and	sole
judge  of  his satisfaction on such policy  matters  on	 the
advice of the Government.
</p><p id="p_413">The  locus standi of the petitioners was challenged  by	 the
Attorney  General.  The petitions were heard on	 merits.   I
have  -dealt  with  all	 the  arguments	 advanced.   It	 is,
therefore, not at all necessary to deal with this objection.
For the reasons mentioned above, the petitions fail 'and are
dismissed.  There will be no order as to costs.
