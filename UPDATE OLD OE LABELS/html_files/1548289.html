dated   30.11.2010   and   directed   the   appellant   to   supply   the   information   in 


regard to queries 3, 5 and 13, on the following reasoning :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">        "According   to   the   Central   Information   Commission   the   solutions   which 

        have been supplied by the Board to the examiners are given in confidence 

        and therefore, they are entitled to protection under <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_11">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the 

        RTI Act. <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_12">Section 8(1)(e)</a> does not protect confidential information and the 

        claim   of   intellectual   property   has   not   made   by   the   respondent   No.2 

        anywhere.   In   the   reply   it   is   suggested   that   the   suggested   answers   are 

        published and sold in open market by the Board. Therefore, there can be 

        no confidentiality about suggested answers. It is no where explained what 

        is the difference between the suggested answers and the solutions. In our 

        opinion, the orders of both Authorities in this respect also suffer from non-

        application of mind and therefore they are liable to be set aside. We find 

        that the right given under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_13">Information Act</a> has been dealt with 

        by the Authorities under that Act in most casual manner without properly 

        applying their minds to the material on record. In our opinion, therefore, 

        information   sought   against   queries   Nos.3,5   and   13   could   not   have   been 

        denied   by the  Authorities   to the   petitioner.  The  principal  defence  of  the 

        respondent No.2 is that the information is confidential. Till the result of 

        the examination is declared, the information sought by the petitioner has to 

        be treated as confidential, but once the result is declared, in our opinion, 

        that   information   cannot   be   treated   as   confidential.   We   were   not   shown

nature of exemption. For example, any information which is exempted from 


disclosure under <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_24">section 8</a>, is liable to be disclosed if the application is made 


in   regard   to   the   occurrence   or   event   which   took   place   or   occurred   or 


happened twenty years prior to the date of the request, vide <a href="/doc/22288/" id="a_25">section 8(3)</a> of 


the   RTI   Act.   In   other   words,   information   which   was   exempted   from 


disclosure, if an application is made within twenty years of the occurrence, 


may not be exempted if the application is made after twenty years. Similarly, 


if   information   relating   to   the   intellectual   property,   that   is   the   question 


papers, solutions/model answers and instructions, in regard to any particular 


examination   conducted   by   the   appellant   cannot   be   disclosed   before   the 


examination   is   held,   as   it   would   harm   the   competitive   position   of 


innumerable third parties who are taking the said examination. Therefore it

citizen   any   information   relating   to   question       papers,   solutions/model 


answers and instructions relating to a particular examination before the date 


of such examination. But the position will be different once the examination 


is held. Disclosure of the question papers, model answers and instructions in 


regard   to   any   particular   examination,   would   not   harm   the   competitive 


position of any third party once the examination is held. In fact the question 


papers are disclosed to everyone at the time of examination.   The appellant

papers   in   the   form   of   a   book   for   sale   every   year,   after   the   examination. 


Therefore   <a href="/doc/1838023/" id="a_26">section   8(1)(d)</a>   of   the   RTI   Act   does   not   bar   or   prohibit   the

instructions   if   any   given   to   the   examiners   and   moderators   after   the 


examination and after the evaluation of answerscripts is completed, as at that 


stage   they   will   not   harm   the   competitive   position   of   any   third   party.   We 


therefore   reject   the   contention   of   the   appellant   that   if   an   information   is

`State'.   The   information   sought   is   a   material   in   which   ICAI   claims   a 


copyright. It is not the case of ICAI that anyone else has a copyright in such 


material. In fact it has specifically pleaded that even if the question papers,

party   for   ICAI,   the   copyright   therein   is   assigned   in   favour   of   ICAI. 


Providing access to information in respect of which ICAI holds a copyright,

holder   of   the   information   in   a   fiduciary   relationship   need   not   only   be   a 


`public   authority'   as   the   word   `person'   is   of   much   wider   import   than   the 


word   `public   authority'.   Therefore   the   exemption   under   <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_46">section   8(1)(e)</a>   is

</p><p id="p_48">18.     The  information  to which  <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_48">RTI  Act</a>  applies  falls into  two categories, 


namely, (i) information which promotes  transparency and accountability in 


the   working   of   every   public   authority,   disclosure   of   which   helps   in 


containing or discouraging corruption, enumerated in clauses (b) and (c) of 


<a href="/doc/266825/" id="a_49">section 4(1)</a> of RTI Act; and (ii) other information held by public authorities

falling   under   the   first   category,   the   public   authorities   owe   a   duty   to 


disseminate the information widely  suo moto  to the public  so as to make it 


easily   accessible   to   the   public.   In   regard   to   information   enumerated   or 


required   to   be   enumerated   under   <a href="/doc/1576851/" id="a_52">section   4(1)(b)</a>   and   (c)   of   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_53">RTI   Act</a>, 


necessarily and naturally, the competent authorities under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_54">RTI Act</a>, will 


have to act in a pro-active manner so as to ensure accountability and ensure 


that the fight against corruption goes on relentlessly. But in regard to other 


information which do not fall under <a href="/doc/1576851/" id="a_55">Section 4(1)(b)</a> and (c) of the Act, there 


is   a   need   to   proceed   with   circumspection   as   it   is   necessary   to   find   out 


whether they are exempted from disclosure. One of the objects of democracy 


is to bring about transparency of information to contain corruption and bring 


about   accountability.   But   achieving   this   object   does   not   mean   that   other 


equally   important   public   interests   including   efficient   functioning   of   the 


governments and public authorities, optimum use of limited fiscal resources,

preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information, etc. are to be ignored 


or sacrificed. The object of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_56">RTI Act</a> is to harmonize the conflicting public 


interests,   that   is,   ensuring   transparency   to   bring   in   accountability   and 


containing corruption on the one hand, and at the same time ensure that the 


revelation   of   information,   in   actual   practice,   does   not   harm   or   adversely 


affect   other   public   interests   which   include   efficient   functioning   of   the 


governments,   optimum   use   of   limited   fiscal   resources   and   preservation   of 


confidentiality of sensitive information, on the other hand. While <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_57">sections 3</a> 


and  <a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_58">4</a>  seek  to  achieve   the  first  objective,   <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_59">sections   8</a>,  <a href="/doc/1053993/" id="a_60">9</a>,  <a href="/doc/580445/" id="a_61">10</a>  and  <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_62">11</a>  seek   to 


achieve   the   second   objective.   Therefore   when   <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_63">section   8</a>   exempts   certain 


information from being disclosed, it should not be considered to be a fetter 


on the right to information, but as an equally important provision protecting 


other   public   interests   essential   for   the   fulfilment   and   preservation   of 


democratic   ideals.   Therefore   in   dealing  with   information   not   falling   under

read  the  exemptions  in  <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_66">section  8</a>  in  a   restrictive  manner  but  in  a  practical 


manner   so   that   the   other   public   interests   are   preserved   and   the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_67">RTI   Act</a>

<p id="p_57">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">      "When   a   large   number   of   candidates   appear   for   an   examination,   it   is 

      necessary to have uniformity and consistency in valuation of the answer- 

      scripts.   Where   the   number   of   candidates   taking   the   examination   are 

      limited   and   only   one   examiner   (preferably   the   paper-setter   himself) 

      evaluates   the   answer-scripts,   it   is   to   be   assumed   that   there   will   be 

      uniformity in the valuation. But where a large number of candidates take 

      the   examination,   it   will   not   be   possible   to   get   all   the   answer-scripts 

      evaluated   by   the   same   examiner.   It,   therefore,   becomes   necessary   to 

      distribute the answer-scripts among several examiners for valuation with 

      the   paper-setter   (or   other   senior   person)   acting   as   the   Head   Examiner. 

      When   more   than   one   examiner   evaluate   the   answer-scripts   relating   to   a 

      subject,   the   subjectivity   of   the   respective   examiner   will   creep   into   the 

      marks awarded by him to the answer- scripts allotted to him for valuation. 

      Each examiner will apply his own yardstick to assess the answer-scripts. 

      Inevitably   therefore,   even   when   experienced   examiners   receive   equal 

      batches   of   answer   scripts,   there   is   difference   in   average   marks   and   the 

      range   of   marks   awarded,   thereby   affecting   the   merit   of   individual 

      candidates. This apart, there is 'Hawk- Dove' effect. Some examiners are 

      liberal in valuation and tend to award more  marks. Some examiners  are 

      strict and tend to give less marks. Some may be moderate and balanced in 

      awarding marks. Even among those who are liberal or those who are strict, 

      there may be variance in the degree of strictness or liberality. This means 

      that if the same answer-script is given to different examiners, there is all 

      likelihood   of   different   marks   being   assigned.   If   a   very   well   written 

      answer-script goes to a strict examiner and a mediocre answer-script goes 

      to a liberal examiner,  the mediocre  answer-script may be awarded more 

      marks than the excellent answer-script.  In other words,  there is 'reduced 

      valuation'   by   a   strict   examiner   and   'enhanced   valuation'   by   a   liberal 

      examiner. This is known as 'examiner variability'  or 'Hawk-Dove effect'. 

      Therefore, there is a need to evolve a procedure to ensure uniformity inter 

      se the Examiners so that the effect of 'examiner subjectivity' or 'examiner 

      variability'   is   minimised.   The   procedure   adopted   to   reduce   examiner 

      subjectivity or variability is known as moderation. The classic method of 

      moderation is as follows:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_54">      (ii) To achieve uniformity in valuation, where more than one examiner is 

      involved, a meeting of the Head Examiner with all the examiners is held 

      soon  after  the examination.  They discuss  thoroughly the  question paper, 

      the possible answers and the weightage to be given to various aspects of 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                              24</span>



the answers. They also carry out a sample valuation in the light of their 

discussions. The sample valuation of scripts by each of them is reviewed 

by   the   Head   Examiner   and   variations   in   assigning   marks   are   further 

discussed. After such discussions, a consensus is arrived at in regard to the 

norms   of   valuation   to   be   adopted.   On   that   basis,   the   examiners   are 

required   to   complete   the   valuation   of   answer   scripts.   But   this   by   itself, 

does not bring about uniformity of assessment inter se the examiners. In 

spite   of   the   norms   agreed,   many   examiners   tend   to   deviate   from   the 

expected or agreed norms, as their caution is overtaken by their propensity 

for strictness or liberality or eroticism or carelessness during the course of 

valuation. Therefore, certain further corrective steps become necessary.


</blockquote><p id="p_58">(iii) After the valuation is completed by the examiners, the Head Examiner 

conducts a random sample survey of the corrected answer scripts to verify 

whether the norms evolved in the meetings of examiner have actually been 

followed by the examiners...........
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">(iv)   After   ascertaining   or   assessing   the   standards   adopted   by   each 

examiner,   the  Head  Examiner   may   confirm  the  award  of  marks  without 

any   change   if   the   examiner   has   followed   the   agreed   norms,   or   suggest 

upward   or   downward   moderation,   the   quantum   of   moderation   varying 

according to the degree of liberality or strictness in marking. In regard to 

the top level answer books revalued by the Head Examiner, his award of 

marks is accepted as final. As regards the other answer books below the 

top   level,   to   achieve   maximum   measure   of   uniformity   inter   se   the 

examiners, the awards are moderated as per the recommendations made by 

the Head Examiner.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">(v)   If   in   the   opinion   of   the   Head   Examiner   there   has   been   erratic   or 

careless marking by any examiner, for which it is not feasible to have any 

standard   moderation,   the   answer   scripts   valued   by   such   examiner   are 

revalued either by the Head Examiner or any other Examiner who is found 

to have followed the agreed norms.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">(vi) Where the number of candidates is very large and the examiners are 

numerous, it may be difficult for one Head Examiner to assess the work of 

all   the   Examiners.   In   such   a   situation,   one   more   level   of   Examiners   is 

introduced.   For   every   ten   or   twenty   examiners,   there   will   be   a   Head 

Examiner   who   checks   the   random   samples   as   above.   The   work   of   the 

Head Examiners, in turn, is checked by a Chief Examiner to ensure proper 

results.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
The   above   procedure   of   'moderation'   would   bring   in   considerable 

uniformity and consistency. It should be noted that absolute uniformity or 

consistency in valuation is impossible to achieve where there are several 

examiners and the effort is only to achieve maximum uniformity."

where more than four lakhs candidates participate;  that out of them, about 


15-16% are successful, which means that more than three and half lakhs of 


candidates are unsuccessful; that if even one percent at those unsuccessful 


candidates  feel dissatisfied  with the results  and seek  all types of unrelated 


information, the working of ICAI will come to a standstill. It was submitted 


that for every meaningful user of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_78">RTI Act</a>, there are several abusers who will 


attempt to disrupt the functioning of the examining bodies by seeking huge 


quantity   of   information.   ICAI   submits   that   the   application   by   the   first 


respondent is a classic case of improper use of the Act, where a candidate 


who has failed in an examination and who does not even choose to take the 


subsequent examination has been engaging ICAI in a prolonged litigation by 


seeking a bundle of information none of which is relevant to decide whether 


his   answer   script   was   properly   evaluated,   nor   have   any   bearing   on 


accountability or reducing corruption. ICAI submits that there should be an 


effective   control   and   screening   of   applications   for   information   by   the 


competent authorities under the Act. We do not agree that first respondent 


had   indulged   in   improper   use   of   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_79">RTI   Act</a>.   His   application   is   intended   to 


bring about transparency and accountability in the functioning of ICAI. How

far  he  is  entitled  to  the information  is  a different   issue. Examining  bodies 


like ICAI should change their old mindsets and tune them to the new regime 


of disclosure of maximum information. Public authorities should realize that 


in an era of transparency, previous practices of unwarranted secrecy have no 


longer a place. Accountability and prevention of corruption is possible only 


through   transparency.   Attaining   transparency   no   doubt   would   involve 


additional   work   with   reference   to   maintaining   records   and   furnishing 


information.   Parliament   has   enacted   the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_80">RTI   Act</a>   providing   access   to 


information, after great debate and deliberations by the Civil Society and the 


Parliament. In its wisdom, the Parliament has chosen to exempt only certain 


categories of information from disclosure and certain organizations from the 


applicability of the Act. As the examining bodies have not been exempted, 


and   as   the   examination   processes   of   examining   bodies   have   not   been 


exempted,   the   examining   bodies   will   have   to   gear   themselves   to   comply 


with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_81">RTI Act</a>. Additional workload is not a defence. If 


there   are   practical   insurmountable   difficulties,   it   is   open   to   the   examining 


bodies   to  bring  them to  the  notice  of  the  government   for  consideration  so 


that any changes to the Act can be deliberated upon. Be that as it may.

to information intended to bring transparency, to improve accountability and

to   reduce   corruption,   falling   under   <a href="/doc/1576851/" id="a_82">section   4(1)(b)</a>   and   (c)   and   other 


information   which   may   not   have   a   bearing   on   accountability   or   reducing 


corruption.   The   competent   authorities   under   the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_83">RTI   Act</a>   will   have   to 


maintain a proper balance so that while achieving transparency, the demand 


for   information   does   not   reach   unmanageable   proportions   affecting   other 


public interests, which include efficient operation of public authorities and 


government,   preservation   of   confidentiality   of   sensitive   information   and 


optimum use of limited fiscal resources.
