<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                       Page 1 of 21</span>
 against the arbitral award dated 18th August, 2009 passed by the sole
arbitrator in a dispute between FCL and MTNL.
</p><p id="p_3">       To the extent necessary, we first note the facts giving rise to the
present appeal.
</p><p id="p_4">2.     MTNL had entered into a contract dated 11th July, 1990 with
FCL for supply of following four sizes of Jelly Filled Cables (JFCs) :
</p><pre id="pre_2">         S.No. Items                     Unit Price      Total Price
         1.    20/6 Armoured U/s         65,102.00       9,76,530.00
               Jelly Filled Cable
         2.    50/6 Armoured U/s         1,08,8520.50 10,88,525.00
               Jelly Filled Cable
         3.    400/6 Armoured U/s        5,84,820.00     23,29,280.00
               Jelly Filled Cable
         4.    2400/4      Armoured      12,93,946.72 3,23,48,668.00
               U/s
               Jelly Filled Cable


</pre><p id="p_5">3.     Pursuant to the said contract, a purchase order dated 20th
December, 1990 was placed upon FCL. The date of delivery of the
aforesaid goods was 20th May, 1991. The entire quantity was to be
supplied to the Delhi/Bombay unit with the consignee being specified
as "MTNL Delhi/Bombay".
</p><p id="p_6">4.     There is no difficulty with regard to the supply of three sizes of
cables which were duly supplied in accordance with the delivery
schedule.    However, the fourth size was a unique type of cable
requiring approval of the Telecom Engineering Centre ('TEC'
hereafter), which admittedly could not be supplied by FCL by the
specified date.      There also appears to have been an error in the
description of the said cable, which had to be amended subsequently.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                          Page 2 of 21</span>
<p id="p_7"> 5.     In terms of the contract, FCL had furnished performance bank
guarantee dated 5th December, 1990 in the sum of Rs.18,37,650/-
</p><p id="p_8">6.     Clause 9.2 of the purchase order/Contract stated that the MTNL
reserved the rights to cancel the balance quantity of the order if the
supply was not made within the delivery period or extended delivery
period (i.e., by 20th May, 1991). Clause 10.3 stipulated that delivery
of the cable would be supplied strictly as per specifications supplied
by the TEC/CGM(QA), Bangalore.
</p><p id="p_9">7.     In clause 14.3, reasonable quantities were to be offered for
inspection to DET (QA) and the invoices raised by the supplier were
to be accompanied by certificates of inspection stating that the stores
conformed to the specifications offered and were accepted.
</p><p id="p_10">8.     We extract hereunder clause 17 which provided for liquidity
damages and reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "17. Liquidated Damages

       17.1 The date of delivery of the stores stipulated in the
       acceptance of Purchase Order should be deemed to be the
       essence of the contract and delivery must be completed not
       later than the dates specified therein. Extension will not be
       given except in exceptional circumstances. Should, however,
       deliveries be made after expiry of the contract and be
       accepted by the Consignee, such deliveries will not deprive
       the Purchaser of his right to recover liquidated damages
       under Clause 17.2 below, where, however, supplies are made
       within 21 (twenty one) days of the contracted original delivery
       period, the consignee may accept the stores and in such cases
       the provisions of clause 17.2 will not apply.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       Should the tenderer fail to deliver the stores or any
       consignment thereof within the period prescribed for delivery,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                        Page 3 of 21</span>
        the Chairman Cum Managing Director, MTNL, shall be
       entitled to recover Â½% of the undelivered stores value of the
       Order placed; for each week of delay or part thereof, subject
       to a maximum of 10% of the value of the Order placed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">9.     It appears that FCL submitted a sample to the TEC on 18 th May,
1991, i.e., two days before the expiry of the dead line on 20th May,
1991. This type approval was granted ultimately only on 5th August,
1991. According to the FCL, after the type approval was granted by
TEC, which evidently was after the stipulated delivery period, MTNL
time and again wanted the FCL to extend the delivery period. It is an
admitted position that FCL obliged and kept extending the
performance bank guarantee from time to time. MTNL would point
out that FCL raised no objection to the extension of the performance
bank guarantee.
</p><p id="p_12">10.    It was the case of the MTNL, in the arbitration proceedings, that
time continued to essence of the contract, and that, even after
obtaining the approval of the TEC on 5th April, 1991, FCL did not
supply a single meter of the ordered cable. It is interesting to note that
there is no exchange of correspondence during this period between
MTNL and FCL. It is apparent that MTNL did not make a single
request to the FCL to supply the cable.
</p><p id="p_13">       Interestingly, without once calling upon the FCL to deliver the
cable for a period of over nine years, MTNL asked the FCL to extend
the PBG. Thus the PBG for the sum of Rs. 18,37,650/- was extended
15 times.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                          Page 4 of 21</span>
<p id="p_14"> 11.    It would appear that FCL presumed that requirement of the
supply of cable did not exist anymore. Mr. Atul Y. Chitale, ld. Senior
Counsel for the FCL (respondent in the present matter) has drawn our
attention to the letter dated 7th April, 1992 addressed by the FCL
requesting MTNL to short close the balance portion of the purchase
order without any commercial implications, on account of there being
no follow up by the MTNL.
</p><p id="p_15">12.    MTNL has contended that, by keeping the PBG alive as and
when demanded by MTNL, there was an implied consent by FCL to
keep the purchase order alive.
</p><p id="p_16">13.    Another pertinent fact which needs to be noted is that FCL had
addressed a letter dated 26th September, 2001, to the Department of
Telecommunication (DoT) "for induction of Foam Skin Cables
('FOC') in telecom network". TEC's reply dated 14th December, 2001
is important whereby TEC wrote the following :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "The proposal for induction of Foam Skin Cables (FSC) in
       Telecom network has been considered. The proposal appears
       to be good but BSNL is trying to reduce the use of
       underground PIJF cable by using more and more other
       modern technology like WLL, DLC and HDSL etc. in its
       network. Further BSNL has issued instructions to the field
       units to shift from concentrated switching to distributing
       switching by use of more and more RSUs/RLUs so that large
       sizes of primary cables are reduced in the network. There is
       no plan of BSNL to try a new type of Foam Skin Cable in its
       network at present.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       In view of the above we are not interested for presentation on
       advantages of Foam Skin Cables at this stage."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                       Page 5 of 21</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6"> 14.    It is pointed out on behalf of FCL that MTNL therefore was not
really interested in the supply of the fourth cable as it was using more
modern technology as is evident from the above.
</blockquote><p id="p_17">15.    It is in this factual background, that on the 29th of January 2004,
MTNL wrote a letter addressed to the Central Bank of India invoking
the PBG furnished by the FCL as guarantee towards the contract.
</p><p id="p_18">16.    The basis for the invocation is disclosed in a letter dated 24th
February, 2004 addressed by MTNL to FCL wherein it was stated as
follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "Sir,

       Regarding the above mentioned purchase order, you did not
       supply 2400//4 mm. diameter wire without covering (25 km
       length). Due to this reason contract has been terminated. The
       loss due to termination of contract is calculated is
       Rs.40,70,756/- out of the Rs.18,37,650.00 bank cheque/DD
       has been encashed. Balance Rs.22,23,106.00 has to be
       recovered, the said amount within seven days of receipt of this
       notice, please give bank draft in favour of MTNL at office of
       undersigned. In this much amount has not been deposited
       within this period, this amount will be deducted from any of
       your bills or any other bank guarantee."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                           (Emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">17.    On 9th March, 2004, FCL wrote a letter to MTNL stating, inter
alia, that as the requirement of the cable did not exist, financial burden
should not be imposed upon the FCL by encashing the bank guarantee.
</blockquote><p id="p_19">FCL instead requested that charges deducted for the bank guarantee,
be reimbursed to it.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                          Page 6 of 21</span>
<p id="p_20"> 18.    MTNL claimed liquidated damages of Rs.40,70,756/- and
recovered Rs.18,37,650/- from the available performance bank
guarantee and called upon FCL to deposit Rs.22,33,106/- being the
balance amount.
</p><p id="p_21">19.    On 18th March, 2004, MTNL also invoked a bank guarantee in
the sum of Rs.20,79,320/- furnished by FCL from the Central Bank of
India, Pimpri Branch, Pune which had been given in another contract,
appropriating the amount thereof towards the claimed damages in the
present contract.
</p><p id="p_22">20.    It is also on record that, another bank guarantee for the sum of
Rs.1,56,100/- furnished by FCL towards another contract was also
encashed by MTNL and so appropriated.
</p><p id="p_23">       We are noting this fact for the reason that MTNL has encashed
these bank guarantees and has appropriated this amount towards the
amount claimed by it as liquidated damages in the present case which
are the subject matter of the orders by the arbitrator with regard to
which the dispute was raised before the arbitral tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_24">Arbitration proceedings

</p><p id="p_25">21.    Aggrieved by the above action, by its letters of 6 th November,
2005 and 24th December, 2005, FCL sought reference of the disputes
to arbitration. The Chairman-cum-Managing Director of MTNL
appointed Dr. S.M. Dewan, D.G., SCOPE as the sole arbitrator for
adjudication of the disputes between the parties.        FCL filed the
statement of claim whereby it claimed an amount of Rs.40,70,756/- as
due and payable from MTNL along with interest @ 15% per annum



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                           Page 7 of 21</span>
 from the date of invocation of the bank guarantees till the date of
repayment as well as cost of arbitration. Apart from filing its reply,
MTNL also raised a counter claim of Rs.6,28,44,266/- from FCL.
</p><p id="p_26">22.    After consideration of the matter at length, the sole arbitrator
had passed an Award dated 18th August, 2009, inter alia, holding that
there was implied consent of both FCL and MTNL to keep the
purchase order alive. The Arbitrator notes that MTNL did not follow
up with the FCL to deliver the material for a period of 12 years; that
nevertheless, the delay of 12 years in supply of the ordered material
and lack of subsequent reminders by the FCL to supply the material
left no choice but to cancel the purchase order; that there is no
material to show that parties knew that the loss was likely to result
from non-delivery of the cables; that if the agreed liquidated damages
were to be enforced, it must be a result of some genuine pre-estimated
damages; that in view of the clause 7.4 of the purchase order, MTNL
was justified in invoking the bank guarantee and recovering the
liquidated damages up to maximum of 10% of the ordered value. i.e.,
Rs.36,75,300/-.
</p><p id="p_27">       The Arbitrator has noted that except the bald averments and an
assumed loss of profit, there was no material at all on record to
substantiate the counter claim which was actually rejected.              No
interest or costs were awarded.
</p><p id="p_28">23.    This arbitral award was assailed by FCL under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> of the
Arbitration Act by way of OMP No.746/2009. These objections were
considered and decided by the ld. Single Judge by way of the
judgment dated 11th April, 2017. The ld. Single Judge placed reliance



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                        Page 8 of 21</span>
 on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2015) 4 SCC
136, <a href="/doc/70828540/" id="a_5">Kailash Nath Associates vs. Delhi Development Authority</a> and
concluded that the sum of Rs.36,75,300/- as liquidated damages was
based on no evidence at all and consequently, invocation of the bank
guarantee by the MTNL was unjustified. It was also concluded by the
ld. Single Judge that conduct of both parties, i.e. of MTNL and FCL in
submitting the cable only on 18th May, 1991 for approval to the TEC
and that by the TEC granting approval only on 5 th August, 1991,
resulted in the expiry of the original delivery period on 20th May, 1991
and that both the parties had accepted this reality. The ld. Single
Judge also observed that MTNL did not consider this as a breach of
contract and took no steps to terminate the contract for the failure of
FCL to adhere to the delivery period and nor did the FCL resist the
demands of MTNL from time and again for keeping the bank
guarantee alive for the period of 12 years. It was held by the ld.
Single Judge that finding of the ld. Arbitrator that there was "an
implied consent of both the claimants and the respondent to keep the
purchase order alive" was a correct assessment of what transpired
between them.
</p><p id="p_29">       This judgment stands assailed by MTNL before us.
</p><p id="p_30">24.    We have heard Mr. Abhinav Vashisht, ld. Senior Counsel for
MTNL and Mr. Atul Chitale, ld. Senior Counsel for FCL at length. In
the judgment dated 11th April, 2017, ld. Single Judge has noted that by
the letter dated 7th April, 1992 by the FCL to the MTNL seeking short
closure was understandable. The ld. Single Judge has extracted from
this letter the submission by FCL which had made arrangement "for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO(OS)No.227/2017                                        Page 9 of 21</span>
 procurement of raw material for development of this item and within a
period of 8-9 months we were able to offer the cable for proto testing
and finally we got type approval". FCL had offered short closure
without any commercial implication. MTNL did not permit the short
closure but also neither did it, in response, allege any breach of
contract nor claimed any liquidated damages.
</p><p id="p_31">25.    We may extract the observations of the Supreme Court reported
at (2008) 1 SCC 503 <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_6">Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. The
Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>. which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">       "19. It is, no doubt, true that the general rule is that an offer
       is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offerree,
       yet it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be
       given in so many words. Under certain circumstances,
       offerree's silence, coupled with his conduct, which takes the
       form of a positive act, may constitute an acceptance an
       agreement sub silentio. Therefore, the terms of a contract
       between the parties can be proved not only by their words
       but also by their conduct."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">26.    In these facts, the conclusion of the ld. Single Judge that in view
of the fact that for a period of 14 years after the original purchase
order dated 20th December, 1990, neither party made a move for
closure of the contract and consequently time was not the essence of
the contract from the point of view of either party cannot be faulted.
This conclusion is also supported by the decisions reported at
<a href="/doc/3413/" id="a_7">Keshavlal Lallubhai Patel &amp; Ors. v. Lalbhai Trikumlal Mills Ltd</a>.
and AIR 1958 SC 512; AIR 1999 SC 3804 <a href="/doc/899181/" id="a_8">Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v.
Union of India</a>.

<p id="p_33"> 27.    The ld. Single Judge has rightly also concluded from the letter
dated 14th December, 2001 that probably MTNL did not need the
cable anymore. From the above discussion, it is apparent that the hard
reality is that neither party considered time as being of essence to the
contract.
</p>
<p id="p_34">Whether the encashment of the bank guarantees and appropriation
of the amounts of the liquidated damages was justified?
</p>
<p id="p_35">28.    Before examining the findings of the ld. Single Judge on this
issue, we may usefully consider the applicable legal principles. The
ld. Single Judge has placed reliance on the law laid down in para 43 of
the Kailash Nath which summed up the legal position qua the claim
of liquidated damages in the following terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "43. On a conspectus of the above authorities, the law on
       compensation for breach of contract under Section 74 can be
       stated to be as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       43.1. Where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated
       amount payable by way of damages, the party complaining of
       a breach can receive as reasonable compensation such
       liquidated amount only if it is a genuine pre-estimate of
       damages fixed by both parties and found to be such by the
       Court. In other cases, where a sum is named in a contract as
       a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only
       reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the
       amount so stated. Similarly, in cases where the amount fixed
       is in the nature of penalty, only reasonable compensation can
       be awarded not exceeding the penalty so stated. In both
       cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is the upper limit
       beyond which the Court cannot grant reasonable
       compensation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        43.2. Reasonable compensation will be fixed on well known
       principles that are applicable to the law of contract, which
       are to be found inter alia in <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_9">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       43.3. Since <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_10">Section 74</a> awards reasonable compensation for
       damage or loss caused by a breach of contract, damage or
       loss caused is a sine qua non for the applicability of the
       Section.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       43.4. The Section applies whether a person is a plaintiff or a
       defendant in a suit.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">       43.5. The sum spoken of may already be paid or be payable in
       future.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       43.6. The expression "whether or not actual damage or loss
       is proved to have been caused thereby" means that where it
       is possible to prove actual damage or loss, such proof is not
       dispensed with. It is only in cases where damage or loss is
       difficult or impossible to prove that the liquidated amount
       named in the contract, if a genuine pre-estimate of damage
       or loss, can be awarded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       43.7. <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_11">Section 74</a> will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest

<p id="p_43">36.    On a consideration of the material of the record of the arbitral

was placed on record by the MTNL that it suffered an iota of loss on
account of non-supply of cables".
</p><p id="p_44">37.    The ld. Single Judge has further returned the finding that even if

 circumstances of every case. In the present case, the ld. Single Judge
has observed that the arbitrator has awarded the maximum amount
specified under Clause 7.4. As noted above, MTNL led no evidence of
loss. The ld. Single Judge has found that the Award of the amount is
without any explanation at all as to how the maximum liquidated
damages anticipated by the said clause was actually a "reasonable
sum" in the facts and circumstances of the case.         This is legally
impermissible.
</p><p id="p_45">38.    We are unable to fault with the findings of the ld. Single Judge
that having found no loss whatsoever as having been suffered by the
MTNL, there was no warrant or explanation at all for the Arbitrator
awarding the maximum i.e. 10% of the total value of the contract
being the sum of Rs.36,75,300/-. The finding of the ld. Single Judge
in the impugned judgments, that the Arbitral award was based on no
evidence at all and was contrary to the well settled legal position, thus
has to be upheld.

<p id="p_49">41.    It is apparent, therefore, that, while interference by court, with
arbitral awards, is limited and circumscribed, an award which is
patently illegal, on account of it being injudicious, contrary to the law
settled by the Supreme Court, or vitiated by an apparently untenable
interpretation of the terms of the contract, requires to be eviscerated.
In view thereof, the decision of the ld. Single Judge that reasoning of
the arbitral award in this regard was based on no material and was
contrary to the contract, cannot be said to be deserving of any
interference at our hands under <a href="/doc/1656413/" id="a_23">Section 37</a> of the Act.               In a
pronouncement reported at MANU/DE/0459/2015, MTNL v. Fujitshu
India Pvt. Ltd. (FAO(OS) No.63/2015), the Division Bench of this
court has held that "an appeal under <a href="/doc/1656413/" id="a_24">Section 37</a> is like a second
appeal, the first appeal being to the court by way of objections under
<a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_25">Section 34</a>". Being in the nature of a second appeal, this court would
be hesitant to interfere, with the decision of the learned Single Judge,
unless it is shown to be palpably erroneous on facts or in law, or

 manifestly perverse. The impugned judgment dated 11 th April, 2017
of the ld. Single Judge cannot be said to suffer from any such
infirmity.
</p>
<p id="p_50">Conclusion

</p><p id="p_51">42.    It is to be noted that the arbitral tribunal rejected the counter
claim of the MTNL, yet proceeded to award liquidated damages. We
are unable to agree with Mr. Abhinav Vasisht, ld. Senior Counsel for
the appellant - MTNL that the contract was of such nature that it was
not possible to evaluate the damages and therefore, that 10% of the
amount quantified in the contract between the parties as liquidated
damages had to be treated as being reasonable award of damages.
</p><p id="p_52">43.    It is clearly stated in para 43.6 of Kailash Nath that in case
where damages are difficult or impossible to prove, the claimants
would be entitled to the liquidated damages if they were a genuine
pre-estimate of the damage. No material at all in this regard was
produced before the arbitral award. MTNL has not even asserted that
it had suffered loss.
</p><p id="p_53">44.    The Arbitrator has not even examined the challenge by the FCL
to the encashment of the bank guarantees furnished by FCL to MTNL
for other contracts and permitting amount thereof to be applied
towards liquidated damages claimed by MTNL in the present case. In
any case, keeping in mind the view taken by the ld. Single Judge qua
the Award of the liquidated damages for which these two bank
guarantees were encashed, there is no justification at all for
encashment of these two bank guarantees.
