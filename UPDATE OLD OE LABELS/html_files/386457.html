ACT:
Income Tax-Debtor and Creditor (Occupation Period) Ordinance
(Malaya Ord.  No. XLII of 1948)-Scope of-Liability to tax on
principle of estoppel.



HEADNOTE:
The  Japanese  currency introduced into	 Malaya	 during	 the
Japanese occupation began to depreciate after January  1963,
so  that  debts	 paid  off and	received  in  that  currency
resulted in loss to the creditors.  The Government of India,
by  a  notification issued in 1947, propounded a  scheme  to
give  relief  to Indian nationals carrying  on	business  in
Malaya,	 and  the Central Board of  Revenue  issued  further
instructions  on  the scheme.  One of the  instructions	 was
that if any creditors opted to accept the scheme, a recovery
subsequently  made by them, with respect to the debt due  to
them  was to be taken as their income.	In 1948, the  Debtor
and Creditor (Occupation Period) Ordinance No. XLII of 1948,
of Malaya was passed by the Malaya Legislature.	 Under	that
Ordinance,  payments  made in Japanese currency were  to  be
valued	and scaled down in accordance with its Schedule,  so
that  a	 payment  in  Japanese currency	 would	be  a  valid
discharge of a debt only to the extent of such	revaluation.
A  creditor  could  enforce  his  debt	to  the	 extent	 not
discharged  and	 the  debtor  was  under  an  obligation  to
discharge  it  to that extent.	On the questions as  to	 (i)
whether amounts, recovered by creditors who had accepted the
scheme, from their debtors, in terms of the Ordinance,	were
liable	to  income-tax; and (ii) whether the  debtors  could
claim  the  payments made by them as  deductions,  the	High
Court held, (i) that the assessees who had received payments
would  not he liable to tax in respect of amounts  they	 had
received  towards principal, but they would be so liable  in
respect of moneys which they had received towards  interest;
and (ii) that those assessees who had made payments  towards
the  debts, would be entitled to deduct from  their  income,
and  claim exemption from tax only such amounts as they	 had
paid on account of interest, but they would not be  entitled
to  deduct  any payment made on account of  principal.	 The
High Court also gave directions that open payments should be
appropriated  according	 to  the  law  of  appropriation  of
payments.   The Commissioner and a debtor-assessee  appealed
to the Supreme Court.
  HELD : The appeals should be dismissed.
   (i)	  The creditor-assessees were not' precluded on	 the
principle  of "approbate and reprobate" from  pleading	that
the income they derived subsequently, by realisation of	 the
revived	 debts,	 was not taxable income.  The  doctrine	 was
only  a species of estoppel and cannot operate	against	 the
statute.   If a particular income is not taxable  under	 the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Income-tax Act</a>, it cannot be taxed on the basis of  estoppel
or any other equitable doctrine. [822 F-H]
   (ii)	  Under	 the Ordinance, the discharged debts  became
enforceable  to the extent of the balance of the amount	 due
after the scaling down of the
816
payments,  and the contention of the Revenue that the  State
provided  for  compensation  for the loss  incurred  by	 the
creditor-assessees could not be accepted. [825 B-E]
(iii)	  The  Income-tax Officer could only  impose  income
tax  on	 the income recovered by  the  assessees  thereafter
towards	 their	debts if such income was taxable  under	 the
provisions  of	the Act.  So too in regard to  the  payments
made  by the Assessees towards such debts, they could  claim
relief	by  way of deduction only if  such  deductions	were
permissible under the Act. [825 F-G]

<p id="p_7">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
   Subba Rao J. These 16 appeals are filed against the Judg-
ment of the High Court of Judicature at Madras and raise the
question   of  the  effect  of	the  Debtor   and   Creditor
(Occupation  Period) Ordinance No. XLII of 1948	 of  Malaya,
hereinafter  called the Ordinance, on the liability  of	 the
assessee  to  pay income-tax in	 respect  of  pre-occupation
debts revived thereunder.
</p><p id="p_8">   During the last World War Japan occupied Malaya.   During
the  period of their occupancy i.e., from February  1942  to
September  1945,  they	introduced  their  own	currency  in
dollars.   During  that period both the currencies  were  in
vogue  though  there  was  a  progressive  depreciation	  of
Japanese  currency in its relation to Malayan currency.	  On
September 5, 1945, the British Government re-occupied Malaya
and introduced the Malayan currency as legal tender in place
of  Japanese  currency.	  The  Indian  nationals,  who	were
carrying  on  business	in  Malaya  during  the;  period  of
Japanese occupation, were hit adversely and suffered losses.
The  Government	 of  India  came  to  their  rescue  and  by
Notification dated August 14, 1947, they propounded a scheme
to  give them relief by allowing them to set off the  losses
incurred  by  them  during  the	 5  years  relevant  to	 the
assessment  years 1942-43 to 1946-47 against the profits  of
the assessment years 1942-43 and 1941-42.  We shall consider
the scheme in some detail at a later stage of the  judgment.
On  December  16, 1948, the Malayan Legislature	 passed	 the
Ordinance declaring that payments made in Japanese  currency
by  debtors to their creditors in respect of debts  incurred
prior  to  and	during the Japanese occupation	were  to  be
valued	and  scaled  down in accordance	 with  the  schedule
appended to the Ordinance.  We shall deal with Ordinance  in
some detail at the appropriate place but the broad effect of
the  Ordinance	was that though a debt had  been  discharged
fully  by  paying the amount due in Japanese  currency,	 the
debt  was  revived  in proportion  to  the  depreciation  of
Japanese  currency  in relation to the Malayan	currency  as
laid down by the schedule.  The creditor's right to  recover
the debt to the said extent and the liability of the  debtor
to pay the same revived.
</p><p id="p_9">As  the	 question raised is one of law and does	 not  depend
upon the peculiar facts of each case, we think it is  enough
if we
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">818</span>
state  briefly the facts of two cases, one illustrating	 the
claim of an assessee against the imposition of income-tax in
respect	 of  the income he realized by the  revival  of	 the
debts  and the other illustrating that of an assessee to  an
allowance  on the ground that he paid the scaled down  debts
over again.
</p><p id="p_10">   The respondent in Civil Appeal No. 722 to 735 of 1963  is
a  firm carrying on business of money-lending in  Kampar  in
Federated  Malaya  State.  It applied for relief  under	 the
special	 scheme.   It incurred loss for the  aforesaid	four
years of Rs. 1,33,125.	For the years 1941-42 and 1942-43 it
had a profit of Rs. 53,010 and Rs. 35,753 respectively.	 The
said  profits were set off against the losses and the  taxes
paid  by it for the years 1941-42 and 1942-43 were  refunded
to  it.	  After the Ordinance was passed, in terms  of	that
Ordinance the respondent recovered 6,437 dollars during	 the
previous  year	ending April 12, 1952 corresponding  to	 the
assessment year 1952-53.
</p><p id="p_11">  Civil	 Appeals  Nos.	518 to 520 of  1963  deal  with	 the
converse  case.	 The appellant therein is a Hindu  undivided
family carrying on, inter alia, a money-lending business  in
its own village in Kaula Kubbu Bharu and Parit Buntar in the
Federated  Malaya States.  In the course of its business  it
had  taken  moneys as deposits from various  persons  before
April  12,  1942.   During  the	 period	 of  occupation	  it
discharged its liability to various creditors but after	 the
publication  of	 the  Ordinance	 it  had  to  pay  again  to
creditors 6,214.58 dollars in the previous year ending April
12, 1950; 28,586 dollars for the previous year ending  April
12,  1951; and 11,547 dollars for the previous	year  ending
April  12, 1952.  The aforesaid amounts were claimed by	 the
appellant  as  deductions respectively	for  the  assessment
years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53.

   The	Income-tax Officers held that during the  period  of
Japanese  occupation the debts were discharged and that	 the
receipt	 of  additional amounts under the Ordinance  was  in
fact assessable to tax.	 They also held that in the case  of
an assessee who was a debtor no deduction was permissible on
the ground that the amounts paid represented only  repayment
of  capital  and not business expenditure.   On	 appeal	 the
Appellate  Assistant Commissioner held that the receipts  by
the  assessee  in  respect of the revived  debts  were	only
realization  of	 the original amounts lent  and,  therefore,
could  not be regarded as income.  In the case of the  claim
for  deduction,	 he agreed with the view of  the  Income-tax
Officer.  On further appeal to the Tribunal, in the case  of
receipts  it  held that the assessee  by  claiming  benefits
under  the  scheme and in including all its  cash  and	Bank
balances  in  the  Malayan business as part  of	 the  losses
incurred  therein in effect indirectly wrote off  the  debts
due to them and, therefore, the recoveries under the  Ordin-
ance  were only a subsequent realization of the written	 off
bad  debts  and, therefore, assessable	to  income-tax.	  In
those appeals relating to deductions, the Tribunal confirmed
the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
The  High  Court answered the questions referred  to  it  as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      (1)   Where    an	  assessee   has    received
	      repayments,  he will not be liable to  tax  in
	      respect  of  amounts  he has  received  as  or
	      towards principal, but he will be so liable in
	      respect of moneys which he has received as  or
	      towards interest.. Where only part of the debt
	      has  been	 recovered, the assesse will  be  at
	      liberty,	subject	 to  the  law  relating	  to
	      appropriation of payments, to appropriate	 the
	      money he has received either towards principal
	      or  interest.   The assessment in	 respect  of
	      such receipts will proceed on this basis, that
	      is  to say, if the payment has  been  lawfully
	      appropriated towards interest, will be  liable
	      to  pay tax thereon.  But if he  has  lawfully
	      appropriated it towards principal, he will not
	      be liable to pay tax on it.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      (2)   Where an assessee has made payments,  he
	      will  be	entitled  to deduct  them  from	 his
	      income  and claim exemption from tax for	only
	      such  amounts  as he has paid  on	 account  of
	      interest.	  He will not be entitled to  deduct
	      any payments on account of principal.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">821</span>
<p id="p_123">The  Tribunal was directed to review the assessment  in	 the
light of the said directions.  The main reason given by	 the
High  Court for giving the said answers was that the  result
of  the	 Ordinance  was	 to revive the	old  debts  and	 the
question  of the exigibility of the said income to  tax	 can
only be decided on the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">Income-tax Act</a>	 and
not by the terms of the scheme of the Ordinance.  Hence	 the
appeals.
</p><p id="p_124">   The learned Solicitor-General, appearing for the Revenue,
raised before us the following three points: (1) Sub-s.	 (2)
of<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_4"> s. 4</a> of the Ordinance on which reliance was placed by the
High Court applies only to pre-occupation capital debts	 and
the debts with which the appeals are concerned are not	pre-
occupation  capital  debts  and,  therefore,  they  are	 not
revived	 thereunder. (2) The assessees having taken  benefit
under the scheme propounded by the Government of India which
contained  a condition that if any  recoveries	subsequently
made would be taken as income,, they are now precluded	from
contending  that the, amounts realized towards	the  revived
debts  are  not taxable on the principle  of  approbate	 and
reprobate.   And  (3) on a reasonable  construction  of	 the
relevant  sections of the Ordinance it should be  held	that
there  was no revival of the debts but only that  the  State
had provided for compensation for the losses incurred during
the occupation period by the assessees.
The  first question had not been raised at any stage of	 the
proceedings  before  the Tribunal and the High	Court.	 Nor
does  it find a place in the statement of case.	 We  cannot,
therefore,  allow  the learned Counsel to raise it  for	 the
first time before us.
</p><p id="p_125">Nor has the second question been raised in the High Court in
the  form  in which it is presented before us.	 The  scheme
propounded by the Government of India, inter alia,  contains
the following provisions :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      (i)   No assessee was under any obligation  to
	      accept  the scheme.  If he desired to opt	 for
	      the scheme be was required to give option with
	      one month after he was informed of the scheme.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      (ii)  An assessee was permitted to include  in
	      his  expenses  certain items  which  would  be
	      inadmissible under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_5">Indian Income-tax Act</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      (iii) The	 losses	 suffered  by  an   assessee
	      during   the  five  years	 relevant   to	 the
	      assessment years 1942-43 to 1946-47 were to be

</blockquote><p id="p_126">The Central Board of Revenue issued further instructions  on
the above scheme by its letter dated December 1, 1947.	 One
of  the instructions was that debts due to the	assessee  if
paid  in  Japanese  currency would be  taken  to  have	been
satisfied to that extent and excluded from the asset side in
the  balance  sheet,  provided	that  if  any  recovery	 was
subsequently  made, it was to be taken as  income.   Briefly
stated, under the scheme the losses suffered by an  assessee
during the assessment years 1942-43 to 1946-47 were set	 off
against	 his  profits for the assessment years	1942-43	 and
1941-42	 and  any  unabsorbed  loss  could  not	 be  carried
forward.   The	debts discharged in Japanese  currency	were
excluded  from the assets side in the balance sheet but	 the
authority  reserved  for  itself  the  right  to  treat	 any
recoveries  subsequently made as income.  The contention  is
that  the  assessees  having opted  to	accept	the  scheme,
derived	 benefit  thereunder,  and  agreed  to	have   their
discharged debts excluded from the asset side in the balance
sheet subject to the condition that subsequent recoveries by
them would be taxable income, they are now precluded, on the
principle  of "approbate and reprobate", from pleading	that
the  income they derived subsequently by realization of	 the
revived	 debts	is  not taxable	 income.   The	doctrine  of
"approbate and reprobate" is only a species of estoppel;  it
applies	 only to the conduct of parties.  As in the case  of
estoppel,  it  cannot operate against the  provisions  of  a
statute.   If a particular income is not taxable  under	 the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_6">Income-tax Act</a>, it cannot be taxed on the basis of  estoppel
or any other equitable doctrine.  Equity is out of place  in
tax law; a particular income is either exigible to tax under
the  taxing statute or it is not.  If it is not the  Income-
tax Officer has no power to impose tax on the said income.
The  decision  in <a href="/doc/31353/" id="a_7">Amarendra Narayan Roy v.  Commissioner  of
Income-tax,  West Bengal</a>(1) has no bearing on  the  question
raised
(1)  A.I.R. 1954 Cal. 271.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">823</span>
<p id="p_127">before	us.   There  the  concessional	scheme	tempted	 the
assessee  to disclose voluntarily all his  concealed  income
and he agreed to pay the proper tax upon it.  The  agreement
there related to the quantification of taxable income but in
the  present  case  what is, sought to be  taxed  is  not  a
taxable	 income.  The assessee in such a case can  certainly
raise the plea that his income is not taxable under the Act.
We, therefore, reject this plea.
  To appreciate the third argument it is necessary to notice
the  relevant  terms of the Ordinance.	 The  Ordinance	 was
issued	 by   the  Malayan  Government	 to   regulate	 the
relationship  between the debtor and creditor in respect  of
debts  incurred prior to and during the period of the  enemy
occupation  of the territories comprising the federation  of
Malaya.	 The relevant sections of the Ordinance read:

sub-s.	(2) of<a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_11"> S. 4</a> of the Ordinance does not apply  to	 the
debts in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> 825</span>
question  as throughout the proceedings of this case it	 was
assumed	 that  it  applies to the said	debts.	 During	 the
Japanese  Occupation  both  the Japanese  currency  and	 the
Malayan	 currency  were	 in  vogue.   In  January  1943	 the
Japanese  currency  began to depreciate and  by	 August	 13,
1945, it ceased to be of any value.  During that process  of
devaluation  debts  were paid off and received	in  Japanese
currency  which	 resulted  in loss  to	the  creditors.	  To
regulate  the  relationship between creditors  and  debtors.
during	that  period the said Ordinance was  passed  by	 the
Malayan	 Legislature on December 16, 1948.  Under  the	said
Ordinance  payments in Japanese currency were to  be  valued
and scaled down in accordance with the Schedule appended  to
the Ordinance.	If a debtor had paid his debt in depreciated
Japanese  currency,  he	 was required to pay  over  again  a
certain	 amount to be ascertained by the application of	 the
provisions  of the Schedule.  In terms sub-s. (2) says	that
the payment in Japanese currency shall be a valid  discharge
of  such debt only to the extent of such revaluation.	When
the payments made towards debts were scaled down, the  debts
were  revived in regard to the balance of the  debt.   After
the making of the Ordinance, the creditor could enforce	 his
debt  to  the extent not discharged and the debtor  had	 the
obligation  to discharge the same.  On the express terms  of
the Ordinance it is impossible to accept the contention that
the State provided for compensation for the losses  incurred
bY  the	 assessees.  indeed  the  State	 did  not  pay	 any
compensation at all.  The legal relationship of the creditor
and  debtor  was  not created by the Ordinance	but  it	 was
regulated  on  the basis of the	 pre-existing  relationship.
We,  therefore,	 hold, agreeing with the  High	Court,	that
under the Ordinance the discharged debts became	 enforceable
to  the	 extent of the balance of the amount due  after	 the
scaling down of the payments.  If so, the Income-tax Officer
could  only  impose  tax  on the  income  recovered  by	 the
assessees thereafter towards their debts if such income	 was
taxable under the provisions of the Act.
   So  too, in regard to the payment made by  the  assessees
towards	 such  debts  they  could claim	 relief	 by  way  of
deductions  only if such deductions were  permissible  under
the Act.
</p><p id="p_129">   The	High Court held that the assessees who had  received
repayments would not be liable to tax in respect of  amounts
they  had  received towards principal but they would  be  so
liable in respect of moneys which they had received  towards
interest.  It further held that those assessees who had made
payments towards the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">826</span>
debts  would  be entitled to deduct from  their	 income	 and
claim exemption from tax only such amounts as they had	paid
on  account  of interest but they would not be	entitled  to
deduct	any payment made on account of principal.  The	High
Court  also  gave  a  direction that in	 the  case  of	open
payments  the respective amounts paid towards  principal  or
interest should be ascertained in accordance with the law of
appropriation  of payments.  Neither the learned  Solicitor-
General,  who  appeared	 for the Revenue,  nor	the  learned
counsel,  who  appeared for the	 assessees,  questioned	 the
correctness  of the said directions if the  construction  we
placed	on the Ordinance was correct.  The directions  given
by the High Court will, therefore, stand.  In our view,	 the
High Court gave correct answers to the questions referred to
it.
