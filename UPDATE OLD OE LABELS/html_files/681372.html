HEADNOTE:
The  respondent, a member of the Indian Police Service,	 was
borne  oil the Jammu and Kashmir Cadre.	 The Commission	 set
up   under  the	 Jammu	and  Kashmir   Government   Servants
Prevention  of	Corruption (Commission) Act  1962,  directed
investigation  into a complaint received by  the  Commission
against	 the respondent.  He challenged the jurisdiction  of
the  Commission,  and the High Court allowed  the  petition,
holding tint the members of an All India Service, serving in
a  State, are governed by the <a href="/doc/1820745/" id="a_4">All India Services  Act</a>,	1951
and  the Rules made thereunder, and the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_5">Commission  Act</a>	 was
not applicable to them.
Dismissing the appeal to this Court,
HELL)  :  Assuming that the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_6">Commission Act</a> is, in  pith	 and
substance,  a law with respect to corruption  of  Government
servants, it is repugnant to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1820745/" id="a_7">All India
Services  Act</a>  and the All India  Services  (Discipline	 and
Appeal) Rules, 1955, and hence, under <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_8">Art. 254</a> as it existed
when  the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_9">Commission Act</a> came into force (July,	 16,  1962),
the  <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_10">Commission Act</a> must give way to the <a href="/doc/1820745/" id="a_11">All India  Services
Act</a> and the Rules made thereunder. [883 C.D. 887 B-C; 997 F]
(a)  The  position when the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_12">Commission Act</a> came	 into  force
was  that  Parliament could legislate on item  70,  List  I,
dealing with 'Union Public Services ' All India Services and
Union Public Service Commission, and )Vt. 254, as applicable
to  Jammu  and Kashmir at that time provided  that,  if	 any
Provision  of  a law made by the Legislature of a  State  is
repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which
Parliament is competent to enact the law made by Parliament,
whether	 passed	 before	 or  after  the	 law  made  by	 the
Legislature of the State, shall prevail and the law made  by
the  Legislature  of  the State shall,	to  ,the  extent  of
repugnancy, be void.  It therefore follows that if provision
of  the	 <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_13">Commission Act</a> is repugnant to a provision  of	 the
Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1955, then the law made by	 the
State of Jammu and Kashmir must give way. [884 H-885 F]

(b)  Repugnancy	 arises when (i) there is  inconsistency  in
the  actual terms of the Act enacted by Parliament  and	 the
impugned <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_16">State Act</a>,
882
or  (ii) the law enacted by Parliament was intended to be  a
complete and exhaustive code, (or) (iii) the law enacted  by
Parliament was intended expressly or impliedly to cover	 the
whole field. [887 F-H]

(c)  It	 could	be  said a law	enacted	 by  Parliament	 was
intended  to cover the whole field, where by reason  of	 the
subject	 matter dealt with, and the method of  dealing	with
it,  and  the  nature and multiplicity	of  the	 regulations
prescribed,  Parliament had adopted a plan or  scheme  which
would	be  hindered  and  obstructed  if   any	  additional
regulations whatever ate prescribed upon the subject by	 any
other  authority, that is, if the subject is either  touched
or trenched upon by the State authority. [888 D-F]

(d)  From the perusal of the provisions of the two statutory
laws, namely, the All India Services (Discipline and  Appeal
Rules,	1955, and the Jammu and Kashmir Government  Servants
Prevention  of	Corruption  (Commission)  Act,	1962  it  is
impossible  to escape the conclusion that the two cannot  go
together.    The  impugned  Act	 provides   for	  additional
punishments  not provided for in the Discipline	 and  Appeal
Rules;	and in so far as the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_20">Commission Act</a> deals  with	 the
infliction of disciplinary punishment it is repugnant to the
Discipline  and Appeal Rules.  Parliament had  occupied	 the
field  and  given clear indication that the only  manner  in
which  any disciplinary action could been taken against	 the
members	 of the All India Service, was under the  All  India
Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules. [897 B-D]
In  so far as the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_21">Commission Act</a> deals. with  a	 preliminary
enquiry	 for the purposes of enabling any prosecution to  be
launched it may be within the legislative competence of	 the
Jammu and Kashmir State and not repugnant to the  provisions
of  the Discipline and Appeal Rules.  But as the  provisions
dealing with investigation for possible criminal prosecution
are inextricably interwined with the provisions dealing with
infliction of disciplinary punishment the whole Act must  be
read  so as to leave the members of the All  India  Services
outside its purview. [897 D-F]

<p id="p_4">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Sikri, C.J. This is an appeal by certificate granted by	 the
High  Court  of Jammu and Kashmir from	its  judgment  dated
October	 31,  1966 allowing the writ petition filed  by	 the
petitioner-respondent,	M. S. Farooqi of the  Indian  Police
Service,  and  restraining the State of Jammu  and  Kashmir,
appellant  before us, from proceeding against him under	 the
Jammu	and  Kashmir  Government  Servants'  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_22">Prevention	  of
Corruption (Commission) Act</a>, 1962-hereinafter referred to as
the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_23">Commission Act</a>.  The High Court held that the members of
an All India Service serving in a State are governed by	 the
<a href="/doc/1820745/" id="a_24">All India Services Act</a>, 1951, and the Rules made thereunder,
and the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_25">Commission Act</a> was not applicable to them.  The High
Court  further held that the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_26">Commission Act</a> was hit by	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">art.
14</a>  of the Constitution as "there is a clear  discrimination
between the members of All India Services posted else  where
and  the  members of the same Service posted  in  the  State
inasmuch   as  inquiry	against	 the  former  for  acts	  of
corruption is to be held under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_28">Central Act</a> and the rules
made  thereunder while against the latter for the same	acts
of  corruption	enquiry is to be held under  the  <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_29">Commission
Act</a>,  the provisions of which are for more drastic than	 the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_30">Central Act</a> and the rules made thereunder."
We  may briefly state the relevant facts which	necessitated
the filing of the writ petition.  The respondent before	 us,
M. S. Farooqi, hereinafter referred to as the petitioner, is
a member of the Indian Police Service which is in All  India
Service.   He  is borne on the Jammu &amp;	Kashmir	 cadre.	  On
March  12, 1964, an anonymous complaint was received by	 the
Commission,  set up under the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_31">Commission Act</a>.  On March	 20,
1964,  the  Commission asked for a report  from	 the  Deputy
Inspector  General of Police.  The Deputy Inspector  General
of Police (Anti Corruption Organisation) raised the question
of  the	 jurisdiction of the  Commission.   The	 Commission,
however, held that the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_32">Commission Act</a> was applicable in	 its
entirety  to  Government  servants belonging  to  Jammu	 and
Kashmir	 cadre	of the All India  Services.   The  objection
raised by the Investigating Agency was thus overruled.	 The
Investigating Agency was directed to continue  Investigation
of  the case and submit a report.  Thereupon the  petitioner
filed  the writ petition in the High Court  challenging	 the
jurisdiction  of the Commission.  As stated above, the	High
Court allowed the petition, but later granted certificate of
fitness and the appeal filed on behalf of the State of Jammu
and Kashmir is now before us.
</p><p id="p_5">The learned counsel for the State contends that
(1)  <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_33">The  Commission Act</a> is in pith and substance a  law  in
respect	 of corruption of Government servants of  Jammu	 and
Kashmir and only incidentally deals with members of the	 All
India
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">884</span>
Services, and is therefore valid in its entirety.
(2)  If	 such  a  legislation  is  valid,  the	Act  is	 not
discriminatory	because	 all servants of Jammu	and  Kashmir
Government are treated alike and the same procedure  applied
to them for the trial of offences of corruption;
(3)  There  is	a  valid  classification  on  the  basis  of
territory; and
(4)  In any event, the procedure under the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_34">Commission Act</a> is
not  more prejudicial than that under the AU India  Services
Act, 1951, and the rules made thereunder.
The first point raised by the learned counsel does not	meet
the  real objection to the applicability of  the  <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_35">Commission
Act</a> to members of the Indian Police Service serving in Jammu
and  Kashmir.	This objection is that,	 assuming  that	 the
<a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_36">Commission  Act</a> is in pith and substance a law with  respect
to corruption of Government servants, it is repugnant to the
provisions  of the <a href="/doc/1820745/" id="a_37">All India Service Act</a>, 1951, and the	 All
India	Services  (Discipline  and  Appeal)   Rules,   1955-
hereinafter referred to as the Discipline and Appeal  Rules,
and it must give way to the statutory provisions.
It  seems to us that there is force in the objection  raised
on  behalf  of	the petitioner and in that view	 it  is	 not
necessary  to decide the four points raised by	the  learned
counsel.
</p><p id="p_6"> We  are here concerned with, the Constitution of  India  as
applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir at the relevant
time.  <a href="/doc/666119/" id="a_38">Article 370</a> of the Constitution of India, inter alia,
provides that "the powers of Parliament to make laws for the
State  (of  Jammu  and Kashmir) shall be  limited  to  those
matters in the Union List and the Concurrent List which,  in
consultation with the Government of the State, are  declared
by  the President to correspond to matters specified in	 the
Instrument  of	Accession  governing the  Accession  of	 the
State, to the Dominion of India as the matters with  respect
to  which  the Dominion Legislature may make  laws  for	 the
State,	and  (ii) such other matters in the said  Lists	 as,
with  the  concurrence of the Government of the	 State,	 the
President may by order specify.	 "
</p><p id="p_7">In exercise of the powers conferred by cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/666119/" id="a_39">art.	370</a>,
the President, with the concurrence of the Government of the
State	of  Jammu,  and	 Kashmir,  made	  the	Constitution
(Application  to  Jammu and Kashmir) Order,  1954.   We	 are
concerned  in this case with the position as it	 existed  on
0July  16, 1962 when the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_40">Commission Act</a> received the  assent
of  the Sadar-i-Riyasat.  The position was  that  Parliament
could  legislate  on List I, entry 70, which  reads:  "Union
Public	Services, All-India Services; Union  Public  Service
Commission."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">885</span>
<p id="p_8"><a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_41">Article, 246</a> of the Constitution, as applied to Jammu and
Kashmir, then read
	      "24.6(1)	Parliament  has exclusive  power  to

	      enumerated  in List I in the Seventh  Schedule

	      "Union List."
</p><p id="p_9">Articles  248 and 249 of the Constitution had not been	made
applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir and, therefore,
all the residuary powers rested with the State of Jammu	 and
Kashmir.   Entry  97  of  List	I,  dealing  with  residuary
powers., had also been omitted.

</blockquote><p id="p_11">At the relevant time there was no concurrent Iist.   Certain
entries in the Concurrent List seem to have been applied  by
the  order No. CO 66 of 1963 dated September 25,  1963,	 for
the first time.
</p><p id="p_12">From  this  constitutional  scheme  it	follows	 that  if  a

of the Discipline and Appeal Rules, 17955, then the law made
by the State of Jammu and Kashmir must give way.
<a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_44">Article 254</a> of the Constitution as applied above, is similar
to section 109 of the Australian Constitution which provides
that "when a law of the State is inconsistent with a law  of
the  Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the  former
shall to the extent of inconsistency, be invalid."

Court  examined the question of repugnancy.  It referred  to
various authorities and concluded that either there must  be
inconsistency  in  the actual terms of the  Act	 enacted  by
Parliament and the impugned <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_67">State Act</a> or the law enacted  by
Parliament be intended to be a complete and exhaustive code;
in  other words, expressly or impliedly evince an  intention
to cover the whole field.  Various tests have been suggested
by various authorities as to how to determine whether  there
is any inconsistency or repugnancy.  Bhagwati, J.,  referred
to  Nicholas-Australian Constitution, 2nd ed. p. 303who	 had
suggested  three  tests	 of  inconsistency  or	repugnancy,,
namely :-

there  may still be, inconsistency if the State attempts  to
govern	conduct or to deal with a matter which	has  already
been  dealt with by a law of the Commonwealth  intended	 to,
express	  completely   exhaustively   or   exclusively	 the
law,governing  a  certain subject matter.  The	question  in

Parliament  ? Is it an intention to lay down the  whole	 'of

withdrawn  from State control, but, as we have see from	 the
reasoning of Dixon J., in the 44-hour Case, it is withdrawn,
not  from any or all State legislation which may  affect  or
have,  some  connection	 with  it,  but	 only  from   State,
legislation which attempts to govern it in the character  in

whether the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_69">State Act</a> deals with such conduct as forming  an
element	 in the subject intended to be exclusively  governed
by  Commonwealth  law.	This question is one which  must  be
decided in the circumstances of each particular case."
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in O  'Sullivan
v.  Noarrlunga Meat Ltd.(1) approved of the following  lines
from the judgment of Dixon J. in Ex parte Mclean (2) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	      "The  inconsistency does not lie in  the	mere
	      coexistence of two laws which are	 susceptible

	      in the Canadian cases cannot be brushed  aside
	      by  simply  saying  that	they  relate  to   a

	      not only ,of the greatest weight but must be a
	      guide  to us even in interpreting	 the  Indian
	      Constitution.  Of course, we cannot  interpret
	      the language of any section in the <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_71">Indian	 Act</a>
	      in  the  light of the  interpretation  of	 the

	      part of the doctrine and exclude another part.
	      Partial  application  may frustrate  the	very
	      object for which the rule of law was  deduced.
	      The  two doctrines of incidental	encroachment
	      and  unoccupied field are closely related.   I
	      would  go	 further  and  say  that  they	 are
	      indissolubly connected.  We cannot import	 the
	      doctrine of incidental encroachment in  favour
	      of  the  Provinces, and refuse to	 import	 the
	      doctrine	of  unoccupied	field  which  is  in
	      favour of the Centre.  The two must go hand in
	      hand.   To  allow Provincial  legislatures  to
	      encroach	upon  the exclusive  Federal  field,
	      even though in an indirect way, when there  is
	      a	 Central legislation already  occupying	 the

	      in  the  Federal List.  Such a  carte  blanche

such  legislation in respect of subjects enumerated in	List
II  may	 without any such  safeguard  override	pre-existing
enactments even of the Central Legislature if they relate to
subjects specified in List I."
</p><p id="p_30">The learned counsel for the State relies on the decision  of
the Privy Council in <a href="/doc/571954/" id="a_81">Megh Raj. v. Allah Rakhia</a>(1) in support
of his proposition that if the impugned legislation is a law
not  with  respect  to All India Services  but	a  law	with

jurisdiction  of the State Legislature, and no	question  of
repugnancy arises.  He relies particularly on the  following
observations:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	      "Thus both parties rightly construed<a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_82"> S. 107</a> as

	      List  II, without any necessity to invoke	 any
	      powers  from the, Concurrent List,  List	III.
	      Accordingly  questions of repugnancy under <a href="/doc/1143713/" id="a_83"> s.

	      need not be considerd here."
</blockquote><p id="p_31">But  if	 facts	are examined it would be  clear	 that  these
observations do not assist the appellant.  The Art which was
impugned was the Punjab Restitution of Mortgaged Lands	Act,
1938, and it was argued that the provisions of the  impugned
Act  were repugnant to certain existing Indian	Laws,  viz.,
<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_84">Indian	Contract Act</a> and the Code of Civil Procedure,  which
fell, within entries 8 and 10 of List III of the, Government
of  India  Act,	 1935.	 Entry 8  dealt	 with  "transfer  of
property other than agricultural land; registration of deeds
and documents" and entry 10 dealt with "Contracts, including
partnership,  agency,  contracts  of  carriage,	 and   other
special	 forms	of  contract, but  not	including  contracts
relating  to agricultural land." The Privy Council  came  to
the conclusion that the impugned Act was within items 2	 and
21 of List II.	Their Lord ships observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	      "If,  as their Lordships think,  the  impugned
	      Act is limited to agricultural land items 7, 8
	      and 10 of List III do not affect the position,
	      since  agricultural land is excluded in  these
	      entries.	 But in any event, the Act does	 not
	      deal with wills or the transfer of property at
	      all;  it does certainly deal  with  mortgages,
	      but  as their Lordships have  already  stated,
	      mortgages,  though not expressly mentioned  in
	      the  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_85">Constitution	 Act</a>,  are  properly  to  be
	      classed  not under the head of contracts,	 but
	      as special transactions ancillary to the entry
	      of "land." .
</blockquote><p id="p_32">In  this  case	it was obvious that there  was	no  conflict
between legislation on entries in List II and legislation on
entries	 in  List III the conflict if at all  was  with	 the
existing  Indian  laws.	 The Privy Council had not  to	deal
with  the matter with which we are concerned, vim,,  when  a
valid	State  legislation,  comes  into  conflict  with   a
competent legislation of 'Parliament under List I.
Similarly in prafulla <a href="/doc/806261/" id="a_86">Kumar Mukherjee v. Bank of Commerce</a>(1)
there was alleged conflict between the Bengal Money
(1)  [1947] F.C.R. 28, 34.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">893</span>
<p id="p_33">Lenders	 Act,  1940,  and an existing  Indian  Law,  namely,
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_87">Negotiable  Instruments Act</a>.  It was urged before the  Privy
Council that "if outside the authorized field. the  impugned
Act  conflicts with a Federal law-in the sense in which	 the
words  are used in<a href="/doc/1524688/" id="a_88"> s. 107</a> of the Constitution Act-it may  be
that its provisions would be ineffective.  The answer to the
suggestion that there is any such conflict here is threefold
:  (i)	There is no conflict or	 inconsistency	between	 the
impugned  Act  and the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_89">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>;  (ii)  If
there is a conflict, then the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_90">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>  is
not  a	Federal	 law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1143713/" id="a_91"> S.	107</a>  of	 the
Constitution  Act; (iii) If there is a conflict, and if	 the
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_92">Negotiable  Instruments	 Act</a>  is  a  Federal  law  then	 the
conflict  is with that part of the Federal Law which  is  in
the  field of contract, which is within the power  conferred
by List III, the Concurrent List, and the conflict is  cured
by  the provisions of<a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_93"> s. 107</a>, sub-s. 2, of the	<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_94">Constitution
Act</a>,  because this is a case where the Act was reserved	 for
the consideration of the Governor-General, and therefore the
Provincial law in the province would prevail."
The  Privy Council posed three "questions. (1) <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_95">Does the	 Act</a>
in question deal in pith and substance with money lending  ?
(2) If it does, is it valid though it incidentally  trenches
on  matters reserved for the Federal legislature ? (3)	Once
it  is	determined whether the pith and substance  is  money
lending, is the extent to which the Federal field is invaded
a material matter ? They answered the first question in	 the
affirmative.   Dealing with the second question,  the  Privy
Council observed
	      "Moreover,   the	 British   Parliament	when
	      enacting	the  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_96">Indian Constitution Act</a>  had  a
	      long experience of the working of the  British
	      North   America	Act   and   the	  Australian
	      Commonwealth  Act and must have known that  it
	      is  not in principle possible to	ensure	that
	      the   powers   entrusted	 to   the    several
	      legislatures 'will never overlap."
</p><p id="p_34">The  Privy Council approved of certain observations  of	 Sir
Maurice Gwyer, C.J. and then observed
	      "But the overlapping of subject-matter is	 not
	      avoided  by substituting three lists for	two,
	      or  even	by  arranging  for  a  hierarchy  of
	      jurisdictions Subjects must still overlap, and
	      where they do, the question must be asked what
	      in  pith and substance is the effect  of	the,
	      enactment of which complaint is, made" and, in
	      what list is its true nature and character  to
	      be  found.   If these questions could  not  be
	      asked,  much beneficient legislation would  be
	      stifled  at  birth, and many of  the  subjects
	      entrusted to
11-L1061SupCI/72
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">894</span>
Provincial  legislation.  could never effectively  be  dealt
with."
</p><p id="p_35">Dealing	  with	the  third  question,  the   Privy   Council
observed:,
	      "No  doubt it is an important matter, not,  as
	      their Lordships think, because the validity of
	      an  Act  can be determined  by  discriminating
	      between  degrees	of  invasion,  but  for	 the
	      purpose  of determining what is the  pith	 and
	      substance of the impugned Act.  Its provisions
	      may  advance so far into Federal territory  as
	      to show that its true nature is not  concerned
	      with  provincial matters, but the question  is
	      not,  has it trespassed more or less,  but  is
	      the trespass, whatever it be, such as to	show
	      that  the pith and substance of  the  impugned
	      Act is not money lending but promissory  notes
	      or banking ?"
</p><p id="p_36">Their Lordships further observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">	      "Does the priority of the Federal	 legislature
	      prevent	the  Provincial	  legislature	from

	      has  one to consider what the substance of  an
	      Act  is  and, whatever its  ancillary  effect,
	      attribute it to the appropriate list according
	      to its true character ?"
</blockquote><p id="p_37">in this case there was no conflict alleged with the  Federal
legislation  on	 an  item  in List  I  and  what  they	were
considering was conflict with the existing law.
<a href="/doc/1057797/" id="a_97">In A. S. Krishna v. State of Madras</a>(1) the conflict  alleged
was  between  the Madras Prohibition Act, 1937, on  the	 one
hand  and  the	<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_98">Indian Evidence Act</a>, 1872 and  the  Code  of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 on the other.	This Court held that
the impugned Act in question was a law with respect to entry
31 List II, and observed
	      "The  Madras  Prohibition Act is thus  in	 its
	      entirety a law within the exclusive competence
	      of   the	Provincial  Legislature,   and	 the
	      question	of repugnance under<a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_99"> s.	107(1)</a>	does
	      not arise."'
The  Court  did not address itself to the  question  whether
assuming' that if was a law with respect to entry 31 List II
and  not a law with respect to entries 5 and 2	respectively
of  List III, 'yet what is to happen if the  existing  laws,
namely,	 the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_100">Evidence Act</a> and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_101"> the Criminal  Procedure  Code</a>,
were  in fact repugnant.  At any rate, this Court  was	then
not  concerned with Parliamentary legislation under  List  I
and  also was not concerned with <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_102">art. 254</a> in the form as  it
existed	 at the relevant time as applicable to the State  of
It Jammu and Kashmir.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">895</span>
<p id="p_39">We may mention that this Court upheld the provisions of	 the
Bombay	Prohibition  Act, 1949, under <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_103">art.  254(2)</a>  in	Ukka
Kothe v. State of Madras (1) insofar as they were consistent
with "the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_104"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure.
The learned counsel for the appellant referred to  Calcutta.
<a href="/doc/690534/" id="a_105">Gas Company v. State of West Bengal</a>(2), but we are unable,to
see  how  it helps the appellant's case.  In that  case	 the
Court  was  concerned with reconciling certain	entries	 and
observed  that	"entries in the lists are  only	 legislative
heads or fields of legislation; they demarcate the area over
Which  the appropriate legislature can operate.	 It is	well
settled	 that  widest  amplitude  should  be  given  to	 the
language  of  the entries.  But some of the entries  in	 the
different List or in the same List may overlap and sometimes
may  also appear to be in direct conflict with	each  other.
It  is then the duty of this Court to reconcile the  entries
and bring harmony between them." But in this case we are not
concerned  with	 any  question of  harmonising	the  entries
because	 we have on the one hand a specific entry in List  I
and on the other hand a residuary List.
</p><p id="p_40">Now it remains to be seen whether the impugned Act is repug-
nant to the provisions of the All India Service	 (Discipline
and Appeal) Rules, 1955.  We may first notice the provisions
of  the	 Discipline  and Appeal Rules.	 Rule  3  prescribes
certain	 penalties,  which  may	 for  good  and	  sufficient
reasons, and as hereinafter provided be imposed on a  member
of the Service.	 The penalties include censure,	 withholding
of increments or promotion; reduction in rank, removal	from
service	 and dismissal from service, etc.  The authority  to
institute  proceedings and to impose penalties is  mentioned
in  r.	4. It is the Government, under whom  the  member  is
serving at the time of the commission of an act or  omission
which renders him liable to any penalty, which is  competent
alone	to  institute  disciplinary  proceedings  and	that
Government can also impose all the penalties specified in r.
3  except  the penalty of dismissal, removal  or  compulsory
retirement which order can only be passed by an order of the
Central	 Government.   Rule 5 prescribes the  procedure	 for
imposing penalties.  The grounds on which it is proposed  to
take action shall be reduced to the form of definite  charge
or charges which shall be communicated to the member of	 the
Service charged together with a statement of the allegations
on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances
which  it is proposed to take into consideration in  passing
orders	on  the	 case.	A member of  the  service  is  given
reasonable  time to put in a written statement	of  defence.
It enables him to be heard if he

(2) [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 1.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">896</span>
<p id="p_41">so  desires.  The member of the Service is entitled to	have
access to official records.  After the written statement  is
received,  if  such is filed, the Government may  appoint  a
Board  of Inquiry or an Inquiry Officer to enquire into	 the
charges or the Government enquires into the charges itself.
In brief, detailed rules are laid down regarding the  manner
of  holding the enquiry.  Rule 6 provides  for	consultation
with the Union Public Service Commission.  Rule 7 deals with
suspension  during disciplinary proceedings and r.  8  deals
with subsistence allowance during suspension.  Rule 9  deals
with payment of pay and allowances and treatment of  service
on  reinstatement.   A	right of  appeal  is  given  against
certain	 orders	 and  r. 20 provides for a  memorial  to  be
submitted to the President.
</p><p id="p_42">These  rules  are a complete code as far  as  infliction  of
penalties prescribed in r. 3 is concerned.
<a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_106">The  Commission Act</a> provides for the constitution of one  or
more Commissions to be known as the Anti-Corruption  Commis-
sions  to  hold enquiry into the charges  of  corruption,and
misconduct, as defined in<a href="/doc/83029037/" id="a_107"> ss. 3</a> and <a href="/doc/163417439/" id="a_108">4</a> of the Commission Act,
against	 all  government servants including members  of	 All
India	Services.   The	 Commission  is	 provided  with	  an
investigating  agency  to  investigate	into  the   charges.
<a href="/doc/21660685/" id="a_109">Section 10</a>, before its amendment, provided for an inquiry by
the Commission either suo mato or on a report in writing  by
certain officers.  Under<a href="/doc/116442787/" id="a_110"> S. 1</a> <a href="/doc/116442787/" id="a_111">1</a> every person is entitled  to
complain  to  the Commission against a	Government  servant.
<a href="/doc/62166058/" id="a_112">Section	 12</a>  provides for a preliminary examination  of	 the
complaint.  The Commission may either dismiss the  complaint
or,  if	 in  its opinion there are  sufficient	grounds	 for
taking further proceedings in the complaint, the  Commission
shall  cause  the substance of the allegations to  be  drawn
into distinct articles of charges and summon the accused  to
appear before it.  Under sub-s. (5) of<a href="/doc/62166058/" id="a_113"> s. 12</a>, as it  existed
before its amendment in 1969, the government servant had  to
be  placed under suspension after the charges were drawn  up
against	 him  by the Commission.  <a href="/doc/146717946/" id="a_114">Section  13</a>  provides	 for
procedure   at	the  enquiry.	<a href="/doc/144705095/" id="a_115">Section	 17</a>   requires	 the
Commission to record its findings on the various articles of
the  charge  and submit its recommendation to  the  Sadar-i-
Riyasat.   If  any  of the charges are	held  to  have	been
established  against  the  accused, the	 Commission  has  to
recommend  the punishment mentioned in this  section.  under
sub-s.	(2) of<a href="/doc/144705095/" id="a_116"> S. 17</a> the Commission may, in addition to	 the
punishment  referred  to in sub-s. (1), recommend  that	 the
accused	 be declared for ever or for any shorter  period  of
time  to be specified, incapable or being appointed  to	 any
public office.	Sub-<a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_117">section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">897</span></a>
the accused be prosecuted for any offence in a Court of law.
Sub-section  (7) specifically deals with members of  the  An
India Services and provides that in their case the  Sadar-i-
Riyasat	 may recommend the imposition of the  punishment  to
the   appropriate  authority.	There  are   various   other
incidental provisions which we need not detail.
From  the  perusal of the provisions of	 the  two  statutory
laws, namely, the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal)
Rules, 1955, and the Jammu and Kashmir Government  Servants'
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_118">(Prevention  of	 Corruption (Commission) Act</a>,  1962,  it  is
impossible to escape from the conclusion that the two cannot
go  together.	The  impugned Act  provides  for  additional
punishments not provided in the Discipline and Appeal Rules.
It  also  provides  for suspension and	infliction  of	some
punishments.   It  seems  to,  us that	in  so	far  as	 the
<a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_119">Commission  Act</a>	 deals with the infliction  of	disciplinary
punishments  it	 is repugnant to the Discipline	 and  Appeal
Rules.	 Parliament has occupied the field and	given  clear
indication  that  this	was the only  manner  in  which	 any
disciplinary  action should be taken against the members  of
the All India Service.	Insofar as the <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_120">Commission Act</a>  deals
with a preliminary enquiry for the purposes of enabling	 any
prosecution to be launched it may be within the	 legislative
competence of the Jammu and Kashmir State and not  repugnant
to  the provisions of the Discipline and Appeal Rules.	 But
as  the provisions dealing with investigation  for  possible
criminal  prosecution are inextricably intertwined with	 the
provisions   dealing   with   infliction   of	disciplinary
punishment  the whole Act must be read down so as  to  leave
the members of the All India Service outside its purview.
We  accordingly hold that the provisions of  the  <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_121">Commission
Act</a>  do not apply to the members of the All India  Services.
Accordingly  we dismiss the appeal.  As the  respondent	 was
not  represented  there would be no order as to	 costs.	  We
thank Mr. G. L. Sanghi for assisting us as amicus curiae.
