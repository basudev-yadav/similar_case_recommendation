With
C.A. 4603 of 1997

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. RAMASWAMY, J. Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">These appeals are directed to resolve mutually inconsistent law adumbrated
by two Division Benches of Andhra Pradesh High Court. The appeals arising
from SLP(C) No. 17080-81/95 are filed against the judg-ment passed on April
28, 1995 in Writ Petition Nos. 9513/93 and 7725/94 in which the Division
Bench has held that the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Area Land Transfer
Regulation (1 of 1959), as amended by Regulation II of 1970 (for short, the
'Regulation') and the Mining Act (67 of 1957) do not prohibit grant of
mining leases of Government land in the scheduled area to the non-tribals.
<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_1">The Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980 (for short, the FC Act') does not apply
to the renewals. The Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967 also does not apply to
the renewal of the leases. It, accordingly dismissed the writ petitions
filed by the appellant challenging the power of the Government to transfer
the Government land situated in the tribal area to the non-tribals for
mining purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_3">In the appeal arising from SLP(C) No. 21457 of 1993 tiled by Hyderabad
Abrasives and Minerals, another Division Bench, earlier had taken
dramatically the opposite view and held that mining leases are illegal. The
word 'person' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of the Regulation includes Govern-ment. Any
lease to the non-tribals even of the Government land situated in scheduled
area is in violation of <a href="/doc/1870616/" id="a_3">Section 3</a> and so is void. Equally, it held that a
mining lease in a forest area tor non-forest purpose or renewal thereof,
without prior approval of the Central Government, is in violation of
Section 2 of the FC Act. Accordingly, the Division Bench directed the
Government to prohibit mining operations in scheduled area except that the
mines stacked on the surface be permitted to be removed after obtain-ing
proper permits. This decision, though earlier in point of time, was not
brought to the notice of later Bench mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_4">The admitted facts are that Borra reserved forest area along with its
environs consisting of 14 villages, is the notified scheduled area in Anan-
thagiri Mandal of Visakhapatnam District of Andhra Pradesh. The State
Government granted mining leases in this area to several non-tribal per-
sons. K. Appa Rao, respondent No. 13, was granted mining lease in that
reserved forest area. Most of the area granted to M/s. Perclase India Ltd.,
respondent No. 7 falls in reserved forest area. M/s. Unirock Minerals Pvt.
Ltd., respondent No. 8 had 125.30 acres in the reserved forest area and
45.70 acres in the non-reserved forest area. M/s. Kalyani Minerals, respon-
dent No. 10 had 48.00 acres in the reserved forest area and 32 acres in
non-reserved forest area. One M. Seetharama Swamy was granted mining lease
of an extent of 300 acres in Borra reserved forest area. Sri. R.K. Deo is
also having mining lease in that area. Respondent No. 9 is said to be the
legal heir of M. Seetharama Swamy. These facts are admitted in the counter-
affidavit filed by the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_5">It is also an admitted fact that Ananthagiri Mandal in which the mining
areas are situated, is within the scheduled area. The tribal people from
tribal groups are inhabiting therein. Two mining leases were granted to one
Chalpati Rao, respondent No. 11 for graphite to an extent of 50 acres in
Nandkote Reserve Forest for a period of 20 years on August 26, 1971. The
lease deed was executed on January 24, 1972 and expired on January 23,1992;
it is stated that thereafter mining operations are not being carried on.
Similarly, mining lease for an extent of 111 acres of land situated in
Chimidipalli and Saripalli villages of Ananthagiri Mandal, was granted on
August 29,1974. The lease was executed on December 20,1974 for a period of
20 years which expired on December 19, 1994. Mining lease for Andhra
Phosphates (P) Ltd. was granted to an extent of 271.544 hectares in Y.
Seetharampuram, Veduruvada Reserved Forest on March 23,1957 for 20 years.
The lease deed was executed on June 10, 1957 which was renewed for 20 years
on May 2, 1978. The renewed deed was executed on the even date which would
continue upto June 9, 1997. As stated earlier, K. Apparao, respondent No.
13, was granted mining lease for 20 years on July 20, 1978 which was
executed on January 24, 1979. It is due to expire on July 23, 1999. But, it
is stated that at present he is not working out the mining operations.
Respondent No. 14, M. Venkatapathi Raju was granted mining lease for 13.84
acres for yellow Ochra in unserveyed revenue poramboke, in Konapuram,
Ananthagiri Mandal for a period of 20 years on April 4, 1980. The lease
deed was executed on April 26, 1981 and is to expire on April 25, 2001. It
is claimed that the lease is not being worked out and it is said to have
lapsed. The lease granted to M/s. Visaka Mines &amp; Minerals, respondent No.
15, is said to be in non-surveyed area in Mandaparti village of Ananthagiri
Mandal on July 20, 1978 for a period of 20 years. The lease deed was
executed on December 18, 1978 and it would expire on December 17, 1998.
They are working out their mines. Another lease was granted for 130 acres
in reserved forest area of Sivalingam village of Ananthagiri Mandal on
September 20, 1977 for a period of 20 years which expires on December 30,
1997. It is stated that the lease had lapsed since it was not being worked
out, w.e.f. February 9, 1988 as per G.O.Ms. No. 295 dated June 6, 1989.
Associated Mica Exports, respondent No. 16 holds to leases for 50 acres in
Dumbriguda village of Ananthagiri Mandal of a period of 20 years granted on
March 13,1986. The lease was executed on September 11, 1986 and it is to
expire on September 10,2006. It is stated that lease is not being worked
out at present. They had another lease for 10 acres in Borra group of
villages for 20 years granted on October 20, 1983 and the lease deed was
executed on November 21, 1983. The lease is to expire on November 20, 2003.
It is stated that the mining is not being worked out at present. Respondent
No. 17, N. Madan Mohan Reddy had a lease in Mallagumuru village of
Ananthagiri Mandal. The extent of the land has not been mentioned but the
lease was granted on July 4, 1984. The lease was executed on September 5,
1984 and it is to expire on September 4, 2004. It is stated that the mine
is not being worked out at present. M/s. Trowall Cements Ltd. obviously got
it transferred from N. Madan Mohan Reddy to whom lease was granted for 20
years in G.O.Ms. No. 303, Industries and Commerce on July 9, 1984 for a
period of 20 years. The lease deed was executed by Madan Mohan Reddy on
January 7, 1985 and is due to expire on January 6, 2005. It is stated that
the mining is not being worked out and steps are being taken to declare it
as a lapsed lease. It is the case of the appellant that the above lease was
sub-leased to M/s. Indian Rayon Industries Ltd., respondent No. 19 but in
the affidavit filed by the Government, it is said that no steps are taken
to win over the mine from the leased area. On the other hand, in the
counter-affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No. 19, it is admitted that
the mines are being worked out and that high purity calcite with minimum
silica content is their product. Calcite mine is available in Visakhapatnam
District at a short distance of 100 kms. from their factory situated in
Visakhapatnam. One M. Laxminarayana was the lessee of an extent of 21.56
acres of land in Nimmalapadu village in Ananthagiri Mandal which is valid
upto May 31, 2005. Another lease of 37.895 hectares in Ananthagiri Mandal
was granted for a period of 10 years. The lease is valid upto July 3, 19%.
Respondent No, 19 had transfer of the said lease in its favour in G.O.Ms.
No. 4, Industry and Commerce dated January 5, 1993 and they are working out
the mines. M/s. Birla Periclase is a subsidiary of respon-dent No. 19. It
is stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the Government that 21.56
acres of land containing mica, calcite, quartz and yellow ochra in
Nimmalapadu village which is the subject matter of the original lease dated
November 17, 1984 for a period of 20 years had by M. Lax-minarayana, was
transferred to respondent No. 19. It was stated that the same has further
been transferred in favour of M/s. A.P. Mineral Develop ment Corporation
Ltd. on December 20, 1994 by G.O.Ms. No, 456 dated December 7, 1994. The
latter is a State Government Undertaking but that is not so stated in the
counter-affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No. 19. It is sought to be
justified that M. Laxminarayana, Respondent No. 20, has a legal right to
assign the lease in favour of Respondent No. 19. It is also admitted in the
Government's counter-affidavit that by operation of Section 11(5) of the
Mine and Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_4">Development) Act</a>, 1957 (for short, the
'Mining Act'), as amended by <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_5">State Act</a>, on and from August 14, 1991, no
mining leases in the scheduled area should be granted in favour of non-
tribals. It is also admitted that tribals have their patta lands in five
enclosures and have their right to cultivate those lands. It is the case of
the appellant that after re-survey, the entire area was identified as
reserved forest area or at any rate is a forest area in scheduled area.
</p>
<p id="p_6">On this factual matrix, the appellant-Society claiming to protect the
interests and life of the scheduled tribes in the area, filed the writ
petitions questioning the power of the Government to grant mining leases in
favour of non-tribals in the scheduled area, in violation of the Regulation
which prohibits transfer of any land in scheduled area to a non-tribal. The
Division Bench of the High Court has, held that the Regulation does not
prohibit transfer of the Government land by way of lease to the non-
tribals. The word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> of the Regulation is applicable to
natural persons, namely, tribals and non-tribals. The Regulation prohibits
transfer of the land in scheduled area by a tribal to a non-tribal natural
persons. The leases granted in accordance with the provisions of the Mining
Act to non-tribals are valid. The FC Act was not violated by grant of
leases or renewal thereof. Therefore, the writ, as sought for, was not
available. Resultantly, the writ petitions were dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">In the appeal of M/s. Hyderabad Abrasives and Minerals, the ad-mitted facts
are that the appellant was granted mining lease for 20 years m 1974 for
mining leatarite situated in Peddamaredumilli Reserved Forest Area in East
Godavari District. The total extent of the land leased was 318 acres out of
which it was carrying on mining operation in 42 acres. Similarly, other
persons were also granted mining leases in the reserved forest area in East
Godavari District. Consequently, M/s. Shakti, the voluntary organisation
filed, the writ petition in the High Court questioning the. power of the
Government to grant mining leases in violation of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> of the
Regulation and the FC Act. The lease expired in 1994. The Division Bench
held that by operation of the prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_8">Section 3</a> of the
Regulation and Section 2 of the FC Act, the appellant is not entitled to
mining operations. However, since he had already broken up the mining, the
excavated mine on the surface may be removed on obtaining permission from
the appropriate authorities. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed the
above appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_8">The primary questions in these cases are : whether the Regulation would
apply to transfer of Government land to a non-tribal?; whether the
Government can grant mining lease of the lands situated in scheduled area
to a non-tribal?; whether the leases are in violation of Section 2 of the
FC Act?; and whether the leases are in violation of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment Protection
Act</a>, 1986 (for short, the 'EP Act')? It is stated in paragraph 3(c) of the
Petition of Samatha that the Borra Reserve Forest area was part of the
domain of the Rajah of Jeypore and from time immemorial, it was a tribal
area occupied by tribal villages. They have pattas in their favour and do
cultivation. In 1967, 14 villages were declared as Borra Reserved Forest.
About 250 tribal families settled in 14 villages have in their occupation,
436 acres of land in five enclosures. They are situated in Ananthagiri
Mandal. In the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No. 10, M/s.
Kalyani Minerals, it is admitted that Borra caves may be as old as million
of years. It is admitted that the "entire area around Borra caves is
thickly forested." In the counter-affidavit filed by the District Forest
Officer, respondent No. 4, it is admitted that Ananthagiri Mandal is a
scheduled area and the tribals belong to diverse denominations. It is also
one of the important hill regions of the eastern ghats and is known not
only for the diversity of its flora and fauna but also for the richness of
mineral deposits. It is also rich in forest wealth and the minerals. It is
their contention that the forest wealth in this area is the national asset.
</p>
<p id="p_9">Agriculture - a means of livelihood, succor for social justice and base for
dignity of person.
</p>
<p id="p_10">Agriculture is the main part of the economy and source of livelihood to the
rural Indians and a source and succor for social status and a base for
dignity of person. Land is a tangible product and sustaining asset to the
agriculturists. <a href="/doc/1124708/" id="a_10">In Waman Rao v. Union of India</a>, [1981] 2 SCR 1 a
Constitution Bench had observed that India being a predominantly
agricultural society, there is a "strong linkage between the land and the
person's status in social system". The strip of land on which they till and
live assures them equal justice and "dignity of their person by providing
to them a near decent means of livelihood". Agricultural land is the
foundation for a sense of security and freedom from fear. Assured
possession is a lasting source for peace and prosperity.
</p>
<p id="p_11">Agriculture is the only source of livelihood for Scheduled Tribes, apart
from collection and sale of minor forest produce to supplement their
income. Land is their most important natural and valuable asset and
imperishable endowment from which the tribals derive their sustenance,
social status, economic and social equality, permanent place of abode and
work and living. It is a security and source for economic empowerment.
Therefore, the tribes too have great emotional attachment to their lands.
The land on which they live and till, assures them equality of status and
dignity of person and means to economic and social justice and potent
weapon of economic empowerment in social democracy.
</p>
<p id="p_12">Ninety per cent of the Scheduled Tribes predominantly live in forest areas
and intractable terrains 95 per cent of them are below poverty line and
totally depend upon agriculture or agriculture based activities and some of
them turn out as migrant construction labour due to their displace-ment
from hearth and home for the so-called exploitation of minerals and
construction of projects. As per 1991 Census, in Andhra Pradesh the
population of the Tribes was 41.99 lakhs. They adopted traditional shifting
cultivation (Podu or Jhoom), since they are poor and illiterate and away
from winds of modern agricultural technology and economy. Such cultiva-tion
is predominantly prevalent in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, North-eastern States and some
parts of Uttar Pradesh. According to this practice an area covered with
vegetation is burnt out to serve as manure. Cultivation is done for a year
or two and then the area is abandoned. Another area is cleared in a similar
manner and again abandoned. Vegetation regenerates in the abandoned area
and after a lapse of 8 to 10 years, the area is again cleared and burnt
and, thus, shifting cultivation is carried on. This cycle repeatedly goes
on. Due to pressure on land this shifting cultivation has now been
abandoned and the Tribes are settling to cultivate crops in fixed holdings.
</p>
<p id="p_13">Plight of the Tribes.
</p>
<p id="p_14">Detailed study in this behalf and of their exploitation has been conducted
by sociologists and anthropologists, the foremost notable of them being
Prof. C.V.F. Haimend'-of and Arher. Many others equally have evinced keen
interest and investigated into living conditions of the tribes, their
culture and customs, etc. which establishes that initially the tribals had
held large tracts of lands as masters and had their own rich culture with
economic status and cohesiveness as compact groups. The policy adopted by
the rulers encouraged non-tribals to immigrate in large number and settle
down in tribal areas. Governments compelled tribal Chieftains to permit
non-tribals to take hold of revenue administration, which led to the
slipping of lands from the hold of the tribes to the non-tribals. In the
"Tribes of India - The Struggle for Survival", Prof. Haimendrof has graphi-
cally explained diverse methods by which the tribals were deprived of their
lands. Numerous methods adopted to exploit them having become un-bearable,
they rebelled against their exploitation. Inderelli (Andhra Pradesh) police
firing in which hundreds of innocent tribals were killed, is one of the
latest events which would depict the enormity of their exploita-tion. By
laying the railway tracks and roads as means of communication by the
British rulers, the tribal areas became accessible to the non-tribal
immigrants who, with limited means, came in large number in search of
livelihood and settled down in the agency areas and acquired large holdings
by exploitation of the tribals. Dr. P.V. Ramesh, IAS, Director, Tribal
Welfare in his article "Land Reforms Land Transfer in Scheduled Area" in a
seminar organised by A.P. Judicial Academy and published by it as
"Scheduled Tribal and Social Justice" page 178 at 202 has stated that in
Utnoor Division of Adilabad District a tribal in whose name, 148 acres was
recorded as owner, was declared as surplus land-holder under the Land
Reforms Act and the only 5 acres of land in his actual possession and
enjoyment was taken by the Government as surplus land. In contract,
Izaradars surrendered Government land as they entered their names in
revenue records as owners and claimed compensation under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_11">Land
Acquisition Act</a> for 742 acres,

The tribal economy was simple but with the gradual contact with the non-
tribals they started taking loans. The wiles money-lenders and traders
exploited their innocence. Honest, truthful and hard working tribals become
pry for the greed and exploitation by non-tribals. They charged maximum
rate of interest etc. for fringe money or gains or goods lent to them.
Tribals had to repay disproportionately in three or four fold in kind.
Exorbitant rate of interest was charged and repayment collected in kind,
i.e., the produce in three or four-fold. In the "Land Alienation and
Restoration in Tribal Communities in India" edited by S.N. Dubey and Ratna
Murdia, (Himalaya Publishing House), compilation of articles presented and
read out at a Seminar organised by Tata Institute of Social Science in
which bureaucrats and social scientists participated. B. Danam, IAS, then
Project Officer, ITDA Khammam, had highlighted in his paper about diverse
modes of exploitation by money-lenders of the tribals in Andhra Pradesh.
They were : short-term loan at an exorbitant rate of interest (Kandagutha),
the repayment of which was made in kind, i.e., harvest produced from a
particular extent of land; the medium-term loan on the security of the
immovable property, repayable with compound interest at yearly or half-
yearly rests. Third mode was lease of land against a loan for a fixed
number of years (Tirumanam) during which period the tribals have to
cultivate their land, raise the crop and deliver the entire produce to the
money-lender; by usufructuary mortgage, the money-lender remains in
possession and enjoys the produce from the land for a fixed number of years
or till the principal sum is repaid; by advancing cash and kind loans
(Namu) and lending commodities like foodgrains mostly for sustenance during
the lean months or for seedlings, on the condition that the same would be
repaid in full along with flat rate of interest at the time of harvest and
in default payment should be with compound interest; in case of further
default, the accumulated arrears get merged with the principal, i.e., by
way of compound interest. The other types of money-lending extend to petty
loans or selling clothes on credit to the tribals during the lean months on
the condition that it would be paid in full at the time of harvest and in
default the money-lender would take over the land by threat of physical
force.
</p>
<p id="p_15">Legislative intervention - Enforcement ineffectiveness.
</p>
<p id="p_16">The Ganjam and Vizagapatnam Act of 1839 declared the Agency Areas of the
Madras Presidency, comprising parts of southern Orissa and seven present
Andhra Pradesh districts for special administration. In 1874, the Scheduled
Districts Act XIV (Central Act) was passed. Thereunder, Scheduled districts
were defined to mean the territories mentioned in the First Schedule and
parts thereof; they also include any other territory to which the Secretary
of State for India by resolution in Council, may declare. Subsequently, the
Act was extended to the Taluk of then Badrachalam in East Godavari District
which is now a part of Khamman District together with the districts covered
under 1839 Act. The provincial Government issued rules prescribing the
procedure to be followed by the officers appointed thereunder to administer
Agency Tracts. Later on, the Agency Tracts and Land Transfer Act 1 of 1917
came to be passed. Thereunder, to mitigate the hardships of the tribals
from the wiles of money-lenders and other migrants from plain area,
provision was made so that rate of interest would not exceeding 24% per
annum and compound interest would not be charged nor any collateral
advantage would be taken by the money-lenders. The total interest allowed
or decreed should not to exceed the principal amount. The "Scheduled
Districts" defined in 1874 Act were reconfirmed in 1917 Act. <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_12">Section 4</a>
thereof prohibited transfer of land in the Agency Tracts which read as
under :
</p>
<p id="p_17">"4. Transfer of Immovable property by a member of a hill tribe.
</p>


<p id="p_18">(1) Notwithstanding any rule of law or enactment to the contrary, any
transfer of immovable property situated within the Agency Tracts by the
member of a hill tribe shall be absolutely null and void unless made in
favour of another member of a hill tribe, or with the previous consent in
writing of the Agent or of any other prescribed officer.
</p>
<p id="p_19">(2)  Where a transfer of property is made in contravention of sub-section
(1), the Agent or any other prescribed Officer may on application by any
one interested, decree ejectment against any person in possession of the
property claiming under the transfer and may restore it to the transferor
or his heirs.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(3)  Subject to such conditions as may be prescribed an appeal against a
decree or order under sub-section (2) if made by the Agent shall lie to the
Governor in Council and if made by any other officer shall lie to the
Assistant Agent or to the Agent as may be prescribed. "Montague and
Chaonsford Report, 1918 brief-ly touched the administration of tribal areas
and political reform and excluded them from the reformed provincial
Governments. Govt. of India Act, 1919 divided the area into two parts
"wholly excluded and partially excluded areas for reform". The former were
small and the latter were given joint responsibility of the Governor and
the Government General in Council."
</p>
<p id="p_21">Montague Chaonsford Report of 1918 suggested that the backward area where
primitive (tribal) live should be excluded from proposed politi-cal reform
and administration was entrusted to the Governors of the Provinces.
</p>
<p id="p_22">Pursuant to Simon Commission Report, the Government of India Act, 1935
dealt with excluded and partially excluded areas as per Order 1936 issued
under Section 91 of Government of India Act, 1935. Simon's Report is worth-
extracting here and reads thus :
</p>
<p id="p_23">"There were two dangers to which subjection to normal laws would have
specially exposed these peoples, and both arose out of the fact that they
were primitive people, simple, unsophisticated and frequently improvident.
There was a risk of their agricultural land passing to the more civilized
section of the population, and the occupation of the tribals was for the
most part agricultural : and, secondly, they were likely to get into the
"wiles of the moneylenders". The primary aim of Government policy then was
to protect them from these two dangers and preserve their tribal customs;
and this was achieved by prescribing special procedures applicable to these
backward areas,"
</p>
<p id="p_24">Therein also, "Scheduled Districts" defined in 1874 Act were treated as
excluded and partially excluded areas. The administration thereof was
exclusively vested in the Governor of the Province under Section 92 of
Government of India Act, 1935 sub-sections (1) and (2) which are relevant
for our purpose read as under :
</p>
<p id="p_25">"92. (1) The executive authority of a Province extends to excluded and
partially excluded therein, but, notwithstanding anything in this Act, no
Act of the Federal Legislature or of the Provincial Legis-lature shall
apply to an excluded area or a partially excluded area, unless the Governor
by public notification so directs, and the Governor in giving such a
direction with respect to any Act may direct that the Act shall in its
application to the area, or to any specified part thereof, have effect
subject to such exceptions or modifications as he thinks fit.
</p>
<p id="p_26">(2) The Governor may make regulations for the peace and good government of
any area in a Province which is for the time being an excluded area, or a
partially excluded area, and any regulations so made may repeal or amend
any Act of the Federal Legislature, or of the Provincial Legislature or any
existing Indian Law, which is for the time being applicable to the area in
question. Regulations made under this sub-section shall be submitted
forthwith to the Governor General and until assented to by him in his
discretion shall have no effect, and the provisions of this Part of this
Act with respect to the power of His Majesty to disallow Acts shall apply
in relation to any such regulations assented to by the Governor General as
they apply in relation to Acts of a Provincial Legislature assented to by
him."
</p>
<p id="p_27">The Government of India (Adoption of Indian Laws) Order, 1937 repealed 1874
Act and brought excluded and partially excluded areas directly under the
governance of the Governor under Section 92 of the Government of India Act,
1935. Thus they became the Scheduled Areas by virtue of the Scheduled Areas
(Part 'A' States) Order, 1950 issued by the President of India. After the
Advent of the Constitution, Fifth and Sixth Schedules were engrafted as
part of the scheme of the Constitution by the founding fathers. Fifth
Schedule empowers the President of India who thereunder issued Scheduled
Areas (Part 'A' States) Order, 1950 declaring specified areas therein to be
Scheduled Areas within the States specified in Part 'A' of the First
Scheduled to the Constitution of India. Therein also East Godavari, West
Godavari and Visakhapatnam Agencies (Vizianagram and Srikakulam Districts
are part of it) were declared to be Scheduled Areas in Madras Province.
Equally, by Scheduled Areas (Part 'B' States) Order, 1950 which became
effective from December 7, 1950, the President exercised the power
declaring certain specified areas as Scheduled Areas in Part 'B' States
including the State of Hyderabad (Adilabad, Karimnagar, Nizamabad,
Warangal, Khammam, Mehboob Nagar Districts).
</p>
<p id="p_28">It would, thus, be clear that right from the inception of the Colonial
administration, the agency areas were treated distinctly from other areas.
Tribals were protected from exploitation; their rights and title to enjoy
the lands in their occupation and their autonomy, culture and ecology were
preserved; infiltration of the non-tribals into tribals area was
prohibited. Sugalis, i.e., Khanabadosh, non-tribals, by migration became in
due course, tribals. Even those migrant non-tribals were prohibited to
purchase the lands in agency areas from the tribals except with the prior
sanction of the officer appointed by the Government in that behalf.
However, with the connivance and fabrication of revenue records, non-
tribals got hold of the lands and exploited the tribals.
</p>
<p id="p_29">Prof. Haimendrof has explained how notoriously the migrants swelled in
number in the agency areas in Telangana of Andhra Pradesh and dispossessed
the tribals from their holdings with impunity and prevented them from
enjoying right over their lands or unlawfully dispos-sessed them in
collusion with the Patwaris, Deshmukhs or Deshpandes, the lower level local
officials. He has given the comparison of population at page 57 thus :
</p>
<p id="p_30">"Despite all such obstacles the allocation of land to the tribals of
Adilabad which began in 1944 made good progress. By 1945 a total of 45, 417
acres of land had been granted to 3, 144 tribals, and by 1949 the amount of
land assigned on patta to tribals had risen to 160,000 acres and the number
of beneficiaries to 11,198. The work continued until about 85 per cent of
the tribal householders of Adilabad adequate holdings of cultivable land."
</p>
<p id="p_31">At page 59, he has stated that :
</p>
<p id="p_32">"Visual impressions of the process of ethnic and cultural change are
supported by demographic figures. While in 1951 the popula-tion of Utaur
Taluk was only 34,404, the majority of whom were tribals, by 1961 it had
risen to 55,099 and by 1971 to 93,823. No official census figures are
available for later years, but according to a malaria survey of 1977 the
population of the taluk had then reached a total 112,000. This phenomenal
increase is clearly due to immigration, and all the new comers are non-
tribals. The change in the composition of the population is reflected in
the figures for tribals in individual circles. Thus in the Marlavai Circle,
which in 1941 was almost totally tribal, the percentage of tribals in 1961
was still 90.38 per cent, but by 1971 it had dropped to 65.52 per cent, a
figure which undoubtedly has diminished since then."
</p>
<p id="p_33">Narrating the event (after his revisit), he has stated at pages 59-60 thus
:
</p>
<p id="p_34">"On 7 December 1976, Kumra Boju of Kerimeri came to see me in Kanchanpalli
and told me the following story :
</p>
<p id="p_35">My father Somu owned fifteen acres of patta land, but for the last thirteen
years Rama Gaudu of Asifabad (a man of toddy-tap-ping caste) has been
cultivating this land. When my father died I was a small child, and Rama
Gaudu occupied our land. Some time ago I applied to M. Narayan, the Special
Dy. Collector, for res-toration of my father's land. The Dy. Collector
decided the case in my favour and restored the land to me. I was very happy
and ploughed the land in preparation for sowing jawari. But when I was
ready to sow Rama Gaudu, supported by some villagers of Keslaguda, stopped
my cultivating. Then the Tahsildar, the revenue inspector, and the Patel
came to the village and told me that my father's land was mine by right.
But at the same time they advised me not to cultivate that land, but to
occupy instead of adjoining field which belongs to a Muslim. How could I do
this? Then Rama Gaudu brought some men and sowed on my land. Moreover Rama
Gaudu had reported to the police that I had illegally ploughed his land. So
the Sub-inspector of police came to my house with some constables and
wanted to arrest me. But in the end they did not take me to Asifabad. Rama
Gaudu has occupied also the patta land of three other Gonds, who are my
mother's brothers. They all died but they have sons who have a claim to
their land. Now none of us has any land of our own because Rama Gadu has
all of it taken away."
</p>
<p id="p_36">This is only a tiny iceberg of several instances. He has highlighted the
gross injustice done to the tribals. The book contains full details which
need no recounting here to avoid needless burden.
</p>
<p id="p_37">Dr. G.P. Reddy at pages 66-67 of his book "Politics of Tribal Ex-
ploitation" has stated thus :
</p>
<p id="p_38">"These non-tribal cultivator immigrants enjoyed liberal conces-sions. They
were assigned land just for asking even waiving land revenue. Many of them
were also conferred with right of Patel and Patwari. They were encouraged
not only to establish now villages but also to settle in already well-
established Goa villages. In this process the aboriginals gained nothing
but became mute witnesses to the process set in by the rules which
ultimately pauparised the tribals, turning them from land owners to
agricultural proletariat."
</p>
<p id="p_39">Writing about the non-tribals acquiring interest in the land in the ribal
areas of Adilabad, Sethumadhava Rao has stated that:
</p>
<p id="p_40">"Where land outside the forest was vacant it was readily granted Patta to
the non-tribals. The Gonds too had an opportunity of acquiring Patta rights
in the land but they were slow to understand that they would suffer if they
did not take advantage of these concessions. The new Watandars made a
subtle use of their office as village headmen to evict the original
possessors or take lands vacated by them for themselves." Another modus
operandi for evicting the tribals who were cultivating the lands was by
treating them as Sivaijamabandi, i.e., treating as un-authorised occupants,
A cultivator who held land under Sivaijamabandi tenure is liable to
eviction at any time. The tribals who were owners under the law were
treated as unauthorised occupants by manipulation of revenue records. The
tribals who could not understand the meaning of Patta rights could not be
expected to understand the meaning of Sivaijamabandi. In many cases, though
tribals had been cultivating the lands for several decades and generations,
they were purposefully categorised as Sivaijamabandi, and were evicted.
Their lands were assigned to non-tribals. It is ridiculous even to classify
the lands held by tribals as Sivaijamabandi just because these people
lacked knowledge of the nature of their rights over their lands.
</p>
<p id="p_41">Traditionally, the tribals of the area acquired absolute right over the
land for cultivation the day they started clearing new patches of forest.
Prof. Haimendrof has narrated hundreds of such cases wherein the poor
tribals had complained to him as to how they had lost their lands because
of wrong and false entries made in the land records by the Patwaris. Even
till recently, the records were not maintained properly. This gave scope
for the manipulation both by the Patwaris as well as by the petty revenue
officials. This manipulation of records took place mainly due to corrupt
practices.
</p>
<p id="p_42">Dube's compilation gives first-hand account given by I.A.S. officers on the
field representing Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra represented
then by K. Padmanabhaiah, the present Home Secretary, Govt. of India,
Orissa, M.P., Rajasthan and West Bengal and they had given graphic first
hand account of the magnitude of the problems of land alienations, causes
of exploitation. They pointed out urgent need for res-toration of the lands
to the tribals. Dr. G. Prakash Reddy from ICSSR surveyed the problems once
again and has graphically explained it in his "Politics of Tribal
Exploitation" (Mittal Publication). "The Khonds and Jaungs in Andhra
Pradesh, Hand Book for Development" by Dr. Ramakant Nath, B.M. Boal and N,
Soreng tells the plight of, and the need for restitution of the land to and
rehabilitation of, Orissa tribes. The Reports of the Commissioner of SCs.
and STs., 1980-81 and 1984-85 also emphasise the urgency of the problem. As
in the year 1995, in Andhra Pradesh, the non-tribals are in possession of
7,51,435,66 acres in scheduled areas of A.P. State (Vide page 192 of
Scheduled Tribes and Social Justice). Like in Madras province, in Bihar,
the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act, 1908 prohibited transfer of lands by sale
etc. except with the previous sanction of the Deputy Commissioner. The
Bombay Province Land Revenue Code, 1879 also prohibited transfer of land
from a tribal to a non-tribal without the permission of the District
Collector. Similarly, the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act, 1908, Santhal Pargana
Tenancy (Supplemen-tary Provisions) Act, 1959 and the Bihar Scheduled Areas
Regulations 1969 also prohibit the alienation of land of the tribals. These
regulations also provide for restoration of alienated land to the tribals
or when converted for urban use, to give them equivalent lands. As early as
in 1901, in Gujarat, some measures of protection were provided (when it
formed part of the Bombay Province) by amendment of <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_13">Sections 73-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_14">79-A</a>
in the Bom-bay Land Revenue Code, 1879, and imposed ban on transfer of land
of tribes in those scheduled villages in which survey and settlement had
not been introduced without previous permission of the Collector. The
Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and Tenancy Laws (Amendment) Act, 1974 and
the Maharashtra (Restoration of Lands to <a href="/doc/1893819/" id="a_15">Scheduled Tribes) Act</a>, 1974 also
prohibit alienation and ensure restoration of alienated lands to the
tribes. Dr. B.L. Maharda, IAS, a bureaucrat of Rajasthan Cadre, in his
"History and Culture of Giriasias" of State of Rajasthan, has narrated the
similar problems of tribals.
</p>
<p id="p_43">The Regulation prohibits absolutely the transfer of land in scheduled areas
of Andhra Pradesh between tribals and non-tribals or non-tribals inter se.
In 1971, an amendment was made to exempt hypothecation of lands by tribes
to the Co-operative Land Mortgage Banks and other financial institutions
approved by the Government, subject to certain conditions. In Assam, the
Assam Land and Revenue Regulation Act, 1964 was enacted. In Himachal
Pradesh, the H.P. Transfer of Land (Regulation) Act, 1968 was made. In
Karnataka, the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 was made
applicable in Bombay region of the Karnataka State. The Mysore Land Revenue
(Amendment) Rule, 1960 was suitably amended imposing restriction or
alienation of the lands allotted to the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled
Castes without prior permission of the Government. In Kerala, the Kerala
Land Reforms Act, 1963 contains similar provision. The Kerala Scheduled
Tribes (Restriction of Transfer of Land and Res-toration of Alienation
Lands) Act, 1975 was enacted for the same object which has recently been
amended by a bill, details whereof are not avail-able. Madhya Pradesh, the
M.P.L.P. Code, 1959, under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_16">Sections 165(6)</a> and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_17">168(1)</a>, prohibits alienation
of land and remedy of restoration thereof is provided. In Manipur, the
Manipur Land Reforms and Land Revenue Act, 1970 was made. Similarly, the
Orissa Scheduled Areas (Transfer of Immov-able Property) Regulation and
also Orissa Land Reforms Act, 1960 were made for the same purpose. The
Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, as amended in 1956, prohibits such transfer of
lands. In Sikkim, Sikkim Revenue Order, 1977 and Sikkim Agricultural Land
Ceiling and Reforms Act, 1977 are enforced. Equally, the Madras Cultivating
Tenants Protection Act, 1955 provides the same relief. In Tripura, Tripura
Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960 imposes similar restrictions. In
Uttar Pradesh, the U.P. Land Laws (Amendment) Act, 1982 was made though its
implementation was stayed by the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_44">The above bird's eye survey discloses the enormity of the yawning gap
between making of the Acts and their proper enforcement. The magnitude of
the problem is of national importance which needs to be tackled and solved
by Parliamentary law and effective enforcement.
</p>
<p id="p_45">As we have seen from the legislative history, from the beginning of the
British rule in India, the Legislature has adopted the policy to exclude
some areas totally and some partially from the governance through the
Executive Council and given power to the Governor of the Province and the
Governor General/Viceroy to administer them with their special
responsibilities. The partially excluded areas had the dual control by the
Executive with primacy given to the Governor of the Province to apply or to
exclude the application of the laws made by the legislature or the
Executive Council to the partially excluded scheduled areas. In either
event the object was to prevent the tribals to get into the wiles of the
money-lenders and preservation of their property and customs and to allow
the tribals autonomy of their living in accordance with their customs and
culture. Until the Simon Commission, the legislative protection was not
available in that behalf. The Simon Commission found it necessary to bring
the tribals to the main-stream of national life. In consequence, tribal
area was to be brought under the direct administration of the elected
govern-ments by encouraging education, self-reliance and the provincial
Govern-ment were to devote special attention for their upliftment. But the
scheme was not given effect to in the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_18">Constitution of India Act</a> 1935. As is
seen Sections 91 and 92 of the Government of India Act and the Cabinet
Mission Statement of May 16,1946 emphasised the special attention on the

tribal.areas.
</p>
<p id="p_46">From this perspective, we are required to consider the debate in the
Constituent Assembly and the draft statements by the two Committees, one
for the North-east area now called Sixth Schedule and the rest of the areas
covered under Fifth Schedule to the Constitution. The Draft Constitution on
Fifth Schedule, presented by Dr. Ambedkar related to Draft Articles 215A
and 215B making provision for the administration and control of scheduled
areas and Scheduled Tribes. Emphasis was laid therein on the creation of
the Tribal Advisory Council to assist the Governor or the Ruler of each
State having schedul area therein, who are required to submit annual report
to Government of India regarding the administration of scheduled area in
that State, so that the executive power of the Union shall extend to that
area to give directions to the State as to the administration of the said
area. Draft Part II, clause 5 relates to law applicable to scheduled area
and clause (a) of sub-clause (2) of Clause 5 postulated, prohibition or
restriction on the transfer of land by or among members of the Scheduled
Tribes in such area; clause (b) regulate the allotment of the land to
members of the Scheduled Tribe in such area and clause (c) regulate by
person who lend money to members of the Scheduled Tribes in such area. Sub-
clause (3) of Clause 5 gives power to the Governor or Ruler to amend any
Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of the State or any existing law
which is for the time being applicable to the area in question. The draft
report contained provision for allotment of the lands to the non-tribals.
The report dated August 18, 1947 indicates that areas like the Madras and
Orissa agency still need to be of simplified type which does not expose
them to the complicated machinery of ordinary law course vide Shiv Rao's
study. It is provided at pp. 755-56 thus : As regards the allotment of new
land for cultivation or residence, however, "we are of the view that the
interest of the tribal need to be safeguarded in view of the increasing
pressure on land everywhere. We have proceeded accordingly that the
allotment of vacant land belonging to the State in scheduled area should
not be made except in accordance with special regulation made by the
Government on the advice of the Tribal Advisory Council". In the joint
report on the partially excluded areas other then Assam and North-east
frontier dated August 25, 1947 the above finds place. As per the minutes of
the advisory committee dated December 7, 1947 it was felt that the
amendment should be made after discussion in the Constituent Assembly. In
the revision of Articles qua allotment of land to non-tribals was retained.
However, after authorisation given by the Constituent Assembly to make
necessary restructuring to the Fifth Schedule as explained by Dr. Ambed-
kar, the Draft was amended excluding all references to the allocation of
land of tribals to the non-tribals with no amendment proposed by any member
vide Vol. 9 C.A.D., pp. 965-1001.
</p>
<p id="p_47">It would, therefore, be seen that before the Draft Constitution be-came
paramount law and the Fifth Schedule as its integral part, the members of
the Constituent Assembly deliberated to protect land, the precious asset to
the tribals, for their economic empowerment, economic justice, social
status and dignity of their person by retention of the land with the
tribals not only belonging to them but also allotment of the Government
land. The proposal for allotment of the Government land to the non-tribals
though was initially proposed but was ultimately dropped. After re-
structuring Fifth Schedule, as presently found, the specific provision in
the draft report to allot land to non-tribals was omitted which was
accepted by the members of the Constituent Assembly without any demur or
discussion.
</p>
<p id="p_48">The draft Constitution 1948, Clause (6) as originally proposed reads as
under : "(1) alienation of allotment of land to non-tribals in Scheduled
Areas, it shall not be lawful for a member of Scheduled Tribes to transfer
any land in person who is not a member of the Scheduled Tribes; (ii) no
land in scheduled area vested in the State within such area shall be
allotted to person who is not a member of the Scheduled Tribes except in
accord-ance with the rules made in that behalf by the Governor in
consultation with the Tribal Advisory Council for the State." The text
ultimately ap-proved by the Constituent Assembly as part of the
Constitution reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_49">"(1) The Governor may make regulations for the peace and good government of
any area in the State which is  for the   time being

a scheduled area.
</p>
<p id="p_50">(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing
powers, such regulations may : -
</p>
<p id="p_51">(a) prohibit or restrict the transfer of a land by or among members of the
Scheduled Tribes in such area;
</p>


<p id="p_52">(b) regulate the allotment of land to members of the

Scheduled tribes in such area;
</p>
<p id="p_53">(c) regulate the carrying on of business as money-lenders by person who
lend money to members of the Scheduled Tribes in such area."
</p>
<p id="p_54">It would, therefore, be clear from the narration of the Debates in the
Constituent Assembly that various drafts were placed before the Con-
stituent Assembly. Suggestions and ultimate approval of the Fifth Schedule,
as extracted hereinbefore, would manifest the animation of the founding
fathers that land in the scheduled area covered by the Fifth Schedule
requires to be preserved by prohibiting transfers between tribals and non-
tribals and providing for allotment of land to the members of the Scheduled
Tribes in such area and regulating the carrying on of the business by
money-landers in such area.
</p>
<p id="p_55">Constitutional Scheme to protect the Tribes

Chapter VI, Part X of the Constitution deals with "Scheduled Tribes and
Tribal Areas". <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_19">Article 244</a> provides that the provision of the Fifth
Schedule shall apply to the administration and control of the Scheduled
Areas and Scheduled Tribes in any State other than the State of Assam,
Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The provision of Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1371525/" id="a_20">Article 244-
A</a> are not relevant for the purpose of this case; hence omitted. The Fifth
Schedule makes the provisions as to the administration and control of
Scheduled Area and Scheduled Tribes. Para (1) envisages that unless the
context otherwise requires, the expression "State" defined in the Schedule
does not include the State of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. Part V
of the Schedule gets attracted to its administration and control. Para (2)
envisaged that subject to the provisions of the Scheduled, the executive
power of a State extends to the Scheduled Areas enumerated therein. Special
duty has been entrusted to the Governor to report to the President of the
administration of scheduled area. It enjoins that the Governor of each
State, having Scheduled Areas therein, shall annually, or whenever so
required by the President, make a report to the President regarding the
administration of the Scheduled Areas in that State and the executive power
of the Union shall extend to the giving of directions to the State as to
the administration of the said area. Para 5(2} provides that the Governor
may make regulations for the peace and good government of any area in a
State which is for the time being a Scheduled Area. Without prejudice to
the above general power, special power has been conferred under clause (a)
to prohibit or to restrict the transfer of land by or among members of the
Scheduled Tribes in such area and under Clause (b) to regulate the
allotment of land to members of the Scheduled Tribes in such area; under
clause (c) regulates money-lending to the tribals in the Scheduled Area.
</p>
<p id="p_56">In the Constitution, the expression 'Scheduled Areas' has been defined to
mean such area as the President may by order declare to be Scheduled Areas.
Clause (2) of para 6 provides that the President may at any time by order
</p><p id="p_57">(a) direct that the whole or any specified part of a Scheduled Area shall
cease to be a Scheduled Area or a part of such an area; (aa) increase the
area of any Scheduled Area in a State, after consultation with the Governor
of that State; (b) alter, but only by way of rectification of boundaries,
any Scheduled Area; (c) on any alteration of the boundaries of a State or
on the admission into the Union or the establishment of a new State,
declare any territory not previously included in any State to be, or to
form part of, a Scheduled Area, Clause (d) deals with the rescission of any
order under para 6. Such order may contain such incidental and
consequential provisions as appear to the President to be necessary and
proper, but save as aforesaid, the order made under sub-paragraph (1) of
that paragraph shall not be varied by any subsequent order. Part D, para 7
empowers the Parliament to amend the Schedule by way of addition, variation
or repeal of any of the provisions of the Fifth Schedule. Such a varied or
modified Schedule shall be referred to such amended Schedule, The other
details are not material for the purpose of this case. Hence they are
omitted.

Adilabad, Nizamabad, Warangal, Khammam and Mahaboobnagar declared from time
to time as Scheduled areas by the President under sub-paragraph (1) of
paragraph 6 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution. 'Scheduled Tribe'
has been defined in <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_22">Section 2(f)</a> to mean any tribe or tribal community or
part of or groups within any tribe or tribal community resident in the
Agency tracts and specified as such by a public notification by the
President under Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_23">Article 342</a> of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_24">Section 2(g)</a>
defines 'transfer' to mean mortgage with or without posses-sion, lease,
sale, gift, exchange or "any other dealing" with immovable property, not
being a testamentary disposition and includes a charge on such property or
a contract relating to such property in respect of such mortgage, lease,
sale, gift, exchange or other dealing. The definition of transfer is a
comprehensively vide definition except testamentary disposi-tion by a
tribal to another tribal so as to effectuate the prohibition of transfer of
immovable property to any person other than a Scheduled Tribe or a
Cooperative Society composed solely of members of the Scheduled Tribes.

does not include a partition or a devolution by succession.'' <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_28">Section 3</a>,
therefore, prohibits transfer of immovable property by a member of the
Scheduled Tribes to a non-Scheduled666 Tribe. Sub- section (l)(a)
envisages, with a non obstante clause, that notwithstanding anything

Scheduled Tribe, shall be presumed to have been acquired by such person or
his predecessor in possession, through a transfer made to him by a member
of a Scheduled Tribe (emphasis supplied). The burden would always be on the
non-tribal to prove that the Land in his possession was not acquired by
transfer from a tribal; in other words, the land belongs to tribal and the
non-tribal possesses it in contravention of law.

</p>
<p id="p_74">It is settled law that the transfer of immovable property between a member
of the Scheduled Tribe to a Non-scheduled Tribe in the Agency tracts is
null and void. The non-tribal transferee acquires no right, title and
interest in that behalf in furtherance of such sale. This Court in
Manchegowda &amp; Ors. v. State of Kamataka &amp; Ors., [1984] 3 SCC 301 had
declared such sales to be voidable. <a href="/doc/1145196/" id="a_43">In Lingappa Pochanna Appelwar v. State
of Maharashtra &amp; Anr</a>., [1985] 1 SCC 479 this Court upheld the con-
stitutionality of similar provisions of Maharashtra Restoration of Lands to
<a href="/doc/1893819/" id="a_44">Scheduled Tribes Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_75">When the constitutionality of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_45">Section 3</a> of the Regulation was im-pugned as
violative of Articles 19(1) (f) and 14 of the Constitution, this Court, in
<a href="/doc/101893/" id="a_46">P. Kami Reddy &amp; Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>., [1988] 3 SCC 433
upheld its validity holdings that the Regulation aims to restore the lands
to the tribals which originally belonged to them but passed into the hands
of non-tribals. It would be unjust, unfair and highly unreasonable merely
to freeze the situation, instead of reversing the injustice and rest oring
the status quo ante. The non-tribal economic exploiters would get no
immunity and not be accorded a privileged treatment by permitting them to
transfer the lands and structures, if any, raised on such lands to non-
tribals and to make profits at the cost of the tribals. <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_47">Section 3</a>, though
it causes hardship to the non-tribals, equally, alleviates hardship of the
tribals. The Court must keep in mind the larger perspective of the interest
of the tribal community in its entirety; the restrictions cannot be con-
demned as unreasonable. The presumption embodied b <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_48">Section 3(l)</a> (b) is a
rule of evidence. The non-tribals could be reasonably expected to disclose
their title to the properties. The tribals due to handicaps and ignorance
are unable to prove their right to land. The burden to prove title,
therefore, was shifted to the non- tribals. The presumption was upheld as
reasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_76">As a part of on-going industrial advancement, large industries or projects
are being set up or constructed in the scheduled areas displacing the
tribals and rendering them impoverished landless labourers. When their
lands are acquired for public purpose, the Government should give
alternative lands for rehabilitation and easy loans for reclamation. Law
relating to prohibition of alienation and restoration of lands to tribes
must be simple, less cumbersome and result-oriented. The machinery must be
speedy and the officers must have compassion and sense of dedication and
direction to ameliorate the economic status of the tribes to assimilate
them into national main-stream.
</p>
<p id="p_77">In Telangana area of the State of Andhra Pradesh, prior to the Regulation
and pursuant to Part B State Regulation in Fifth Schedule, the AP Tribd
Area Regulation, III of 1359F promulgated by Raj Pramukh of Hyderabad was
in vogue, Section 46 of Agricultural Land and Tenancy Act, 1950 prohibits
transfer of agricultural land without sanction of the competent authority.
Section 3 of the Tribal Area Regulation excludes the application of any
Act, Regulation or Rules by a notification published in the official
Gazette. <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_49">Section 4</a> gives power to the Government to make Rules. Sub-section
(2) of <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_50">Section 4</a> prohibits eviction of tribals from the lands in their
possession or occupied by them. Clause (f) prohibits grant of patta rights
over any land in notified area to a non-tribal; the agent is empowerend to
cancel such transfer or revise any title of land granted to a non-tribal in
any notified tribal area. Clause (g) prohibits sale b execution the named
or nominated Government agent etc. who would purchase it in the prescribed
manner under the Regulation and assign it on to a tribal. The Andhra
Pradesh High Court had held that the transfer of land in Scheduled Area by
a tribal given to either a Scheduled Caste or a Backward Class settled in
Agency tracts as void.
</p>
<p id="p_78">In P. Rami Reddy's case, this Court had observed thus :
</p>
<p id="p_79">"Within the scheduled areas of both Telangana and Andhra regions the land
was entirely in occupation of different tribal communities. The area was an
inaccessible tract of land covered by forests and hills. These tribal
communities were in occupation of lands and lived by shifting cultivation
and gathering whatever produce that was available.
</p>
<p id="p_80">The non-tribals who arrived in these areas late in the 19th Century in
certain areas and the early 20th Century in certain other areas found the
tribals who were in occupation of these lands an easy pray for the schemes
of exploitation. The non-tribals were lending money to the tribal
communities and taking the land belonging to them as security though
nothing was taken in writing from a tribal. The rates of interest charged
ranged between 25 to 50 per cent and in certain cases even 100 per cent.
The tribals who were traditionally honest and who were simple in their
thought and habits fell an easy prey to the schemes of the non-tribals. It
was observed by several committees that the non-tribals were able to find
ways and means to circumvent the provisions of Regulation 1 of 1959 by
entering into benami transactions and other clandestine transactions with
unsophisticated tribals. It is absolutely necessary to create conditions
for peace and maintain peace and prevent the new non- tribals from settling
down in the scheduled area. If the alienations are permitted to the non-
tribals there is a danger of large-scale exploitation by the new non-
tribals again with the result peace will be disturbed in that area.
</p>
<p id="p_81">Unless new enterants into the scheduled areas are prevented from settling
down in the scheduled areas by purchasing properties either from tribals or
non-tribals, it is not possible to prevent the exploitation of the
unsophisticated tribals. It is only with a view to ment of Scheduled
Tribes? Would it be permissible to construe that the land belonging to the
Government is outside such control or prohibition or restriction; whether
the State Government could allot its land to non-tribals in violation of
the Constitution and the law? Answer to these crucial questions bears
paramount significance and impact since the object of the founding fathers
of the Constitution in empowering the Governor, on the basis of his
personal satisfaction, is to regulate by law the administration or control
of the Scheduled area for peace and good governance of the Scheduled Tribes
in the area. The question is : whether any contra inter-pretation would
subserve the Constitutional animation or would it frustrate the
constitutional objective? The Division Bench of the High Court in Samatha's
case relied upon the dictionary meaning of the word 'person' and the
prohibition on transfer of land inter vivos between natural persons of
Scheduled Tribes and non-tribes in Agency tracts ; it came to conclude that
the Regulation does not apply to the land owned by the State Govern-ment
since the State Government is not a natural person, The earlier Division
Bench had taken contra view. The question, therefore, is : which of the two
views subserves the constitutional purpose and is correct in law?
</p>
<p id="p_82">Meanings of the word 'Person' - whether Government is persona ficta?
</p>
<p id="p_83">From this perspective, the next question that arises is : whether the State
Government is a person within the meaning of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_51">Section 3</a> of the Regulation
and whether its transfer of land to non- tribals or company is valid in
law?
</p>
<p id="p_84">The word 'person' in the interplay of juristic thought is either natural or
artificial. Natural persons are human beings while artificial persons are
Corporations. Corporations are either Corporation aggregate or Corpora-tion
sole. In "English Law" by Kenneth Smith and Denis Keenan (Seventh Edition)
at page 127, it is stated that "(L)egal personality is not restricted to
human beings. In fact various bodies and associations of persons can, by
forming a corporation to carry out their functions, create an organisation
with a range of rights and duties not dissimilar to many of those possessed
by human beings. In English law such corporations are formed either by
charter, statute or registration under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_52">Companies Act</a>s; there is also
the common law concept of the Corporation Sole". At page 163, it is further
stated that "(T) he Crown is the executive head in the United Kingdom and
Commonwealth, and government departments and civil servants act on behalf
of the Crown", In "Salmond on Jurisprudence" by P.J. Fitzgerald (Twelfth
Edition), at page 66, it is stated that "(A) legal person is any subject-
matter other than a human being to which the law attributes personality.
This extension, for good and sufficient reasons, of the concep-tion of
personality beyond the class of human beings is one of the most noteworthy
feats of the legal imagination....". At page 72, it is further amplified
that "(T)he King himself, however, is in law no mere mortal man. He has a
double capacity, being not only a natural person, but a body politic, that
is to say, a corporation sole. The visible wearer of the crown is merely
the living representative and agent for the time being of this invisible
and underlying persona ficta, in whom by law the powers and prerogatives of
the government of this realm are vested". In "Jurisprudence" by R.W.M. Dias
(Fifth Edition), at page 265, it is stated that".... the value of
personifying group activities is further reduced by the fact that courts
have evolved ways of dealing with such activities without resorting to the
device of persona".
</p>
<p id="p_85">In Madras Electric Corporation v. Boarland, (1955) 1 All ER 753, relied
upon by Shri Dhawan, it has been held that the word 'person' in its
ordinary and natural sense includes crown. The same view was reiterated in
<a href="/doc/1163950/" id="a_53">I.R. Commissioner v. Whiteworth Coal Co. Ltd</a>., (1968) 2 All ER 91 at 108.
On the concept of "legal personalityT and the concept of "person", in
"Elementary Principles of Jurisprudence" by Keeton (1949 Edition) relied on
by Shri Rajeev Dhawan, in Chapter XIII at page 150, it is stated that in
modern law, this personification by law is confined to certain definite
limits, although this restriction is based, not upon principle, but upon
convenience. In law, however, we are concerned with legal persons, whether
they are natural, i.e., human beings capable of sustaining rights and
duties, or artificial or juristic, i.e., g.oups or things to which the law
attributes the capacity to bear rights and duties. Legal personality is
itself nothing but a fiction, in so far as it is intended to imply no more
than that a legal person is simply a complex of legal rights and duties. At
page 151, it is stated that juristic persons may be defined as those
persons or groups of persons which the law deems capable of holding rights
and duties, with a few exceptions. At page 152, he has amplified that
corporation sole is a juristic person and it succinctly describes the
position in modern English law. The conception of separate personality
attaching to the successive occupants of a particular office is as valid
juristically as the conception of incorporation of the members of a group.
The Law of Property Act, 1925, <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_54">Section 180</a> contents itself with addition
briefly, that a corporation sole may now hold personal property with rights
and duties. At page 154, it is stated that principles applying to
corporation aggregate are not fully applicable to corporation sole. "Court
regarded the corporation sole not as a person, but as a device for the
transmission of rights from one natural person to another". He quotes
Blackstone : that "corporation sole consists of one person only and his
successors, in some particular station, who are incor-porated by law, in
order to give them legal capacities and advantages, in particular that of
perpetuity, which in the natural persons could not have had. In this sense
the King is a corporation sole". At page 155, it is further stated that the
law, therefore, has wisely ordained, that the person, qua tenus person,
shall never die, any more than the King; by making him and his successors a
corporation sole. By which means all the original rights of a personage are
preserved entirely to the successors. At page 169, it is stated that the
reason for King personality, a corporate sole, is that corporate
personality is a technical device, applied for a multitude of very diverse
aggregations, institutions and transactions, whereas each of many theories
has been conceived for a particular type of juristic personality. None of
them foresaw the extent to which the device of incorporation would be used
in modern business, or we may add, to cloak the activities of some branch
of Government.
</p>
<p id="p_86">Thus, in Great Britain, Crown has been regarded as a Corporation sole,
persona ficta so that it has never been considered necessary to personify
the State. The Crown in its political represents the State in England and
can sue in the English courts as a person. In Madras Electric Corporation
case, the same view was reiterated but when liability was sought to be
imposed upon a person, it was held that the general principle of person,
does not include the Crown, unless the statute is binding on the Crown, by
express provision or by necessary implication. As held in <a href="/doc/1163950/" id="a_55">I.R. Commissioner
v. Whiteworth Coal Co. Ltd</a>., (1968) 2 All ER 91 at 108, in a taxing statute
it was held that there was no objection to interpret the word 'person' to
include the Crown in any provision other than those which seek to impose a
burden.
</p>
<p id="p_87">In the American Jurisprudence 2nd Series, Vol. 72, page 407, it is stated
that a State, in the ordinary sense of the Federal Constitution, is a
political community of free citizens, occupying a territory of defined
boundaries, and organised under a government sanctioned and limited by a
written constitution, and established by the consent of the governed. While
the municipal corporation is organised under the authority of a state
legislature and draws its public character from the law of the state
creating it, it is endowed with a public character by virtue of having been
invested by the legislature with subordinate legislative powers to
administer local and internal affairs of the community, as well as by
having been created as a branch of the state government to assist it in the
civil government of the State. A public corporation, \vith capacity to sue
and be sued, under modern statutory provisions, is a legal person. So also,
for purposes of convenience, certain Departments of Government or the board
of managers of a public institution are sometimes incorporated, but the
corporations thus created, although public, are not municipal corporations.
In Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, Page 675, the word "Government"
has been defined thus :
</p>
<p id="p_88">"From the Latin gubernaculum, signifies the instrument, the helm, whereby
the ship to which the state was compared, was guided on course by the
"gubernator" or helmsman, and in that view, the government is but an agency
of the state, distinguished as it must be in accurate thought from its
scheme and machinery of govern-ment.
</p>
<p id="p_89">In the United Slates, government consists of the executive, legislative,
and judicial branches in addition to administrative agen-cies. In a broader
sense, includes the federal government and all its agencies and bureaus,
state and county governments, and city and township governments.
</p>
<p id="p_90">The system of polity in a state, that form of fundamental rules and
principles by which a nation or state is governed, or by which individual
members of a body politic are to regulate their social actions. A
constitution, cither written or unwritten, by which the rights and duties
of citizens and public officers are prescribed and defined, as a
monarchical government, a republican government, etc. The sovereign of
supreme power in a state or nation. The machinery by which the sovereign
power in a state expresses its will and exercises its functions, or the
framework of political institutions, departments, and officers, by means of
which the executive, judicial, legislative, and administrative business of
the state is carried on."
</p>
<p id="p_91">In Edgar B. Sims. v. United States of America, (359 US 108 : 3 L ed 2d 66),
Federal tax authorities issued notices of levy of tax for assessment on
unpaid income of employees of the State of West Virginia, and had the
notice served on the defendant. The State auditor, seized the accrued
salaries of the taxpayers pursuant to Sections 6331 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954. The defendant-State refused to honour the levy and instead,
delivered payroll warrants to the taxpayers for their, then accrued
salaries. Thereafter, the Government brought the action in the District
Court for the Southern District of West Virginia to recover from defendant
the amount of salaries he had so paid to the taxpayer in disobedience to
the Government's levies. The District Court upheld the Government's order.
The Court of Appeals, on appeal, affirmed it. On a writ of certiorari, it
was held by the Supreme Court of USA that the levy of tax made under
<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_56">Section 6331</a> was authorised levy and that defendant under Section 6332 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as 'person' was liable to pay the same.
</p>
<p id="p_92">In State of Ohio v. Guy T. Helverirtg, (292 US 360 : 78 L ed 1307 at 1310)
the question was whether "the State", when it was selling liquor through
its agency and sources, "was a person" within the meaning of U.S.C. title
26, Section 205 (Section 3244, as amended)? It was held at page 1310 that
the tax is levied upon every person who sells liquor etc. The word 'person'
as used in the title, should be broadly construed as to mean and include a
partnership, association, company or corporation, as well as a natural
person. Whether the word 'person' or 'corporation' includes a State or the
United States depends upon the connection in which the word is found. In
South Carolina case, the United States Court disposed of the question by
holding that since the State was not exempt from the tax, the statute
reached the individual sellers who acted as dispensers for the State. While
not rejecting that view, the Court preferred to place on the word 'person'
the broader ground that when the State itself becomes a dealer in
intoxicating Liquors, it falls within the reach of the tax either as a
'person' under the statutory extension of that word to include a
corporation, or as a 'person' without regard to such extension.
</p>
<p id="p_93">In State of Georgia v. Hiram W. Evans, (316 US 159 : 86 L ed 1346) the same
view was reiterated by the U.S.A. Supreme Court and it was held that if the
word 'person' is to include a State as plaintiff, it must equally include a
State as a defendant or else the language used would be meaningless.
</p>
<p id="p_94">In United States of America v. Cooper Corporation et al, (312 US 600: 85 L
ed 1071) relied on by Sri Sudhir Chandra, considering the word 'person'
used in Sections 7, 85 and 178 of the Sherman Anti Trust Act, it was held
that although the term "person", as used in a statute, is not ordinarily
construed to include the sovereign, this is not a hard and fast rule of
exclusion, but may be negatived by resort to aids to construction
indicating a contrary intent. On the facts, it was held that State was not
a person. In that context it was held that in the absence of any indication
to the contrary, the term 'person', when used in different sections of a
statute, was employed throughout the statute, in the same, and not
different sense. But the said decision was reversed in State of Georgia
case. In United States v. I.C.C., (1949) 337 U.S. 426 it was held that when
relief is sought against State itself, the word 'person' would include the
State and be construed accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_95"><a href="/doc/25576/" id="a_57">In Superintendent &amp; Legal Remembrancer, State of West Bengal v. Corporation
Calcutta</a>, [1967] 2 SCR 170 a Bench of nine Judges of this Court was to
consider whether the State of West Bengal, when it was carrying on trade,
as owner and occupier of the market at Calcutta, without obtaining the
licence, was bound by the Calcutta Municipality Act or, by necessary
implication, was exempted to obtain licence. A complaint against the State,
for its failure to obtain licence was filed by the Municipal Corporation.
It was contended that the State is not a person under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_58">Section 218</a> of the
said Act. Per majority, it was held that the Common Law rule of
construction that the Crown is not, unless expressly named or clearly
intended, bound to be a State, was held to be not acceptable as a rule of
construction. It was held that the archaic rule based on prerogative and
protection of the Crown has no relevance to a democratic republic. It is
inconsistent with the rule of law based on the doctrine of equality and
introduces conflicts and anomalies. The normal construction, viz., that an
enactment applies to citizens as well as to the State, unless it expressly
or by necessary implication exempts the State from its operation, steers
clear of all the anomalies and is consistent with the philosophy of
equality enshrined in the Constitution. <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_59">Under the Act</a> there is a
distinction between fine imposed under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_60">Section 537</a> and under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_61">Section 541</a> of
the Act, the fines under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_62">Section 537</a> are in respect of offences enumerated
therein they certainly go to the coffers of the States. In respect of such
offences it may be contended that, as the fines paid reach the State
itself, there is an implication that the State was not bound by the
Sections enumerated therein, for a person who receives the fine, cannot be
the same person who pays it. This incongruity may lead to the said
necessary implication. Another Bench of nine Judges in <a href="/doc/1799890/" id="a_63">State Trading
Corporation of India Ltd, v. The Commercial Tax Officer &amp; Ors</a>., AIR (1963)
SC 1811 at 1817 per majority interpreted the word 'citizen' in a broader
perspective. <a href="/doc/544641/" id="a_64">In Union of India v. Jubbi</a>, AIR (1968) SC 360 at 362 a three-
Judge Bench had held that a statute applies to State as much it does to a
citizen, unless, it expressly or by necessary implication, exempts the
State from its operations. If the Legislature intended to exclude the
applicability of the Act to the State, it could have easily stated in
<a href="/doc/1724061/" id="a_65">Section 11</a> itself or by a separate provision that the Act was not to be
applied to the Union or to the lands held by it. In the absence of such a
provision, in a constitutional set up like the one we have in this country,
and of which the overriding basis is the broad concept of equality, free
from any arbitrary discrimination, the presumption would be that a law of
which the avowed object is to free the tenant of landlordism and to ensure
to him secuhty of tenure would bind all landlords irrespective of whether
such a landlord is an ordinary in-dividual or the Union. In that case, it
was contended that Abolition of Big Landed Estates and Land Reforms Act,
1953 and <a href="/doc/1724061/" id="a_66">Section 11</a> thereof does not apply to the land held by the
Government. This Court rejected that contention. It would, therefore, be
settled law that the question whether or not the word 'person' used in a
statute would include the State has to be determined with reference to the
provisions of the Act, the aim and its object and the purpose the Act seeks
to subserve. There is no reason to consider the word 'person' in a narrow
sense. It must be construed in a broader perspectivity, unless the statute,
either expressly or by necessary implication, exempts the State from the
operation of the Act as against the State and would include "State
Government".

<p id="p_96">Property of the State - how dealt with under the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_97">Part I of the Constitution of India deals with Union and its territories.
<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_67">Article 1</a> declares that India, that is Bharat shall be a Union of States.

2 to 4 deal with the power of the Parliament to admit into the Union, by
law, any State, or establish new States on such terms and conditions as it
thinks fit. Formation of the new States and alteration of areas, boundaries
and names of the existing States are regulated by law made by Parliament.
It also gives power to the Parliament to amend the First and the Fourth

<p id="p_102">The members of the Legislature are elected by the people periodically at
the end of every five years. The political party or group of political
parties who secure majority in the Legislative Assembly of the State elects
the leader who would be called upon by the Governor to form the Govt. and
on his appointment as the Chief Minister, On his advise, the Governor
appoints his Council of Ministers who act in collective responsibility to
aid and advise the Governor in the governance of the State during the
tenure of their office. Permanent bureaucracy acts as an arm of the
Government.
</p>
<p id="p_103">Articles 309 to 312A in Chapter I of Part XIV under the heading "Services
under the Union and the States" regulate the recruitment and conditions of
service and appointments to the public services and posts in connection
with the affairs of the Union or the States, subject to the provisions of
the Constitution and acts of the appropriate Legislature. Details thereof
are not material for the purpose of this case; suffice it to state that
Constitution has created permanent bureaucracy consisting of diverse all
India services allotted to various States and State Services created
thereunder, to assist the political executive and to implement the
provisions of the Constitution, the laws and the executive policy of the
appropriate Government. Under the Constitution, in all ordinary matters of
administration, the Ministers take full responsibility, subject to the
control by the Legislature. The bureaucracy gives shape to the decisions
taken by the council of Ministers at the Cabinet meeting or by the
individual Ministers by working out the details and they are applied in the
given set of facts. In Halsbur's Laws of England (4th Edn.) Vol. 8 in
paragraph 1152 at page 711, it is stated that the Government offices and
departments through which the general executive administration of the
country is carried on owe their establishment and organisation, together
with the powers they possess and duties they perform, partly to the royal
prerogative and partly to the Parliament, They derive almost all their
powers directly or indirectly from Parliament, which alone can provide them
with the supplies of money, necessary for their operations. Their internal
arrangements, on the other hand, are hardly ever organised or directly
interfered with by Parliament, but have been a matter for the royal
prerogative. This principle proprio vigore applies to Cabinet form of
functioning under our Constitution. In paragraphs 1155 at page 713, it is
further stated that where functions entrusted to a minister or to a depart-
ment are performed by an official employed in the ministry or department
there is in law no delegation because constitutionally the acts or
decisions of the officials are that of the Minister. In the exercise of
their functions relating to land under any enactment, every Minister and
government department must have regard to the desirability of conserving
the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside.
</p>
<p id="p_104">Ministerial Responsibility.
</p>
<p id="p_105">As stated hereinbefore, the Constitution envisions to establish an
egalitarian social order rendering to every citizen, social, economic and
political justice in a social and economic democracy of that Bharat
Republic. <a href="/doc/358206/" id="a_83">Article 261(1)</a> of the Constitution provides that full faith and
credit shall be given, throughout the territory of India, to public acts,
record and judicial decisions of the Union and of every State. <a href="/doc/970047/" id="a_84">In
Secretary, Jaipur Development Authority v. Daulat Mal Jain</a>, [1997] 1 SCC
35, a Bench of this Court had held thus ;
</p>
<p id="p_106">"The Governor runs the Executive Government of a State with the aid and
advice of the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers which exercise
the powers and performs its duties by the individual Ministers as public
officers with the assistance of the bureaucracy working in various
Departments and Corporate sectors etc. Though they are expressed in the
name of the Governor, each Minister is personally and collectively
responsible for the actions, acts and policies. They are accountable and
answerable to the people. Their powers and duties are regulated by the law
and the rules. The legal and moral responsibility or liability for the acts
done or omissions, duties performed and policy laid down rest solely on the
Minister of the Department, Therefore, they are indictable for their
conduct or omission, or misconduct or misap-propriation. The Council of
Ministers are jointly and severally responsible to the Legislature.
He/they, is/are also publicly ac-countable for the acts or conducts in the
performance of duties.
</p>
<p id="p_107">The Minister holds public office though he gets constitutional status and
performs functions under Constitution, law or executive policy. The acts
done and duties performed are public acts or duties as holder of the public
office. Therefore, he owes certain accountability for the acts done or
duties performed. In a democratic society governed by rule of law, power is
conferred on the holder of the public office or the concerned authority by
the Constitution by virtue of appointment. The holder of the office,
therefore, gets opportunity to abuse or misuse of the office. The
politician who holds public office must perform public duties with the
sense of purpose, and a sense of direction, under rules or sense of
priorities. The purpose must be genuine in a free democratic society
governed by the rule of law to further socio-economic democracy. The
executive Government should frame its policies to maintain the social
order, stability, progress and morality. All actions of the Government are
performed through/by individual persons in collective or joint or
individual capacity. Therefore, they should morally be responsible for
their actions.
</p>
<p id="p_108">When a Government in office misuses its powers, figuratively, we refer to
the individual Minister/Council of Ministers who are constituents of the
Government. The Government acts through its bureaucrats, who shapes its
social, economic and administrative policies to further the social
stability and progress socially, economically and politically. Actions of
the Government, should be accounted for social morality. Therefore, the
actions of the individuals would reflect on the actions of the Government.
The actions are intended to further the goals set down in the Constitu-
tion, the laws or administrative policy. The action would, therefore, bear
necessary integral connection between the 'purpose' and the end object of
public welfare and not personal gain. The action cannot be divorced from
that of the individual actor. The end is something aimed at and only
individuals can have and shape the aims to further the social, economic and
political goals. The ministerial responsibility thereat comes into
consideration. The Minister is responsible not only for his actions but
also for the job of the bureaucrats who work or have worked under him. He
owes the responsibility to the electors for all his actions taken in the
name of the Governor in relation to the Department of which he is the
head."
</p>
<p id="p_109"><a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_85">In Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab &amp; Anr</a>., [1974] 2 SCC 831, a Bench of
seven Judges of this Court had held that under the Cabinet System of
Government as embodied in our Constitution, the Governor is the Formal head
of the State. He exercises all his powers and functions conferred on him by
or under the Constitution, on the aid and advice of his Council of
Ministers, save in spheres where the Governor is required by or under the
Constitution to exercise his function in his discretion. The satisfaction
of the Governor for the exercise of any power or function, required by the
Constitution, is not the personal satisfaction of the Gover-nor but is the
satisfaction in the constitutional sense under the Cabinet System of
Government. The executive is to act subject to the control of the
legislature. The executive power of the State is vested in the Governor as
head of the Executive. The real executive power is vested in the Ministers
of the Cabinet. The Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers with the
Chief Minister as its head aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of
his executive functions. The same principle was reiterated by a Bench of
three Judges in UK. Jain v. Union of India, [1995] 4 SCC 119. Therein, it
was held that in a democracy governed by rule of law, State is treated on
par with a person by <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_86">Article 19(6)</a> in commercial/industrial activities.
</p>
<p id="p_110">It would thus be clear that in a democratic polity governed by the rule of
law, the administration is run through constitutional mechanism i.e.,
Cabinet form of Govt. by a Council of Ministers headed by the Chief
Minister. They aid and advise the Governor, the executive head of the
State. The bureaucracy - an arm of the political executive - assists as an
integral part of administrative mechanism. Their actions or the acts,
individually or collectively, are directed to elongate and fulfil the
socio-economic goals set down in the Constitution to establish the
egalitarian social order in which socio-economic justice is secured to the
poor and weaker sections of the society including the Schedule Castes and
Scheduled Tribes, in particular, as enjoined in <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_87">Article 46</a> of the
Constitution, to promote their socio-economic interest and protect them
from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. The State is,
therefore, a "person" within the constitutional mechanism persona ficta is
enjoined to elongate the objects of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_111">Scope of the power of the Govt. in disposal of its property in Scheduled
area and constitutional duty and limitation of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_112">In "In the Framing of the India's Constitution", a study by B. Shiva Rao,
(Volume n) in Chapter 20 on the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution on the
Tribal Area, the author has surveyed the historical background for
integration of Scheduled Tribes into the national mainstream. The histori-
cal survey and legislative development do assure us that throughout......A

system of modified exclusion of law was applied to the Scheduled areas. The
power was with the Governor. He exercises the executive and legislative
power to apply, or to refrain from applying any law made by Parliament or
State Legislature to the Agency tracts. The object of Government policy

is to protect the tribals or their land..... by securing to them protection

from exploitation. The principal duty of the administration is to protect
them from exploitation. Considering the past experience and the
exploitation of the tribals' simplicity and truthfulness by the non-
tribals, it became imperative by statutory safeguards to preserve the land
which is their natural endowment and mainstay for their economic
empowerment. No laws affecting social matters, occupation of land including
tenancy laws allotment of land and setting apart of land for village
purposes and village management, including the establishment of village
panchayats, would apply, unless they are suitable to the conditions. Shiva
Rao has stated at page 579 thus :
</p>
<p id="p_113">"The transfer of land in a Scheduled Area from a tribal to a non-tribal was
forbidden; and the State Government was also prohibited from allotting
State land in a Scheduled Area to non-tribals except in accordance with
rules made after consulting the Tribes Advisory Council. Likewise, if
advised by the council, the Governor was obliged to license money-lending,
prescribing such conditions as were considered necessary; and the breach of
these conditions would be an offence. In order that public attention must
be focussed on the development work carried out in these areas, the State
Government was required to show separately in its annual financial
statement the revenues and expenditure pertaining to these areas."
</p>
<p id="p_114">Thus, the Fifth and Sixth Schedules an integral scheme of the Con-stitution
with direction, philosophy and anxiety is to protect the tribals from
exploitation and to preserve valuable endowment of their land for their
economic empowerment to elongate social and economic democracy with
liberty, equality, fraternity and dignity of their person in our political
Bharat.
</p>
<p id="p_115">Egalitarian Social Order - Scope and Content,

Justice is an attribute of human conduct. Law, as a social engineer-ing, is
to remedy existing imbalances, as a vehicle to establish an egalitarian
social order in a Socialist Secular Bharat Republic. The Upanishad says
that, "let all be happy and healthy, let all be blessed with happiness and
let non be unhappy". Bhagwatgeeta preaches through Yudhishtra that, "I do
not long for kingdom, heaven or rebirth, but I wish to alleviate the
suffer-ings of the unfortunate'. Prof. Friedlander in his "Introduction of
Social Welfare" at page 6 states that social welfare is the organised
system of social service and institutions are designed to aid individuals
and groups to attain specified standard of life and health and personal and
social relationship which permit them to develop their full capacities and
to promote their well-being in harmony with the needs of their families and
the community. Welfare State is a rubicon between unbridled individualism
and communism. All human rights are derived from the dignity of the person
and his inherent worth. Fundamental Rights and Directive Prin-ciples of the
Constitution have fused in them as fundamental human rights as indivisible
and inter- dependent. The Constitution has charged the State to provide
facilities and opportunities among the people and groups of people to
remove social and economic inequality and to improve equality of status.
<a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_88">Article 39(b)</a> enjoins the State to direct its policy towards securing
distribution of the ownership and control of the material resources of the
community as best to subserve the common good. The founding fathers with
hind sight, engrafted with prognosis, not only inalienable human rights as
part of the Constitution but also charged the State as its policy to remove
obstacles, disabilities and inequalities for human develop-ment and
positive actions to provide opportunities and facilities to develop human
dignity and equality of status and of opportunity for social and economic
democracy. Economic and social equality is a facet of liberty without which
meaningful life would be hollow and mirage.
</p>
<p id="p_116">Right to development - a fundamental right.
</p>
<p id="p_117">Declaration of "Right to Development Convention" adopted by the United
Nations and ratified by India, by <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_89">Article 1 "</a>right to development'' became
part of an inalienable human right. By virtue thereof, every human person
and ail people are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy
economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human
rights and fundamental freedoms would be fully realised (emphasis sup-
plied). Clause (2) thereof provides that "the human right to development
also implies the full realisation of the right of the people to improve
their natural wealth and resources". <a href="/doc/300602/" id="a_90">Article 2(1)</a> provides that "the human
person is the central subject of development and should be and active
participant and beneficiary of the right to development". Clause (2) says
that all human beings have a responsibility for development, individually
and collectively, taking into account the need for full respect for their
human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as their duties to the
community, which alone can ensure free and complete fulfilment of the human
being and they should, therefore, promote and protect an appropriate
political, social and economic order for development". Clause (3) thereof
provides that the State have "the right and the duty to formulate
appropriate national development policies that aim at the constant
improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all
individuals, on the basis of their active, free and meaningful
participation in development and in the fair distribution of the benefits
resulting therefrom".
</p>
<p id="p_118"><a href="/doc/452639/" id="a_91">Article 3(1)</a> recognises and enjoins that it is the State's primary
responsibility to create conditions favourable to the realisation of the
right to development. Under clause (3) thereof, it reminds the State of its
duty to cooperate with each other and of "ensuring development and
eliminating obstacles to development". <a href="/doc/531094/" id="a_92">Article 6(2)</a> reassures that "human
rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent; equal
attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation,
promotion and protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural
rights (em-phasis supplied) and clause (3) thereof enjoins that "the States
should take steps to eliminate obstacles to development. <a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_93">Article 8</a> enjoins
that "the State should undertake, at the national level, all necessary
measures for the realisation of the right to development and shall ensure
inter alia equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic
resources, education, health services, food, housing, employment and the
fair distribution of income", it also provides that "an appropriate
economic and social reform should be carried out with a view to eradicating
all social injustice". <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_94">Article 9</a> gives a right declaring that "all the
aspects of the right to development set forth in the present declaration
are indivisible and interdependent and each of them should be considered in
the context of the whole" and <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_95">Article 10</a> concludes and reminds the State of
its duty "to take steps to ensure them the full exercise and progressive
enhancement of the right to development, including the formulation,
adoption and implementation of policy, legislative and other measures at
the national levels". The directive principles in Part IV of the
Constitution are fore-runners to the Convention (Emphasis sup-plied).
</p>
<p id="p_119">India being an active participant in the successful declaration of the
Convention on Right to Development and a party signatory thereto, it is its
duty to formulate its policies, legislative or executive, accord equal
attention to the promotion of, and to protect the right to social,
economic, civil and cultural rights of the people, in particular, the poor,
the Dalits and Tribes as enjoined in <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_96">Article 46</a> read with Articles 38, 39
and all other related Articles read with right to life guaranteed by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_97">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. By that constant, endeavour and
interaction, right to life would become meaningful so as to realise its
full potentiality of "person" as inalienable human right and to raise the
standard of living, improve excellence and to live with dignity of person
and of equal status with social and economic justice, liberty, equality and
fraternity, the trinity are pillars to establish the egalitarian social
order in Socialist Secular Democratic Bharat Republic.
</p>
<p id="p_120">Social and economic democracy is the foundation on which political
democracy would be a way of life in the Indian polity. Law as a social
engineering is to create just social order removing inequalities in social
and economic life, socio-economic disabilities with which poor people are
languishing by providing positive opportunities and facilities to
individuals and groups of people. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, in his closing speech
in the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, had lucidly elucidated
thus :
</p>
<p id="p_121">"What does social democracy mean? It means way of life which recognises
liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. These
principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are not to be treated as
separate items in a trinity. They form a union of trinity in the sense that
to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy.
Liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from
liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Without
equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many.
Equality without liberty, would kill individual initiative - we have in
India a society based on the principle of graded inequality which means
elevation for some and degradation for others. On the economic plan, we
have a society in which there are some who have immense wealth as against
many who live in abject poverty". We cannot afford to have equality in
political life and inequality in economic life. How long shall we continue
to live this life of contradiction? How long shall we continue to deny
equality in our social and economic life? We must remove this contradiction
at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffered from inequality
will blow up the structure of political democracy which this Assembly H
has laboriously built up." (Vide B. Shiva Rao's, The    Framing of India's
Constitution : Select Documents', Vol. IV, p. 944.)

The core constitutional objective of "social and economic democracy" in
other words, just social order, cannot be established without removing the
inequalities in income and making endeavour to eliminate inequalities in
status through the rule of law. The mandate for social and economic
retransformation requires that the material resources or their ownership
and control should be so distributed as to subserve the common good. A new
social order, therefore, would emerge, out of the old unequal or
hierarchical social order. The legislative or executive measures,
therefore, should be necessary for the reconstruction of the unequal social
order by corrective and distributive justice through the rule of law.
</p>
<p id="p_122">Right to life - Scope and Content,

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_98">Article 21</a> of the Constitution reinforces "right to life" - a fundamental
right - which is an inalienable human right declared by the Universal
Declaration on Human Rights and the sequential Conventions to which India
is a signatory. <a href="/doc/268805/" id="a_99">In Delhi Transport Corporation v. D.T.C Mazdoor Congress</a>,
AIR (1991) SC 101 at 173 in paragraph 223, this Court had held that right
to life would include right to continue in permanent employment which is
not a bounty of the employer nor can its survival be at the volition or
mercy of the employer. Income is the foundation to enjoy many fun-damental
rights and when work is the source of income, the right to work would
become as much a fundamental right. Fundamental rights can ill-afford to be
consigned to the limbo of undefined premises and uncertain application.
That will be a mockery of them. <a href="/doc/595099/" id="a_100">In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India</a>,
[1984] 3 SCC 161 at 183-84, this Court had held that right to live with
human dignity enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_101">Article 21</a> derives its life breath from the
Directive Principles of State Policy and that opportunities and facilities
should be provided to the children to develop in a healthy manner and in
conditions of freedom and dignity. Adequate facilities, just and humane
conditions of work etc. are the minimum requirements which must exist in
order to enable a person to live with human dignity and the State has to
take every action. <a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_102">In Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar</a>, AIR (1991) SC 420,
this Court had held that the right to life includes the right to enjoyment
of pollution free water and air for full enjoyment of life. <a href="/doc/709776/" id="a_103">In Olga Tellis
v. Bombay Municipal Corporation</a>, AIR (1986) SC 180, this Court had held
that right to livelihood is an important facet of the right to life. In
CE.S.C. Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. S.C. Base &amp; Ors., [1992] 1 SCC 441 at 462-63, para
30, it was held that right to social and economic justice is a fundamental
right. Right to health of a worker is a fundamental right. Therefore, right
to life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_104">Article 21</a> means something more than mere survival of
animal existence. The right to live with human dignity with minimum
sustenance and shelter and ail those rights and aspects of life which would
go to make a man's life complete and worth living, would form part of the
right to life. Enjoyment of life and its attainment - social, cultural and
intellectual - without which life cannot be meaningful, would embrace the
protection and preservation of life guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_105">Article 21.</a> Right to
health and social justice was held to be fundamental right to workers in
<a href="/doc/1657323/" id="a_106">Consumer Education and Research Centre v. Union of India</a>, [1995] 3 SCC 42
and <a href="/doc/1513693/" id="a_107">Life Insurance Corporation v. Consumer Education and Research Centre</a>,
[1995] 5 SCC 482. Right to economic equality is held to be fun-damental
right in Dalmia Cement Bharat Ltd. &amp; Anr. Etc. v. Union of India &amp;. Ors.
Etc., JT (1996) 4 SC 555. Right to shelter is held to be a fundamental
human right in P.G. Gupta v. State of Gujarat &amp; Ors., [1995] Supp. 2 SCC

(1996) 10 SC 485. The tribals, therefore, have fundamental right to social
and economic empowerment. As a part of right to development to enjoy full
freedom, democracy offered to them through the States regulated power of
good Government that the lands in Scheduled areas are preserved for social
economic empowerment of the tribals.
</p>
<p id="p_123">Meaning of Socialist Democratic Republic.
</p>
<p id="p_124">It is necessary to consider at this juncture the meaning of the "socialism"
envisaged in the Preamble of the Constitution. Establishment of the
egalitarian social order through rule of law is the basic structure of the
Constitution. The Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles are the
means, as two wheels of the chariot, to achieve the above object of
democratic socialism. The word "socialist" used in the Preamble must be
read from the goals Articles 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 38, 39, 46 and all
other cognate Articles seek to establish, i.e., to reduce inequalities in
income and status and to provide equality of opportunity and facilities.
Social justice snjoins the Court to uphold government's endeavour to remove
economic inequalities, to provide decent standard of living to the poor and
to protect the interest of the weaker sections of the society so as to
assimilate all the sections of the society in the secular integrated
socialist Bharat with dignity of person and equality of status to all.
</p>
<p id="p_125">Shri P.A. Choudhary, learned senior counsel for the 13th respondent,
contended that the word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_111">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulation does not
cover the executive Government of the State nor dees it prohibit the
Government from transferring its land. According to him, such an inter-
pretation would get the Regulation exposed itself to be ultra vires of
<a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_112">Article 298</a> of the Constitution which should be avoided. The premise of his
contention is founded on the principle that the Constitution empowers the
Executive to acquire, hold and dispose of the property and the Governor, as
sovereign head of the Executive, gets no power under the Fifth Schedule to
prohibit the State Government to transfer its property to non-tribals. On
the other hand, the Constitution has full faith in the Executive to
implement the directives contained in the Fifth Schedule to the
Constitution to promote the welfare of the Tribes. The Constitution has
built up a balance structure distributing powers and functions to each of
the three branches of the State. The Fifth Schedule read with <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_113">Article 244</a>
of Chapter X of the Constitution, with a non-obstante clause, has conferred
only the legislative power on the Governor, referable to <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_114">Article 245</a> to
enact the law relating to scheduled areas. The power to acquire, hold and
dispose of the property of the State was wisely left untouched in that
behalf. The prohibition contained in Fifth Schedule, therefore, does not
effect the power of the State under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_115">Article 298</a> to dispose of its property
situated in Scheduled area in the manner it deems appropriate. To buttress
his contention, the learned counsel cited a passage from Walter Bagehot -
The English Con-stitution at page 283 that the queen, without consulting
the Parliament, can by law disband the Army, engage or dismiss the officers
from General Commanding-in-Chief downwards. She could sell all her war
ships and all novel stores etc. He also cited "Governmental Law" by Hartley
and Griffith, page 289 in that behalf. He further cited Lord Birkeenhead's
dictum in <a href="/doc/1231203/" id="a_116">Birkdale District Electric Supply Company Ltd. v. Corporation of
Southport</a>, (1926) AC 355 at 364, wherein it was held that power entrusted
to a person or public body by the Legislature was to effectuate public
purpose. They cannot divest themselves of those powers and duties. Nor can
they do any action incompatible with due exercise of their powers or the
discharge of their duties.

<p id="p_126">In Rederiaktiebolaget Amphitrite v. The King, [1921] 3 KB 500, cited by the
learned counsel, the Government had given an undertaking to the owners and
permitted the neutal warships to carry a particular class of cargo to a
British colony in which event the said ships will be released from
detention. On the faith of it the owners of the ships carried the cargo and
requested for their release from detention. When clearance was refused,
action was laid in the court for damage for breach of contract. It was held
that such an undertaking by the Government was not enforceable in a Court
of law, as it was not being within the competence of the Crown to make a
contract which would have the effect of limiting its power of executive
action in the future.

<p id="p_127">He also cited Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company et al v. Charles Sawyer, 343

has executive inherent power to seize private property to meet an emergency
subject to the legislation confronting him of the power. He also cited Lois
P. Myers v. United States, 272 US 160 : 71 L ed 11 wherein it was held that
the President has the executive power to appoint and remove executive

and is not subject to any law made by the Parliament or the Legislature of
the State. In other words, according to the learned counsel, the ratio
therein reiterates that the executive power of the President/Governor
granted under the Constitution is not subject to any limitations but is co-
extensive with the exercise of the legislative power.

<p id="p_129">Maru Ram Etc. Etc. v. Union of India &amp; Anr., [1981] 1 SCR 1196 was cited

of the Governor under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_121">Article 162</a>, are not subject to legislative control.

Governor to pardon or to reduce the life imprisonment of a convict.
</p>
<p id="p_130">It is true, as contended by Shri Chowdhary, that the Constitution has
demarcated legislative, executive and judicial powers and entrusted them to
the three wings of the State; in particular the President/Governor of the
State is to exercise the executive power in their individual discretion. It
is not subject to legislative limitations to be done in accordance with
rules of business. In particular, the President/Governor is entrusted with
the execu-tive power co-extensive with the legislative power enumerated in
the Seventh Schedule read with <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_123">Article 245</a> of the Constitution. The
executive power especially conferred by the Constitution like the pleasure
tenure or the power of pardoning a convict are in our view, not apposite to
the issue. The power of the executive Government in that behalf has wisely
been devised in the Constitution is not subject to any restriction except
in accordance with the Constitution and the law made under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_124">Article 245</a> read
with the relevant Entry in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution is
subject to Fifth Schedule when it is applied to Scheduled area. The power
of the Government to acquire, hold and dispose of the property and the
making of contracts for any purpose conferred by <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_125">Article 298</a> of the
Constitution equally is co-extensive with the legislative power of the
Union/State. However, <a href="/doc/700735/" id="a_126">Article 244 (1)</a> itself specifies that provisions of
the Fifth Schedule shall apply to the administration and control of the
Scheduled areas and Scheduled Tribes in any State except the excluded areas
specified therein. The legislative power in Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_127">Article 245</a>
equally is "subject to the provisions of the Constitution" i.e. fifth
Schedule. Clause (1) of para 5 of Part B of the Fifth Schedule applicable
to Scheduled areas, adumbrates with a non obstante clause that "Not-
withstanding anything in the Constitution, in other words, despite the
powerr under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_128">Article 298</a>, the Governor may, by public notification, direct
that any particular Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of a State
shall not apply to a Scheduled Area or any part thereof in the State or
shall apply to a Scheduled Area or any part thereof in the State, subject
to such exceptions and modifications as he may specify in the notification
and any direction given under clause (1) of para 5, may be given so as to
have retrospective effect". The executive power of the State is, therefore,
subject to the legislative power under clause 5(1) of the Fifth Schedule.
Similarly sub-para (2) thereof empowers the Governor to make regulation for
the peace and good government of any area in a State which is for the time
being a Scheduled Area. In particular and without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing power, such regulation may regulate the allot-
ment of land to members of the Scheduled Tribes in such area or may
prohibit or restrict the transfer of land under clause (a) by or among the
members of the Scheduled Tribes in such areas. In other words sub-para 5(2)
combines both legislative as well as executive power, clause 5(2)(a) and
</p><p id="p_131">(c) legislative power and clause (b) combines both legislative as well as
executive power. The word 'regulation' in para 5(2)(b) is thus of wide
import.
</p>
<p id="p_132">Meaning of the word 'Regulation' in the title of the Regulation, para 5(2)
of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_133">The question then is: whether the word "regulate" in para 5 clause (2)(b)
would include prohibition to transfer the Government land? It requires no
elaborate discussion in this behalf. While interpreting <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_129">Article 19(l)(g)</a> of
the Constitution, this Court has consistently being held that the term
'regulation' would include total prohibition vide <a href="/doc/65796/" id="a_130">Narendra Kumar v. Union
of India</a>, [I960] 2 SCR 372; <a href="/doc/1547238/" id="a_131">Fatehchand Himmatlal v. State of Maharashtra</a>,
[1977] 2 SCC 670; <a href="/doc/1324332/" id="a_132">State of U.P. &amp; Ors. v. Hindustan Aluminium Corpn</a>. and
Ors., [1979] 3 SCC 229; <a href="/doc/87528/" id="a_133">K. Ramanathan v. State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr</a>., [1985]
2 SCC 116. This Court consider the meaning of the word "regulation" in Air
India Statutory Corporation Etc. v. United Labour Union &amp; Ors. Etc., 1996 9
SCALE 70 paragraph 56 at 104-05. Therein, the Contract Labour (Regulation
and Abolition) Act, 1970 came for consideration. The question was whether
the word "regulation" would include regularisation of the contract labour
in the establishment in which contract labour system was abolished, though
it was not expressly provided. A Bench of three Judges had held that the
word "regulation", in the absence of restrictive words, must be regarded as
plenary in the larger public interest. By necessary implication it includes
to do everything which is indispensable for the purpose of carrying out the
purposes in view. Accordingly, it was held that though no express provision
was made in the Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act to regularise
the services of the contract labour, working in an establishment after the
abolition of contract labour, by necessary implication, the word
'regulation' includes the power to regularise their services as permanent
employees in the establishment. Therefore, the word "regulate" the
allotment of land to members of Scheduled Tribes in scheduled area in the
Fifth Schedule by Clause 5(2)(b) must be read as a whole to ensure
regulation of the land only to and among the members of the Scheduled
Tribes in the Scheduled area. In the light of the provisions contained in
clause (a) of sub-para (2) of para 5, there is implied prohibition on the
State's power of allotment of its land to non-tribals in the Scheduled
Areas. When so read there is no incompatibility and inconsistency between
the power of the executive Government and the Constitution and conjoint
operation would elongate the good governance of the Scheduled Areas. So,
while prohibiting transfer of land between natural persons, i.e., tribles
and non-tribals and preventing non-tribals to purchase from or transfer to
another non-tribal, his right, title of interest in the land in the
scheduled area, at the same breathe would not be permissible for the
Government to transfer their land to a non-tribal except for equally
competing public purpose. The answer obviously should be that it is
permissible to the Government to transfer its lands to the non-tribals.
This negative answers leads to effectuate the constitutional objective to
preserve the land in the scheduled area to the tribals, prohibits the
Government from allotting their land to the non- tribals; prohibit
infiltration of the non-tribals into the scheduled area and prevents
exploita-tion of the tribals by non- tribals in any form. This purposive
interpretation would ensure distributive justice among the tribals in this
behalf and elongates the constitutional commitment. Any other
interpretation would sow the seed beds to disintegrate the tribal autonomy,
their tribal culture and frustrate empowerment of them, socially,
economically and politically, to live a life of equality, dignity of person
and equality of status.
</p>
<p id="p_134">It would, therefore, be clear that the executive power of the State to
dispose of its property under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_134">Article 298</a> is subject to the provisions in
the Fifth Schedule as an integral scheme of the Constitution. The
legislative power of the State under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_135">Article 245</a> is also subject to the
Fifth Schedule, to regulate the allotment of the Government land in the
Scheduled Areas. Obviously, therefore, the State legislature of Andhra
Pradesh has now imposed total prohibition under <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_136">Mines Act</a> to transfer its
lands to the non-tribals. Doubtless that under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_137">Article 298</a>, the State
exercises its power of disposal for public purpose. When two competing
public purposes claim preferential policy decision, option to the State
should normally be to elongate and achieve constitutional goal. Secondly,
the constitutional priority yields place to private purpose, though it is
hedged by executive policy. As a facet of interpretation, the Court too
adopts purposive inter-pretation tool to effectuate the goals set down in
the Constitution. Equally, the executive Government in its policy options
requires to keep them in the backdrop and regulate disposal of their land-
property in accordance with the constitutional policy, executive decision
backed by Public policy and, at the same time, preserve paramount Tribal
interest in the scheduled area. No abstract principle could be laid in that
behalf. Each case requires examination in the backdrop of the
legislative/executive action,its effect on the constitutional objectives
and the consequential result yields therefrom. The law relating to the
power of the President under the Constitution of U.S.A, as has been
interpreted by the Supreme Court of U.S.A. or the executive power of the
Queen under the scheme in English unwritten Constitution transformed by
Convention does not assist us much in this behalf. Shri Chowdhary also
cited an article The Notion of a Living Constitution" written by William H.
Rehnquist, the present Chief Justice of Supreme Court of USA [Texas Law
Review Vol. 54, 693] emphasising that the Executive should have full
freedom in exercising its executive power and the Court cannot limit the
executive power by interpretation of a statute or regulation. This also is
of no assistance since the Constitution of India conferred express power of
judicial review on the constitutional Courts, i.e., Supreme Court of India
and High Courts under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_138">Article 32</a> and <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_139">226</a> of the Constitution respectively.
From the aforestated constitutional perspective and the interpretation of
the words 'person' and 'regulation' put up in the earlier parts of the
judgment, the question arises: whether the word 'person' under <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_140">Section 3(1)</a>
of the Regulation would include the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_135">Shri Rajeev Dhavan, learned senior counsel for the appellant, con-tended
that the word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_141">Section 3(l)(a)</a> requires interpretation, keeping
in view the contextual constitutional history of prohibition on transfer of
the land by a tribal to a non-tribal including that of the Government land,
differently depending upon the context in which it has occurred in the
first part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_142">Section 3(2)(a)</a> the word 'person' may be considered in a
generic sense and in the second part thereof to mean a natural person.
Prohibition on the transfer of the land by a tribal to a non-tribal
visualises transfer between natural persons. The factum of mem-bership of
the person as a tribe does not necessarily cut down the width of the word
'person', namely, legal person taken alongside the natural person. The word
'person' requires interpretation in the natural sense of the Context in
which it is used. Legal person may be natural, artificial or statutory
person. The words "whether or not" in clause 3(2) (a) are in the nature of
clarification and it would not cut down the contextual meaning. The words
"such person" in the first part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_143">Section 3(l)(a)</a> must be interpretated to
mean transferor, namely, artificial or statutory person apart from natural
person. The objection of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_144">Section 3(1)(a)</a> would be rendered nugatory if the
meaning of the word 'person' is confined or restricted to natural person in
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_145">Section 3(2)(a)</a>. Generic person may be a co-operative society, a
shareholder of a company and equally a Govern-ment constitutionally capable
to hold, acquire and dispose of the property. Therefore, the word 'person'
used in the first part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_146">Section 3(2)(a)</a> is of wider import in the context
of ownership of the land transfer of which is prohibited within the
scheduled area to a non-tribal. The word 'person' in the second clause was
used in the context of natural persons, i.e., the transfer between the
tribes and non-tribes. In that context, the word 'person' was used in a
restricted sense. So in the context of the artificial or juridical or
statutory person, the word 'person' is of wider import. Any other
interpretation would defeat the object of the Fifth Schedule and the
Regulation. Similarly, <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_147">Section 3(2)(b)</a> regulates the reverse effect. The
land in Scheduled area is presumed to belong to the tribals treating them
as a class. The meaning of the word 'person' does not detract from the
meaning of the word 'person' b <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_148">Section 3(2)(a)</a>. Similarly, in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_149">Section 3(2)</a>
</p><p id="p_136">(c) if a non-tribal intends to sell the land to a tribal and if the latter
is not willing to purchase the same, the government may purchase the land
from the non-tribal person and distribute it to the tribal (in such manner
as may be prescribed). The words "manner of disposal" would indicate that
it should be only in favour of the Scheduled Tribes since the sole object
of the Fifth Schedule and its species, the regulation, is that the land in
Scheduled area requires preservation among the tribals by allotment and
their enjoyment by the tribals along. <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_150">Section 3(2)(b)</a> reinforces that the
assignment or sale of the property should only be in favour of the
Scheduled Tribes or a Society composed solely of the members of the
Scheduled Tribes. The entire property in Scheduled area is treated to be
the property, be it taken from the non- tribals or is of the Government and
at the disposal of the State Government. In that context, the learned
counsel has drawn our attention to the word 'regulation' in the Fifth
Schedule, para 5(2)(b). He also contends that the word 'regulation'
requires to be interpreted broadly to preserve not only the tribal autonomy
but also to subserve distributive justice in favour of the tribals in the
matter of assignment of the land belonging to the Government in their
favour. Conversely, there is implied prohibition on the transfer of
Government land in favour of the non-tribal The words "peace and good
government" used in para 5(2) also requires to be understood in a wider
sense. Good Government must, of necessity, be in accordance with the
Constitution and dispensation of socio-economic justice to the tribals
including regulation of the land, distribution between the tribals and
prohibition on the non-tribals to entrench into scheduled area, to acquire,
hold and deal with the lands in scheduled area. It would defeat the object
of the Constitution envisaged in the Fifth Schedule thereof because the
non-tribals get the Government land transferred in their favour and
manoeuvre to have the tribals deprived of their land by other illegal
means. The word 'State', therefore, would include within the concept of the
word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_151">Section 3</a> of the Act. In support thereof, Shri Rajeev
Dhavan cited <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_152">State of West Bengal v. Union of India</a>, [1964] 1 SCR 371 and
Madras Electric Corporation case. He has also drawn our attention to
construe the provisions in the context of the whole statute relving upon
<a href="/doc/1149874/" id="a_153">Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance &amp; Invest-ment Co. Ltd. &amp;
Ors</a>., [1987] 1 SCC 424 para 33 at page 450-<a href="/doc/1510944/" id="a_154">51 and C.E.S.C. Ltd, &amp; Ors. v.
Subhash Chandra Base &amp; Ors</a>., [1992] 1 SCC 441 at 464. He further contends
that in view of the object, the word may be read broadly, in the light of
public purpose and social and economic justice which the Regulation seeks
to serve. He cited, in support of his contention, the following decisions
viz. <a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_155">The State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamar-baugawala</a>, [1957] SCR 874 at
892-95; <a href="/doc/1051408/" id="a_156">Ishwar Singh Bindra &amp; Ors. v. The State of U.P</a>., [1969] 1 SCR 219
at 225; Nedurimilli Janardhana Reddy v. Progessive Democratic Students'
Union &amp; Ors., [1994] 6 SCC 506 para 6. A word may be read in different
contexts in a different way. He cited that the word 'sale' used in the
context of freedom of speech and expression was given different meaning in
<a href="/doc/1484835/" id="a_157">Printers (Mysore) Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. Asstt</a>. Commercial Tax Officer &amp; Ors.,
[1994] 2 SCC 434 at 445; Pushpa Devi &amp; Ors. v, Milkhi Ram (dead) by his
Lrs., [1990] 2 SCC 134 and <a href="/doc/1082133/" id="a_158">Commissioner of Income-tax, Bangalore v. J.H.
Gotla Yadagiri</a>, [1985] 4 SCC 343. The word 'vest' was interpreted with a
different meaning in <a href="/doc/37494799/" id="a_159">Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui &amp; On. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.,
[1994] 6 SCC 360 at pp. 393, 404-05 and 423. He therefore, contends that
different meaning is required to be given to the word 'person' as used in
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_160">Section 3(l)(a)</a>, <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_161">3(l)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_162">3(l)(c)</a> of the Act. We find force in his
contention.
</p>
<p id="p_137">M/s. Sudhir Chandra, L. Nageshwara Rao, A.V. Rangam and their companion
learned advocates, contended that in <a href="/doc/150101864/" id="a_163">Section 3</a> of the Regula-tion read with
the Fifth Schedule, para 5 sub-clauses 2(b), the word "person" would be
understood in its natural and contextual perspective which would indicate
that the word 'person' would be applicable only to natural persons. The
learned counsel laid great emphasis on the Statement of Objects and Reasons
for amendment of the Regulation in 1970. Accord-ing to the learned counsel,
the golden rule of interpretation is that the legislative intent is to be
effectuated by giving natural and grammatical meaning to the word used in a
statute. Only when the court finds ambiguity of the expression used by the
statute, principles of interpretation would be applicable. In this case,
there is no such ambiguity. The word 'person' is simple and plain,
connoting prohibition on transfer of land between natural persons, namely,
tribals and non-tribals. That is made manifest by the Statement of Objects
and reasons of the amended Regulation which envisages that the Regulation
was brought on statute to prohibit alienation of the lands in the scheduled
area by tribal in favour of a non-tribal. By necessary implication the
Government is not intended to be included in the word 'person'. Shri P.A.
Chowdhary, learned Senior Counsel, further elaborated, stating that <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_164">Section
3(2)(b)</a> amplifies that the land is purchased from a non-tribal by the
Government or where the heirs of a tribal transferor are not willing to
take back the property, assignment or disposal of the said property in
favour of another tribal as "a property at the disposal of the State
Government" and prosecution for violation of the Regulation under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_165">Section
6A</a> by way of penalty, are not intended to be applied to the Government when
the transfer is made in violation of the provisions of the Regulation; and,
therefore, the word 'person' should be given restricted meaning applicable
only to natural person.
</p>
<p id="p_138">Sri Sudhir Chandra further contended that Clause 2(a) of para 5 of the
Fifth Schedule restricts transfer of land by or among members of the
Scheduled Tribes; Clause (b) regulates the allotment of land to members of
the Scheduled Tribes in such areas; and clause (c) regulates money-lending
business by non-tribals to members of the Scheduled Tribes in scheduled
area and para 5(3) gives power to the Governor to regulate by law or to
repeal or amend any Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of the State or
any existing law in relation to that area. The purpose, thereby, is to
prevent exploitation of tribals by non-tribals. The State Government is not
expected to exploit the tribals. The Fifth Schedule does not prevent
establishment of any factory or an industry or any scheme for development
of the tribal area by non-tribals. Exploitation of valuable minerals by the
non-tribals is not intended to be prevented by Fifth Schedule to the
Constitution. In particular, they laid emphasis on para 5, clause 2(b) of
the Fifth Schedule, which does not prohibit the allotment of the land to
the non- tribals. It is contended that the word "regulate" used therein
does not necessarily imply prohibition. If such a construction is adopted,
it would hinder the progress of the tribal areas. It introduces mutually
internal and external contradictions. Harmonious interpretation, therefore,
has to be adopted to make the Regulation and the Fifth Schedule work as a
consis-tent whole, regulating prohibition on transfer of land in the tribal
areas to the non-tribal natural persons only. Thereby, the word 'person'
should be understood in that perspective. The government and juristic
persons are outside the purview of paras 5(2) and 5(3) of the Fifth
Schedule and <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_166">Section 3</a> of the Regulation.
</p>
<p id="p_139">The respective contentions give rise to the question: whether the
regulation prohibits the State Government transferring its lands to non-
tribals?
</p>
<p id="p_140">The historical evidence collected and culled out from B. Shiva Rao's "In
the making of the Constitution" and the scheme of the representative form
of Government furnishes background material for interpretation of the word
"person". It is well established rule of interpretation that the words of
width issued in the Constitution requires wide interpretation to effectuate
the goals of establishing an egalitarian social order supplying flesh and
blood to the glorious contents and context of those words and to enable the
citizen to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Constitution from generation
to generation. In Ashok Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P., JT (1997) 4 SC 251,
this Bench has applied the rule of wide interpretation of the Constitution.
It bears no reiteration; reasons given therein mutatis mutandis would
proprio vigore apply to the fact situation. From the above perspective,
having given our deep and anxious consideration to the respective
contentions of the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the
considered view that the interpretation put up by Shri Rajeev Dhavan merits
acceptance. It is seen and bears recapitulation that the purpose of the
Fifth and Sixth Schedules to the Constitution is to prevent exploitation of
truthful, inarticulate and innocent tribals and to empower them socially,
educationally, economically and politically to bring them into the
mainstream of national life. The founding fathers of the Constitution were
conscious of and cognizant to the problem of the exploitation of the
Tribals. They were anxious to preserve the tribal culture and their
holdings. At the same time, they intended to provide and create
opportunities and facilities, by affirmative action, in the light of the
Directive Principles in part IV, in particular, Articles 38, 39, 46 and
cognate provisions to prevent exploitation of the tribals by ensuring
positively that the land is a valuable endowment and a source of economic
empowerment, social status and dignity of persons. The Constitution intends
that the land always should remain with the tribals. Even the government
land should increasingly get allotted to them individually and collectively
through registered Cooperative Societies or agricultural/farming
Cooperative Societies composed solely of the tribals and would be managed
by them alone with the facilities and opportunities provided to them by the
Union of India through their Annual Budgetary allocation spent through the
appropriate State Government as its instrumentalities or local body in a
planned development so as to make them fit for self-governance. The words
"peace and good government" used in the Fifth Schedule require widest
possible interpretation recognised and applied by this Court in <a href="/doc/731827/" id="a_167">T.M.
Kanniayn v. Income-tax Officer, Pondicherry &amp; Anr</a>., [1968] 2 SCR 103 at

shall be competent to safeguard and preserve... community resources".
Clause (j) of <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_170">Section 4</a> provides that planning and management of minor
water bodies in the Scheduled Areas shall be entrusted to the Panchayats at
the appropriate level. Under clause (m) (iii) the power to prevent
alienation of land in the Scheduled Areas and to take appropriate action to
restore any unlawful alienation of land of a Scheduled Tribe and under
clause (iv) the power to manage village markets, by whatever name called,
are entrusted to the Gram Panchayats. It would indicate that the tribal
autonomy of management of their resources including the prevention of the
alienation of the land in the Scheduled Areas and taking of appropriate
acdon in that behalf for restoration of the same to the tribals, is
entrusted to the Gram Panchayats.
</p>
<p id="p_142">The maxim "reddendo singula singulis" will apply to the interpretation of
the word 'person" so that the general meaning of the word "person" in its
generic sense with its width would not be cut down by the specific
qualification of one species, i.e., natural "person" when it is capable to
encompass, in its ambit, natural persons, juristic persons and
constitutional mechanism of governance in a democratic set up. It has
already been held, and bears no repetition, that the State, by Cabinet form
of Government, is a persona ficta a Corporate sole. Constitution empowers
the State to acquire, hold and dispose of their property. The Governor in
his personal responsibility is empowered to maintain peace and good
government in scheduled area. The Fifth Schedule to the Constitution
empowers him to regulate allotment of the land by para 5(2)(b) read with
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_171">Section 3</a> of the Regulation of the land be it between natural persons,
i.e., tribals and non-tribals; it imposes total prohibition on transfer of
the land in scheduled area. The object of the Fifth Schedule and the
Regulation is to preserve tribal autonomy, their culture and economic
empowerment to ensure social, economic and political justice for
preservation of peace and good government in the Scheduled Area. Therefore,
all relevant clauses in the Schedule and the Regulation should harmoniously
and widely be read so as to elongate the aforesaid constitutional
objectives and dignity of person to the Scheduled Tribes, preserving the
integrity of the Scheduled Areas and ensuring distributive justice as an
integral scheme thereof. Clauses (a) and (c) of sub para (2) of para 5 of
the Fifth Schedule prohibits transfers Inter vivos between tribals and non-
tribal natural persons and prevents money-lenders to exploit the tribals.
Clause (b) intends to regulate allotment of land not only among tribals but
also prohibits allotment of the land belonging to the government to the
non-tribals. In that behalf, wider interpretation of "regulation" would
include "prohibition" which should be read into that clause. If so read, it
subserves the constitutional objective of regulating the allotment of the
land in Scheduled Areas exclusively to the Scheduled Tribes. Clause 5(2)(b)
ensures distributive justice of socio-economic empowerment which yields
meaningful results in reality . If purposive construction, in this backdrop
is adopted, no internal or external contradiction would emerge. The word
"person" would include both natural persons as well as juristic person and
constitutional Government. This liberal and wider interpretation would
maximise allotment of Govern-ment land in scheduled area to the tribals to
make socio- economic justice assured in the Preamble and Articles 38, 39
and 46, a reality to the tribals. The restricted interpretation would
defeat the objective of the Constitu-tion. The word "person" would be so
interpreted as to include State or juristic person Corporate sole or
persona ficta. Transfer of land by the juristic persons or allotment of
land by the State to the non- tribals would stand prohibited, achieving the
object of para 5(2) of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_172">Section 3</a>
of the Regulation. If the word 'person' is interpreted to mean only natural
persons, it tends to defeat the object of the Constitution, the genus and
the Regulation, its species. As a corollary, by omission in the final draft
of the Fifth Schedule of the power of the State Government to transfer its
land to the non-tribals with the sanction of a competent authorised officer
or authority would, by interpretation brought into effect and the object of
the Constitution would easily be defeated. We are, therefore, inclined to
take the view that the word 'person' includes the State Government. The
State Government also stands prohibited to transfer by way of lease or any
other form known to law, the Government land in scheduled area to non-
tribal person, be it natural or juristic person except to its
instrumentality or a Co-operative Society composed solely of tribes as is
specified in the second part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_173">Section 3(1)</a> (a). Any other interpretation
would easily defeat the purpose exclusive power entrusted by the Fifth
Schedule to the Governor. If the Cabinet form of Government would transfer
the land of the Government to non-tribals peace would get disturbed, good
governance in scheduled area would slip into the hands of the non-tribals
who would drive out the tribals from scheduled area and create monopoly to
the well developed and sophisti-cated non-tribals; and slowly, and
imperceptible, but surely, the land in the scheduled area would pass into
the lands of the non-tribals. The letter of law would be an empty content
and by play of words deflect the course of justice to the tribals and
denude them of the socio-economic empowerment and dignity of their person.
</p>
<p id="p_143">The word "person" in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_174">Section 3(l)(a)</a> would, therefore, be construed to
include not merely the natural persons, in the context of tribal and non
tribal who deal with the land in Scheduled Areas by transfer inter vivos
but all juristic persons in the generic sense, including the Corporation
ag-gregate or Corporation sole, State, Corporation, partnership firm, a
com-pany, any person with corporate veil or persons of all hues, either as
transferor or transferee so that the word 'regulate in para 5(2)(b) of the
Fifth Schedule in relation to the land in Scheduled Areas would be ap-
plicable to them either as transferor or transferee of land in a Scheduled
Area. It, thus, manifests the constitutional and legislative intention that
tribals and a Cooperative Society consisting solely of tribal members alone
should be in possession and enjoyment of the land in the scheduled area as
dealt with in various enactments starting from Gunjam and Vizianagaram Act,
1839 to the present regulation.
</p>
<p id="p_144">This interpretation of ours is consistent with the constitutionality of the
Regulation as was upheld by this Court in <a href="/doc/101893/" id="a_175">P. Rami Reddy &amp; Ors. Etc, v.
State of A.P. &amp; Anr</a>. Etc., [1988] Supp. 1 SCR 443; <a href="/doc/1145196/" id="a_176">Lingappa Pochanna
Appelwar v. State of Maharashtra and Anr</a>., [1985] 1 SCC 479 and Manchegowda
and Ors. v. State of Kamataka and Ors., [1984] 3 SCC 301. There is no
internal and external contradiction in this process of har-monious and
purposive interpretation of para 5(2)(a) of the Fifth Schedule which
regulates transfers between natural persons; Para 5(2) (b) encompas-ses
within its ambit, the transfer by the Government of its land to a non-
tribal and clause (c) or the relevant clauses in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_177">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_178">4</a> of the
Regulation. The Regulation prevents exploitation of the tribals through the
State Government; from the other end, it does not allow parting with of
their land and prevents induction of non-tribals into the scheduled area by
allotment of the land or by regulating allotment of the land, be it private
or private corporate aggregate. This interpretation per se, therefore, is
public law interpretation to subserve the constitutional purpose without
recourse to private law principles.

<p id="p_145"><a href="/doc/1215719/" id="a_179">In Minerva Mills Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., [1981] 1 SCR 206,
the Constitution Bench had held that the edifice of our Constitution is
built upon the concept crystalised in the Preamble. We "the People"
resolved to constitute ourselves a socialist State which carries with it
the obligation to secure to the people, justice - social, economic and
political. We, therefore, put Part IV into our Constitution containing
Directive Principles of State Policy which specifies the socialistic role
to be achieved. <a href="/doc/1416283/" id="a_180">In D.S. Nakara &amp; Ors. v. Union of India</a>, [1983] 2 SCR 165
at 187F to 189H, another Constitution Bench had dealt with the object to
amend the Preamble by the Constitution (42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_181">Amendment) Act</a> and pointed out
that the concept of Socialist Republic was to achieve socio- economic
revolution to end poverty, ignorance and disease and inequality of
opportunity. It was pointed out that socialism is a much misunderstood
word. Values deter-mine contemporary socialism - pure and simple. The
principal aim of socialist State is to eliminate inequality in income and
status and standards of life. The basic framework of socialism is to
provide a decent standard of life to the working people especially to
provide security from cradle to grave. The less equipped person shall be
assured a decent minimum standard of life and exploitation in any form
shall be prohibited. There will be equitable distribution of national cake
and the worst off shall be treated in such a manner as to push them up the
ladder. The Preamble directs the centers of power, Legislature, Executive
and Judiciary - to strive to set up from a wholly feudal exploited slave
society to a vibrant, throbbing socialist welfare society under rule of law
though it is a long march, but during the journey to the fulfilment of goal
every State action including interpretation whenever taken, must be
directed and must be so interpreted as to take -the society towards
establishing egalitarian socialist State, the goal. It was, therefore, held
that "it, therefore, appears to be well established that while interpreting
or examining the constitutional validity of legislative/ad-ministrative
action, the touchstone of Directive Principles of State Policy in the light
of the Preamble will provide a reliable yardstick to hold one way or the
other."
</p>
<p id="p_146">Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, while participating in the discussion on the
Constitution (First Amendment) Bill, had stated that the Directive Prin-
ciples are intended to bring about a socio-economic revolution and to
create a new socio-economic order where there will be social and economic
justice for all and for everyone, not only to fortunate few but also the
teeming millions of Indians who would be able to participate in the fruits
of freedom and development and exercise the fundamental rights.
</p>
<p id="p_147">Dr. Ambedkar, while introducing the Preamble of the Constitution for
discussion by the Constituent Assembly, had stated that the purpose of the
Preamble is to constitute "a new society in India based on justice, liberty
and equality". The Constituent Assembly debates of November 1948 at pages
230 to 357 do indicate that the Directive Principles intended to provide
life blood to social, economic and political justice to all people. Some of
the members like Mahavir Tyagi, Professor K.T. Shah, Dr. Saxena Etc.
pleaded for incorporation of socialism as part of the Preamble but Dr.
Ambedkar the father of the Constitution, while rejecting the amendment,
made it clear that the socio-economic justice provided in the Directive
Principles and the Fundamental Rights given in Chapter III would meet the
above objective without expressly declaring India as a socialist State in
the Constitution. Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyer supported Dr. Ambedkar and had
stated that "the constitution, while it does not commit the country to any
particular form of economic structure of social adjustment, gives ample
scope for the future legislature and the future Parliament to evolve any
economic order and undertake any legislation they choose in public
interest". Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in his speech also emphasised the need
to enter into a new social order in which "there would be valid growth in
the standard of living of all the people of India with equitable
distribution of wealth and equality of opportunity and status of all".
Dias, in his "Jurisprudence" (5th Edn.) on 'distributive justice' in
Chapter 4 at page 66, has stated that justice is not synonymous with
equality; equality is one aspect of it. Justice is not something which can
be captured in a formula once and for all. It is a process, a complex and
shifting balance between many factors including equality. Justice is never
given, it is always a task to be achieved. Justice is just allocation of
advantages and disadvantages, preventing the abuse of power, preventing the
abuse of liberty by providing facilities and opportunities to the poor and
disadvantaged and deprived social segments for a just decision of disputes
adapting to change.
</p>
<p id="p_148">Justice P.B. Sawant, former Judge of this Court, in his "Socialism under
the Indian Constitution" had stated at page 2 that today socialism has come
to be associated with certain social and economic arrangements and a way of
life in a socialist economy that the resources of the society are owned by
the State as a whole and are used for the benefit of all,. for ensuring all
basic human rights to every member of the society and not for the profit of
a few. By human rights is meant - all economic, political, social and
cultural rights which are necessary for an individual to realise his full
potential. In a socialist society, social, political and economic
inequalities disappear and none is allowed to possess economic power to the
extent that he is in a position to exploit or dominate others. It is only
such society which can guarantee human dignity, stability, peace and
progress.
</p>
<p id="p_149">Mahatma Gandhiji, the father of the nation, in 'Harijans' dated October
9,1937 had stated that "true economics never militates against the highest
ethical standard, just as all true ethics to be worth its name must at the
same time be also good economics. An economies that inculcates Mammon
worship, and enables the strong to amass wealth at the expense of the weak,
is a false and dismal science. It spells death. True economics, on the
other hand, stands for social justice, it promotes the good of all equally,
including the weakest, and is indispensable for decent life." Dr. V.K.R.V.
Rao, one of the eminent economists of India, in his "Indian Socialism
Retrospect and prospect" has stated at page 46-47 that a socialist society
has not only to bring about equitable distribution but also to maximise
production. It has to solve problems of unemployment, low income and mass
poverty and bring about a significant improvement in the national standards
of living. At page 47, he has stated that socialism, therefore, requires
deliberate and purposive action on the part of the State in regard to both
production and distribution and the fields covered are not only savings,
investment, human skills and use of science and technol-ogy, but also
changes in property relations, taxation, public expenditure, education and
the social services. A socialist society is not just a give-away society
nor is it only concerned with distribution of income. It must bring about
full employment as also an increase in productivity.
</p>
<p id="p_150">A socialistic society involves a planned economy which lakes note of time
and space considerations in the distribution and pricing of output. It
would be necessary for both the efficient working of socialist enterprises
and the prevention of unplanned and anarchical expansion of private
enterprises. The Indian conception of socialism with democracy with human
dignity is by creation of opportunities for the development of each
individual and not the destruction of the individual. It is not for the
merging of the individual in the society. The Indian socialist society
wants the development of each individual but requires this development to
be such that it leads to the upliftment of the society as a whole.
Fundamental duties in Chapter VI-A of the Constitution to bear meaningful
content, facilities and opportunity on equal footing is the fundamental
condition of a socialist society. The more the talent from backward classes
and areas get recogni-tion and support, the more socialist will be the
society. Public sector and private sector should harmoniously work. The
Indian approach to socialism would be derived from Indian spiritual
traditions. Buddhism, Jainism, Vedantic and Bhakti Hinduism, Sikhism, Islam
and Christianity have all contributed to this heritage rooted to respect
for human dignity and human equality. While imposing restrictions on the
right to private property even to the extent of abolishing it where
necessary in the social and public interest, it permits private enterprise
in economic activity and makes for a mixed economy rather than a completely
socialised economy. It abhors violence and class war and heirarchical class
structure and pins its faith on non-violence, sacrifice, and dedication to
the service of the poor and as a natural consequence, its implementation is
envisaged through Parliamen-tary democracy planned economy and the rule of
law rather than through a violent revolution or a dictatorship in any form.
Indian socialism, therefore, is different from Marxist or scientific
socialism.
</p>
<p id="p_151">To achieve the goal set down in the Preamble, the Directive Prin-ciples and
fundamental rights, the Constitution envisaged planned economy. The
Planning Commission has been given the constitutional status for the above
purpose. The Third Five Year Plan document extracts the basic features of
the socialist pattern of society thus :
</p>
<p id="p_152">".....Essentially, this means that the basic criterian for determining

lines of advance must not be private profit, but social gain, and that the
pattern of development and the structure of socio-economic relations should
be so planned that they result not only in appreciable increase in national
income and employment but

also in greater equality in incomes and wealth........The benefits of

economic development must accrue more and more to the rela-tively less
privileged classes of society, and there should be progres-sive reduction
of the concentration of incomes, wealth and

economic power.......The socialist pattern of society is not to be

regarded as some fixed or rigid pattern. It is not rooted in any

doctrine or dogma.......It is neither necessary nor desirable that

the economy should become a monolithic type of organisation offering little
play for experimentation either as to forms or as to modes of functioning.
Nor should expansion of the public sector mean centralization of decision-
making and of exercise of

authority...........The accent of the socialist pattern of society is on

the attainment of positive goals, the raising of living standards, the
enlargement of opportunities for all, the promotion of enterprise among the
disadvantaged classes and the creation of a sense of partnership among all
sections of the community. These positive goals provide the criteria for
basic decisions. The directive prin-ciples of State policy in the
Constitution have indicated the ap-proach in broad terms; the socialist
pattern of society is a more concretised expression of this approach.
Economic policy and institutional changes have to be planned in a manner
that would secure economic advance along democratic and egalitarian
lines........"
</p>
<p id="p_153">Mr. G.D.H. Cole, one of the leading socialist of U.K., in his speech 'The
Growth of Socialism" published in 'Law and Opinion in England in the 20th
Century' (Morris Ginsberg, Editor) at page 79-80, has stated that socialism
is a movement aiming at greater social and economic equality and using
extended State action as one of its methods, perhaps the most distinctive
but certainly not the only one needed to be taken into account. The affairs
of the community shall be so administered as to further the common
interests of ordinary men and women by giving to everyone, as far as
possible, an equal opportunity to live a satisfactory and contended
existence, coupled with a belief that such opportunity is incompatible with
the essentially unequal private ownership of the means of production. It
requires not merely collective control of the uses to which these are to be
put, but also their collective ownership and disinterested administration
for the common benefit. This basic idea of socialism involves not only the
socialisation of the essential instruments of production, in the widest
sense, but also the abolition of private incomes which allow some men to
live without rendering or having rendered any kind of useful service to
their fellowmen and also the sweeping away of forms of educational
preference and monopoly which divide men into social classes. It involves,
in effect whatever is needful for the establishment of what socialists call
a 'classless society' and in pursuance of this aim its votaries necessarily
look lor support primarily, though not exclusively, to the working classes,
who form the main body of the less privileged under the existing social
order. Socialists seek to reduce economic and social inequalities not only
in order to remove unearned sources of superior position and influence, but
also in order to narrow the gaps between men to such as are compatible with
all men being near enough together in ways of living to be in substance
equals in their mutual intercourse.
</p>
<p id="p_154">In Excel Wear Etc. v. Union of India &amp; Ors., [1979] 1 SCR 1009, the
Constitution Bench had held at pages 1030-31 that the concept of socialism
or socialist state has undergone changes from time to time from country to
country and from thinker to thinker. But some basic concept still holds the
field. The doctrinaire approach to the problem of socialism be eschewed and
the pragmatic one should be adapted. So long as the private ownership of an
industry is recognised and governs an overwhelmingly large propor-tions of
an economic structure, it.is not possible to say that principles of
socialism and social justice can be pushed to such an extreme so as to
ignore completely or to a very large extent the interest of another section
of the public, namely, the private ownership of the undertaking. In other
words, the object of intermediation should be co-existence and flourishing
of mixed economy. <a href="/doc/1474119/" id="a_182">In State of Kamataka v. Shri Ranganatha Reddy &amp; Anr</a>.
Etc., [1978] 1 SCR 641, a Bench of nine Judges of this Court considered
nationalisation of the contract carriages. In that behalf, it was held that
one of the principal aims of socialism is the distribution of the material
resour-ces of the community in such a way as to subserve the common good.
This principle is embodied under <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_183">Article 39(b)</a> of the Constitution as one
of the essential directive principles of State polity. Therein, this Court
laid stress on the word 'distribute' as used in <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_184">Article 39(b)</a> being a key-
word of the provision emphasising that The key word is distribution and the
genius of the Article, if we may say so., cannot but be given full play as
it fulfils the basic purpose of restructuring the economic order. Each word
in this Article has a strategic role and the whole Article is a social
mission. It embraces the entire material resources of the community. Its
task is to distribute such resources, its goal is to undertake distribution
as best to subserve the common good. It reorganises by such distribution
the owner-ship and control."

<p id="p_155"><a href="/doc/1195357/" id="a_185">In Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.,
[1983] 1 SCR 1000 another Constitution Bench reiterated the above view;
while considering <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_186">Article 39(b)</a> of the Constitution, at page 1020, this
Court had held that the broad egalitarian principle of economic justice was
implicit in every directive principle and, therefore, a law designed to
promote a directive principle, even if it came into conflict with the
formalistic and doctrinaire view of equality before the law, would most
certainly advance the broader egalitarian principle and desirable
constitutional goal of social and economic justice for all. If the law was
aimed at the broader egalitarianism of the Directive Principles, <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_187">Article
31C</a> protected the law from needless, unending and rancorous debate on the
question whether the law contravened <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_188">Article 14'</a>s concept of the equality
before the law. The law seeking the immunity afforded by <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_189">Article 31C</a> must
be a law directing the policy of the State towards securing a Directive
Principle and the connection with the Directive Principle must not be some
remote or tenuous connection. The object of the nationalisation of the coal
mine is to distribute nations resources. It was held at page 1023 that
though the word 'socialist' was introduced in the Preamble by late
amendment of the Constitution, that socialism has always been the goal is
evident from the Directive principles of the State policy. The amendment
was only to emphasise the urgency. Ownership, control and distribution of
national productive wealth for the benefit and use of the community and the
rejection of a system of misuse of its resources for selfish ends is what
socialism is about and the words and thought of <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_190">Article 39(b)</a> but echo the
familiar language and philosophy of socialism as expounded generally by all
socialist writers. Socialism is, first of all, a protest against the
material and cultural poverty inflicted by capitalism on the mass of the
people. Nationalisation of coal mine for distribution was upheld as a step
towards socialism. In State of Tamil Nadu Etc. Etc. v. L. Abu Kavur Bai &amp;
Ors, Etc., [1984] 1 SCR 725, the same extended meaning of distribution of
material resources in <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_191">Article 39(b)</a> was given by another constitution Bench
to uphold Tamil Nadu State Carriages and Contract Carriages (Acquisition)
Act. Similar view was reiterated by a three Judge Bench in Madhusudan Singh
&amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors., [1984] 2 SCC 381. In Air India case the
concept of socialism was elaborated and applied to fill in the gaps of the
Act to regularise the services of the contract labourers in the
establishments of Air India.
</p>
<p id="p_156">It is an established rule of interpretation that to establish Socialist
Secular Democratic Republic, the basic structure under the rule of law,
pragmatic broad and wide interpretation of the Constitution makes social
and economic democracy with liberty, equality of opportunity, equality of
status and fraternity a reality to "we, the people of india", who would
include the Scheduled Tribes. All State actions should be to reach the
above goal with this march under rule of law. The interpretation of the
words 'person' 'regulation' and 'distribution' require to be broached
broadly to elongate socio-economic justice to the tribals. The word
'regulates' in para (2)(b) of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution and
the title of the Regulation would not only control allotment of land to the
Tribes in Scheduled area but also prohibits transfer of private or
Government's land in such areas to the non-tribals. While later clause (a)
achieves the object of prohibiting transfer inter vivos fay tribals to the
non-tribals or non-tribals inter se, the first clauses includes the State
Government or being an juristic person integral scheme of para 5(2) of
Schedule, The Regulation seeks to further achieve the object of declaring
with a presumptive evidence that the land in the Scheduled Areas belongs to
the Scheduled Tribes and any transfer made to a non-tribal shall always be
deemed to have been made by a tribal unless the transferee establish the
contra. It also prohibits transfer of the land in any form known to law and
declared such transfer as void except by way of testamentary disposition by
a tribal to his kith and kin/tribal or by partition among them. The
regulation and its predecessor law in operation in the respective areas
regulate transfer between a tribal and non-tribal with prior permission of
the designated officer as a condition precedent to prevent exploitation of
the tribals. If a tribal is unwilling to purchase land from a non-tribal,
the State Government is enjoined to purchase the land from a non-tribal as
per the principles set down in the regulations and to distribute the same
to a tribal or a cooperative society composed solely of tribals.

<p id="p_158"><a href="/doc/645212/" id="a_192">Section 105</a> of the Transfer of Property Act defines 'lease' as a transfer
of right to enjoy immovable property made by the transferor to the
transferee for a certain period, express or implied, for consideration of
price paid or promised etc. to the transferor by the transferee who,accepts
the transfer on such terms. Thereby the lease creates a right or an
interest in enjoyment of the demised property on terms and conditions
contained therein to remain in possession thereof for the duration of the
period of lease unless it is determined in accordance with the contract or
the statute. It is an encumbrance on the right to be in possession; use and
enjoyment of the land by the transferee. Lease is the outcome of separation
of ownership and possession. It may be either rightful or wrongful. If it
is rightful, it is an encumbrance on the owner's title but if it is
wrongful the transferee acquires no lawful right to enjoy the interest
therein. <a href="/doc/1547653/" id="a_193">Section 11(5)</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and

being empowered to operate the Regulation, by implication, the Regulation
does not apply to Government land per force, is untenable in view of the
above unambiguous constitutional, legislative and executive policy. The
further contention that there is no need for its incorporation and that the
Government would be prohibited from transferring for public purpose, is
untenable. They do not detract from legal reasoning and purposive
interpretation. The transfer of such land for a public purpose, viz., to
construct a hospital or to set up a bank by the Government or its
instrumentalities and for any public purpose etc., is not prohibited for
two reasons, namely, (i) there is no transfer of interest in the Government
land in favour of a non-tribal; (ii) there is no transfer of its land in
law to itself. The contention, therefore, that the Regulation prohibits
transfer of Government land for its public purpose is unsus-tainable. The
further contention that even philonthrophic persons imbued with social zeal
and spirit to ameliorate the social status and economic position of the
tribals, would also be prevented to serve them is untenable. What the
Regulation prohibits is the transfer of right, title and interest in the
immovable property in scheduled area in favour of non-tribals. There is no
prohibition on non-tribals philonthrophist to organise, though tribals and
a Cooperative Society composed solely of tribals, actions to ameliorate
socio-economic status of the tribals in the Scheduled Area. The further
contention that the rich mineral wealth being a national asset cannot be
kept unexploited which is detrimental to the national development, is
devoid of force. Instead of getting the minerals it exploited through non-
tribals, by exploitation of tribals, the minerals could be exploited
through an appropriate scheme, without disturbing ecology and forest, by
the tribals themselves, either individually or through Cooperative
Societies composed solely of the tribes with the financial assistance of
the State or its instrumentalities. It would itself would be an opportunity
to the tribals to improve their social and economic status and a source of
their economic endowment and empowerment and would give them dignity of
person, social and economic status and an opportunity to improve their
excellence. In the Constituent Assembly, a demand was made for allotment of
mining areas in North-Eastern States to the autonomous bodies; the
Constituent Assembly instead approved payment of royalty. At many a place,
the minerals deposits may be situated in tribal area. In the light of the
language used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_198">Section 3</a> of the Regulation and Section 11(5) of Mining
Act, we have examined the question taking aid of the source thereof, i.e.,
para 5(2)(a) and (b) of the Fifth Schedule and interpreted the word
'person' to include State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_165">The object of Fifth and Sixth Schedules to the Constitution, as seen
earlier, is not only to prevent acquisition, holding or disposal of the
land in Scheduled Areas by the non-tribals from the tribals or alienation
of such land among non-tribals inter se but also to ensure that the tribals
remain in possession and enjoyment of the lands in Scheduled areas for
their economic empowerment, social status and dignity of their person.
Equally exploitation of mineral resources national wealth undoubtedly, is
for the development of the nation. The competing rights of tribals and the
State are required to be adjusted without defeating rights of either. The
Gover-nor is empowered, as a constitutional duty, by legislative and
executive action, to prohibit acquiring, holding and disposing of the land
by non-tribals in the Scheduled Areas. The Cabinet, while exercising its
power under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_199">Article 298</a>, should equally be cognizant to the constitutional
duty to protect and empower the tribals. Therefore, the Court is required
to give effect to the constitutional mandate and legislative policy of
total prohibition on the transfer of the land in Scheduled area to non-
tribals.

the Governor being the head of the Executive to sanction transfer of its
lands. Since the Executive is enjoined to protect social, economic and
educational interest of the tribals and when the State leases out the lands
in the Scheduled Areas to the non- tribals for exploitation of mineral
resources, it transmits the corelative above constitutional duties and
obligation to those who undertake to exploit the natural resources should
also to improve social, economic and educational empowerment of the
tribals. As a part of the administration of the project, the licensee or
lessee should incur the expenditure for:
</p>
<p id="p_168">(a)    re-forestation and maintenance of ecology in the Scheduled Areas;

<p id="p_169">(b)    maintenance of roads and communication facilities in the Scheduled

</p>
<p id="p_171">(e)    providing employment to the tribals according to their

</p>
<p id="p_175">In this behalf, at least 20 per cent of the net profits should be set apart
as a permanent fund as a part of industrial/business activity for
establishment and maintenance of water resources, schools, hospitals,
sanitation and transport facilities by laying roads etc. This 20%
allocation would not include the expenditure for re-forestation and
maintenance of ecology. It is needless to mention that necessary sanction
for exemption of said amount from income-tax liability, may be obtained;
and the Centre should ensure grant of such exemption and see that these
activities are undertaken, carried on and maintained systematically and
continuously. The above obligations and duties, should be undertaken and
discharged by each and every person/industry/licensee/lessee concerned so
that the con-stitutional objectives of social, economic and human resource
empowerment of the tribals could be achieved and peace and good government
is achieved in Scheduled Areas. We have not examined the other Acts in
detail but as and when such need arises, they may be examined in the light
of the language used therein and the law.
</p>
<p id="p_176">Mining lease of Government land is whether outside the Regulation.
</p>
<p id="p_177">The question then is whether grant of mining leases lands in the Scheduled
Areas belonging to the Government is outside the purview of the Regulation?
In the light of the aforestated discussion and the con-clusion that the
word 'person' would include the State Government, the necessary corollary
would be that the transfer of the land in Scheduled Area by way of lease,
for mining purpose in favour of non-tribals stands prohibited by para 5{2)
</p><p id="p_178">(b) of the Fifth Schedule read with <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_208">Section 3</a> of the Regulation. It is on
record that the non-tribals individuals have transferred their lease hold
interest in the mining leases in favour of some of the respondent-
companies. The Government stands prohibited to transfer the mining leases
to Corporation aggregate etc. except to its instrumentality. The lease
being a transfer of an interest in the land or a right to enjoy such
property during subsistence of lease, its transfer stands prohibited. It is
well settled position of law, by catena of decisions of this Court, that
renewal of lease is in reality a fresh grant of lease, though it is called
a renewal because it postulates the existence of a prior lease. It has been
brought out from record that some of the respondents-companies have got
transfer of mining lease in their favour from the individual lessees. This
Court in <a href="/doc/663097/" id="a_209">M/s. Victoria Granites (P) Ltd. v. P. Rama Rao &amp; Ors., JT</a> (1996) 9
SC 303 has held that the transfer of mining leases by an individual in
favour of a company is void and in effect, would defeat the object of
<a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_210">Article 39(b)</a> of the Constitution and would nullify the object of
distributive justice of the largess of the State to accord economic justice
to individuals to improve socio-economic status and to secure dignity of
persons. Therefore, the transfer of lease or renewal of mining lease in
favour of some of the respondents is void as it defeats the constitutional
and statutory objectives.
</p>
<p id="p_179">It is seen that in one case, the transfer was claimed to have been made in
favour of the State instrumentalities, i.e., A.P.S.M.D. Corporation Ltd. It
has already been held that transfer of the Government land in favour of its
instrumentalities, in the eye of law, is not a transfer but one of
entrustment of its property for public purpose. Since, admittedly, a public
Corporation acts in public interest and not for private gain, such transfer
stands excluded from the prohibition under para 5(2)(b) of the Fifth
Schedule and <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_211">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the Regulation, Such transfer or lease,
therefore, stands upheld. But a transfer of mining leases to non-tribal
natural persons or company, corporation aggregate or partnership firm etc.
is unconstitutional, void and inoperative.
</p>
<p id="p_180">The A.P.S.M.D. is required to exploit minerals in conformity with law,
namely, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_212">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980, E.P. Act etc.

ENCLOSURES -  WHETHER  GOVERNMENT CAN LEASE  THE LANDS TO MINING OPERATION

It is an admitted position that five enclosures comprise of 426 acres of
land occupied by the tribals in those villages. Re- survey started in 1990
jointly by Revenue, Forest and Mining Departments and was completed and the
report was made on August 2, 1990. Though 14 villages with five enclosures
were notified as Borra reserved forest in GOMs No. 2997 F &amp; A dated October
31, 1966, they stood excluded from reserved forest area. Therefore, the
lands in the enclosures being cultivated by the tribals are their patta
lands and are entitled to get pattas by the concerned officers. It is
conceded on behalf of the respondents that the Government have no power to
grant raining leases for these lands situated within the enclosures.
</p>
<p id="p_181">WHETHER LEASES ARE IN VIOLATION OF F.C. ACT OR E.P. ACT

In the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the Government, it is conceded
that major part of the lands to which mining leases were granted are
situated in reserved forest. It has already been held that transfer of
lands situated within scheduled area to mm- tribals is void. It is stated
that a part of the land covered by some mining leases is outside the
reserved forest. The question, therefore, arises: whether these areas are
forest? A controversy has been raised by the respondents that unless the
lands are declared either as a reserved forest or forest under the Andhra
Pradesh Forest Act, 1967, the F.C. Act has no application. Thereby, there
is no prohibition to grant mining lease or renewal thereof by the State
Govern-ment. The need for prior approval of the Central Government is not,
therefore, necessary. Prior to the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967, the
Madras Forest Act, 1882 was in force. For declaration of reserved forest
for the purpose of the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_213">Central Forest Act</a> or a State act, the set scheme
has been devised, namely, publication in the State Gazette constituting any
land as a reserved forest specifying its situation, its limits and a
declaration constituting such land as reserved forest. A Forest Settlement
Officer gets appointed to consider the objections, if any, from the persons
claiming any right, title and interest in any land covered by the
notification. Pending consideration thereof, provisions exist in the
respective Acts prohibiting clearance of the forest or deforestation of the
forest or depletion of forest wealth and resultant consequences. After
consideration of objections, if any, and rejection of the objections and
claims, subject to preserving the easmentary right of way, water course or
use of water or right to pastures or right to forest produce, the Forest
Settlement Officer would determine the right of parties and would direct
the concerned department to pay compensation determined on the basis of the
principles laid in the Act with a right of appeal thereon. Thereafter, a
declaration would duly be publish-ed in the Gazette with fixed boundaries
that the "aforesaid area are a reserve forest". Similar is the provision
and procedure in the Wild Life Sanctuary under <a href="/doc/1781078/" id="a_214">Wild Life (Protection) Act</a>,
1972, Therein too, provisions have been made declaring them as sanctuary
for preservation and protection of wild life etc. However, the right to
residence and right to collect forest produce, forest goods or agriculture
etc. to the tribals is regulated under the appropriate provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_182">The words 'forest' or 'forest land' have not been defined in the <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_215">A.P. Act</a>
or the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_216">Central Forest Act</a>. In collins English Dictionary (1979 Edn.) the
word 'forest' has been defined as page 568 as "a large wooded area having a
thick growth of trees and plants, the trees of such an area, something
resembling a large wooded area especially in density''. Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary defines 'forest' as "an extensive tract of land covered
with trees and undergrowth, sometimes intermingled with pasture". In
Webster's comprehensive Dictionary (International Edn.) at page 495,
'forest' has been defined as "a large tract of land covered with a natural
growth of trees and underbrush, in English Law wild land generally belong-
ing to the crown and kept for the protection of game, Of, pertaining to, or
inhabiting woods or forest. To overspread or plant with trees; make a
forest of. The 'forest cover' means "The sum total of vegetation in a
forest; more especially, herbs, shrubs and the litter of leaves, branches".
'Forest reserve' for the different manners 'a tract of forest land set
aside by Government order for protection and cultivation". According to
Stroud's Judicial Dic-tionary (fifth ed.), Vol. 2, at page 1014 'forest'
means "a place privileged by royal authority or by prescription for the
peaceable abiding and nourishment of the beats or birds of the forest, for
resort of the King; a subject may hold a forest by grant from the crown; by
the grant of a forest in a man's own ground, not only the privilege but the
land itself passes; within the bounds and within the regard". Black's law
Dictionary (6th Edn.) defines 'forest' at page 649 as 'A tract of land
covered with trees and one usually of considerable extent". Chambers's
Twentieth Century Dictionary defines the expression forest at page 415 as
'a large uncultivated tract of land covered with trees and underwood: woody
ground and rude pasture"
</p>
<p id="p_183">It would thus be seen that 'forest' bears extended meaning of a tract of
land covered with trees, shrubs, vegetation and undergrowth inter-mingled
with trees with pastures, be it of natural growth or manmade forestation.
The FC Act, as amended by 1988 Act was enacted to check deforestation and
conservation of forest. Sub-section (2) with a non-obstante clause on
deforestation of forest or use of forest land for non-forest purposes;
regulates the forest and provides that notwithstanding any other law for
the time being in force in the State, no State Government or other
authority shall make, except with prior approval of the Central Government,
</p><p id="p_184">(i) any order directing that any reserved forest or any portion thereof
shall cease to be a reserved forest, (ii) that any forest land or portion
thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose; (iii) that any forest land
or any portion thereof may be assigned, by way of lease or otherwise, to
any private person or to any authority or corporation, agency or any other
organisation, not owned, managed or controlled by the Government, (iv) that
any forest land or any portion thereof may be cleared or trees which have
grown natural in the land or portion for the purpose of using it for
reforestation. Clauses (iii) and (iv) were added by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_217">Amendment Act</a> 69 of
1988 w.e.f. December 19, 1988. The explanation thereto of non-forest
purpose was defined to mean the breaking up or clearing of any forest land

or portion thereof for the cultivation of.......but does not include any
work

relating to ancillary to conservation development and management of forest

and wild life, namely, establishment of check-posts, fire lines......or
other

like purposes. Section2, therefore, prohibits de-reservation of the forest
or use of any forest land for any non-forest purpose or assignment by way
of lease or otherwise of any portion of land to any private person other
than Government controlled or owned, organised or managed by the State
Government agency; it prohibits clearance of trees or natural growth in the
forest land or any portion thereof to use it for reforestation, except for
preservation. Breaking up or clearance of forest land or a portion thereof
is amplified to be of non-forest purpose. The object of the F.C. Act is to
prevent any further deforestation which causes ecological imbalance and
leads to environmental degradation. It is, therefore, necessary for the
State Government to obtain prior permission of the Central Government for
(1) dereservation of forest; and (2) the use of forest land for non-forest
purpose. The prior approval of the Central Government, therefore, is a
condition precedent for such permission. The State Governments are enjoined
by FC Act, with power coupled with duty, to obtain prior approval of the
Central Government. The leases/renewal or leases otherwise are good.
</p>
<p id="p_185"><a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_218">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short, the 'EP Act') was
enacted to protect and improve environment and prevention of hazards to
human beings, other living creatures, lands and property. Section 3 of EP
Act enjoins the Central Government that it should take such measures as it
deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting and improv-ing
the quality of the environment and preventing, controlling and abating
environmental pollution. It would, therefore, be clear that the meaning of
the expression 'forest land' in the respective Acts requires extended mean-
ing given so as to preserve forest land from deforestation to maintain
ecology and to prevent environmental degradation and hazardous effects on
right to life. <a href="/doc/27930439/" id="a_219">In Virender Gaur Ors. v. State of Haryana &amp; Ors</a>., [19951 2

amounting to violation of right to life assured by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_220">Article 21.</a> Hygienic and
environment are an integral facet of right to healthy life and it would be
impossible to live with human dignity without a humane and healthy
environment. Environmental protection, therefore, has now become a mat-ter
of grave concern for human existence. Promotion of environmental protection
implies maintenance of eco-friendly environment as a whole comprising of
man-made and the natural environment. It is, therefore, the duty of every
citizen and industry to conserve, and if it becomes inevitable to disturb
its existence, it is concomitant duty to reforest and restore forestation;
duty of the State to coordinate with all concerned and should ensure
adequate measures to promote, protect and improve both man-made, natural
environment floura and founa as well as bio-diversity.

regarding environmental upkeep and cognizance of ecological importance had
in recent times entered into governmental activities. The EP Act protects
to upkeep forest land or reserved forest, prevents deforestation,
encourages forestation and takes steps as are necessary to preserve
ecology. In paragraph 23, it was held that mining activity was held
uncongenial to ecology and environment. Trees are friends of mankind and
forests arc inevitable necessity for human existence, healthy living and
the civilisation to thrive and flourish. The need of protection and
preservation of forests is fundamental duty of every citizen and all
persons in comprehensive sense, i.e., juristic as well. The problem of
forest preservation and protec-tion was no more to be separated from the
life style of tribals. The approach required is shift from the dependence
on law and executive implementation to dependence on the conscious and
voluntary participa-tion of all persons. Maintenance of ecology is the
primary duty of the Stale to prevent any further degradation of the ecology
and environment and equally is the duty of every citizen. All persons
conjointly should allow regeneration of forest as an essential step for
healthy life. This Court in <a href="/doc/45508/" id="a_222">Chhetriya Pardushan Mukti Sangarsh Samiti v.

Particular, in Vellore Citizens case, this court had pointed out that the
sustainable development consists in preservation of the person without
compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their needs.
Sustainable development is a balancing concept between ecological
development and industrialisation. Therefore, with a view to improve the
quality of human life, while living within the carrying capacity of the
subordinate ecology system, sustainable development should be maintained by
the industry and the State should ensure environmental protection and
prevent degradation thereof. As a facet thereof, as the principle of "the
polluter pays", this Court awarded damages for causing deforestation and
directed development of eco-friendly environment.
</p>
<p id="p_187">Mining operations, though detrimental to forest growth, are part of layout
of the industry, provision should be made for investment or in-
frastructural planning to reforest the area; and to protect environment and
regenerate forest. The Ministry of Environment and Forest and all
Secretaries of all the State Governments holding charge of Forest Depart-
ments, have a duty to prevent mining operations affecting the forest. It is
significant to note that, whether mining operations are carried on within
the reserved forest or other forest area. It is their duty to ensure that
the industry or enterprise does not denude the forest to become a menace to
human consistence nor a source to destroy flora and fauna and biodiversity.
The provisions of the FC Act get attracted to ensure preservation of
forest. In Garwal case, this Court, prohibited mining operations. <a href="/doc/104313664/" id="a_233">In Rural

later case, two Judges Bench applied provisions of EC Act and EP Act and
held that the application of sustainable development requires that
appropriate assessment should be made of the forest wealth and the
establishment of industries based on forest produce; other working should
also be monitored closely to maintain the required ecological balance. No
distinc-tion can be made between the Government forests and private forests
in the matter of forest wealth of the nation and in the matter of

In M/s. Victorian Granites case, sub-lease of the mining leases, even with
prior approval and grant by the State Government, was held to be illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_189">It is seen from the evidence that the mining leases were granted by the
State Government or were transferred and re transferred with the sanction
of the State Government from private individuals to juristic per-sons, the
partnership firms or companies. The lands with mining area are situated
either in the reserved forest or forest land or within the Scheduled Area.
Therefore, all the mining leases or renewals thereof are in violation of
the Fifth Schedule. Equally, mining leases/renewals of mining leases by the
State Government are in violation of the Regulation 3(l)(a) read with
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_243">Section 3(2)</a> of the Regulation and F.C. Act. Therefore, they are all void.
</p>
<p id="p_190">Shri Sudhir Chandra in his written submissions has stated that in respect
of the lands leased to the 19th respondent, a sum of Rs. 350 crores has
been invested for manufacturing of "High Purity Sea Water" magnified by
using 100% import high technology. The said product saves annually 70
crores of foreign exchange. It is essential for modernisation of steel
industry. The product also has wide application for major core industry
saving large foreign exchange for the country. He has also stated that the
mining operations are carried on in plain area only and thereby forest area
is not affected. However, since these averments have been made for the
first time in the written submissions, after Court reserved its decision,
we are deprived of the advantage of having the response of the State
Govern-ment, which in fact, has not taken any active interest in this
litigation. We, therefore, feel it necessary that the Chief Secretary of
the Andhra Pradesh State should constitute a committee consisting of
himself, Secretary (In-dustry), Secretary (Forest), Secretary (Tribal
Welfare/Social Welfare) to have the factual information collected and
consider whether it is feasible to permit the industry to carry on mining
operations. If the Committee so opines, the matter may be placed before a
Cabinet sub-Committee consisting of Minister, Minister for Industries,
Minister for Forests and Minister of Tribal Welfare to examine the issue
whether licences could be allowed to continue until they expire by efflux
of time or whether is expedient to prohibit further mining operations in
the light of <a href="/doc/1724061/" id="a_244">Section 11</a> (5) of the Mining Act, to take appropriate action
in that behalf and submit report to this Court on the actions so taken.
</p>
<p id="p_191">In cases where the similar Acts in other Stales do not totally prohibit
grant of mining leases of the lands in the Scheduled Area, similar
Committee of Secretaries and State Cabinet sub- Committees should be
constituted and decision taken thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_192">Before granting leases, it would be obligatory for the State Government to
obtain concurrence of the Central Government which would, for this purpose,
constitute a sub-Committee consisting of the Prime Minister of India, Union
Minister for Welfare, Union Minister for Environment so that the States
Policy would be consistent with the policy of the nation as a whole.
</p>
<p id="p_193">It would also be open to the appropriate legislature, preferably after a
thorough debate/conference of all the Chief Ministers, Ministers holding
the concerned Ministry and the Prime Minister and the Central Ministers
concerned, to take a policy decision so as to bring about a suitable
enactment in the light of the guidelines laid down above so that there
would emerge a consistent scheme throughout the country, in respect of the
tribal lands under which national wealth in the form of minerals, is
located.
</p>
<p id="p_194">The State Government, therefore, is directed to ensure that all concerned
industrialists, be they natural or juristic person stop forthwith mining
operations within the scheduled area, except where the lease has been
granted to the State Undertaking, i.e., A.P.S.M.D. Corporation; they should
report compliance of this order to the Registry of this Court within six
months of the receipt of this judgment. The lessees of mining leases are
directed not to break fresh mines; however, in the meanwhile, they are
entitled to remove the minerals already extracted and stocked in the
reserved forest area within four months time from today. All concerned
authorities are directed to ensure compliance thereof. Even the State
Undertaking carrying the mining operations, would be subject to the
regulations under the FC Act and EP Act. It would be open to the State
Government to organise Co-operative Societies composed solely of the
Scheduled Tribes to exploit mining operations within the Scheduled area
subject to the compliance of the FC Act and EP Act.
</p>
<p id="p_195">The appeals of Samatha are accordingly allowed. The Judgment of the High
Court stands set aside and directions are issued accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_196">The appeal of Hyderabad Abrasives and Minerals (P) Ltd. stands dismissed
since their licence has already expired by efflux of time and grant of
renewal is prohibited under F.C. Act and Section 11(5) of the Mining Act.
No costs.

<p id="p_197">S. SAGHIR AHMAD, J. Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_198">I have the advantage of going through the Judgments prepared separately by
Esteemed Brothers Ramaswamy and Pattanaik. I am inclined to agree with
Brother Ramaswamy, for the reasons which I am presently setting out
hereinbelow.
</p>
<p id="p_199">Tribals were the first settlers in this country but they were gradually
pushed back to the forests and hills by subsequent settlers who were non-
tribals. The forests and hills provided a natural barrier and isolated the
tribals from people living on the plains. On account of their isolation,
they remained illiterate, uneducated, unsophisticated, poor and destitute
and developed their own society where they allowed themselves to be
governed by their own primitive and customary laws and rituals.
</p>
<p id="p_200">2.  Successive governments who ruled India from medieval times to modern
times (British Period) allowed these tribals and aboriginals to live in
complete isolation and allowed them to follow their own traditional
culture, social customs and animistic tribal faiths. There were many
dangers in subjecting them to normal laws and they were, therefore,
governed by special laws.
</p>
<p id="p_201">3. The Tribal Areas or Agency Areas of the Madras Presidency were governed
by Gunjam and Vizagapatnam Act of 1839. Then came the Scheduled Districts
Act 14 of 1874 which was followed by the Agency Tracts and Land Transfer
Act, 1 of 1917. <a href="/doc/989772/" id="a_245">Section 4(1)</a> and (2) of this Act provided as under :
</p>
<p id="p_202">"4(1). Notwithstanding any rule of law or enactment to the con-trary, any
transfer of immovable property situated within the agen-cy Tracts by a
member of a hill tribes shall be absolutely null and void unless made in
favour of another members of a hill tribe, or with the previous consent in
writing of the Agent or of any other prescribed officer.
</p>
<p id="p_203">(2) Where a transfer of property is made in contravention of sub-section
(1), the Agent or any other prescribed Officer may on application by any
one interested, decree ejectment against any person in possession of the
property claiming under the transfer and may restore it to the transferor
or his heirs."
</p>
<p id="p_204">4.  Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the administration of the
Scheduled Districts was exclusively vested in the Governor of the Province.
Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 92 of the Government of India Act, 1935
provided as under :
</p>
<p id="p_205">"92. (1) The executive authority of a Province extends to excluded and
partially excluded areas therein, but, notwithstanding anything in this
Act, no Act of the Dominion Legislature or of the Provincial Legislature
shall apply to an excluded area or a partially excluded area, unless the
Governor by public notification so directs, and the Governor in giving such
a direction with respect to any Act may direct that the Act shall in its
application to the area, or to any specified part thereof, have effect
subject to such exceptions or modifications a.s he thinks fit.
</p>
<p id="p_206">(2) The Governor may make regulations for the peace and good government of
any area in a Province which is for the time being an excluded area, or a
partially excluded area, and any regulations so made may repeal or amend
any Act of the Dominion Legisla-ture, or of the Provincial Legislature, or
any existing Indian Law, which is for the time being applicable to the area
in question. Regulations made under this sub-section shall be submitted
forthwith to the Governor-General and until assented to by him shall have
no effect."
</p>
<p id="p_207">5.   In B. Shiva Rao's Study Volume of The Framing of India's Constitution"
it is stated as under :
</p>
<p id="p_208">"There were two dangers to which subjection to normal laws would have
specially exposed these peoples, and both arose out of the fact that they
were primitive people, simple, unsophisticated and frequently improvident.
There was a risk of their agricultural land passing to the more civilized
section of the population, and the occupation of the tribals was for the
most part agricultural : and, secondly, they were likely to get into the
"wiles of the moneylender", the primary aim of government policy then was
to-protect them from these two dangers and preserve their tribal customs;
and this was achieved by prescribing special procedures applicable to these
backward areas. At first individual laws were enacted, applicable to
particular areas, which, among other things, prescribed simple and elastic
forms of judicial administrative pro-cedures. The Scheduled Districts Act,
enacted in 1874, appears to have been the first measure adopted to deal
with these areas as a class. <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_246">That Act</a> enabled the executive to extend any
enactment in force in any part of Birtish India to a "scheduled district"
with such modifications as might be considered necessary. In other words,
the executive had power to execlude these areas from the normal operation
of ordinary law and give them such protection as they might need.
</p>
<p id="p_209">The Montagu-Chelmsford Report of 1918 contained a brief reference to these
areas : it suggested that the political reforms contemplated for the rest
of India could not apply to these back-ward areas where the people were
primitive and "there was no material on which to found political
institutions". The typically backward tracts were therefore to be excluded
from the jurisdic-tion of the reformed Provincial Governments and
administered personally by the heads of the Provinces. In the Government of
India Act of 1919 these tracts were divided into two categories. Some areas
were considered so backward that they were wholly excluded from the scope
of the reforms. The effect of this was that neither the Central nor the
Provincial Legislature had power to make laws applicable to these areas and
the power of legislation was vested in the Governor acting with his
Executive Council, the Ministers being excluded from having any share in
the respon-sibility for the administration of these areas. Proposals for
expen-diture in these tracts were not required to be submitted to the vote
of the Legislative Assembly; and no question could be asked and no subject
relating to any of these tracts could be discussed in the Assembly without
the Governor's sanction."
</p>
<p id="p_210">6. It is further stated as under :
</p>
<p id="p_211">"The object of Government policy in relation to these areas, inhabited by
backward, tribal and aboriginal populations, was clearly visualized by the
Simon Commission. Until then the aim had primarily been to give the
primitive inhabitants of these areas security of land tenure, freedom in
the pursuit of their traditional means of livelihood, and a reasonable
exercise of their ancestral customs : not self- determination or rapid
political advance, but experienced and sympathetic handling and protection
from economic subjugation by their neighbours. The Commission realized that
perpetual isolation from the main currents of progress would not be a
satisfactory long-term solution : and that it would be necessary to educate
these people ultimately to become self-reliant. In this direction
practically nothing had been achieved. The Commission observed :
</p>
<p id="p_212">The responsibility of Parliament for the backward tracts will not be
discharged merely by securing to them protection from exploitation and by
preventing those outbreaks which have from time to time occurred within
their borders. The principle duty of the administration is to educate these
people to stand on their own feet, and this is a process which has scarcely
begun.
</p>
<p id="p_213">The Commission recognized this problem to be one of consid-erable magnitude
and complexity. On the one hand it was loo large a task to be left to the
efforts of missionary societies and individual officials, since
coordination of activity and adequate funds were required. On the other
hand the typically backward tract was deficit area and "no provincial
legislature (was) likely to possess either the will or the means to devote
special attention to its particular requirements". In these circumstances
the Commission recommended that the responsibility for the backward classes
would be adequately discharged only if it was entrusted to the Centre. It
was recognized that it would not be a practicable arrangement if
centralization of administrative authority in these areas led to a
situation in which these areas would be separated from the Provinces of
which they were an integral part : and in order to meet this difficulty the
Commission suggested that even though there would be a central
responsibility, the backward tracts should not be separated from the
Provinces but that the Central Government should use the Governors as
degree of backwardness, it could be laid down by rules how far the degree
of backwardness, it could be laid down by rules how far the Governor would
act in consultation with his Ministers in the discharge of these agency
duties. The proposal for centralizing the administration of these areas was
however not adopted in the constitutional reforms of 1935. Under the
Government of India Act of 1935, these backward areas were classified as
excluded areas and partially excluded areas. A small number of excluded
areas-the total extent of these was about 18,600 square miles in Assam and
10,000 square miles in the rest of Imlia-in the Provinces of Madras,
Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, the Punjab and Assam, were placed
under the personal rule of the Governor acting in this discretion : and
while partially excluded areas were within the field of ministerial
responsibility, the Governors exercised a special responsibility in respect
of the administration of these areas; and they had the power in their
individual judgment to overrule their Ministers if they thought fit to do
so. <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_247">No Act</a> of the Federal or Provincial Legislature would apply to any of
these areas : but the Governors had the authority to apply such Acts with
such modifications as they considered necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_214">In addition to these excluded and partially excluded areas, there were in
the territory of India certain 'tribal areas", which were defined in the
Government of India Act, 1935, as "areas along the frontiers of India or in
Baluchistan which are not part of British India or of Burma or of any
Indian State or of any foreign State". The position of these areas was even
more peculiar. In terms of the definition they did not form part of the
territory of British India and neither the Parliament of Britain nor the
Legislatures of British India claimed or exercised any direct legislative
powers over these years. The powers exercisable in these areas were
described as arising out of "treaty, grant, usage, sufferance or otherwise"
and the Act of 1935 contained a specific authorization enabling these
powers to be exercised as part of the executive authority of the Central
Government, by the Governor-General acting in his discretion, and therefore
outside the area of responsibility of the Ministry."
</p>
<p id="p_215">7. It is further stated as under :
</p>
<p id="p_216">"The Cabinet Mission's statement of May 16, 1946, mentioned the excluded
and partially excluded areas and the tribal areas as requiring the special
attention of the Constituent Assembly, The Advisory Committee on
Fundamental Rights and Minorities, to be set up at the preliminary meeting
of the Assembly, was to contain due representation of all the interests
affected; and one of its functions was to report to the Constituent
Assembly on a scheme for the administration of tribal and excluded areas at
its meeting on February 27, 1947, the Advisory Committee set up three sub-
committees - one to consider the tribal and excluded and partially excluded
areas in Assam : one to consider the tribal areas in the North-West
Frontier Province and Baluchistan : and the third sub-committee to consider
the position of excluded and partially excluded areas in the Provinces
other than Assam."
</p>
<p id="p_217">8. The Sub-Committee on Assam submitted its report on 28th July, 1947 while
the other Sub-Committee on the Excluded and Partially Ex-cluded Areas other
than Assam submitted its interim report on 18.8.1947 and final report in
September, 1947. The Joint meeting of the two Sub-committees was held in
August, 1947. The Joint meeting summed up the problems as under :
</p>
<p id="p_218">"The areas inhabited by the tribes, whether in Assam or else-where, are
difficult of access, highly malarial and infested also in some cases by
other diseases like yaws and venereal disease and lacking in such
civilizing facilities as roads, schools, dispensaries and water supply. The
tribes themselves are for the most part extremely simple people who can be
and are exploited with ease by plainsfolk, resulting in the passage of land
formerly cultivated by them to money-lenders and other erstwhile non-
agriculturists. While a good number of superstitions and even harmful
practices are prevalent among them, the tribes have their own customs and
way of life with institutions like tribal and village panchayats or
councils which are very effective in smoothing village administra-tion. The
sudden disruption of the tribals' customs and ways by exposure to the
impact of a more complicated and sophisticated manner of life is capable of
doing great harm. Considering past experience and the strong temptation to
take advantage of the tribals' simplicity and weaknesses; it is essential
to provide statutory safeguards for the protection of the land which is the
mainstay of the aboriginal's economic life and for his customs and
institutions which, apart from being his own, contain elements of value",

</p><p id="p_219">9. It would be useful at this stage to reproduce further the two passages
from Shri Rao's Book relating to the recommendations :
</p>
<p id="p_220">"From the beginning the objectives of the Government's policy in regard to
the tribes and tribal areas were primarily directed to the preservation of
their social customs from sudden erosion and to safeguarding their
traditional vocations without the danger of their being pauperized by
exploitation by the more sophisticated elements of the population. At the
same time it was recognized that this stage of isolation could not last
indefinitely : a second and major objective was therefore laid down, that
their educational level and standard of living should be raised in order
that they might in course of time be assimilated with the rest of the
popula-tion. From this point of view the sub-committee was of the opinion
that the policy of exclusion and partial exclusion had not yielded much
tangible result in the progress of the aboriginal areas towards the removal
of their backward condition or in their economic and educational
betterment. The sub-committee did not therefore find it advisable to
abolish the administrative distinction between the backward areas and the
rest of the country; and it recommended that while certain areas like
Sambalpur in Bihar and Angul in Orissa need no longer be treated
differently from the regularly administered areas, there were other areas
which needed a simplified type of administration to protect the aboriginal
people from exposure to the complicated machinery of the ordinary law
courts and save them from the clutches of the moneylender who took
advantage of their simplicity and illiteracy, deprived them of their
agricultural land, reduced them to a state of virtual serfdom. The general
position, according to the sub-committee, was that the areas predominantly
inhabited by tribal people should be known as "Scheduled Areas" (the
intention being that these areas should figure in a schedule to a
notification) and special administrative arrangements made in regard to
them.
</p>
<p id="p_221">At the same, time having found the treatment of exclusion and partial
exclusion to have proved a failure, the sub-committee recommended that the
responsibility for the betterment and wel-fare of these areas should be
squarely that of the Provincial Governments and that accordingly the
Governors should not have any special reserved or discretionary powers in
regard to these areas. But the ultimate responsibility was to be that of
the Centre, both for drawing up plans for the betterment of these areas and
for providing the necessary finances. In order to ensure that the
requirements of these areas were given full consideration, the sub-
committee recommended that the Constitution should provide for the setting
up in each Province of a body which would keep the Provincial Government
constantly in touch with the needs of the aboriginal tracts in particular
and with the welfare of the tribes in general. This body was to be known as
a Tribes Advisory Council, which it was proposed should have a strong
repre-sentation of the tribal element.
</p>
<p id="p_222">The Tribes Advisory Council would primarily advise the government in regard
to the application of laws to the Scheduled Area : no laws affecting the
following matters would apply if the Tribal Advisory Council considered
such a law unsuitable :
</p>
<p id="p_223">(1) Social matters; (2) occupation of land, including tenancy laws,
allotment of land and setting apart of land for village pur-poses; (3)
village management, including the establishment of village panchayats.
</p>
<p id="p_224">The provisions for the other States were more detailed. In their case, the
advisory body was known as the Tribes Advisory Council. The membership of
the Tribes Advisory Council in each of the States was to be between ten and
twenty- five, of whom three-fourths were to be elected representatives of
the Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the State as in the
case of the Punjab and the United Provinces; it was laid down as the duty
of the Tribes Advisory Council generally to advise the Government on all
matters pertaining to the administration of the Scheduled Areas and the
welfare of the tribes. The State Government was statutorily enjoined to
give effect to the advice of the council if it considered that an Act,
whether of Parliament or of the State Legislature, relating to the
following matters, was unsuitable for, or required modification in, its
application to a Scheduled Areas :
</p>
<p id="p_225">(a) marriage; (b) inheritance of property; (c) social customs of tribes;
</p><p id="p_226">(d) land, including rights of tenants, allotment of land and reservation
for any purpose; (e) village administration and village panchayats.
</p>
<p id="p_227">It was made obligatory that the Governor should act according to the advice
of the Tribes Advisory Council on the application of Acts relating to these
matters. He was not bound to accept the advice of the council on laws
relating to other matters. The State Government was also empowered to make
regulations applicable to a Scheduled Area after consulting the council. As
in the case of East Punjab and the United Provinces, such regulations would
make provision for the trial of offences other than those punishable with
death, transportation for life or imprisonment for five years or more; such
regulations could also provide for the trial of disputes "other than those
arising out of any such laws as may be defined in such regulations".
</p>
<p id="p_228">The transfer of land in a Scheduled Area from a tribal to a non-tribal was
forbidden; and the State Government was also prohibited from allotting
State land in a Scheduled Area to non-tribals except in accordance with
rules made after consulting the Tribes Advisory Council Likewise, if
advised by the council, the Governor was obliged to license moneylending,
prescribing such conditions as were considered necessary; and the breach of
these conditions would be an offence. In order that public attention might
be focussed on the development work carried out in these areas, the State
Government was required to show separately in its financial statement the
revenues and expenditure pertaining to these areas.
</p>
<p id="p_229">10. The Sub-Committee in its report with regard to the land in Tribal
(Scheduled) Area, provided as under :
</p>
<p id="p_230">"25, Land : The importance of protection for the land of the tribals has
been emphasised earlier. All tenancy legislation which has been passed
hitherto with a view to protecting the aboriginal has tended to prohibit
the alienation of the tribal's land to non-tribals. Alienation of any kind,
even to other tribals, may have to be prohibited or severely restricted
according to the different stages of advancement. We find however that
provincial Govern-ments are generally alive to this question and that
protective laws exist. We assume that these will continue to apply and as
we have made special provision to see that land laws are not altered to the
disadvantage of the tribal in future, we do not consider additional
restrictions necessary. As regards the allotment of new land for
cultivation or residence, however, we are of the view that the interests of
the tribal need, to be safeguarded in view of the increasing pressure on
land everywhere. We have provided accord-ingly that the allotment of vacant
land, belonging to the State in Scheduled Areas should not be made except
in accordance with special regulations made by the Government on the advice
of the Tribes Advisory Council."

<p id="p_231">

</p><p id="p_232">11.  In Part-II of Appendix C to this report, it was indicated as under :
</p>
<p id="p_233">"Vacant land in a Scheduled Area which is the property of the State shall
not be allotted to a non-tribal except in accordance with rules made by the
Provincial Government in consultation with the Tribes Advisory Council."
</p>
<p id="p_234">12.  The recommendations of the two Sub-Committees were not considered by
the Constituent Assembly in its Session in July, 1947, when the broad
principles of the Constitution were settled since, as explained by Dr.
Ambedkar, they were received too late. The Drafting Committee however,
considered these proposals at the stage of drafting and suitable provisions
including Schedule V &amp; VI were included in the Draft Constitu-tion of
February, 1948 in which it was indicated that the transfer of land in
Scheduled Area From Tribal to non-Tribal was forbidden; and the State
Government was also prohibited from allotting the State land in the
Scheduled Area to Non-Tribal except in accordance with the Rules which may
be made by the Governor after consulting the Tribes Advisory Council.

the Central Provinces and Berar, and Orissa. Clause 5 specified the laws
applicable to Scheduled Areas in those states. It provided as under :

<p id="p_253">17.  Part IV related to the State of East Punjab Clause 17 provided as
under :-
</p>
<p id="p_254">"(2) The Governor may also make regulations so as to prohibit the transfer
of any land in a scheduled area in the State by a member of the Scheduled
Tribes to any person who is not a member of the Scheduled Tribes.
</p>
<p id="p_255">(3) Any regulations made under this paragraph when promul-gated by the
Governor shall have the same force and effect as any Act of the appropriate
Legislature which applies to such area and has been enacted by virtue of
the powers conferred on that Legis-lature by this Constitution."
</p>
<p id="p_256">18. The important provision to be noticed is that although in respect of
States of Madras, Bombay, West Bengal, Bihar, the Central Provinces and
Berar, and Orissa, a total ban was placed on the transfer of land by a
member of the Scheduled Tribe to a person who is not a member of the
Scheduled Tribe, it was provided, so far as allotment of Government land
was concerned, that no land in a Scheduled Area could be allotted to or
settled with a Non-Tribal except in accordance with the rules made in that
behalf by the Governor after consulting the Tribes Advisory Council. This
indicated that if a rule was made by the the Governor in that regard, land
in a Scheduled Area which was vested in the Government, could be allotted
to the Non-Tribal. It is obvious that the powers of allotment could not be
exercised so long as the rules were not made.
</p>
<p id="p_257">19.  No provision, so far as allotment of Government land was con-cerned,
was made for the State of United Provinces and West Bengal for which the
only provision made was that the Governor may make regula-tions so as to
prohibit the transfer of land in a Scheduled Area by a member of the
Scheduled Tribe to any person who is not a member of the Scheduled Tribe.
</p>
<p id="p_258">20.  It also requires to be noticed that the Regulations made by the
Governor for all these States to which Schedule Fifth was applicable were
to have the same force and effect as an Act of the appropriate Legislature.
But this was not stated in respect of rules which could be made by the
Governor under Clause 6(2) of the Fifth Schedule applicable to State of
Madras, Bombay, West Bengal, Bihar, the Central Provinces and Berar, and
Orissa.
</p>
<p id="p_259">21. The comments and suggestions made on the Draft Constitution including
the Fifth Schedule prepared by the the Drafting Committee, so far as
relevant paras, namely, Para 5, Para 6, Para 12 and Para 17 of the Fifth
Schedule, are concerned, and the decision of the Drafting Committee thereon
are quoted below :-
</p>
<p id="p_260">"PARAGRAPH 5

The Government of Orissa has questioned the propriety of the provisions
contained in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 in Part II of the Fifth
Schedule and has made the following comments :
</p>
<p id="p_261">Under Section 92(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935 no Act of the
Federal or Provincial Legislature applies to a partially excluded area
unless the appropriate Provincial Government so directs by a notification.
The plan followed in the Draft Constitution of India is, however,
fundamentally different. The idea underlying paragraph 5(1) of Part II of
the Fifth Schedule to the Draft Constitution is that as soon as an Act of
the Federal or the Provincial Legislature is passed, it will apply
automatically to all Scheduled Areas unless the Governor on the advice of
the Tribes Advisory Council directs, in respect of any particular
legislation, either that it shall not apply to any specified Scheduled
Areas or that it shall apply to such areas, subject to specified excep-
tions and modifications. Although on the whole the Govern-ment of Orissa
prefer the plan indicated in para 5(1) of Part II of the Fifth Schedule to
the Draft Constitution to the provision of section 92(l) of the Government
of India Act, 1935, they apprehend that difficulties, mainly of an ad-
ministrative nature, might arise out of the inevitable time lag between the
passing of an Act by either the Dominion or the State Legislature and the
decision of the Governor cither that the Act shall not apply to any
Scheduled Area or that in its application to such an area, it shall be
subject to certain modifications and exceptions. Since the position will be
that as soon as an Act is passed by a Legislature it will apply in all
Scheduled Areas, certain rights and obligations will be created or modified
by virtue of the Act. The accrual of such rights and obligations in the
interim period might give rise to an awkward situation if it is decided
subsequently (and a direction is made to that effect) either that the Act
shall not apply to Scheduled Areas or that it shall apply to such areas
subject to certain specified exceptions and modifications. It is of course
possible to give retrospective effect to the direc-tions made under para 5
(1) in order to secure that the exceptions and modifications subject to
which the Act is applied to Scheduled Areas will have effect therein from
the date of the passing of the Act. If that is done, consequential
provisions will have to be inserted by way of 'modifications' in order to
regularize anything done under the Act during the interim period. Even so,
however, it is likely that the rights of several parties might be seriously
affected and there might be much confusion. The Provincial Government,
however, see no easy solution of such difficulties if the plan envisaged in
para 5(1) of Part II of the Fifth Schedule is adhered to.
</p>
<p id="p_262">Note : The provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth
Schedule are based on the recommendation of the Sub-Com-mittee on Excluded
and Partially Excluded Areas (Other than Assam) as adopted by the Advisory
Committee. Attention is in-vited in this connection to paragraphs 10 and 11
of Volume I (Report of the Excluded and Partially Excluded Areas (Other
than Assam) Sub-Committee). It will appear from the said report that the
present system under which the Governor in his discretion applies the
legislation did not appeal to the committee as this principle would be
regarded as undemocratic even though the Governor in future might be an
elected functionary. The criticism offered by the Government of Orissa to
the provision set out in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 will also apply
if the present provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, under which
no Act of the Central or a Provincial Legislature applies to an ex-cluded
or a partially excluded area unless the Governor by a public notification
so directs, is adopted; for, if in such case it is essential that an Act of
the Central or a Provincial legislature should apply to any such area along
with other areas on the date when it becomes law after it has been assented
to, there is bound to be some time lag between the passing of the Act and
the decision of the Governor that the Act shall apply to such or that in
its application to such area it shall be subject to certain modifications
and exceptions as in the present case. A decision will have to be arrived
at in either case as to the application or non-application of the Act when
the Bill is passing through the Legislature and a notification will have to
be kept ready for issue on the date the Bill on being assented to becomes
law.
</p>
<p id="p_263">Decision of the Drafting Committee, October, 19i48 : The Drafting Committee
decided to recast the proviso to sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of Part
II of the Fifth Schedule as follows : Provided that where such Act relates
to any of the following subjects, that is to say :
</p>
<p id="p_264">(a)  marriage, inheritance or property for social customs of the Scheduled
Tribes :
</p>
<p id="p_265">(b)  and (c) (Omit);
</p>
<p id="p_266">(d)  land, other than lands which are reserved forests under the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_251">Indian
Forest Act</a>, 1927, or under any other law for the time being in force in the
area in question, including rights for tenants, allotment of land and
reservation of land for any purpose;
</p>
<p id="p_267">(e)  any matter relating to village administration including the
establishment of village panchayats.
</p>
<p id="p_268">the Governor shall issue such direction when so advised by the Tribes
Advisory Council,

The Government of Orissa has also made the following comments with regard
to sub-paragraph (2) of Paragraph 5 of Part II of the Fifth Schedule :
</p>
<p id="p_269">With reference to the Governor's power to make regulations under paragraph
5(2) of Part II of the Fifth Schedule, the question has been raised whether
the power is as plenary as the power at present conferred by section 92(2)
of the Government of India Act, 1935. A regulation made under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_252">Section 92(2)</a>
may deal with any subject irrespective of whether it is included in the
Central, Provincial or Concur-rent List; it may even amend a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_253">Central Act</a>.
Since, however sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 5 of Part 11 of the Fifth
Schedule does not specifically refer to the Dominion Parlia-ment, the
Provincial Government are doubtful if the power to make regulations
conferred by sub-paragraph (2) of para-graph 5 will be equally plenary or
will be restricted to matters on which the State Legislature will be
competent to legislate. Although the term "appropriate legislature" used in
sub-para-graph (4) of paragraph 5 would etymologically include the
"Dominion Parliament" as well as "the State Legislature, it appears from a
perusal of the Draft Constitution that the draftsman made a distinction
between "Parliament" on the one hand and "State Legislature" on the other.
It may, there-fore, be the intention of the Draft Constitution that the
Governor's power to make regulations under sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 5
will not extend to matters included in the Central List. If that is the
Plan, the Provincial Government beg to differ from it, as they feel that
the Provincial Governor's power to make regulations for the good govern-
ment of Scheduled Areas should continue to be as plenary as it is at
present.
</p>
<p id="p_270">Note : The power to make regulations conferred by sub- paragraph (2) of
paragraph 5 is not restricted only to matters on which the State
Legislature will be competent to legislate. The expression "with respect to
any matter not provided for by any law for the time being in force in such
area" in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 5 and the use of the expression
"appropriate legislature" in sub-paragraph (4) of that paragraph make it
clear that the power to make regulations under sub-paragraph (2) of that
paragraph is not restricted only to matters with respect to which the
Legislature of the State is competent to legislate. Any further
clarification is hardly necessary. However, to make intention clearer the
following amendment may be made in paragraph 5 of Part II of the Fifth
Schedule : In sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule, the
following be added at the end :
</p>
<p id="p_271">and any regulations so made may repeal or amend any Act of Parliament or of
the Legislature of the State or any existing law which is for the time
being applicable to such area.
</p>

decided to substitute the following for sub- paragraph (2) of paragraph 5
of Part II of the Fifth Schedule :

(2) The Governor may, after consultation with the Tribes Advisory council

<p id="p_292">22. When the Constituent Assembly took up the Fifth Schedule for
consideration on 5th September, 1949, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar moved another Draft
Fifth Schedule in place of the original Fifth Schedule. This Schedule was
simpler in form and uniformly applied to all the Scheduled Areas. Para 5 of
new Draft is quoted below :
</p>
<p id="p_293">"5. Law Applicable to scheduled areas - (l) Notwithstanding any-thing
contained in this Constitution the Governor or Ruler, as the case may be,
may by public notification direct that any particular Act of Parliament or
of the Legislature of the State shall not apply to a scheduled area or any
part thereof in the State or shall apply to a Scheduled Area or any part
thereof in the State subject to such exceptions and modifications as he may
specify in the notifica-tion.
</p>
<p id="p_294">(2) The Governor or Ruler, as the case may be, may make regulations for the
peace and good government of any area in a State which is for the time
being a Scheduled Area.
</p>
<p id="p_295">In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing
power, such regulations may -
</p>
<p id="p_296">(a)  prohibit or restrict the transfer of land by or among members of the
Scheduled Tribes in any such area;
</p>
<p id="p_297">(b)  regulate the allotment of land to members of the Scheduled Tribes in
such areas;
</p>
<p id="p_298">(c)  regulate the carrying on of business as money- lender by persons who
lend money to members of the Scheduled Tribes in such areas.
</p>
<p id="p_299">(3) In making any regulation as is referred to in sub-paragraph (2) of this
paragraph, the Governor or Ruler may repeal or amend any Act of Parliament
or of the Legislature of the State or any existing law which is for the
time being applicable to the area in question.
</p>
<p id="p_300">(4)  All regulations made under this paragraph shall be sub-mitted to the
President and until assented to by him shall have no effect.
</p>
<p id="p_301">(5)  No regulation shall be made under this paragraph unless the Governor
or the Ruler making the regulation has, in the case where there is a Tribes
Advisory Council for the State, consulted such Council."
</p>
<p id="p_302">23. Before the Fifth Schedule was finally adopted by the Constituent
Assembly, there was debate in the Assembly on every Clause of the Schedule.
It will be useful, at this stage, to reproduce some passages from the
Constituent Assembly Debate as under :
</p>
<p id="p_303">"(Shri Yudhisthir Mishra)

The special purpose for moving this amendment is that there are areas in
Orissa and the C.P. States which may not be specified as scheduled areas
but there are certain Scheduled Tribes among which certain kinds of land
laws are prevalent. For example, in C.P. and Orissa States, it is not
permissible on the part of a non-aboriginal to acquire the lands of an
aboriginal without the sanction of the Government. Now, Sir, in that case,
supposing according to paragraph 5, the Governor or the Ruler of a State
does not make any regulation and retains the same provisions applicable to
non-aboriginals with respect to the transfer of lands; then I shall submit
that there will be no use in saying that the Government is prepared to
safeguard the interests of the tribal people."
</p>
<p id="p_304">24.  Shri Brajeshwar Prasad suggested as under :
</p>
<p id="p_305">"............The provinces being weak in economic resources arc not

in a position to shoulder the responsibility. Hence I plead that the Centre
should take command of the tribal areas. The Government of India has no
right to exist if it cannot undertake to guarantee means of livelihood and
free educational and medical facilities even for such a small number of
people....
</p>
<p id="p_306">I want, Sir, that no land in the scheduled areas belonging to an Adibasi
should be allowed to be sold or mortgaged even to tribals without the
permission of the Deputy Commissioner. Such a provision exists in Santhal
Pargana. 1 am not at all in favour of dispossessing those non-tribals who
have got lands or property in the scheduled areas, but no further lands
should be given to non-tribals. This protection is needed in the interests
of the tribals. It is also in consonance with the demands of the tribal
leaders. This concession will generate a feeling of loyalty in the hearts
of the tribal people........"
</p>
<p id="p_307">25.  Shri Jadubans Sahay forcefully argued :
</p>
<p id="p_308">"........So far as land is concerned, it is not our intention, nor of the

provincial Governments where the tribals have provincial Govern-ments have
made laws to see that land should not pass out of the hands of the tribal
people; in our province, the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act was modified and
altered long long before 1937 in order to see that no land should pass out
of the hands of the tribal people. But, there were various difficulties in
the original schedule that land should not be settled by the Government to
any one except the tribal people. In the Scheduled areas, there are not
only the tribal people; there are Harijans also; there are other castes
also who are equally backward, if not otherwise, at least economically, at
the tribal people. Is it, then, Sir, our wish that in those areas where the
Harijans and other backward people remain, land should not be settled by
the Government to them also? Of course, the tribal people should have the
preference as well as the Harijans living in those areas. If these things
are made elastic, we should have nothing to say on this point. But, the
Government should see and in the future we also should see that preference
is given to the tribal people and if they have no land, the landless tribal
people should have the first priority............"
</p>
<p id="p_309">26.  The above portions have been extracted from the Constituent Assembly
Debates to indicate the mood of the representatives of the people and the
urgency they felt in protecting the land of the tribals and need for
prohibiting transfer of land in the Scheduled Areas to non-tribals by the
State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_310">27.  Para 5(2) of the Fifth Schedule, as finally adopted and engrafted in
the Constitution, provided as under :
</p>
<p id="p_311">"5(2). The Governor or Rajpramukh, as the case may be, may make regulations
for the peace and good government of any area in a state which is for the
time being a Scheduled Area.
</p>
<p id="p_312">In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the forego-ing
power, such regulations may -
</p>
<p id="p_313">(a)  prohibit or restrict the transfer of land by or among members of the
Scheduled Tribes in such area;
</p>
<p id="p_314">(b)   regulate the allotment of land to members of the scheduled tribes in
such area;
</p>
<p id="p_315">(c)  regulate the carrying on of business as money- lender by persons who
lend money to members of the scheduled tribes in such areas.
</p>
<p id="p_316">(3) In making any such regulation as is referred to in sub-paragraph (2) of
this paragraph, the Governor or Ruler may repeal or amend any Act of
Parliament or of the Legislature of the State or any existing law which is
for the time being applicable to the area in question.
</p>
<p id="p_317">(4) All regulations made under this paragraph shall be submitted forthwith
to the President and until assented to by him shall have no effect.
</p>
<p id="p_318">(5)  No regulation shall be made under this paragraph unless the Governor
or the Ruler making the regulation has, in the case where there is a Tribes
Advisory Council for the State, consulted such Council."
</p>
<p id="p_319">28.  The word "Rajpramukh" was subsequently deleted by the Con-stitution
(Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.
</p>
<p id="p_320">29.  The above legislative history indicates that from the very begin-ning,
at least from the 19th Century, Scheduled Areas inhabited by aboriginals
and tribals have been administered exclusively under the con-trol of the
Central Government through the Governor of the State by providing special
statutory measures. It is obvious that from the earliest time till the
making of the Constitution, it was all along felt that the transfer of land
in the Scheduled Areas by a tribal to a person who was not a member of the
scheduled Tribe be totally prohibited and if such a transfer was made, it
was to be treated as null and void. Government land in the Scheduled Areas
could also not be allotted to persons who were not the members of the
Scheduled Tribes. If such land was proposed to be allotted to them, it
could be done only under the regulations made by the Governor. The basic
concept was that the land of the Scheduled Tribes should be protected and
should not be frittered away by transfer nor should any non-tribal be
allowed to infiltrate in the Scheduled Area by getting an allotment of land
made in his favour. In case of a transfer of land which was void, the power
to restore land to a tribal or his heirs after evicting the non-tribal was
also vested in the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_321">30.  It has already been seen above that in the Draft Constitution,
prepared by the Drafting Committee, there was a clear prohibition on the
allotment of Government land to non-tribals except in accordance with the
rules made by the Governor.
</p>
<p id="p_322">31. In the Constituent Assembly when the Draft Fifth Schedule was
considered, no Member raised any objection that the Government should be
free to allot its land to the non-tribals in the Scheduled Areas as all the
Members were conscious of the fact that the special privileges and special
status enjoyed by the tribals should not be disturbed by allowing non-
tribals to enter into that Area.
</p>
<p id="p_323">32.  The protective measures adopted through Legislation for the
preservation of tribal life, for the prevention of exploitation of tribals
by non-tribals and money-lenders and to seal infiltration of non-tribals in
the Agency tracts or Scheduled Areas rested on three main planks :
</p>
<p id="p_324">(a)  Prohibition of transfer of land by tribal to a non-tribal with the
stipulation that such transfer will be null and void.
</p>
<p id="p_325">(b)  Prohibiting Government from allotting land vested in it to non-tribal.
</p>
<p id="p_326">(c)  Power of Government to evict non-tribal from the tribal's land coming
into his possession through a void sale-deed and restoring the same to the
tribal or his heirs.
</p>
<p id="p_327">33. The question is whether this position is still reflected in the Fifth
Schedule read with Articles 15(4), 46 and 244 of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_328">34.  The Fifth Schedule as finally brought on the pages of the Con-
stitution does not contain any specific prohibition.
</p>
<p id="p_329">35.  After specifying that the executive power of the State extends to the
Scheduled Areas therein and that the Governor shall report annually to the
President regarding the administration of those areas and that the
executive power of the Union extends to the giving of direction to the
States about the administration of the Scheduled Areas and further that
there shall be a Tribes Advisory Council to advise on such matters pertain-
ing to the welfare and advancement of the Scheduled Tribes as may be
referred to them by the Governor, the Fifth Schedule, in Para 5 thereof,
proceeds to speak about the applicability of laws to the Scheduled Areas by
saying that the Governor may, by Notification, direct that an Act of
Parliament or Legislature of the State shall not apply to the Scheduled
Area or that it shall apply with such exceptions and modifications as may
be specified in the Notification, These directions may also be issued with
retrospective effect.
</p>
<p id="p_330">36.  Under Para 5(2) of the Fifth Schedule, the Governor has also been
given the power to make Regulations for the "Peace and Good Government" of
the Scheduled Area.
</p>
<p id="p_331">37. Apart from this power which is in very vide and General terms,
Regulations could also be made by the Governor to :
</p>
<p id="p_332">(a)  prohibit or restrict the transfer of land by or among member of the
Scheduled Tribes in such area;
</p>
<p id="p_333">(b)  regulate the allotment of land to members of the Scheduled Tribes in
such area;
</p>
<p id="p_334">(c)  regulate the carrying on of business    as money-lender by persons who
lend money to members of the Scheduled Tribes in such area.
</p>
<p id="p_335">38. The power to make Regulations also includes the power to repel or amend
any Act of Parliament or of the State Legislature or any existing law which
may, for the time being, be applicable to the Scheduled Area.
</p>
<p id="p_336">39.  The power to make Regulations is undoubtedly legislative in character.
The power to issue directions under Para 5(1) of the Fifth Schedule as to
the applicability of an Act of Parliament or State Legislature with such
exceptions and modifications as the Governor may direct, is also
legislative in character. <a href="/doc/1290730/" id="a_254">In Chatturam &amp; Ors, v. Commissioner of Income
Tax, Bihar</a>,    (1947) FCR 116 =  (1947) FLJ 92, it was laid down with
reference to Section 92(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935 that when
the Governor issues a Notification under <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_255">Section 92(1)</a> by which Federal
Laws are applied to Excluded and Partially Excluded areas (Scheduled
Areas), he exercised a legislative power. So also when the Governor makes
Regulations in exercise or power under Para 5(2) of the Fifth Schedule,
which is equivalent to Section 92 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and
repeals or amends any Act of parliament or State Legislature, he exercises
legislative power as the principle laid down in Chhaturam's case (supra)
which was followed in Jatindra Nath Gupta \. The Province of Bihar &amp; Ors.,
(1949) FLJ 225, would be applicable to this situation also.
</p>
<p id="p_337">40. The Governor has also been given the legislative power to make
Regulations for the "PEACE AND GOOD GOVERNMENT of any area in a State which
is a Scheduled Area. The words "PEACE AND GOOD GOVERNMENT are the words of
very wide import and give wide dis-cretion to the Governor to make laws for
such purpose. In King Emperor v. Benoari Lal Sharma, (1944) L.R. 72 I A. 57
and in Attorney-General for Saskatchewan v. Canadian Pacific RY. Co.,
(1953) A.C, 594, it was held that the words "PEACE, ORDER AND GOOD
GOVERNMENT" are the words of very wide import giving wide power to the
authority to pass laws for such purposes. <a href="/doc/778950/" id="a_256">In Raja Jogendra Narayan Deb v.
Debendra Narayan Roy &amp; Ors</a>., (1942) L.R. 69 I.A. 76, it was explained that
these words, namely, "PEACE, ORDER AND GOOD GOVERNMENT have reference to
the scope and not to the merits of the legislation. It wa s again explained
in <a href="/doc/1788368/" id="a_257">Girindra Nath Banerjee v. Birendra Nath Pal</a>, (1927) I.L.R. 54 Cal. 727
that these words are words of the widest significance and it is not open to
the Court to consider whether any legislation made by the Governor would
conduce to peace and good Government.
</p>
<p id="p_338">41.  The words "PEACE, PROGRESS AND GOOD GOVERN-MENT have also been used in
<a href="/doc/1823046/" id="a_258">Article 240</a> of the Constitution which empowers the President to make
Regulations for certain Union Territories. This Court had an occasion to
consider the significance of these words in <a href="/doc/731827/" id="a_259">T.M. Kanniyan v. Income-Tax
Officer, Pondicherry and Anr</a>., [1968] 2 SCR 103 and relying upon the above
decisions as also those rendered in Riel .v The Queen, (1885) 10 A.C. 675
and Chenard and Co. &amp; Ors. v. Joachim Arissol, (1949) A.C. 127, it was held
that the power of the President to make Regulations under <a href="/doc/1823046/" id="a_260">Article 240</a> was
very wide and the President could make Regulations with respect to a Union
Territory occupying the same field on which Parliament could also make
laws.
</p>
<p id="p_339">42.  In exercise of the power conferred by Para 5(2) of the Fifth Schedule,
the Governor of Andhra Pradesh promulgated Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Areas
Land Transfer Regulation, 1959.
</p>
<p id="p_340">43. These Regulations were amended by Regulation I of 1970, again by
Regulation I of 1971 and by Regulation I of 1978.
</p>
<p id="p_341">44. The constitutional validity of these Regulations was challenged in <a href="/doc/101893/" id="a_261">P.
Rami Reddy &amp; Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Anr</a>.,   [1988] 3 SCC 433 and
upheld by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_342">45. Para 3(l)(a) of the Regulation which opens with a non- obstante clause
provides that a transfer of immovable property situate in the Agency Tracts
by a person, whether or not such a person is a member of the Scheduled
Tribe, shall be absolutely null and void. This puts a complete ban on the
transfer of immovable properties in the Agency Tracts by any person
whatsoever, whether he is a member of the Scheduled Tribe or not. There is,
however, one exception to this rule as it is provided that such transfer
shall not be null and void if the transfer is made in favour of a person
who is a member of the Scheduled Tribe or is a Society registered or deemed
to be registered under the Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1964,
which is composed solely of members of the Scheduled Tribes.
</p>
<p id="p_343">46. Para 3(l)(c) provides that if a person "who intends to sell his land,
is not able to sell that land either because the member belonging to the
Scheduled Tribe is not willing to purchase the land or is not willing to
purchase the land on the terms offered to him, such person may apply to the
Agent or the Agency Divisional Officer or any other Prescribed Officer (who
are defined in Para 2(b) and (c) of the Regulations) for the acquisi-tion
of such land by the State Government. The Agent or the Agency Divisional
Officer or the Prescribed Officer, as the case may be, shall then take over
the land on payment of compensation in accordance with the principles
specified in Section 10 of the Andhra Pradesh (Ceiling on Agricultural
Holdings) Act, 1961. The land shall then vest, free from all encumberances,
in the State Government which shall dispose of the land in the favour of
member of the Scheduled Tribe or a Co-operative Society composed solely of
the members of the Scheduled Tribe or "in such other manner and subject to
such conditions as may be prescribed." There cannot also be a "Benami"
transaction under the Regulations and a member of the Scheduled Tribe
cannot hold property in his name for the benefit of a non-tribal.
</p>
<p id="p_344">47. Para 3(2) (a) provides that if a transfer of immovable property has
been made in contravention of Para 3(l)(a), the Agent, the Agency
Divisional Officer or any other Prescribed Officer suo motu or on the
application of anyone interested or on the information of a public servant,
decree ejectment of the person in possession of that property claiming
under such transfer. The property shall then be restored to the transferor
or his heirs.
</p>


<p id="p_345">48.  Para 3(2)(b) provides that if a transferor or his heirs are not
willing to take back the property or their whereabouts are not known, the
property shall be assigned or sold to any other member of the Scheduled
Tribe or a Co-operative Society composed solely of the members of the
Scheduled Tribe. The Agent or the Agency Divisional Officer or the
Prescribed Officer shall have a power to "otherwise" dispose it of as if it
was the property at the disposal of the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_346">49.  It may be mentioned here that Para 3(1) (b) contains a rule of
presumption that if any immovable property situated in the Agency Tracts is
in possession of a person who is not a member of the Scheduled Tribe, it
shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the property has been
acquired by that person through a transfer made to him by member of the
Scheduled Tribe.
</p>
<p id="p_347">50.  Para 3A of the Regulation places two restrictions on a person
intending to mortgage his property. The first restriction is that it can be
mortgaged only in favour of a person who is a member of the Scheduled Tribe
or to a Co-operative Society or a Land Mortgage Bank or any other bank or
financial institution approved by the State Government. The Explanation
appended to Para 3A(1) defines a "Bank". The other restric-tion is that
while mortgaging the property, it would not be open to that person to
deliver possession to the mortgagee. Clause 2 of Para 3A provide that in
case the immovable property which was mortgaged is brought to sale on
account of default in payment of the mortgage money or the interest payable
thereon, the said property shall be sold only to a member of the Scheduled
Tribe or to a Co-operative Society composed solely of members of the
Scheduled Tribe. Explanation appended to this Clause specifies as to what
would be treated as Co-operative Societies. It provides that if the
Government is a member of any Co-operative Society, it, namely, the said
Society, shall also be deemed to be a Society registered or deemed to be
registered under the Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1964.
</p>
<p id="p_348">51.  Clause 5 provides that no immovable property situate in the Agency
Tracts and owned by a member of the Scheduled Tribes shall be liable to be
attached and Sold in the execution of money decree.
</p>
<p id="p_349">52.  Clause 6 creates certain offences and prescribes the penalties
therefor. For example, if a person acquires any immovable property in
contravention of any provision of the Regulations or continues in
possession of such property after a decree for ejectment is passed, he will
be prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to
one year.
</p>
<p id="p_350">53.  These Regulations indicated a departure from the normal laws relating
to immovable property. Normally, an owner of the immovable property is free
to transfer his property to anyone he likes. But if he possesses property
in the Agency Tracts or the Scheduled Area, his right to transfer the
property is restricted as he can transfer it only to a member of the
Scheduled Tribe or to a Co-operative Society comprising solely of the
members of the Scheduled Tribes. So also, under the usufructuary mortgage,
possession has necessarily to be transferred to the mortgagee but these
Regulations prescribe  that in no case shall possession be delivered to the
mortgagee.
</p>
<p id="p_351">54. It will be seen from the above that at least in two circumstances, the
property of the member of the Scheduled Tribe or any other person in the
Scheduled Area becomes the property of the State Government:
</p>
<p id="p_352">(1)  If a person is not able to sell his property either because a member
of the Scheduled Tribe is not willing to purchase the property or is not
willing to purchase the property on the terms at which it proposed to be
sold, then the Agent, or the Agency Divisional Officer or any Prescribed
Officer can, by order, acquire the property on payment of compensation. The
property loses its original character and becomes the property of the State
Government.
</p>
<p id="p_353">(2)  If on a decree for ejectment being passed against a person in
occupation of the property belonging to a Scheduled Tribe under sale deed
which is void, the property is sought to be restored to the transferor or
his heirs but they are not willing to take the property or their
whereabouts are not known, it would be open to the Government to assign or
transfer the property to any other member of the Scheduled Tribe or
otherwise dispose it of as if it was the property, at the disposal of the
State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_354">55. In all these circumstances, when the property either comes to vest in
the State Government or becomes a property at the disposal of the State
Government, the Government cannot, in view of the above, transfer the
property to a "person" of its own choice but has to transfer, assign or
sell to a member of the Scheduled Tribe or a Co-operative Society of the
Scheduled Tribes.
</p>
<p id="p_355">56. The possibility of the Government disposing it of to a person who is
not a member of the Scheduled Tribe is totally ruled out by the Regula-
tions by providing that it shall be sold, assigned or transferred only to
tribals or their Co-operative Society. If this applies to properties which
become the Government properties, how the properties which are already the
Government properties could be excluded from the applicability of these
Regulations? The Government has to be bound down to the Con-stitutional
scheme sought to be enforced through Regulations made by the Governor under
Para 5(2) of the Fifth Schedule and cannot be permitted to transfer its own
properties in favour of non-tribals so as to allow their infiltration into
the Scheduled Area. The prohibition contained in Para 3(1) (a) that no
parson, whether he is a member of the Scheduled Tribe or not, shall
transfer his immovable property to a non-tribal must, therefore, in its
scope cover the Government, as well, which, if it possesses land in the
Agency Tracts, cannot transfer it either by sale, allotment, lease or
otherwise to a non-tribal. To this limited extent, it has to be treated as
a "person" within the meaning of Clause 3(l)(a) of the Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_356">57.  It is contended by the learned council for the respondent that where
the property is acquired by the Government on payment of compen-sation or
it becomes the property at the disposal of the Government, such property,
undoubtedly, has to be disposed of in favour of the member of the Scheduled
Tribe or a Co-operative Society of the Scheduled Tribes but the Government
also retains the power and choice to dispose it of in such other manner and
subject to such conditions as may be prescribed. It is contended on the
basis of the words "or in such other manner and subject to such conditions
as may be prescribed" occurring in Para 3(1) (c) that the Government is not
bound to sell the property to a member of the Scheduled Tribe or the Co-
operative Society of the Scheduled Tribes. It is contended that almost
similar words have been used in Para 3(2)(b) where the property, if it is
not taken back by the transferor who is a member of the Scheduled Tribe or
his heirs, becomes the property at the disposal of the State Government and
the State Government has the choice either to assign or sell the property
to any member of the Scheduled Tribe or a Co-operative Society of the
Schedule Tribes or "otherwise dispose it of as if it was a property at the
disposal of the Government". This interpretation cannot be accepted. The
words "or in such other manner and subject to such conditions as may be
prescribed" occurring in Para 3(l)(c) and the words "or otherwise dispose
it of as if it was a property at the disposal of the state Government" have
to be read, not in isolation, but in the context of other words used in
those provisions. The emphasis throughout in these Regulations has been
that the property would be sold or transferred only to a member of the
Scheduled Tribe or their Co-operative Societies. The Constitutional scheme
which is sought to be enforced through Regulations is that the property of
the Scheduled Tribe or the immovable property situated in Agency Tracts may
be protected and be not frittered away and further that they may retain
their original character and may continue to belong to members of the
Scheduled Tribe or their Co-operative Societies, or that if the property
belongs to a non-tribal, it may not be transferred to a non-tribal and may
be transferred to a tribal alone. The words "or in any other manner" in
Para 3(l)(c) or the words "otherwise dispose it of as if it was a property
at the disposal of the State Government" occurring in Para 3(2)(b) have to
be read in that context with the result that even if the Government
intended to deal with such immovable properties "in any other manner" it
could deal only in a manner which would ultimately benefit a member of the
Scheduled Tribe or their Co-operative Societies. The Fifth Schedule
including Para 5 thereof as also the Regulations made thereunder by the
Governor of Andhra Pradesh clearly seek to implement the national policy
that the custom, culture, life-style and properties of the Scheduled Tribes
in the Agency Tracts and other immovable properties situate therein shall
be protected. The Government being under a legal constraint to deal with
the property situated in the Agency Tracts only in the manner indi-cated
above, cannot itself act beyond the scope of the Regulations by saying that
it is free to dispose of its own properties in any manner it likes. If the
Government was allowed to transfer or dispose of its own land in favour of
non-tribals, it would completely destroy the legal and constitutional
fabric made to protect the Scheduled Tribes. The prohibition, so to say,
disqualifies non-tribals as a class from acquiring or getting property on
transfer. On account of this disqualification, the Government cannot, even
if it is not a "person" within the meaning of Para 3(1)(a), transfer, let
out or allot its land or other immovable property to a non- tribal.
</p>
<p id="p_357">58. These Regulations have been made to give effect to the power of the
Governor under Clauses (a) and (b) of Para 5(2) of the Fifth Schedule for
"Peace and Good Government" in the Agency Tracts. These Regula-tions also
aim at ushering in an era of social equality where the most backward and
isolated people who constitute the Schedule Tribes may be rehabilitated
effectively in the nation's main-stream. The prohibition to sell the land
to non-tribals and the further requirement that if the property comes to be
vested in the Government or it becomes property at the disposal of the
Government, it will be sold, assigned or distributed only to the tribals
also is a measure, nay, a strong measure, in that direction to give effect
to the philosophy of "Distributive Justice".
</p>
<p id="p_358">59.  The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_262">Development) Act</a>, 1957 has
already been amended by insertion of <a href="/doc/965382/" id="a_263">Section 11(5)</a> at the State level which
provides that the Government land shall not be allotted for the purpose of
mining to non-tribals. A lot of argument was raised on both sides whether
this Amendment was retrospective or prospective. While it is contended on
behalf of the respondents that the leases which had already been executed
or renewed prior to the Amendment or introduction of <a href="/doc/965382/" id="a_264">Section 11(5)</a>, would
not be affected the appellants in CA, arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 17080-81
of 1995 argued that such leases, including renewed leases cannot be
operated.
</p>
<p id="p_359">60. We have already held that the present scheme, set out in the Fifth
Schedule and Regulations made by the Governor in exercise of the power
under Para 5(2) of the Schedule, is to sell, distribute, assign or let out
the Government land only to members of Scheduled Tribes. <a href="/doc/965382/" id="a_265">Section 11(5)</a>
introduced in the Act only seeks to give effect to what was already
contained in the Fifth Schedule and the Regulations made thereunder. In
order to set at rest the above controversy raised at various levels that
the Government land could also be allotted to non-trlbals, the Amendment
was brought about in the Mines and minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_266">Development)
Act</a>, 1957 so as to make it sure that it was never the intention that the
Government land could be allotted to non-tribals. The Amendment only
retrates the existing position.
</p>
<p id="p_360">61.  I am short of time as Brother Ramaswamy is retiring tomorrow. It is
not possible for me to write out in detail on other points involved in the
case. Since I am agreeing with Brother Ramaswamy on the findings recorded
by him on other issues involved in the case, specially those relating to
forests and Conservation of Forests Act and the environmental questions, I
conclude by saying that I am in respectful agreement with him. I also agree
with the ultimate directions issued in the Judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_361">62. In view of the above, I am also of the opinion that the appeals of
Samatha arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 17080-81 of 1995 deserve to be allowed
and are hereby allowed while the other appeal arising out of SLP(C)
No.21457 of 1993 is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_362">CA. No. 4601-4602/97. PATTANAIK, J. Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_363">These two appeals by special leave are directed against the judg-ment of
the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated 28.4.95 dismissing the two Writ
Petitions filed by the present appellant which were registered as Writ
Petition Nos. 9513 of 1993 and 7725 of 1994, by a common judgment. The
appellant, a Rural Development Society of Peda Mallapuram, Sankhavaram
Mandap in the State of Andhra Pradesh filed the two Writ Petitions as
Public Interest Litigation seeking issuance of writ of mandamus to
terminate the mining leases in Borra Gram Panchayat area of Anantagiri
Mandal which had been granted and/or renewed in favour of the private
respondents inter alia on the grounds that the said leases contravened the
provisions of Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation of
1959, as amended in 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Regulation'), the
leases violate the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_267">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980
(hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_268">Conservation Act</a>'), and such leases are
prohibited under <a href="/doc/1547653/" id="a_269">Section 11(5)</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and
<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_270">Development) Act</a> 1957 as amended by Act of 1991 (hereinafter referred to as
The MMRD Act'). The appellant, who was the petitioner before the High Court
advanced the contention that under the Regulation transfer of all lands in
the schedule area to a non-tribal is prohibited and the said prohibition
equally applied to the government land and as such the mining leases in
favour of the private respondents who are non-tribals are void. In
elaborating this contention it was contended that the word 'person' in
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_271">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulation as amended in 1970 would include the
Government. Further contention of the appellant was that in view of <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_272">Section
2</a> of the Conservation Act no forest land could be utilised for non forest
purpose without the consent of the Central Government and the lease holds
favour of the private respondents being the forest land and there being no
consent of the Central Government the leases are invalid. Lastly it was
contended that in view of Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act the leases in
favour of the private respondent who are non tribals must be declared to be
void.
</p>
<p id="p_364">The Director of Mines and Geology, Government of Andhra Pradesh who was
respondent No. 2 before the High Court filed a counter-affidavit taking the
stand that the leases in question in favour of the private respon-dents
were prior to the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_273">Conservation Act</a> coming into force and, therefore, the
question of taking previous consent of the Central Government did not
arise. On the question of alleged violation of the provisions of the
Regula-tion it was stated that the prohibitions and restrictions in the
Regulation are not intended to apply to the Government land and there was
no bar under the Regulation for the Government to grant mining leases in
favour of the non-tribals. On the question of applicability of Section
11(5) of the MMRD Act it was contended that the said provision is
prospective in nature and no mining lease has been granted after
enforcement of Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act in favour of any non-tribal.
Respondent No. 4, the Forest Officer filed the Counter affidavit stating
that the Borra forest black was notified as reserve forest and some of the
respondents have encroached into the reserved forest area and to that
extent their operations are illegal. The private respondent No. 13 before
the High Court also filed a counter-affidavit adopting the stand taken by
respondent No. 2. The said respondent No. 13 was a transferee from the
original lessee. The other lessee-respondents also filed affidavits
adopting the stand taken by respon-dent No. 13.
</p>
<p id="p_365">The High Court by the impugned judgment came to the conclusion that the
word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_274">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulation does not include the
Government and as such the government is not prohibited from transferring
the government land in favour of non-tribals within the scheduled area.
According to the High Court this conclusion is irresistible from the fact
that in order to prohibit grant of mining lease in favour of the non-
tribals within the scheduled area Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act was
introduced in the year 1991. But the said provisions is prospective in
nature and would not apply to the existing leases. So far as the contention
of applicability of the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_275">Conservation Act</a> the High Court came to the
conclusion that the said Act applies to the reserved forest and since it is
not established as to the extent of the land covered by the mining leases
which form a part of the reserved forest and since the joint survey
conducted indicate that there is no lessee who is occupying the reserved
forest area, except in one case where to an extent of two thousand metres
of the mining lease forms a part of the reserved forest, the validity on
account of the non-compliance of the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_276">Conservation Act</a> cannot be gone into.
The High Court in the impugned judgment has also come to the conclusion
that prior approval of the Central Government under <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_277">Section 2</a> of the Forest
Conservation Act is not required where the land in question has already
broken in pursuance of a lease and in support of this conclusion reliance
has been placed on the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1476082/" id="a_278">State of Bihar v. Banshi
Ram</a>, [1985] 3 SCC 643. The aforesaid view in Banshi Modi's case appears to
have not been approved by the Court in the later cases -.<a href="/doc/1186098/" id="a_279">Ambika Quarry
Works v. State Of Gujarat</a>, [1987] 1 SCC 213. Further in view of the
decisions of this Court in S. Nageswaramma's case, Supreme Court Monitoring
Committee's case and Godavarman's case, the High Court committed error in
relying upon the ratio of Bakshi Ram Modi's case. The High Court,
therefore, observed that the Writ Petitions may approach the Competent
Authority in that regard seeking necessary relief and on such petitions
being filed the appropriate authority would pass appropriate order bearing
in mind the provisions of <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_280">Section 2</a> of the Conservation Act. With these
conclusions the Writ Petitions having been dismissed the present appeals by
special leave have been preferred. Though the contentions before the High
Court were limited to the aforesaid extent as indicated but before this
Court the horizon was expanded and Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned senior council
appearing for the appellant raised several contentions in assailing the
validity of the continuance of the mining leases which according to the
learned counsel are situated within the scheduled area. These two appeals
initially had been heard by a Bench of two judges but later on in view of
the question of law raised as well as in view of certain divergence of
views, has been placed before a three Judge Bench and the matter had been
re-argued.
</p>
<p id="p_366">It has been averred before this Court that the appellant Society was
started in the year 1990 at the request of the local tribes of Peda Mal-
lapuram area and the main objects of the society are implementation of
various welfare schemes of the Government and creating awareness among
tribal people of their rights and duties and protection of ecological
balance and imparting of environmental education in the tribal area. The
society operates in the Borra reserved forest area which was a part of the
domain of Raja of Jaipur before independence. Within the forest area the
tribal villagers occupy the land for cultivation and there are about 230
families settled in 14 villages occupying 436 acres within the enclosures
which are threatened of eviction by the mining operators. It may be noticed
that this assertion was not there in the Writ Petition filed before Andhra
Pradesh High Court. The further assertion of facts in this Court is that
within Anantgiri Mandal there are 230 families of tribals and they occupy
roughly 800 acres and yet they are also threatened to be evicted by mining
operators. The appellant further asserts that the Borra forest area is a
scheduled area in Vishakhapatnam District of Andhra Pradesh and it lies in
Anantgiri hills. The Borra caves are of unique occurrence and the entire
area is rich in mineral wealth, particularly mica and calcite. It is
averred that the mining activity in the said area has started since 1946
and the said mining operations are being carried on in the reserved forest
area, notwithstanding the prohibitions contained in different laws as
already stated, and the State of Andhra Pradesh bas not taken any
initiative in stopping the mining activities which has resulted human
hazards to the peaceful living of the tribal people and which affects the
ecology and environment of the area and, therefore the same should be
prohibited by issuance of mandamus. In the grounds taken before this Court
in these Special Leave Petitions it has been urged that under the amended
<a href="/doc/140100996/" id="a_281">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulations transfer of immovable property situated in
the schedule area to non-tribal is prohibited and the word 'person' used in
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_282">Section 3(1)</a> includes the government and as such the leases contravened
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_283">Section 3(1)</a> of the Regulation. The further ground taken is that under
<a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_284">Section 2</a> of the Conservation Act without the prior approval of the Central
Government the State Government could not have granted mining leases within
the forest area as mining obviously is a non-forest purpose. The private
respon-dent No. 12, who is the Managing Director of the Company, filed the
counter-affidavit taking the positive stand that the mining leases held by
them do not form part of the scheduled area and further the leases have
been granted much prior to the amended provisions of the Regulation as well
as much prior to the coming into force of the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_285">Conservation Act</a> and,
therefore, are not hit by any prohibitions and restrictions contained in
those provisions. Respondent No. 19 has filed the counter-affidavit taking
the stand that the lease has been granted in favour of Shri M. Laxmi
Narainan on 17.11.1984 and certain other leases had been granted in
Anantgiri Mandal to said Shri M, Laxmi Narainan on 24.1.1986. The transfer
of mining leases from the original lessee was granted by the appropriate
authority under the provisions of the MMRD Act and the Mineral Concession
Rules framed thereunder and there has been no violation of any Act or
Regulation in allowing such mining activities. It has also been stated that
the mining activity does not encroach upon any forest area or reserved
forest area and nowhere has the petitioner provided any factual foundation
for allegation to demonstrate that any part of the land held by respondent
No. 19 is within any forest land. And in the absence of such factual metrix
it is not possible to hold that there has been violation of <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_286">Section 2</a> of
the Conservation Act. It has also been averred by the respondent that the
leases do not destroy the ecological balance and do not disturb the flora
and fauna and the Government has granted the mining leases only after
complying with the statutory requirements. On the ques-tion of
interpretation of the provisions of the Regulation it has been stated that
the word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_287">Section 3(1)</a> does not include the Government and
therefore, the provisions of the Regulation have no application to the
Government land. In paragraph 20 of the counter-affidavit it has been
reiterated :
</p>
<p id="p_367">"There is no averment by the petitioner that this respondent has been in
possession of any forest area or the area earmarked for the reserve forest.
Therefore the statutory ban in <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_288">Section 2</a> of Forest (Conservation) Act is
not applicable to the leases granted to this respondent company."
</p>
<p id="p_368">The said assertion has also been repeated in paragraph 25 of the Counter-
affidavit. Several private respondents have also filed counter-af-fidavit
in this Court more or less taking similar stand and it is therefore, not
necessary to repeat the same. But it would be appropriate to notice the
stand taken by the State of Andhra pradesh and its officials who have been
arrayed as respondent Nos. 1 to 4. The State in its affidavit have
indicated that the mining leases which are in dispute had been much prior
to the coming into force of the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_289">Conservation Act</a> of 1980 and, therefore,
there has been no infraction of the aforesaid Act. On the question of
applicability of the provisions of the Regulation it has been stated that
the Government is not 'person' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_290">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of the
Regulation and the Government being the sole owner of the land has the
right to transfer the same to any individual/company. With regard to the
activities of the appellant-society it has been averred that the society is
working for its selfish ends and is mis-guiding the tribals who are
peacefully living and tribals are unnecessarily dragged into litigation. It
has also been stated that the areas which are under occupation of the
tribals have been surveyed and the said areas have been deleted from the
mining leases and, therefore, the assertion that the tribals are being
threatened by the mining operators from being dispossessed is not correct.
It has also been averred that the mining activities are on the exposed
mineral deposit and no extensive mining has been taken in the area damaging
the forest. With regard to the benefits obtained by the State on account of
such mining activities, it has been stated that not only it has provided
employment opportunity to the local tribals but also encourages mineral
based in-dustries in the district which provides good opportunity to the
educated unemployed. The State in its affidavit has also averred that all
the mining leases were granted in accordance with the prescribed law and
there is no possibility of endangering the Borra caves by the alleged
mining activities. The State has further stated that after coming into
force of Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act no mining leases within the
scheduled area has been granted in favour of any non-tribal in
contravention of the aforesaid provisions of the MMRD Act. It has also been
stated that every care has been taken by the Government to protect the
interest of the tribals and to ensure that there is no blasting in the
mining area to rehabilitate the affected people. The State in its affidavit
has also indicated as to which mine continues to be operative and which is
not operative as on the date of the affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_369">Dr. Dhawan, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant
contended that the history of the tribal areas traced from the administra-
tion under the British rule to the inclusion of Schedule V in the Constitu-
tion conferring a special power on the Governor to frame Regulation for
peace and good government in the area would clearly indicate that there
should not be any allotment of land to the non-tribals within the tribal
area, be it the government land or land belonging to the tribals, which in
turn would accord responsibility to the tribals for the economic
development of the area. According to the learned senior counsel one of the
purposes for which Schedule V was engrafted in the Constitution conferring
power on the Governor and not on the respective legislatures of the States
for the administration of the tribal area is to ensure distributive
justice, especially of land and that purpose will be frustrated if
government land within the tribal area is allocated in favour of non-
tribals, whether it is for the purposes of mining or for any other purpose.
It is, therefore, urged that this purpose should be borne in mind in
interpreting Regulation framed by the Governor in exercise of power
conferred upon him under Schedule V to the Constitution. The learned senior
counsel urged that the term 'peace and good government' should be given a
wide interpretation and the expression 'regulate the allotment of land to
members of Schedule-Tribes in such area' in S chedule V(2)(b) should be
construed to mean that the Governor should frame regulation ensuring that
land does not pass out from tribals and the land allotments are made
exclusively to tribals and the distribution of land amongst them inter se
can be regulated. The learned senior counsel further urged that the
provisions of the Constitution itself mandate an obligation on the Governor
to frame regulation prohibiting transfer of land of all category within the
schedule area in favour of a non-tribal. According to Dr. Dhawan, if the
expression 'person' used in first part of Regulation 3(l)(a) is interpreted
to include the State, thereby connoting that the government land also
within the scheduled area cannot be transferred in favour of a non-tribal
then the very purpose of conferring power on the Governor for
administration of tribal area could be achieved and such an interpretation
would not only prevent the exploitation of tribals from non-tribals but
would also advance the interest of the tribals and would secure substantive
distributive justice for the tribals. According to the learned senior
counsel appearing for the appellant the regulations and statutes affecting
the tribal regime must be given a purposive inter-pretation so that the
raison d'etre of the regime is not defeated. So far as the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_291">Conservation Act</a>
is concerned, the counsel argued that in view of the embargo contained in
<a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_292">Section 2</a> of the Conservation Act prior permission of Central Government
not having been obtained the mining activities within the forest area
cannot be permitted to be continued. In relation to the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_293">Environment Protection Act</a>, the learned senior counsel contended that the
Central Government is under a statutory duty to protect the environment and
co-ordinate the activities of the State Government under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_294">Environment
Protection Act</a> of 1986 and such statutory obligation not having been
discharged by the Central Government and the mining activities within the
schedule are a being hazardous to human health this Court should compel the
Union Government to perform its statutory obligation. So far as the
prohibition under Section 11(5) of MMRD Act is concerned, it is contended
by Dr. Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant that
<a href="/doc/965382/" id="a_295">Section 11(5)</a> in the MMRD Act is merely in the nature of clarification to
the provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_296">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the Regulation and in view of such
provision the mining activities after coming into force of the aforesaid
provision cannot be permitted to be continued. Let me now examine the
contentions raised to find out, how many of them would be sustainable.
Administration of Tribal areas under the British Rule and the debates in
the Constituent Assembly in relation to Administration of Tribal Area,
leading to engraftment of Schedule V in the Constitution -
</p>
<p id="p_370">The Indian Statutory (Simon) Commission in its report in 1930 indicated
that these tribal areas covered 1,20,000 square miles with a population of
about eleven million. These areas are located mostly in Bihar, Orissa,
Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bengal and Assam. Even During the British
rule, because of the social and economical conditions of these tribal
people special laws were made applicable in those areas. In the book "THE
FRAMING OF INDIA'S CONSTITUTION" - A study by B. Shiva Rao, it has been
stated that there were two dangers to which subjection to normal laws would
have specially exposed these tribal people, and both arose out of the fact
that they were primitive, simple, unsophisticated and frequently
improvident. There was also a risk of their agricultural land passing to
the more civilised section of the population, and the occupation of the
tribals was for the most part agricultural and secondly they were likely to
get into the "wiles of the moneylender". It was thus the primary aim of the
government policy then to protect these people from these two dangers and
preserve their tribal customs and this was achieved by prescribing special
procedures applicable to these backward areas. The Scheduled Districts Act,
enacted in 1874 was the first measure adopted to deal with these areas and
the said Act enabled the executive to extend any enactment in force in any
part of the British India to a "Scheduled district" with such modifications
as might be considered necessary. Thus, the execu-tive had the power to
exclude these areas from the normal operation of ordinary law and give such
protection as they might need. Even in Mon-tagu-Chelmsford Report of 1918
it was suggested that the political reforms contemplated for the rest of
India could not apply to these backward areas where the people were
primitive and thus these backward tracts were to be excluded from the
jurisdiction of the reformed Provincial Governments and administered
personally by the heads of the Provinces. In the Govern-ment of India Act
1919 these tracts were divided into two categories and some of the areas
were wholly excluded from the scope of the reforms. Therefore, neither the
Central nor the Provincial Legislature had the power to make laws
applicable to these areas and the power of legislation was vested in the
Governor acting with his Executive Council, the Ministers being excluded
from having any share in the responsibility for the ad-ministration of
these areas. Until the Simon Commission's report, the primary object and
the policy of the government in relation to the tribal areas was to give
the inhabitants of the tribal areas security of land tenure, freedom in the
pursuit of their traditional means of livelihood, and a reasonable exercise
of their ancestral customs. The Simon Commission, however, realised that
isolation of these people from the main currents of progress would not be a
satisfactory long term solution and, therefore, it would be necessary to
educate these people to become self-reliant. As the Provincial Government
was not inclined to devote special attention for the upliftment of these
tribal people mostly because of the fact that backward tract was a deficit
area and in view of the magnitude and complexity of problem the Commission
had recommended that the responsibility for the backward classes would be
adequately discharged only if it was entrusted to the Centre. But at the
same time, it was also recognised that it would not be a practicable
arrangement if centralisation of administrative authority in these areas
led to a situation in which these areas would be separated from the
Provinces of which they were an integral part. The Commission, therefore
had suggested that the Central Government should use the Governors for
administration of these areas and it could be laid down by rules how far
the Governor would act in consultation with his Ministers in the discharge
of these agency duties. This proposal, however, was not adopted in the
constitutional reforms of 1935. Under the Govern-ment of India Act of 1935,
these backward areas were classified as excluded areas and partially
excluded areas. The excluded areas in Assam, Madras, Bengal, North-West
Frontier Province were placed under the personal rule of the Government
acting in his discretion and while the partially excluded areas were within
the field of ministerial responsibility and the Governors exercised a
special responsibility in respect of the administration of these areas and
they had the power in their individual judgment to overrule their Ministers
if they thought it to do so. <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_297">No Act</a> of the Federal or Provincial
Legislature would apply to any of these areas but Governors had the
authority to apply such Acts with such modification as they considered
necessary, as is apparent from Sections 91 and 92 of the Government of
India Act 1935. The Cabinet Mission's statement of May 16, 1946 mentioned
about the requirement of the special attention of the Constituent Assembly
in respect of these tribal areas.
</p>
<p id="p_371">Vth Schedule of the Constitution as well as paragraph 5 of the said
Schedule which confers power on the Governor to make Regulations for the
peace and good government in any area in the State which is a schedule area
nowhere indicates that there should be no alienation of any land in favour
of a non-tribal within the said area. The aforesaid provision is an
enabling provision conferring power on the Governor to frame Regulation for
peace and good government and the Regulation in question may provide for
prohibiting or restricting transfer of land by or among the members of the
Scheduled Tribes, regulate the allotment of land to mem-bers of the
Scheduled Tribes and regulate the carrying on business as money-lender by
persons who lend money to the Scheduled Tribes. It has, therefore, become
necessary to find out from the Debates in the Constituent Assembly as to
whether the Constitution makers at all intended to prohibit alienation of
any land in favour of a non-tribal within the tribal area. In course of
arguments while placing the Debates in the Constituent Assembly Dr. Rajiv
Dhawan, learned senior counsel at one point of time had advanced an extreme
argument that all lands within the tribal area belong to the tribals and
only during the British regime the tribals were dented of their rights over
the lands and, therefore, this Court would be justified in holding that the
lands within the entire tribal area belong only to them and the State has
no authority or power in respect of the said land. In support of the said
contention the learned senior counsel placed reliance on a decision of the
Australian Court in the case of Mabo and Others v. The State of Queensland,
reported in Commonwealth Law Reports Vol. 175 (1992) at page 1. The learned
senior counsel had argued that what has been held by the High Court of
Australia in the aforesaid case, namely, Aborigines had the title to the
land and it never got extinguished by annexation by Crown or by the
application of common law in Australia, should apply to the lands within
the tribal area in India. But, however, at later point of time the learned
counsel did not persue the said contention and, therefore, we have to
examine and find out the correctness of the submission as to whether under
the Constitutional Scheme there has been a prohibition for alienation of
any land within the tribal area in favour of a non-Scheduled Tribes. On
going through the Constituent Assembly Debates and the book "The Framing of
India's Constitution - A study by B. Shiva Rao as well as b, Shiva Rao's
The Framing of India's Constitution Volume III, it appears that on account
of the Study already made by the Britishers and several reports obtained
prior to Independence, the ques-tion of administration of tribal areas did
engage the attention of the Constitution Assembly for a considerable
period. The Constituent Assemb-ly had formed two committees, one for the
tribal people of Assam and other for the excluded and partially excluded
areas in Provinces other than Assam. We are really concerned with the
second Committee which had examined the problems of the tribal people in
all other parts of the country excepting Assam. The Committee in fact had
suggested that the solution to the problem of backward areas lies in
developing the area and not in isolating the same. The Committee had also
suggested that it should be the responsibility of the Centre Co draw up the
schemes for the development of these areas and ensure that such schemes
were duly implemented by the States. But the said report could not be
considered by the Constituent Assembly having been received at a late
stage. The Drafting Committee of the Constitution, however, considered the
suggestion of the Advisory Com-mittee and drafted the Vth Schedule of the
Constitution. We are in the present case really concerned with Clause 6
dealing with alienation and allotment of lands which is extracted
hereinbelow :
</p>
<p id="p_372">6. Alienation and allotment of lands to non-tribals in scheduled areas: (1)
It shall not be lawful for a member of the Scheduled Tribes to transfer any
land in a scheduled area to any person who is not a member of the Scheduled
Tribes;
</p>
<p id="p_373">(2) No land in a scheduled area vested in the State within which such area
is situate shall be allotted to, or settled with, any person who is not a
member of the Scheduled Tribes except in accordance with rules made in that
behalf by the Governor in consultation with the Tribes Advisory Council for
the State.
</p>
<p id="p_374">Clause 7 of the Schedule V deals with money lending which is extracted
hereunder :
</p>
<p id="p_375">"7. Regulation of money - lending in scheduled areas: The Governor may, and
if so advised by the Tribes Advisory Council for the State shall, by public
notification direct that no person shall carry on business as a money-
lender in a scheduled area in the State except under or in accordance with
the conditions of a licence with the conditions of a licence issued by an
officer authorised in this behalf by the Government of the State and every
such direction shall provide that a breach of it shall be an offence, and
shall specify the penalty with which it shall be punishable."
</p>
<p id="p_376">Clause 9 of Schedule V deals with Governor's power in extending the
provision to other areas which is extracted hereunder :
</p>
<p id="p_377">"9, Application of Part II to areas other than scheduled areas : (1) The
Governor may, at any time by public notification, direct that all or any of
the provisions of this Part shall on and from such date as may be specified
in the notification apply in relation to any area in the State inhabited by
members of any Scheduled Tribe other than a scheduled area as they apply in
relation to a scheduled area in the State, and the publication of such
notification shall be conclusive evidence that such provisions have been
duly applied in relation to such other area.
</p>
<p id="p_378">(2) The Governor may by a like notification direct that all or any of the
provisions of this Part shall on and from such date as may be specified in
the notification cease to apply in relation to any area in the State in
respect of which a notification may have been issued under sub-paragraph
(1) of this paragraph."
</p>
<p id="p_379">See the framing of India's Constitution by B. Shiva Rao Volume (III).
</p>
<p id="p_380">We are really concerned with Clause 6 of the Draft Constitution dealing
with the alienation and allotment of lands to non-tribals in the scheduled
areas. The Draft Constitution, therefore, had put two restric-tions,
namely, a member of a Scheduled Tribe was not entitled to transfer land
within the scheduled area to a member of non-scheduled tribe, and so far as
the land vested in the State is concerned, the prohibition was that the
said land belonging to the State should not be allotted or settled in
favour of a non-scheduled tribe except in accordance with the Rules made in
that behalf by the Governor in consultation with the Tribe's Advisory
Council. To the aforesaid Draft several amendments were proposed by several
Speakers. So far as paragraph 6 of Schedule V of the Draft Constitution is
concerned, the proposal in the draft that the land belonging to the State
should not be allotted to or settled with any person who is not a member of
Scheduled Tribe was rejected and, therefore, in the final form in Schedule
V there is no such indication that even the government land within the
Scheduled area should not be allotted to a non-Scheduled Tribe person. B.
Shiva Rao in his book "THE FRAMING OF INDIA'S CON-STITUTION - A STUDY,
dealing with the Scheduled and Tribal Areas has stated that for nearly a
century under British rule special laws were applicable to what were called
'backward areas' and two dangers were there to which subjection to normal
laws would have specially exposed these people, and both arose out of the
fact that they were primitive people, simple unsophisticated and frequently
improvident. There was a risk of their agricultural land passing to the
more civilized section of the popula-tion, and the occupation of the
tribals was for the most part agricultural, and, secondly, they were likely
to get into the 'wiles of the moneylender". The primary aim of government
policy then was to protect them from these two dangers and preserve their
tribal customs : and this was achieved by prescribing special procedures
applicable to these backward areas.
</p>
<p id="p_381">After going through the Constituent Assembly Debates, the Draft
Constitution in relation to Schedule V and the final Constitution as it
emerged, after amendments were brought about, it appears that it was not
the intention of the Constitution Makers to prohibit alienation of the land
vested in the State within the scheduled area in favour of a non-Scheduled
Tribe person. On the other hand, though it was in paragraph (2) of the
Draft Constitution of Schedule V but it stood deleted while bringing the
Vth Schedule in its final form. In this view of the matter we are unable to
accept the contention of Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned senior counsel that the
framers of the Constitution intended to prohibit alienation of the
government land in favour of non- Scheduled Tribe person within the
schedule area which has been engrafted in Vth Schedule of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_382">CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE AS ENGRAFTED IN <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_298">ARTICLE 46</a>, <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_299">ARTICLE 39(b)</a> AS WELL AS
THE DECLARATION 'RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT ADOPTED BY UNITED NATIONS - IN
RELATION TO PROHIBITION OF ALIENATION OF GOVERNMENT LAND WITHIN THE TRIBAL
AREA IN FAVOUR OF A NON-TRIBAL PER-SON

As indicated in the earlier part of this judgment vast track of land lie
within the tribal area which is rich in mineral resources and the entire
mineral resources of the country lie within the schedule area of different
States. In interpreting the provisions of the Regulation and the Constitu-
tional mandate engrafted in Fifth Schedule of the Constitution as well as
different other Articles of the Constitution, it must be borne in mind that
the interpretation should subserve the main object, namely the develop-ment
of the schedule area and the protection of the tribal people from
exploitation of the non-tribal people. It is in this prospective <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_300">Article 46</a>
and <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_301">37(b)</a> of the Constitution have to be looked into. <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_302">Article 46</a> of the
Constitution no doubt mandates the State to promote with special care the
educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people,
and in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and
protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. The said
Article embodies the concept of 'distribu-tive justice' which connotes the
removal of economic inequalities and rectifying the injustice resulting
from dealings or transactions between unequals in society. It means those
who have been deprived of their properties by unconscionable bargaining
should be restored to their property. By taking recourse to this Article
the law invalidating transfers of land belonging to a member of the
Scheduled Tribes and restoration of such land to the transferer was held
constitutionally valid. Similarly, when <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_303">Article 39(b)</a> of the Constitution
enjoins upon the State to have its policy towards securing that the
ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so
distributed as best to subserve the common good, what, it connotes is a
duty on the State for building of a welfare State and an egalitarian social
order. The object is that the basic need of a common man must be fulfilled
and the State should endeavour to change the structure of the society. The
aforesaid provision no doubt, may support a case of nationalisation of
material resources but by no stretch of imagina-tion it can be said that it
enjoins upon the State to exploit the mineral resources within the
Scheduled area by itself or through the Scheduled Tribes alone. The
declaration of 'Right to Development' adopted by the United Nations and
ratified by India no doubt casts a responsibility on the State to promote
and protect social and economic order for development of all people and it
has become a States' responsibility to create conditions favourable to the
realisation of the right to development. In other words it is the State's
responsibility to ensure development and eliminate the obstacles to the
State development. It is the States' responsibility to cradi-cate social
injustice. It is the State's responsibility to see the upliftment of the
tribals within the Scheduled areas. There possibly cannot be; any dispute
with the proposition that the State should formulate its policies and laws
so that the neglected tribals within the Scheduled areas get equal
opportunity with their counterparts in the other sophisticated parts of the
State and State should be empowered to make laws for protection of these
tribals from being exploited by the non-tribals. State should take all
effec-tive steps so as to eradicate inequalities.
</p>
<p id="p_383">The aforesaid scheme of the Constitution in cur considered opinion does not
in any manner suggest that alienation of Government land within the
schedule area was intended to be prohibited in favour of a non-tribal
person.
</p>
<p id="p_384"><a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_304">ARTICLE 244</a> AND FIFTH SCHEDULE OF THE CONSTITUTION :
</p>
<p id="p_385"><a href="/doc/700735/" id="a_305">Article 244(1)</a> of the Constitution makes the provisions of the Fifth
Schedule applicable to the Schedule areas and Scheduled Tribes in all State
other than Assam and Meghalaya. <a href="/doc/700735/" id="a_306">Article 244(1)</a> of the Constitution read
with Fifth Schedule vests with the Governor of the State, the entire
governmental power in respect of the schedule areas within the State, The
framers of the Constitution found the necessity of vesting such power on
the Governors of the State as the people of the Scheduled areas were
culturally backward and their social and other customs are different from
the rest of the country. Which area is the Scheduled area within the State
is determined by the President by an order. By virtue of the Fifth Schedule
of the Constitution the Governor is authorised to direct that any Act of
Parliament or of the Legislature of a State shall not apply to a Scheduled
area or shall apply only subject to exceptions and modifications. The
Governor is also authorised to make regulations to prohibit or restrict
transfer of land by or amongst the members of the Scheduled Tribes,
regulate the allotment of land and regulate the business of moneylending
and all such regulations by the Governor have to be assented to by the
President.
</p>
<p id="p_386">Section 5(2) of Schedule V indicates the amplitude of the Governor's power
to make regulation for peace and good government in the Scheduled area in a
State. It also stipulates the field over which regulations can be framed by
the Governor as contained in Clauses (a) to (c) thereof. The Governor is
the sole judge to decide as to what would be the regulation which would be
necessary for the peace and good government of the area in question. The
ambit of the power of Governor is not restricted to the entries in the
Vllth Schedule and the Governor is empowered even to over-ride an act of
Parliament or of a State Legislature so far as its applicability to the
Scheduled area is concerned. Clauses (a) to (c) of Section 5(2) of Schedule
V indicate that the Governor may frame regula-tion prohibiting or
restricting the transfer of land by or among members of the Scheduled
Tribes within the Scheduled area, regulate the allotment of lands to the
members of the Scheduled Tribes in the area; and regulate the carrying on
of business as money-lender by persons who lend money to the members of the
Scheduled Tribes in such area. It would thus appear, as the Britishers
during the British rule, were really concerned to save the tribals of the
area from being exploited by the non-tribals, after coming into force of
the Constitution, smiliar power was conferred on the Gover-nor to make
regulation for achieving the same object, namely, to save the tribals
belonging to the scheduled area from the exploitation of non- tribals. Any
Regulation framed by the Governor required to be interpreted bear-ing in
mind the aforesaid objective with which the Constitution conferred power on
the Governor under the Fifth Schedule.

<p id="p_399">(b) the appellate authority may entertain an appeal on sufficient cause
being shown after the expiry on the time limit prescribed thereof."
</p>
<p id="p_400">After the amendment in 1970 <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_309">Section 3(1)</a> reads thus :
</p>
<p id="p_401">"(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment, rule or law in
force in the Agency tracts, any transfer of immovable property situated in
the Agency tracts by a person, whether or not such person is a member of
Scheduled Tribe, shall be absolutely null and void, unless such transfer is
made in favour of a person, who is a member of Scheduled tribe or a society
registered or deemed to be registered under the Andhra Pradesh Co-operative
Societies Act, 1964 (Act 7 of 1964), which is composed solely of members of
the Scheduled Tribes.
</p>
<p id="p_402">(b)  Until the contrary is proved, any immovable property situated in the
Agency tracts, and in the possession of a person who is not a member of a
Scheduled Tribe, shall be presumed to have been acquired by such person or
his predecessor in possession through a transfer made to him by a member of
a Scheduled Tribe.
</p>
<p id="p_403">(c) Where a person intending to sell his land is not able to effect such
sale, by reason of the fact that no member of a Scheduled Tribe is willing
to purchase the land on the terms offered by such person, then such person
may apply to the Agent, the Agency Divisional Officer or any other
prescribed officer, for the acquisi-tion of such land by the State
Government, and the Agent, Agency Divisional Officer or the prescribed
officer, as the case may be, may, by order, take over such land on payment
of compensation in accordance with the principles specified in Section 10
of the Andhra Pradesh Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1961 (Act X of
1961), and such land shall thereupon vest b the State Government free all
encumbrances and shall be disposed of in favour of members of the Scheduled
Tribes or a society registered or deemed to be registered under the Andhra
Pradesh Co-opera-tive Societies Act, 1964 (Act 7 of 1964) composed solely
of mem-bers of the Scheduled Tribes or in such other manner and subject to
such conditions as may be prescribed."
</p>
<p id="p_404">So far as the regulation prior to its amendment in 1970 is concerned, a
plain reading thereof clearly indicates that the Governor has framed the
regulation as a regulatory measure putting some embargo on the power of
transfer of a member belonging to Scheduled Tribe in respect of his
immovable property. The said embargo enabled a member of a Scheduled Tribe
to transfer the immovable property only in favour of another member of a
Scheduled Tribe or in favour of a co-operative society composed solely of
members of a Scheduled Tribe. If the transfer was intended to be made in
favour of a non-Scheduled Tribe member then it could be so made but only
with previous sanction of the State Government or with the previous consent
in writing of the agent or any prescribed officer subject to the rules made
in that behalf. Thus immovable property even belonging to a Scheduled Tribe
could be lawfully transferred in favour of a non-Scheduled Tribe member but
only with previous sanction of the State Government. Under the pre-amended
provisions, therefore question of any felter on the powers of the State
Government in transferring government land in favour of a non-tribal did
not arise at all. The question that arises for considera-tion is whether
there has been any change under the provisions of 1970 and has there been a
total prohibition of transfer of any land in favour of a non-Scheduled
Tribe person in the Agency tracts.
</p>
<p id="p_405">Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appel-lant in
this context advanced his argument that the entire object of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_310">Amendment
Act</a> of 1970 was to prohibit totally transfer of any land in favour of a
non-tribal member within the Agency tract and accordingly the word 'person'
b <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_311">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the regulation after the amendment would bring within
its sweep the State Government though ordinarily the expression 'person'
may not bring within its sweep the State Government. According to Mr.
Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for the ap-pellant the word
'person' must be given the widest interpretation so as to bring within its
sweep the State Government which would be consistent with the very object
for which the amendment was brought into force so that the integrity of the
tribal regime is maintained. On being faced with the difficulties in giving
same interpretation to the word 'person' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_312">Section 3(l)(a)</a> throughout
the learned counsel urged that it is permissible to give a different
meaning to the same word used in the same statute depending upon the object
sought to be achieved by the statute and, therefore, it would be within the
principles of interpretation to interpret the word 'person' occuring in
First Part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_313">Section 3(1)</a> (a) to include the State Government whereas the
same word 'person' used in the latter part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_314">Section 3(l)(a)</a> may be
interpreted to mean 'an individual'. In support of this contention the
learned counsel relied upon the decisions of this Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_315">State of West Bengal v. Union of India</a>, [1964] I SCR 371, <a href="/doc/1484835/" id="a_316">Printers (Mysore)
Ltd &amp; Anr. v. .Asstt</a>. Commercial Tax Officer &amp; Others, [1994] 2 SCC 434;
<a href="/doc/1082133/" id="a_317">Commissioner of Income Tax, Bangalore v. J.H. Gotla Vadagin</a>, [1985] 4 SCC
343 and Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui and Others Etc. Etc. v. Union of India &amp; On.
Etc. Etc., [1994] 6 SCC 360. The learned counsel also urged that this Court
has accepted the principle that a wide interpreta-tion has to be given to
the meaning of immovable property while interpret-ing the provisions of the
regulation in order to fulfil the purpose of the tribal area regulation in
the case of P. Rami Reddy &amp; Ors, Etc. v. State of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Anr.
Etc., [1988] Supp. 1 SCR 443, <a href="/doc/1145196/" id="a_318">Lingappa Pochanna Appelwar v. State of
Maharashtra &amp; Anr</a>. Etc., [1985] 1 SCC 479 and Manchegowda and Others v.
State of Kamataka and Others, [1984] 3 SCC 301, and therefore, the same
rules of construction of giving a wider inter-pretation to the expression
'person' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_319">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the regula-tion should be adhered to.
</p>
<p id="p_406">Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, on the
other hand contended that the regulation in question prior to its amendment
does not prohibit transfer of land by any person in favour of non-Scheduled
Tribe person but merely postulates that such a transfer must be with the
consent of the competent authority. Though after the amendment in 1970 a
more stringent measure has been adopted but all the restrictions are in
relation to the land belonging to a Scheduled Tribe. A statutory
presumption has been brought in so that whenever within the Agency tract
any immovable property is found to be in possession of a non-Scheduled
Tribe person then burden would be on the non-Scheduled Tribe person to
establish that he has not come in possession of the land by way of a
transfer from the Scheduled Tribe person. The aforesaid stringent
provisions has obviously been made to achieve the main objective to save
the tribals from the exploitation of non-tribals. But by no stretch of
imagination the restrictions contained in regulation 3(1) even after its
amendment can be said to apply to tie State Government in respect of the
government land. According to the learned counsel Mr. Sudhir Chandra if
interpretation as to the word 'person', as, contended by Dr. Rajiv Dhawan,
learned senior counsel is accepted then it would lead to absurdity and the
provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_320">Section 3(1)</a> (a) would be meaningless. The learned counsel
further contended that there is intrinsic evidence in clause (a) itself to
hold that the word 'person' does not include State. Lastly, the learned
counsel urged that bearing in mind the object with which the constitution
has conferred power on the Governor to frame regulation and the object with
which the Governor has framed the regulation, there is no imperative to
construe the word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_321">Section 3</a>{l)(a) of the regulation to include
the State Government. Such an interpretation according to the learned
counsel for the respondents would go against the concept of upliftment of
the tribals within the tribal area inasmuch as even the State Govenunent
would be denuded of its power of transferring government land in favour of
any non-Scheduled Tribe person or organisation even for the purpose of
setting up of a hospital or any other philanthropic purpose. When mines and
minerals lie in abundance mostly in the tribal areas and vest in the State
Government, if the embargo contained in regulation 3(l)(a) applies to the
State Government by interpreting the word 'person' to include the State
Government then there cannot be any exploitation of mineral resour-ces in
the country unless it is done either by the State itself or through the
Scheduled Tribe person and such interpretation would be grossly detrimental
to the general upliftment of the tribal people and, therefore, the counsel
suggests that such an interpretation would not be given to the word
'person' in regulation 3(l)(a).
</p>
<p id="p_407">In view of the rival submissions at the Bar the crucial question arises for
consideration is how the word 'person' in first part of regulation 3(l)(a)
is to be interpreted? In other words the very word 'person' used in
regulation 3(l)(a) itself whether should be interpreted differently and
whether such an interpretation is necessary to subserve the object for
which the regulation has been brought forward. As has been stated earlier,
the history of legislation as discussed, treating the tribal areas
different from the other areas is basically intended to save the tribal
people from being exploited by the non-tribals. It is with that objective
<a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_322">Article 244</a> of the Constitution made the Fifth Schedule applicable to
administer scheduled area and tribal area and the Fifth Schedule of the
Constitution, in turn, conferred power on the Governor to notify the laws
made by Parliament or by the legislature of the State to apply or not to
apply and further Governor has been conferred power to make regulation for
the peace and good government of any area within a State. Such wide power
has been conferred upon the Governor which is plenary in nature so that
Governor can by regulation prevent exploitation of the tribals from the
non-tribals. When such legislations made by Governor in exercise of power
has been challenged, Courts have upheld the validity of the same on the
ground that it is intended to save the tribals from the other non-tribals
in the area who usually take advantage of the simplicity and ignorance of
the tribal people. But it is difficult to accept the contention of Dr.
Rajiv Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, that the
constitutional scheme intended total prohibition of transfer of even the
government land in favour of the non-tribal In P. Rama Reddy's case (supra)
this Court after tracing the history of the Regulation, namely, Andhra
Pradesh Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation, 1959 (Regulation I of
1959) and the subsequent amendment thereto in the amending Regulation of
1970 came to the conclusion that 1959 Regulation was amended as
difficulties were ex-perienced by the Government in implementing the
ejectment procedures under the said Regulation, inasmuch as it was not
always easy for the concerned authority to ascertain the origin of the
right under which the non-tribal is claiming possession and whether the
land under possession of a non-tribal was previously acquired from a tribal
or not. According to the learned judges the changes effected by the amended
Regulation were :
</p>
<p id="p_408">(i) A rule of presumption was introduced to the effect that unless the
contrary is proved, where a non-tribal is in possession of land in the
Scheduled areas, he or his predecessors-in-interest, shall be deemed to
have acquired it through transfer from a tribal;
</p>
<p id="p_409">(ii) Transfers of land in Scheduled Areas in favour of non-tribals shall be
wholly prohibited in future;
</p>
<p id="p_410">(iii) Non-tribals holding lands in the Scheduled Areas shall be prohibited
from transferring their lands in favour of persons other than tribals. Only
partitions and devolution by succession of lands held by them shall be
permitted; and

</p><p id="p_411">(iv) Where a tribal or non-tribal is unable to sell his land to a tribal on
reasonable terms, it shall be open to him to surrender the land to
Government who shall thereupon be obliged to acquire it on payment of
appropriate compensation."
</p>
<p id="p_412">Thus, the changes brought about by the amended Regulation of 1970 were
essentially intended to facilitate effective enforcement of 1959 Regulation
and the object of the amended regulation cannot be held to be total
prohibition of alienation of all land including a government land within
the scheduled area in favour of a non-tribal. Bearing in mind the aforesaid
object of the amended regulation and the Constitutional scheme the word
'person' used in regulation 3 (l)(a) has to be construed and while so
construing certain principles of statutory interpretation have also to be
borne in mind.
</p>
<p id="p_413">WHETHER THE WORD 'PERSON' IN THE REGULATION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED
DIFFERENTLY AND IN THE FIRST PART OF REGULATION 3(1 )(a) IT SHOULD BE
INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE STATE WHEREAS IN THE OTHER PART II SHOULD BE INTER-
PRETED TO MEAN A NATURAL PERSON.
</p>
<p id="p_414">Or. Rajiv Dhawan, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant
contended that the word 'person' occurring in first part of <a href="/doc/1239469/" id="a_323">Section 3(a)</a> of
the Regulation should be construed to mean the 'State' so that the real
object of prohibiting alienation of any land within the scheduled area in
favour of a non-tribal person can be achieved. According to the learned
counsel it is a permissible rule of construction of a statute to construe
the same words used in the same statute differently depending upon the
context in which it is used and the object sought to be achieved. Mr.
Sudhir Chander, learned counsel appearing for the respondents on the other
hand contended that ordinarily a particular word used in a particular
statute should receive the same meaning unless and until it is necessary to
ascribe a different meaning to achieve any particular objective for which
the statute is intended. But according to the learned counsel it was not
the intention of the Constitution makers to prohibit alienation of any land
within the scheduled area in favour of a non tribal person and on the other
hand the objective was to put restrictions on the tribal people from
transferring their land in favour of non-tribal person so that the tribal
people can be saved from being exploited by the sophisticated non-tribals
people. This being the objective, there is no necessity to construe the
word 'person' in first part of clause 3(1) (a) of the Regulation to include
the State Government also.
</p>
<p id="p_415">It is a cardinal rule of construction of statute that the statute must be
read as a whole and construction should be put to all the parts together
and not of anyone part only by itself. Every clause of a statute is
required to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses of
the Act so that so far as possible the meaning of the enactment of the
whole statute would be consistent. When legislature uses the same word in
different parts of the same Section or statute, there is a presumption that
the word is used in the same sense throughout. It was so held by this Court
in the following cases : <a href="/doc/694936/" id="a_324">Suresh Chand v. Gulam Chisti</a>, [1990] 1 SCR 186;
<a href="/doc/738746/" id="a_325">Mohd. Shafi v. Seventh Additional District &amp; Sessions Judge, Allahabad &amp;
Ors</a>.t [1977] 2 SCR 464; <a href="/doc/1999892/" id="a_326">Raghubans Narain Singh v. The Uttar Pradesh
Government</a> through Collector of Bijnor, [1967] 1 SCR 489. But the aforesaid
presump-tion can easily be displaced by the context in which the particular
word is used. In Farrell v. Alexander, [1976] 2 All England Report 721, it
was stated that where the draftsman uses the same word or phrase in similar
context, he must be presumed to intend it in each place to bear the same
meaning. Venkatarama Ayyar, J. in the case of <a href="/doc/1543290/" id="a_327">Shamrao Vishnu Parulekar v.
District Magistrate, Thana</a>, [1956] SCR 644 discussing the aforesaid rule
has said The rule of construction contended for is well settled but that is
only one element in deciding what the true import of enactment is to
ascertain which is necessary to have regard to the purpose being the
particular provision and its setting in the scheme of the statute."
</p>
<p id="p_416">In Madras Electric Supply Corporation Ltd. (in Liquidation) v. Boardland
(Inspector of Taxes), All England Law Reports, [1955] 1 Page 753, Lord
Macdermott pointed out "the presumption that the same word is used in the
same sense throughout the same enactment acknowledges the virtues of an
orderly and consistent use of language, but it must yield to the
requirements of the context and it is perhaps at its weakest when the word
in question is of the kind that readily draws its precise import, its range
of meaning, from its immediate setting on the nature of the subject with
regard to which it is employed. But this Court has accepted the principle
that the same word used at different places in the same clause of the same
Section may not bear the same meaning at each place having regard to the
context of its use. In fact in the case of <a href="/doc/744830/" id="a_328">Maharaj Singh v. State of U.P. &amp;
Ors</a>., [1977] 1 SCR 1072, the word Vest' used in the same Section of U.P.
Jamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act was interpreted to mean although
the vesting in the State was absolute but the vesting in the Sabha was
limited to possession and management. This case illustrates that even a
word which is used more than once in sub-section of a section may connote
and denote divergent things pending upon the context. Therefore, though on
principle the contention of Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned senior counsel
appearing for the appellant that the word 'person' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_329">Section 3(l)(a)</a>
of the Regulation can be given different meaning in the first part than the
meaning to the same word given in the second part of regulation may not be,
taken exception, but the question arises whether in the constitutional
scheme under which the regulation has been framed and the object and
purpose for which the regulation has been framed by the Governor, does it
warrant to give a different meaning to the same word 'person' in different
part of the regulation. It may not be out of place to bear in mind the
normal rule that general words in a statute must receive a general
construction unless there is some thing in the act itself such as subject
matter with which the act is dealing or the context in which the words are
used to show the intention of the legislature that they must be given a
restrictive or wider meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_417">Let us examine some of the authorities cited at the Bar in this regard. In
Appiin v. Race Relations Board, [1974] 2 All ER 73, the word 'person' was
defined to include a local authority in the context in which the word has
been construed. In the case of <a href="/doc/1484835/" id="a_330">Printers (Mysore) Ltd. and Anr. v. Asstt</a>.
Commercial Tax Officer &amp; Ors. (supra) relied upon by Dr. Rajiv Dhawan,
learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellant, the question for
consideration was whether the expression 'goods' occuring in <a href="/doc/486532/" id="a_331">Section 8(3)</a>
</p><p id="p_418">(b) of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_332">Central Sales Tax Act</a> within the phrase 'for use by him in the
manufacture or processing of goods for sale' does take within itself the
newspaper and this Court answered the question agreeing with the view taken
by the Madras and Kerala High Courts that the goods does include newspaper.
This Court relied upon the ratio in T.M. Kanias' case [1968] 2 SCR 103 and
Pushpa Devi's case [1990] 2 SCC 134 and held that it is well settled where
the context does not permit or where it would lead to absurd or unintended
result, the definition of an expression need not be mechani-cally applied.
In Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui &amp; Ors. Etc. Etc. v. Union of India and Ors. Etc.
Etc. [1994] 6 SCC 360, on which Dr. Rajiv Dhawan relied very strongly, the
majority view held the word "vest' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_333">Section 3</a> of the Act has shades
taking colour from the context in which it is used. It does not necessarily
mean absolute vesting in every situation and is capable of bearing the
meaning of a limited vesting being limited in tittle as well as duration.
It was further held the meaning of the word Vest' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_334">Section 3</a> has to
be determined in the light of the text of the statute and the purpose of
its use. Ultimately the Court held while upholdirg the statue that the
vesting of the disputed area in the Central Govt. by virtue of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_335">Section 3</a> of
the Act is limited as a statutory receiver, with the duty for its
management and administration according to <a href="/doc/113739/" id="a_336">Section 7</a> requiring maintenance
of status quo therein in Sub Section (2) of <a href="/doc/113739/" id="a_337">Section 7</a> of the Act. Whereas
the vesting of the adjacent area other than the disputed area acquired by
the Act in the Central Government by virtue of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_338">Section 3</a> of the Act is
absolute with the power of management and administration thereof in
accordance with sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/113739/" id="a_339">Section 7</a> of the Act till its further
vesting in any authority or other body or trustees of any trust in
accordance with <a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_340">Section 6</a> of the Act. The minority view, however,
construing <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_341">Section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/989772/" id="a_342">4(1)</a> held that the area includes the whole bundle
movable and immovable property under the area specified in the Schedule and
all other rights and interests therein or arising thereof and the whole
bundle of property and right vests by reason of <a href="/doc/911526/" id="a_343">Section 4(2)</a> in the Central
Government free and discharged from all encumbrances and held the Act to be
unconstitutional as the provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_344">Section 3</a>, <a href="/doc/252634/" id="a_345">4</a> and <a href="/doc/486532/" id="a_346">8</a> were held to be
invalid. The majority view of the Court expressed through Verma, J, held
that a construction which a language of the statute can bear and promote
larger national purpose must be preferred to a strict literal construction
tending to promote factionalism and discord. But on examining the
provisions of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_347">Section 3(1)</a> (a) of the Regulation after its amendment I am
unable to persuade myself to interpret the word 'person' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_348">Section
3(1)</a><a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_349">00</a> of the regula-tion differently as in my view neither the context in
which the word has been used calls for such an interpretation nor the
interpretation of giving a literal meaning to the word would lead to any
absurdity or unintended result nor even it can be said to be promoting
larger national purpose. In P, Rami Reddy's case [1988] Supp, 1 SCR 443,
the validity of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_350">Section 3(1)</a> of the amended regulation had been assailed
and this Court tracing a short history of legislation came to hold that a
legislation which in spirit sense and substance aims at restoration of the
tribal land which originally belong to the tribals but which passed into
the hands of noa tribals cannot be characterised as unreasonable. The Court
sustained the legislation on the ground that in the absence of protection
economically stronger non tribals would in course of time devour of the
available lands and wipe out the very identity of the tribals who cannot
survive in the absence of the only source of livelihood they presently
have. The Court also noticed the fact that under the pro-amended provisions
of the regulation (Regulation 1 of 1959) transfer of immovable properties
situated in the scheduled areas from a member of a Scheduled Tribe to non
tribals without previous sanction of the State Government was prohibited.
The amendment in question in the year 1970 was introduced to facilitate
effective enforcement of the regula-tions of 1959. In other words, transfer
of land in scheduled area in favour of non tribal became prohibited and non
tribals holding land in the scheduled area were prohibited from
transferring the land in favour of persons other than tribals and further
the statutory presumption was introduced in regulation 3(1) (b) casting
burden on the non tribals when he is found to be in possession of a land
within the scheduled area to establish that he has not acquired the same
from a scheduled tribe. In the aforesaid case the Court did not accept the
argument advanced on behalf of the non-tribal that the expression 'land'
has been used in its restricted sense in paragraph 5(2) (a) of Schedule V
of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_419">In the aforesaid P.R. Reddy's case (supra) the Court also took note of the
earlier case in Manchegowda &amp; Ors. v. State of Kamataka &amp; Ors,t [1984] 3
SCC 301 where constitutional validity of a similar provision in respect of
tribal area of Karnataka was under challenge and the Court upheld the
constitutionality with an eye to preserve and protect the tribals in the
land in the tribal areas. But in none of the aforesaid cases the question
of power of the government to transfer the government land had come up for
consideration. The Constitutional scheme embodied in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_351">Article 15(4)</a> and
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_352">Article 46</a> as well as the power conferred upon the Governor of the State
under Schedule V of the Constitution are intended to preserve and protect
the interest of the tribal in the tribal areas. It cannot be said by any
stretch of imagination that all lands within the tribal areas vest in the
tribal people. State is the paramount owner of lands and in the garb of
preventing the exploitation of tribals from the non-tribals so far as the
lands belonging to the tribals are concerned, the State cannot be denuded
of its power to exploit resources which vest with the State. Judged from
this angle there is no justification for interpreting the word 'person' in
the first part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_353">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the regulation to include State and,
therefore, the prohibitions and restrictions contained in the regulation
would not apply to the lands belonging to the State. The word 'person' used
in the federal statute imposing tax on persons selling liquor came up for
consideration in the case of State of Ohio v. Guy T. Helvering, 85 U.S.
Supreme Court Reports 78 Law Edition 1307, it was held that the State
engaging in the selling spiritual liquors is not immune from the excise tax
imposed by the Federal Government on those engaging in such business, since
in doing it is not performing any governmental function. It was also held
that a State is embraced within the meaning of the term 'person' as used in
a statute imposing an excise tax on persons selling liquor and the word
person shall be construed to mean and include a partnership, association,
company or corporation, as well as a natural person. In the case of United
States of America v. Cooper Corporation et al, US Supreme Court Reports 85
Law Edition 1071 the word 'person' used in Section 7 of the Sherman anti-
trust Act came up for consideration and it was held that United States is
not a person entitled to maintain an action for treble damages within the
mean-ing of <a href="/doc/113739/" id="a_354">Section 7</a> of the Act. It has been held in the aforesaid case
that it may be assumed, in the absence of any indication to the contrary,
that the term 'person' when used in different sections of a statute, was
employed throughout the statute in the same, and not in different senses.
It was also held in the aforesaid case that it is not for the Courts to
indulge in the business of policy making in the field of Federal anti-trust
legislation, but their function ends with the endeavour to ascertain from
the words used, construed in the light of the relevant material, what was
in fact the intent of the Congress. In the case of <a href="/doc/544641/" id="a_355">Union of India v. Jubbi
and Dunia Etc</a>., [1968] 1 SCR 447, the question that arose for consideration
is whether under the provisions of Himachal Pradesh Abolition of Big Landed
Estates and Land Reforms Act, 1953 whether tenants under the Union of India
as the land owner can acquire proprietary rights. Repelling the arguments
advanced by the Union of India that the Act is not intended to be
applicable to the lands to the Union this Court held that the object of the
Act was to abolish big landed estate and alleviate the conditions of oc-
cupancy tenants by abolishing the proprietary rights of the land-owners in
them and vesting such rights in the tenants and that being the object of
the legislature it is hardly likely that it would make any discrimination
between the State and the Citizens in the matter of the application of the
Act, The ratio of all the aforesaid cases can be summed up thus : though
ordinarily a particular word used in a statute should be given the same
meaning but it is permissible to construe the said word differently
depending upon the object of the Act and the scheme of the Act and the
purpose sought to be achieved by Act.
</p>
<p id="p_420">Coming now to the core question of interpretation of the word 'person' in
regulation 3(l)(a) under the Amended Act if word 'person' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_356">Section
3(l)(a)</a> is interpreted to mean to include the State then the expression
'whether or not such a person is a member of a Scheduled Tribe becomes
meaningless as the State can never be a member of the Scheduled Tribe. If a
literal meaning to the word 'person' is given in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_357">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of the
regulation then the prohibitions on restrictions contained therein would
apply with full force to inter se transfer of land between the Scheduled
Tribe and non-Scheduled Tribe and such an interpretation would subserve the
main object of the legislation, namely, to save the tribal people from
being exploited upon by the non-tribal people. If the constitutional scheme
embodied in Articles 15(4) and 244 as well as in the Fifth Schedule is
intended to save the tribal people from being exploited upon by the non-
tribal both in relation to their lands as well as in the matter of taking
loans from the moneylenders, there is no obligation to construe the word
'person' to include the State in the first part of <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_358">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the
regulation. In view of the history of legislation already traced in the
earlier part of this judgment, it is crystal clear that the prohibitions
and restrictions never intended for the lands belonging to the government
and the provisions both prior to the Constitution and under the
Constitution are intended to deal with the tribal people separately so that
better attention can be bestowed for their social and economical
upliftment. It is with this objective Fifth Schedule of the Constitution
conferred power on the Gover-nor not only to indicate which laws made by
the Parliament and the State legislature would apply within the Scheduled
area and which laws would not apply, but further to make regulation for
administration of the tribal areas for peace and good government in respect
of a scheduled area. The matters indicated in Sub-Section (2) of Section 5
of V Schedule of the Constitution as well as the general power of the
Governor to frame regulation contained in Sub-Section (1) of Section 5 of V
Schedule, neither expressly nor by necessary implication prohibit transfer
of government land in favour of a non-tribal within the scheduled area nor
there is any mandate embodied in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_359">Article 15(4)</a> or in <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_360">Article 244</a>
prohibiting the transfer of government land in favour of a non-Scheduled
Tribe person within the scheduled area. In this perspective I do not find
any force in the contention of Dr. Rajiv Dhawan to interpret the word
'person' in the first part of regulation 3(l)(a) to include the State and
to interpret person in the second part of said <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_361">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the
regulation to mean an ordinary in-dividual. In my considered opinion the
expression 'person' used in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_362">Section 3(l)(a)</a> of the regulation should have
its natural meaning throughout the Section to mean 'natural person' and it
does not include the State. In other words, the State is not denuded of its
power in the matter of exploiting its mineral resources within the
scheduled area by a grant or renewal of lease even in favour of non-tribal
persons and the restrictions and embargo contained in regulation 3(l)(a) is
not applicable to the State in dealing with the land belonging to the
State.
</p>


<p id="p_421">In this view of the matters, it must be held that the provisions of the
Regulation have not been contravened by granting mining leases in favour of
the Non-Scheduled Tribe person within the Schedule Area. Notwithstanding my
conclusion that the word 'person' occuring in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_363">Section 3(1)</a> of the
Regulation does not include 'State' and as such the mining leases granted
in favour of different persons do not contravene the provisions of the
Regulation but I am inclined to agree with the observa-tions made by
Brother Ramaswamy, J. that the lessees should be required to spend a part
of the profit for the upliftment of the tribals and for maintaining the
ecology in the scheduled areas. Notwithstanding the con-stitutional
obligation of the Governor to make special provision for ameliorating the
economic status of the tribal people so as to assimilate them into the
national main stream, nothing tangible appears to have been achieved in
this regard even after 50 years of independence. The tribal people who
constitute a substantial majority of the Indian population still spend
their time in jungles and other inexcessible areas and sufficient
legislative and executive measure has not been taken for improving the
living conditions of these tribal people. Since the mining activities are
being carried out mostly within the scheduled areas it is the duty of the
State to see that a part of the profits earned by the lessees should be
spent for ameliorating the living conditions of the tribals by the lessees
themselves. It is in this context brother Ramaswamy, J. has made some
observations at pages 141 and 142 of the judgment which have my general
concurrence but the said objective has to be achieved by appropriate
legislation making it compulsory for the lessees within the tribal area to
spend a portion of the income arising out of the mining business for the
general upliftment of the living conditions of the tribal people. This
should be in addition to the royalty and other cess under different
legislations. The State may also consider the question of incorporating
some provisions in the leases itself for achieving the aforesaid
objectives,

GRANT/RENEWAL OF MINING LEASES AND CONTINUANCE OF THE MINING OPERATIONS
WHETHER CONTRAVENES THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSERVATION ACT?
</p>
<p id="p_422">Mr. Dhavan, the learned senior counsel for appellant contended that the
<a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_364">Conservation Act</a> has been enacted for conservation of forest and for
matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. Deforesta-
tion having caused ecological imbalance and having lead to environmental
deterioration, with a view to checking further deforestation, the President
promulgated the Forest (Conservation) Ordinance, 1980 on 25th October,
1980. The said Ordinance had made the prior approval of the Central
government necessary for deforestation of reserved forests or for use of
forest land for non-forest purposes. The aforesaid Ordinance was replaced
by the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_365">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 (No. 69 of 1980). Under <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_366">Section 2</a> of
the said Act which being with a non-obstante clause to the effect
"Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in
force in a State" no State Government except with the prior approval of the
Central Government can direct that any forest land or any purposes.
Explanation to <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_367">Section 2</a> provides the meaning of the expression 'non-forest
purpose'. Clause (b) of the said Explanation stipulates that any purpose
other than re- afforestation would be a non-forest purpose. This being the
position and mining activity being admittedly a non-forest pur-pose, the
land in question could not have been permitted to be used for such non-
forest purpose without the prior approval of the Central Govern-ment as
required by <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_368">Section 2</a> of the Conservation Act. The High Court according to
the learned counsel, committed serious error in coming to the conclusion
that the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_369">Conservation Act</a> applies only to the reserved forests. Dr. Dhawan
contended that the word 'forest' must be given a wider meaning and should
include all forests commonly known as forest and, therefore, even if the
area on which mining activities are carried on by the respondent do not
form a part of reserved forests in asmuchas no notifica-tion under <a href="/doc/729813/" id="a_370">Section
20</a> of the Indian Forest Act has been issued but all the same the provisions
of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_371">Forest (Conservation) Act</a> would become ap-plicable. <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_372">The Conservation
Act</a> was further amended by Act 69 of 1988 with Presidential assent on
17.10.1988 and was published in the Gazette of India on 19.12.1988. By way
of amendment Clause (3) was inserted to Section (2) which reads thus :
</p>
<p id="p_423">(iii) that any forest land or any portion thereof may be assigned by way of
lease or otherwise to any private person or to any authority, corporation,
agency or any other organisation not owned, managed or controlled by
Government;
</p>
<p id="p_424">Dr. Dhawan, the learned counsel contended that in view of the aforesaid
provision no lease could be granted or renewed after 19.12.1988 in favour
of any authority without the prior approval of the Central Government.
Consequently the impugned leases must be held to be invalid as having
contravened the provisions of <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_373">Section 2</a> of the Conservation Act. The High
Court in the impugned judgment, however, proceeded on the basis that the
<a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_374">Conservation Act</a> is applicable only to the reserved forests and does not
apply to any other category of forests. Bearing in mind the objects sought
to be achieved by the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_375">Conservation Act</a>, we see no justifica-tion to give a
restrictive meaning to the expression 'forest land' used in <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_376">Section 2</a> of
the Conservation Act. On the other hand the expression 'forest land' should
be given an extended meaning to cover a track of land covered with trees,
shrubs, vegetation and undergrowth under mingled with trees with pastures,
be it of natural growth or man made forestation. This Court in the case of
Supreme Court monitoring Committee v. Mussoorie Dehradun Dev. Aty. &amp; Ors.,
in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 749 of 1995 has held "that the term 'forest
land' has not been defined under the Indian forest Act, 1927 or the 1980
Act and, therefore, have to be understood as including an extensive track
of land covered with trees and undergrowth sometimes intermingled with
pasture, i.e. it will have to be understood in the broad dictionary sense.
So understood any area which the State considers to be forest and is
governed under that law will also be subject to <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_377">Section 2(ii)</a> of the 1980
Act". Viewed in this light, any land which the State of U.P. by
Notification declares to be a forest would be governed under Section (ii)
of the 1980 Act. <a href="/doc/187366700/" id="a_378">In T.N. Godavaraman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>,,
in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 202 of 1995, the question relating to
protection and conservation of the forests throughout the country was
considered by this Court, the Court observed : "<a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_379">The Forest Conservation
Act</a>, 1980 was enacted with a view to check further deforestation which
ultimately results in ecological imbalance: and therefore, the provisions
made therein for the conservation of forest and for matters connected
therewith, must apply to all forests irrespective of the nature of
ownership or classification thereof, The word 'forest: must be understood
according to its dictionary meaning. This description covers all
statutorily recognised forests, whether designated as reserved, protected
or otherwise for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1766041/" id="a_380">Section 2(i)</a> of the Forest Conservation
Act. The term 'forest land', occurring in <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_381">Section 2</a>, will not only include
'forest' as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded
as forest in the Govern-ment record irrespective of the ownership. This is
how it has to be understood for the purpose of <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_382">Section 2</a> of the Act. The
provisions enacted in the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_383">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980 for the
conservation of forests and the matters connected therewith must apply
clearly to all forests so under-stood irrespective of the ownership or
classification thereof." The Court also in the aforesaid case gave a
general direction to the following effect: "In view of the meaning of the
word 'forest' in the Act, it is obvious that prior approval of the Central
Government is required for any non-forest activity within the area of any
'forest'. In accordance with <a href="/doc/216578/" id="a_384">Section 2</a> of the Act all on-going activity
within any forest in any State throughout the country, without the prior
approval of the Central Government, must cease forthwith. It is, therefore,
clear that the running of saw mills of any land including veneer or ply-
wood mills, and mining of any mineral are non-forest purposes and are,
therefore, not permissible without prior approval of the central
Government. Accordingly, any such activity is prima facie violation of the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_385">Forest Conservation Act</a>, 1980. Every State Government
must promptly ensure total cessation of all such ac-tivities forthwith." In
the case of Divisional Forest Officer and Others v. 5. Nageswaramma,
[1996],6 SCC 442, this Court has held that renewal of any mining lease
could be done only in accordance with the law prevailing on the date of
renewal and, therefore, if any renewal of mining lease has been done in
violation of <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_386">Section 2</a> of the Forest Conservation Act, in asmuchas no prior
approval of the Central Government has been obtained, then such renewal is
invalid and inoperative.
</p>
<p id="p_425">In view of the afroresaid legal position it is difficult to sustain the
conclusion of the High Court in the impugned judgment that the Conser-
vation Act applies only to a reserved forest. The said conclusion of the
High Court therefore, is set aside. Consequently, it must be held that no
mining activities can continue on any forest land unless prior approval of
the Central Government is obtained as required under <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_387">Section 2</a> of the
Conservation Act. Mr, Sudhir Chandra, learned counsel appearing for the
respondents contended that he does not dispute the proposition that the
expression 'forest land' in the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_388">Conservation Act</a> should be given wider
meaning and that mining activities over the forest land cannot continue
unless prior approval of the Central Government has been obtained in
accordance with <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_389">Section 2</a> of the Conservation Act. He vehemently con-tended
that the mining activities of the respondents are not over any forest land
and the appellants have not produced any material from which this Court can
come to the conclusion that it forms a part of the forest even going by the
extended meaning of the term 'forest'. As has been stated earlier while
narrating the pleadings of the parties, the private respondents have all
along asserted that the mining activities in question and their leasehold
area over which mining activities are continuing do not form a part of the
forest. The State Government though has filed an affidavit but no assertion
has been made as to whether the mining areas with which we are concerned in
these appeals formed a part of the forest land and thereby required the
previous approval of the Central Government for being used for mining
purpose. On the other hand, the affidavit of the Government indicates that
the mining leases in favour of the private respondents have been granted in
accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules and there has been
no contravention of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_390">Forest Conservation Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_426">In this state of affairs even though we are of the considered opinion that
the forest land in <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_391">Section 2</a> of the Conservation Act would receive an
extended meaning to include within its sweep an extensive track of land
covered with trees, shrubs, vegetation and undergrowth undermingled with
trees with pastures, be it of natural growth or man made forestation, yet
unless and until it is so determined by the State Government that the
mining activities of the respondents are being carried on over forest land
it will not be possible to hold that the provisions of <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_392">Section 2</a> of the
Conservation Act gets attracted. In this view of the matter, the only
possible direction which this Court can issue in the facts and
circumstances of the present case is that the State of Andhra Pradesh
through its officers of the Forest Department should immediately inspect
the mining areas of the private respondents and find out whether the lands
covered under the mining leases in question form a part of the forest land
and if it comes to the conclusion that it is part and parcel of the forest
land and no prior approval of the Central Government has been obtained for
carrying out the mining activities then immediate direction should be
issued to the respondents to stop the mining activities which would be in
consonance with the general direction issued by this Court in Godavaraman's
case (supra). We are forced to issue such direction in the case in hand as
on the materials produced before us by the appellant and in view of the
denial in the counter-affidavit filed by the private respondents as well as
the affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Andhra Pradesh, it has not
been possible to come to the conclusion affirmatively that the land in
question formed a part and parcel of the forest land.
</p>
<p id="p_427">WHETHER THE LEASES CAN BE SAID TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
(PROTECTION) ACT 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_428">The aforesaid Act (hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_393">Environment Act</a>') was
enacted by the Parliament as it was thought necessary to protect and
improve the environment and to prevent hazards to human beings other living
creatures, plants and property. A decision in this respect had been taken
in June 1970 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held
at Stockholm in June, 1972 and India had participated in the said
conference. The Objects and reasons of the Act indicates that the decline
in the environmental quality has been evidenced by increasing pollution,
loss of vegetal cover and biological diversity, excessive con-centrations
of harmful chemicals in the ambient atmosphere and in food chains, growing
risks of environmental accidents and threats to life support systems and,
therefore, word community's resolve to protect and enhance the
environmental quality found expression in the decisions taken at the United
Nations Conference on Human Environment held in Stockholm in June, 1972.
though in India there were several legislations for environmen-tal
protection but a need for a general legislation became increasingly evident
and, therefore, an enactment was passed. At the outset it may be made clear
that in the Writ Petition filed before the High Court no complaint has been
made with regard to the violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_394">Environment
Protection Act</a> in the matter of granting lease or allowing the mining
operation to be carried on. In this Court, however, Dr. Dhawan, learned
senior counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the large scale
mining operations within the tribal area pollutes the environ-ment in the
tribal area and, therefore, the Central Government is under a statutory
obligation to protect the environment and coordinate the ac-tivities of the
State Government in the matter of granting mining leases within the tribal
area which must be subject to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_395">Environment Protection
Act</a>. And since no steps have been taken by the State Government in this
regard, the leases must be held to be invalid. According to Dr. Rajiv
Dhawan, learned senior counsel when several industries have been closed
down by this Court on the ground that the existence of such industries are
hazardous to human life and thereby violates <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_396">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution, the mining leases within the tribal areas must also be
annulled. As the mining activities pollutes the tribal atmosphere, natural
flora and fauna of the area and becomes hazardous to the human life within
the tribal area, the said activities must be stopped. In support of this
contention the learned counsel placed reliance on the decisions of this
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/451240/" id="a_397">Tarun Bharat Sangh, Alwar v. Union of India &amp; Others</a>.,
[1992] Supp (2) SCC 448, <a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_398">Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.t [1991] 1
SCC 598. Mr. Sudhir Chandra appearing for the respondents contended that
neither in the High Court nor in the Special Leave Petition in this court
basic facts have been averred to indicate how the mining lease in question
infringe the provisions of the environmental laws. He further contended
that the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant
connot have any application particularly in the absence of any basic facts.
Having examined the rival contentions on this score, we find sufficient
force in the contention of Mr. Sudhir Chandra. It is undisputed that no
averment has been made in the Writ Petition filed before the High Court
alleging infraction of the environmental laws and necessarily, therefore,
no argument had been advanced and the High Court had not considered this
question at all. Even in the Special Leave petition filed in this Court
only infringement of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_399">Conservation Act</a>, the provisions
of Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation and the provisions of Section
11(5) of the Mine and Minerals Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_400">Development Act</a> have been
alleged. In paragraph 2 of the Special Leave Petition the questions of law
enumerated for consideration also do not contain any question on the
violation of environmental laws. In the absence of any allegation and basic
datas and consequently lack of opportunity to the respondents to prove the
same it would not be safe for this Court to embark upon an inquiry and come
to a conclusion as to whether allowing the mining operations within the
tribal area has resulted in the infringe-ment of the Environment protection
Act. It would, therefore, be unneces-sary to deal with the decisions cited
by Dr. Rajiv Dhawan in support of his contention. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_401">The Environment Act</a>
consists of four Chapters with 26 Section therein. Chapter-I contains the
definitions, Chapter II contains General power of the Central Government,
Chapter III contains the prevention, control and abatement of environmental
pollution, and Chapter IV con-tains misc. provisions. Environmental
pollution has been defined in <a href="/doc/6812/" id="a_402">Section 2(c)</a> to mean the presence in the
environment of any environmental pol-lutant. "Environmental pollutant" has
been defined in <a href="/doc/1047784/" id="a_403">Section 2(b)</a> to mean any solid, liquid or gaseous substance
present in such concentration as may be, or tend to be injurious to
environment. <a href="/doc/206748/" id="a_404">Section 7</a> prohibits persons carrying on industry from emission
or discharge of environmental pol-lutants in excess of such standards, as
may be prescribed. "Prescribed" had been defined in <a href="/doc/1408394/" id="a_405">Section 2(g)</a> means
prescribed by rules made under this Act. Thus the Rules standard had to be
indicated, permissible limit of emission environmental pollutant has to be
indicated. <a href="/doc/1631518/" id="a_406">Section 8</a> deals with the embargo on handling of hazardous
substances. <a href="/doc/1684798/" id="a_407">Section 19</a> confers power on the persons empowered by the
Central Government to enter and inspect any of the premises for the
purposes enumerated under Clauses (a) to (c) of Sub-section (1) of Section
</p><p id="p_429">10. <a href="/doc/1182141/" id="a_408">Section 15</a> provides the penalty for contravention of the provisions of
the Act and the rules made thereunder. <a href="/doc/1684798/" id="a_409">Section 19</a> confers power on the
Court to take cognizance of any offence on a complaint being made on that
behalf. <a href="/doc/222361/" id="a_410">Section 24</a> is the overriding provisions of the Act notwithstanding
any thing inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment. The combined
reading of the aforesaid provisions indicate that there must be necessary
particulars to find out whether there has been any emission of the
environmental pol-lutant in excess of the standard fixed under the rules
and it is only then the question of complaining before a court and taking
cognizance of the same would arise. If the averments in the Special Leave
Petition are examined from the aforesaid point it would be seen that there
is no iota of material to come to the conclusion that on account of the
mining operations conducted by the respondents there has been any emission
of environmen-tal pollutant in excess of the standard prescribed under the
Rules, nor it is possible to hold that there has been any environmental
pollution on account of carrying on the mining operations. In our
considered opinion, on the facts alleged it is not possible to embark upon
the enquiry as to whether the grant of leases within the tribal area are in
violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_411">Environment Protection Act</a> nor the leases
can be annulled on that score. Contention of Dr. Dhawan on this score
accordingly must be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_430">Whether the leases in question are contrary to the provisions of the Mines
and Minerals Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_412">Development Act</a> (for short 'MMRD Act')

Dr. Dhawan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that in
view of Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act as amended no mining leases can be
governed in favour of any person who is not a member of Scheduled Tribe.
Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act reads, thus : .Im20.
</p>
<p id="p_431">"Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act no prospecting licence or
mining lease shall be granted in the Scheduled Areas to any person who is
not a member of the Scheduled Tribe, provided that this sub-section shall
not apply to an undertaking owned or controlled by the State or Central
Government or to a Society registered or deemed to be registered under the
Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1964, which is composed of
members of Scheduled Tribes".
</p>
<p id="p_432">There cannot be any dispute that on and after coming into force Section
11(5) of the MMRD Act no mining leases can be granted or renewed within the
Scheduled Area to any person who is not a member of Scheduled Tribe within
the State of Andhra Pradesh. The only exception being as contained in the
proviso, namely, an undertaking owned or con-trolled by the State or
Central Government or a society registered or deemed to be registered under
Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act which is composed of members of
Scheduled Tribes are excluded from the rigours of Sub-section (5) of
<a href="/doc/1366952/" id="a_413">Section 11</a>. Therefore, after 1991 if any mining lease is granted in favour
of any non-Scheduled Tribe person then the said lease would be void being
repugnant to <a href="/doc/1366952/" id="a_414">Section 11(5)</a> of the Act but the said provision does not
affect the subsisting leases and, therefore, the leases in favour of the
respondents cannot be said to be invalid on the ground of infraction of
Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act. The provisions is prospec-tive in operation
and would be applicable to any or renewal of a lease subsequent to the
enactment of Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act. The leases of the respondents
being prior to the aforesaid enactment these are not hit the said
provisions and therefore, Dr. Dhawan's contention on this score cannot be
sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_433">My conclusions on different questions, as discussed above, are summed up as
under :
</p>
<p id="p_434">1.  Under the British rule though steps had been taken to make provision
for special administration of the tribal areas but there had been no
prohibition for transfer of government land in favour of a non-tribal
within the scheduled area.
</p>
<p id="p_435">2.  Under different laws and regulations operating in different tribal
areas prior to coming into force of the Constitution there was restriction
in relation to transfer of lands belonging to the tribals in favour of a
non-tribal within the scheduled area but no such restriction was there so
far as the government land was concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_436">3. The legislative history and the debates in the Constituent Assembly
culminating in engrafting of Schedule V of the Constitution conferring
power on the Governor to make regulation for administration of tribal area
were all aimed to prevent the tribals from exploitation of non-tribals and
the prohibition/restrictions were all in relation to the transfer of lands
belonging to the tribals in favour of non-tribals and it never intended to
have any such prohibition in relation to government land.
</p>
<p id="p_437">4.  A combined reading of <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_415">Article 244</a> and Schedule V of the Con-stitution
would indicate that there is no constitutional obligation on the Governor
to make regulation prohibiting transfer of government land in favour of a
non-tribal within the scheduled area.
</p>
<p id="p_438">5. The word 'person' used in Section 3(l)(a) of the Andhra Pradesh
Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation as amended in 1970 has to be
construed to convey and same meaning throughout the Section and the said
expression does not include the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_439">6.  Neither the legislative history nor the object with which special power
has been conferred on the Governor under Fifth Schedule to the constitution
make it necessary to construe the word 'person' in the first part of
<a href="/doc/960986/" id="a_416">Section 3(l)(a)</a> differently from the rest part of the Section so as to
include State Government within the said expression.
</p>
<p id="p_440">7. Though under <a href="/doc/998995/" id="a_417">Section 2</a> of the Forest conservation Act use of any forest
land for any non-forest purpose is prohibited without the prior consent of
the Central Government and as such mining activities being a non-forest
purpose would attract the mischief of said <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_418">Section 2</a> of the conservation
Act, but in the absence of any materials to conclusively come to the
conclusion that the land over which the respondents are carrying on the
mining activities form a part of the forest land, it would not be proper
for this Court to issue any direction prohibiting the mining activities. At
the same time it would be proper to direct the State of Andhra Pradesh
through its Forest Department to examine whether the mining activities are
being carried on over the forest land and if it comes to the conclusion
that the lands do form a part of the forest land then immediate steps
should be taken prohibiting continuance of the mining activities until the
Central Government in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/932634/" id="a_419">Section 2</a> agrees to the same,
and we accordingly so direct.

<p id="p_441">8. The petitioner has not been able to make out any case of violation of
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_420">Environment Protection Act</a> in the case in hand.
</p>
<p id="p_442">9.  Section 11(5) of the MMRD Act being prospective in nature will have no
application to the existing mining leases and, therefore, the leases of the
respondents' can't be annulled on that score.

<p id="p_444">C.A. No. 4603 of 1997.
</p>
<p id="p_445">PATTANAIK, J. Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_446">This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court dated 27.8.1993 in writ petition No. 3734 of 1993. The
present appellant was respondent No. 6 before the High Court SAKTI, a
voluntary social organisation for the upliftment of tribals in East
Godavari District filed the writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court
praying therein that the mining activities which are carried on by the
respondents 6 to 10 in the said writ petition should be immediately stopped
as the grant of mining leases in their favour is in contravention of
Section 3 of the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Areas Land, Transfer Regulation,
1959 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Regulation') as well as <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_421">Section 2</a> of
the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as the
'Conserva-tion Act'). It was averred in the writ petition that the villages
where the mining activities are being carried on were notified as protected
forest under Section 24 of the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967 with effect
from 8.9.1975 and within the said forest area it is not permissible to
continue any mining activity in view of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_422">Conservation
Act</a> which prohibits user of forest land for non-forest purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_447">Respondents 1 to 4 before the High Court, who were the public officers of
the State Government supported the case of the petitioner and took the
stand that a joint inspection report had been conducted after surveying the
area over which the mining activities are being carried on by the
respondents 6 to 10 and the said report reveals that mining leases have
been granted over the forest area which is prohibited under the Conserva-
tion Act without prior approval of the Central Government,

Respondent No. 6, the present appellant took the stand that the lease
having been granted much prior to the area in question was included as a
protected forest, the embargo contained in the provisions of the Conser-
vation Act will not apply and in this connection reliance was placed on the
decision of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1476082/" id="a_423">State of Bihar v. Banshi Ram</a>, [1995]
3 SCC 643. It was also contended that <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_424">Section 3</a> of the Regulation has no
application to a transfer by the Government in respect of its land in
favour of a non-tribal and the word 'person' in <a href="/doc/960986/" id="a_425">Section 3</a> of the said
Regulation will not include the Government. It is not necessary for us to
examine the stand taken by other private respondents, namely respondents 7
to 10. The High Court by the impugned judgment came to the conclusion that
the transfer of any land in scheduled area to a non-tribal is void under
<a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_426">Section 3</a> of the Regulation, and therefore, the lease in favour of respon-
dent no. 6 within the scheduled area is void. The High Court came to the
conclusion that the word 'person' in <a href="/doc/379553/" id="a_427">Section 3</a> of the Regulation includes
the Government, and therefore, leases granted by the State Government in
scheduled area to a non-tribal is void. On the question of applicability of
the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_428">Conservation Act</a> the High Court also relied upon the decision of the
Court in the Banshi Ram's case (supra) and came to the conclusion that for
grant of mining lease in a protected forest area for non-tribal purpose the
prior approval of the Central Government is mandatory and since the
Government did not obtain the approval of the Central Government, leases
are in contravention of <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_429">Section 2</a> of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.
Having considered the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1186098/" id="a_430">Ambika Quarry Works v.
State of Gujarat</a>, [1987] 1 SCC 213 and taking into account the fact that
respondent no. 6 had completed the mining operation over 42 acres the High
Court permitted the said respondent no. 6 to remove the dug up mining in
the presence of Joint Collector of the District, Assistant Director of
Mines and Geology and the District Surveyor of Forests. Respondent No. 6,
the present appellant was prohibited from mining operation in the area with
the aforesaid conclusion and thus the appeal by special leave.
</p>
<p id="p_448">Learned counsel for the appellant argued with vehemence that the conclusion
of the High Court that the word 'person' in Regulation 3(1)(a) includes the
State Government and the transfer of any land within the scheduled area in
favour of a non-tribal Ls null and void is wholly erroneous as the embargo
in question is applicable in respect of transfer of land belonging to the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and not to land belonging to the
State Government. The learned counsel also urged that the restrictions and
prohibitions in the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_431">Conservation Act</a> will have no application to an
existing lease and the lease in favour of the appellant having been granted
much prior to the coming into force of the Conserva-tion Act, the High
Court committed error in holding that the leases are in violation of the
<a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_432">Conservation Act</a>. Both these questions have been con-sidered in detail by
us in Civil Appeal Nos. 4601-02/97 arising out of S.L.P, c Nos. 17080- 81
of 1995 and for the reasons given therein and in view of the conclusion in
the said appeals to the effect that the word 'person' used in <a href="/doc/960986/" id="a_433">Section 3(l)</a>
</p><p id="p_449">(a) of the Regulation does not include the State Govern-ment, and
therefore, the prohibitions contained in the said Regulation with regard to
transfer of land in favour of a non-tribal will not apply to the transfer
of land made by the government for the purpose of mining lease, the
conclusion of the High Court on this score is erroneous. But so far as the
question of applicability of the <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_434">Conservation Act</a> is concerned, in view of
our conclusion on the said question in the appeals arising out of SLPs
referred to earlier (<a href="/doc/1304919/" id="a_435">Samatha v. State of A.P. &amp; Ors</a>.) the conclusion of the
High Court in the impugned judgment has to be sustained. In view of the
inquiry report and the stand taken by the State officials the land over
which the appellant was permitted to carry on mining activities is a forest
land and before grant of lease in favour of the appellant no approval of
the Central Government has been taken. It is no doubt true that
<a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_436">Conservation Act</a> came into force much later than the grant of mining lease
in favour of the appellant, but in view of the general directions issued by
this Court in <a href="/doc/525269/" id="a_437">T.N. Godavaman Thintmulkpad v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. in Writ
Petition No. 202 of 1995, the mining activities being a user of the forest
land for non-forest purpose has to be stopped and in case it is intended to
continue the mining activities the same can be done only after referring
the matter to the appropriate authority of the Central Government and
getting the permission of the same. In this view of the matter the
conclusion of the High Court in the impugned judgment so far as violation
of <a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_438">Conservation Act</a> is concerned is unexceptionable, and therefore, the
said conclusion is upheld. Necessarily, therefore, the ultimate direction
given by the High Court remains unaffected notwithstanding the conclusion
of the High Court on the first question with regard to the applicability of
the provisions of the Regulation having been reversed by us. In the
premises as aforesaid this appeal is dismissed but in the circumstances
there will be no order as to costs.
