<p id="p_1">Dr. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.
</p>



<p id="p_2">1.      All the aforesaid appeals have been filed against the judgments 


and orders of   the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack   which have been 


passed placing reliance on its earlier judgments in similar cases. The 


facts   and   legal  issues   involved   herein   are   the  same.     Thus,   they   are 


heard   together   and   are   being   disposed   of   by   the   common   judgment 


and order. However, for convenience, Civil Appeal No. 1272 of 2011 


is taken to be the leading case and some reference to facts would be 


taken from other appeals as and when necessary in the context of legal 


issues involved herein. 
</p>



<p id="p_3">2.     The appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order 


dated   22.3.2006   of   the   High   Court   of   Orissa   at   Cuttack   in   Writ 


Petition (Civil) No. 14157 of 2005. 
</p>



<p id="p_4">FACTS:
</p>

<p id="p_5">3. (A)    The respondent was appointed as  a Lecturer in Niali College, 


Niali, on 9.7.1979 and her appointment as such was approved by the 


Director   of   Higher   Education,   Orissa,   a   statutory   authority   -   the 


appellant No. 2,  vide order dated 18.12.1985, and she was granted the 


benefit of receiving 1/3rd grant-in-aid. 
</p>

<p id="p_6">(B)      In order to provide better facilities to teachers and enhance the 


standard   of   higher   education,   the   Government   of   Orissa,   came   out 


with   a   Notification   dated   6.10.1989   with   a   revised   pay   scale 


enforceable with effect from 1.1.1986 as per the recommendations of 


UGC.     However,   the   said   Notification   was   applicable   only   in   such 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                2</span>


cases   where   the   post   has   been   granted   the   benefit   of   grant-in-aid 


Scheme   by   1.4.1989   and   person   manning   that   post   had   a   good 


academic record i.e. 54 per cent or its equivalent grade in a Masters' 


Course. 
</p>

<p id="p_7">(C)  Respondent did not make any representation before any authority 


to   get   the   benefit   of   the   said   Notification   dated   6.10.1989,   rather 


approached   the   High   Court   on   11.11.2005   by   filing     Writ   Petition 


(Civil) No. 14157 of 2005 seeking a direction to the State Government 


to   pay   the   pre-revised   pay   scale   with   effect   from   1.1.1986   placing 


reliance   on   the   various   orders   passed   by   the   High   Court   earlier   in 


cases of other persons e.g.  in case OJC No. 3705 of 1987. 
</p>

<p id="p_8">(D)     The present appellants contested the said writ petition pointing 


out   that   the   respondent   had   secured   only   40   per   cent   marks   in   her 


Master's course.  She was by no means, eligible for appointment.  Her 


appointment, being not in consonance with law, remained illegal.  
</p>

<p id="p_9">(E)           The   High   Court   placing   reliance   on   its   earlier   judgments, 


allowed   the   said   writ   petition   giving   the   benefit   of   the   U.G.C.   pay 


scale to her w.e.f. 1.6.1984. Hence, this appeal. 
</p>



<p id="p_10">4.      The submissions made in all these appeals, particularly by the 


respondents are that the High Court had been dealing with the subject 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                     3</span>


matter   for   a   long   time   and   judgments   of   the   High   Court   have   been 


upheld   by   this   court.     Once   the  SLPs     against   the   judgments   of  the 


High   Court   which   had   been   relied   upon   by   the   High   Court   while 


deciding   these   cases,   have   been   dismissed   in   limine,   judicial 


discipline and decorum demand that this Court should follow the same 


order.   Thus,   the   judgments   and   orders   impugned   herein   did   not 


warrant any interference. 
</p>



<p id="p_11">5.      On the other hand, it has been submitted by learned counsel for 


the   appellants   that   factual   and   legal   issues   involved   in   these   cases 


have never been considered either by the High Court or by this Court 


in proper perspective. For example, in Civil Appeal No. 1274 of 2011, 


State of Orissa v. Mrs. Manju Patnaik, the matter had initially been 


filed before the Orissa Education Tribunal. Therein, the question arose 


as to whether the  respondent herein had been appointed by following 


the procedure prescribed by the law for making the appointment. As 


the   State   had   raised   the   issue   that   respondent   had   been   appointed 


without   following   any   procedure   known   in  law   for   this   purpose   her 


appointment  itself  was  illegal  and  void. The  vacancy  on  the  post of 


Lecturer in Chemistry in Paramananda College, Bolgarh, Dist. Khurda 


was   never   advertised   nor   were   the   names   of   eligible   candidates 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                    4</span>


requisitioned from the Employment Exchange. Admitted facts in the 


said case remain that the vacancy was advertised merely by affixing 


notices   on   the   notice   board   of   the   College   and   of   Bolgarh   Block 


Office inviting applications from the eligible candidates. More so, the 


respondent   had   not   even   faced   an   interview   before   the   Selection 


Board,  as  envisaged    by  the  Statutory  Rules  in  force  at the  relevant 


time, rather she had been interviewed merely by representatives of the 


Committee of Management of the College. The Tribunal accepted the 


case of the State to that effect, but granted her reliefs sought by her. 
</p>

<p id="p_12">The   High   Court   did   not   even   consider   the   issue   of   validity   of   her 


appointment. 
</p>



<p id="p_13">6.      It   is   further   submitted   that   none   of   the   courts   till   today   has 


considered that in case the institution has been accorded the benefit of 


grant-in-aid scheme subsequent to 1.6.1986, there could be no liability 


of   the   government   to   contribute   partly   or   fully   to   the   salary   of   any 


employee of the said college, prior to the date of grant of such benefit, 


whether UGC pay scale could be given prior to the date of according 


grant-in-aid   benefits.       In   Civil   Appeal   No.   1318   of   2011,  State   of 


Orissa   v.   Smt.   Manjushree   Patnaik,   the   post   of   respondent   was 


included   under     grant-in-aid   scheme     w.e.f.   1.6.1988.   She   did   not 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                        5</span>


possess the requisite qualifications and the said respondent was put in 


grant-in-aid   with effect from 1988 though vide impugned judgment 


she has  been given benefit from 1.1.1986.   
</p>



<p id="p_14">7.     In  all  these   cases,  admittedly  most  of  the  respondents   did  not 


possess  the minimum  eligibility, i.e., 54% marks  in Master's  course 


and some of them acquired it at a much later stage. It is pointed out by 


the learned counsel for the respondents herein, that Utkal University 


at   Bhubneshwar   had   condoned   the   deficiency   of   eligibility-
</p>

<p id="p_15">qualification by passing general  orders from time to time. However, 


they failed to point out any statutory provision conferring competence 


upon   the   University   to   condone   the   deficiency,   what   to   talk   of 


reasonableness or propriety in condoning such deficiency.                  It   is 


evident from Civil Appeal No. 1280 of 2011, State of Orissa &amp; Ors. 
</p>

<p id="p_16">v.   Dr.   Jadumani   Sahoo,  that   the   respondent   was   appointed   as   a 


Lecturer in Political  Science   in Begunia  College, Begunia, Khurda, 


on 5.9.1978 and the post which he held came into grant-in-aid scheme 


on 1.6.1984. He acquired the degree of Ph.D. in 2000. His deficiency 


in   qualification   was   condoned   after   about   10   years   by   the   Utkal 


University on 28.10.1987, and he has also been granted the benefit of 


UGC pay scale w.e.f. 1.1.1986.  
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                               6</span>


<p id="p_17">8.      There are letters/circulars issued by the University as well as by 


the   State   of   Orissa   for   condonation   of   the   deficiency.   However,   the 


question   does   arise   as   to   whether   this   kind   of   orders   can   be   given 


effect to or be considered by the courts to grant a relief to the persons 


whose appointments had been illegal for want of eligibility and for not 


following the procedure prescribed by law, i.e. advertisement, etc. 




</p><p id="p_18">9.      Most of the petitions had been filed before the High Court after 


10-15-20 years  for grant  of UGC  pay  scales w.e.f.   1.1.1986 and to 


pay the arrears etc. The High Court in all the cases  granted the same 


with effect from 1.1.1986 or even with effect from 1.6.1984, without 


considering   the   issue   of   delay   and   laches,   merely   placing   reliance 


upon its earlier judgments. Thus, the question does arise as to whether 


the   delay   and   laches   could   be   condoned   all   together   giving   the 


respondents the impetus of the   earlier judgments in cases of persons 


who   had   been   diligent   enough   to   approach   the   Court   within   a 


reasonable period. 
</p>



<p id="p_19">10.     It   has   been   further   submitted   by   learned   counsel   for   the 


respondents   that   teachers   in   government   colleges   have   also   been 


granted the said benefit though not entitled and the respondents herein 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                      7</span>


cannot be given hostile treatment in case the impugned judgments and 


orders       herein   are   not   upheld.   Thus,   the   question   does   arise   as   to 


whether   <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article   14</a>   of   the   Constitution   is   meant   to   perpetuate   an 


illegality. 
</p>



<p id="p_20">11.     Considering the rival submissions made by learned counsel for 


the   parties,     we   are   of   the   view   that   as   the   questions   raised 


hereinabove   had   never   been   considered   by   any   of   the   courts   and 


involve   substantial   questions   of   law   of   public   importance,   the   cases 


require proper adjudication.

<p id="p_46">14.    Education   is   the   systematic   instruction,   schooling   or   training 


given to the young persons in preparation for the work of life.  It also 


connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has 


received.  Education connotes the process  of training and developing 


the   knowledge,   skill,   mind   and   character   of   students   by   formal 


schooling.     The   excellence   of   instruction   provided   by   an 


educational institution mainly  depends directly on the excellence 


of   the   teaching   staff.     Therefore,   unless   they   themselves   possess   a 


good   academic   record/minimum   qualifications   prescribed   as   an 


eligibility,   it   is   beyond   imagination   of   anyone   that   standard   of 


education can be maintained/enhanced. "We have to be very strict in 


maintaining   high   academic   standards   and   maintaining   academic 


discipline   and   academic   rigour   if   our   country   is   to   progress".

provides the process of training and acquiring the knowledge, skills,

necessary   to   maintain   a   high   academic   standard   and   academic

</blockquote><p id="p_51">Democracy   depends   for   its   own   survival   on   a   high   standard   of

citizens.  It is for this reason that in order to maintain the standard of

the children to get proper and good quality education.   However, the

quality of teaching staff cannot be compromised.  The selection of the 


most suitable persons is essential in order to maintain excellence and 


the standard of teaching in the institution.   It is not permissible for the 


State that while controlling the education it may impinge the standard 


of education.  It is, in fact, for this reason that norms of admission in 


institutions   have   to   be   adhered   to   strictly.     Admissions   in   mid 


academic   sessions   are   not   permitted   to   maintain   the     excellence   of

<p id="p_71">         More   so,   relaxation   in   this   manner   is   tantamount   to   changing

rise to a recurring cause of action.  In such an eventuality, the petition

recognition and affiliation even for non-governmental and non-aided 


private colleges, it is mandatory to adhere to the conditions imposed

of teaching staff.  The authority at the time of granting approval has to

<p id="p_88">ARBITRARINESS:
</p>


<p id="p_89">38.     The rule of law inhibits arbitrary action and also makes it liable 


to   be   invalidated.   Every   action   of   the   State   or   its   instrumentalities 


should   not   only   be   fair,   legitimate   and   above-board   but   should   be 


without any affection or aversion. It should neither be suggestive of 


discrimination  nor  even  give  an  impression  of bias,  favouritism  and 


nepotism.  Procedural fairness is an implied mandatory requirement to 


protect   against   arbitrary   action   where   Statute   confers   wide   power 


coupled   with   wide   discretion     on   an   authority.   If     the   procedure 


adopted   by   an   authority   offends   the   fundamental   fairness   or 


established ethos or shocks the conscience, the order stands vitiated.

<p id="p_101">46.      From the aforesaid discussion, the following picture  emerges: 
</p>

<p id="p_102">(i)      The procedure prescribed under the Rules, 1974   has not been 


followed     in   all   the   cases   while   making   the   appointment   of   the 


respondents/teachers   at   initial   stage.   Some   of   the   persons   had 


admittedly been appointed merely by putting some note on the Notice 


Board   of   the   College.   Some   of   these   teachers   did   not   face   the 


interview   test   before   the   Selection   Board.     Once   an   order   of 


appointment itself had been bad at the time of initial appointment, it 


cannot be sanctified at a later stage. 
</p>

<p id="p_103">(ii)     At the relevant time of appointment of the respondents/teachers 


there has been a requirement of possessing good second class i.e. 54% 


marks in Master's Course and none of the said respondents had secured the 


said percentage.  
</p>

<p id="p_104">(iii)    Their appointments had been approved after a long long time. 
</p>

<p id="p_105">In   some   cases   after   10-12   years   of   their   initial     appointment  by   the 


statutory authority i.e. Director of Higher Education.
</p>

<p id="p_106">(iv)     A   candidate   becomes   eligible   to   apply   for   a   post   only   if   he 


fulfils   the   required   minimum   benchmark   fixed   by   the 


rules/advertisement.  Thus, none of the respondents could even submit 


the application what to talk of the appointments.
</p>




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                                      3</span>


<p id="p_107">(v)      The so-called relaxation by the Utkal University was accorded 


by passing a routine order applicable to large number of colleges, that 


too after a lapse of long period i.e. about a decade.
</p>

<p id="p_108">(vi)     Fixation of eligibility falls within the exclusive domain of the 


executive and once it has been fixed by the State authorities under the 


Rules 1974, the question of according relaxation  by Utkal University 


could not arise and, therefore, the order of condonation etc. is nullity. 
</p>

<p id="p_109">(vii)    The   relaxation   has   been   granted   only   by   Utkal   University 


though   Rule   2(i)   of   Rules   1974   defined   `University'   means   Utkal 


University,   Berhampur   University,   Sambalpur   University   and   Sri 


Jagannath Sanskrit Vishwa Vidyalaya. 
</p>

<p id="p_110">(viii) Granting relaxation at this stage amounts to change of criteria 


after issuance of advertisement, which is impermissible in law. More 


so,   it   is   violative   of   fundamental   rights   enshrined   under   Articles   14 


and 16 of the Constitution of the similarly situated   persons, who did 


not apply considering themselves to be ineligible for want of required 


marks. 
</p>

<p id="p_111">(ix)     The   exercise   of   condonation   of   deficiency   had   not   been 


exercised by any University other than Utkal University.
</p>




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                                     3</span>


<p id="p_112">(x)      The post of the teachers i.e. respondents is transferable to any 


college affiliated to any other University under the  Rules 1979. 
</p>

<p id="p_113">(xi)     The   power   to   grant   relaxation   in   eligibility   had   not   been 


conferred   upon   any   authority,   either   the   University   or   the   State.   In 


absence thereof, such power could not have been exercised.
</p>

<p id="p_114">(xii)     This Court in Damodar Nayak  (supra)  has categorically held 


that   a   person   cannot   get   the   benefit   of   grant-in-aid   unless   he 


completes   the   deficiency   of   educational   qualification.   Further,   this 


Court in  Dr. Bhanu Prasad Panda (supra) upheld the termination of 


services   of   the   appellant   therein   for   not   possessing   55%   marks   in 


Master Course.
</p>

<p id="p_115">(xiii) The aforesaid two judgments in  Damodar Nayak    (supra) and 


Dr. Bhanu Prasad Panda (supra), could not be brought to the notice 


of   either the High Court or this Court while dealing with the issue.

law merely  making the reference to Circular dated 6.11.1990, which 


was not the first document ever issued in respect of eligibility.  Thus,

this Court cited and relied upon by the respondents are held to be  not 


of a binding nature. (Per in curiam) 


</p><p id="p_118">(xiv) In case a person cannot get the benefit of grant-in-aid scheme 


unless   he   completes   the   deficiency   of   educational   qualification, 


question of grant of UGC pay scale does not arise. 
</p>

<p id="p_119">(xv)    The cases had been entertained and relief had been granted by 


the   High   Court   without   considering   the   issue   of   delay   and   laches 


merely   placing   reliance   upon   earlier   judgments   obtained   by   diligent 


persons approaching the courts within a reasonable time. 
</p>

<p id="p_120">(xvi) The   authority   passed   illegal   orders   in   contravention   of   the 


constitutional   provisions   arbitrarily   without   any   explanation 


whatsoever polluting the entire education system of the State, ignoring 


the purpose of  grant-in-aid scheme itself  that it has been  so provided 


to maintain  the standard of education. 
</p>

<p id="p_121">(xvii) The   High   Court   granted   relief   in   some   cases   which   had   not 


even   been   asked   for   as   in   some   cases   the   UGC   pay   scale   had   been 


granted     with   effect   from   1.6.1984,   i.e.,   the   date   prior   to   1.1.1986 


though the same relief could not have been granted. Thus, it clearly 


makes out a case of deciding a case without any application of mind.

<p id="p_122">(xviii) In some cases the UGC pay scale has been granted by the High 


Court prior to the date of according the benefit of grant-in-aid scheme 


to the concerned teachers which was   not permissible in law in view 


of the law laid down by this Court in Damodar Nayak (supra).

<p id="p_123">(xix) The grievance of the respondents that not upholding the orders 


passed by the High Court in their  favour would amount to a hostile 


discrimination is not worth acceptance for the reason that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_61">Article 14</a> 


of the Constitution envisages only positive equality. 
</p>

<p id="p_124">(xx)   Concept  of adverse possession  of lien on post or holding over 


are inapplicable in service jurisprudence. 
</p>

<p id="p_125">(xxi) The submission on behalf of the respondents that Government 


orders/circulars/letters   have   been   complied   with,   therefore,   no 


interference  is called for,   is preposterous for the simple  reason that 


such   orders/circulars/letters     being   violative   of   statutory   provisions 


and   constitutional   mandate   are   just   to   be   ignored   in   terms   of   the 


judgment of this Court in  Ram Ganesh Tripathi (supra).

<p id="p_126">47.     In view of the above, it stands crystal clear that a teacher who 


had   been   appointed   without   possessing   the   requisite   qualification   at 


initial   stage   cannot   get   the   benefit   of   grant-in-aid   scheme   unless   he 


acquires the additional qualification and, therefore,  question of grant

of UGC pay scale   would not arise in any circumstance  unless such 


teacher   acquires  the  additional  qualification  making   him eligible   for 


the   benefit   of   grant-in-aid   scheme.   The   cumulative   effect   therefore 


comes to that such teacher will not be entitled to claim the UGC pay 


scale unless he acquires the higher qualification i.e. M.Phil/Ph.D. 
</p>

<p id="p_127">48.    In   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case,   we   feel   that 


terminating   the   services   of   those   who   had   been   appointed   illegally 


and/or withdrawing the  benefits of grant-in-aid scheme of  those who 


had   not   completed   the   deficiency   in   eligibility/educational 


qualification   or withdrawing the benefit thereof from those who had 


been   granted   from   the   date   prior   to   completing   the   deficiency,   may 


not be desirable   as a long period has elapsed. So far as the grant of 


UGC pay scale is concerned, it cannot be granted prior to the date of 


acquisition of higher qualification. In view of the above, the impugned 


judgment/order cannot be sustained in the eyes of law.

<p id="p_128">49.    The full particulars of the respondent-teachers are not before us 


as in some cases there had been claim and counter claim of possessing 


the  requisite   marks  i.e.  54%  in  Master's  Course,   as   in  Civil   Appeal 


No. 1253 of 2011,  State of Orissa &amp; Anr. v. Lokanath Mishra &amp; 


Ors. Thus, we pass the following directions:

<p id="p_129">(i)      In   case   of   dispute   regarding   possessing   of   54%   marks,   the 


authorities,   Secretary   of   Higher   Education/Director   of   Higher 


Education   may   examine   the   factual   position   and   decide   the   case   of 


individual teachers in accordance with  law laid down in this case;  
</p>

<p id="p_130">(ii)     If a person did not possess the requisite qualification on the date 


of appointment and was not entitled for grant-in-aid scheme unless he 


completes the deficiency, his case would be considered from the date 


of completing the deficiency for grant of UGC pay scale. However, in 


no   case,   the   UGC   pay   scale   can   be   granted   prior   to   the   date   of 


according the benefit of the grant-in-aid scheme, i.e. by acquiring the 


degree of M.Phil/Ph.D; 
</p>

<p id="p_131">(iii)    The   aforesaid   exercise   shall   be   completed   within   a   period   of 


four months from today; and 


</p><p id="p_132">(iv)     The arrears of pay, if any, shall be paid to the teacher concerned 


within a period of four months thereafter.

to costs.
