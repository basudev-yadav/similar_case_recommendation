HEADNOTE:
     The respondent-landlord  filed a  petition under  8- 12
read with  8- 16  of the U-P- Urban Buildings (Regulation of
Letting, Rent and <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_4">Eviction) Act</a>, 1972 against the appellant-
tenant in  respect of  a shop  situated in  the district  Of
Bulandshahr. He	 claimed a  declaration that  the  shop	 had
fallen vacant  and that	 it should be released to him on the
ground that the appellant-tenant had sub-let the shop to one
Yadram and  had allowed	 it to be occupied by Yadram and his
son  Madan  Lal,  neither  of  whom  was  a  member  of	 the
appellant's family.  The prescribed  Authority dismissed the
respondent's petition,	holding (i)  that the respondent had
failed to  prove that the appellant had sub-let the shop and
that it	 could be  deemed to  be vacant;  and (ii)  that the
appellant  had	 established  that  he	was  conducting	 his
business of  selling vegetables	 in the	 shop and that Madan
Lal sat	 in on	his behalf.  An appeal by the respondent was
also dismissed	by the	Second	Additional  District  Judge,
Bulandshahr. However,  the High	 Court in  a  Writ  Petition
filed by the respondent, remanded the case to the prescribed
Authority for passing orders on the respondent's application
for release  of the  property from  allotment on  the ground
that the  appellant had	 been unable  to establish any legal
relationship of	 agency between	 himself and  Madan  Lal  or
Yadram and  therefore it must be taken that it was Madan Lal
who was	 occupying the	shop within  the meaning  of <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_5"> S.  12</a>
(l)(b) of the <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_6">U.P. Act</a>.

^
     HELD: 1.  It is well known that a writ in the nature of
certiorari may	be issued  only if the order of the inferior
tribunal or  subordinate court	suffers	 from  an  error  of
jurisdiction or	 from a	 breach of the principles of natural
justice or  is vitiated	 by a  manifest or apparent error of
law. There  is	no  sanction  enabling	the  High  Court  to
reappraise the evidence without sufficient reason in law and
reach findings	of fact	 contrary to  those rendered  by  an
inferior court	or subordinate	court.	When  a	 High  Court
proceeds to  do so, it acts plainly in excess of its powers.
[637 A-C]
     In the  instant case, the finding is that Madan Lal sat
in the	shop conducting	 the vegetable	selling business  on
behalf of  the appellant.  The	findings  of  fact  by	both
authorities rested-on evidence, and there was no warrant for
disturbing that	 finding of fact in a writ petition. [636 G-
H]
     2. Under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_7"> s. 12(1)(b)</a>  of the  U.P. Act  a tenant	of a
building is  deemed to have ceased to occupy the building if
he has	allowed it to be occupied by any person who is not a
member of  his family.	The occupation of a person envisaged
here cannot possibly include the occupation by any person as
the agent  of the tenant. When a person sits in the premises
and carries  on a business on behalf of and for the original
occupant, it  cannot be	 said that the original occupant has
thereby allowed	 the accommodation to be occupied within the
meaning of<a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_8"> s. 12</a> (l)(b). [638 B-F]
     Smt. Keshar  Bai v.  District Judge,  Mathura and Ors.,

</p><p id="p_2">     From the  Judgment and  Order  dated  1.8.1979  of	 the

</p><p id="p_4">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     PATHAK, J.	 : This	 appeal by special leave is directed
against the  judgment of  the Allahabad	 High Court allowing
the respondents	 writ  petition	 on  the  finding  that	 the
accommodation let  out to the appellant must be deemed to be
vacant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">636</span>
<p id="p_5">     The respondent is the landlord and the appellant is the
tenant of  a shop  in Mohalla  Nan  Panjan,  Khurja  in	 the
district of  Bulandshahr. The  respondent filed	 a  petition
under<a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_9"> s.  12</a> read  with s.  16 of  the U.P.  Urban Buildings
(Regulation of Letting Rent and <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_10">Eviction) Act</a>, 1972 alleging
that the  accommodation had been sub-let by the appellant to
one Yadram, that the appellant had ceased to occupy the shop
and had	 allowed it  to be  occupied by	 Yadram and  his son
Madan Lal,  neither of	whom was a member of the appellant's
family. He  claimed a  declaration that	 the shop had fallen
vacant and that it should be released to him.
</p><p id="p_6">     The Prescribed  Authority made  an order  dated October
30, 1976 rejecting the respondent's petition, on the finding
that he	 had failed  to prove that the appellant had sub-let
the shop  and that it could be deemed to be vacant. He found
that the  appellant had	 established that  he was conducting
his business  of selling  vegetables in	 the shop  and	that
Madan Lal  sat in on his behalf. An appeal by the respondent
was dismissed  by the  learned	Second	Additional  District
Judge, Bulandshahr by his order dated September 21, 1977. He
affirmed the findings of the Prescribed Authority.
</p><p id="p_7">     The respondent  filed a  writ petition in the Allahabad
High Court,  and on August 1, 1979 a learned Single Judge of
the High  Court held  that the	appellant had been unable to
establish any  legal relationship  of agency between himself
and Madan  Lal or Yadram and therefore it must be taken that
it was	Madan Lal  who occupying the shop within the meaning
of<a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_11"> s.  12</a> (l)(b)  of the  aforesaid <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_12">U.P. Act</a>. The High Court
also declined  to  accept  the	appellant's  case  that	 the
appellant was carrying on the business of selling vegetables
when he	 was already  carrying on  a brick kiln business and
had a cold storage. Holding that the property must be deemed
to be vacant it remanded the case to be Prescribed Authority
for passing  orders  on	 the  respondent's  application	 for
release of the property from allotment.
</p><p id="p_8">     We are  satisfied that the High Court travelled outside
its jurisdiction  in embarking	upon a	reappraisal  of	 the
evidence. The  Prescribed Authority  as well  as the learned
Second Additional  District Judge  concurrently	 found	that
Madan Lal was sitting in the shop on behalf of the appellant
and deputising	for him in carrying on the vegetable selling
business.  The	 findings  by  both  authorities  rested  on
evidence, and  there was  no  warrant  for  disturbing	that
finding of  fact in  a writ petition. The limitations on the
jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">637</span>
226</a> of	the Constitution are well settled. The writ petition
before the  High Court	prayed for  a writ  in the nature of
certiorari, and	 it is	well known that a writ in the nature
of certiorari  may be  issued  only  if	 the  order  of	 the
inferior tribunal or subordinate court suffers from an error
of jurisdiction,  or from  a breach  of	 the  principles  of
natural Justice	 or is	vitiated by  a manifest	 or apparent
error of  law. There  is no sanction enabling the High Court
to reappraise  the evidence without sufficient reason in law
and reach  findings of fact contrary to those rendered by an
inferior court	or subordinate	court.	When  a	 High  Court
proceeds to  do so, it acts plainly in excess of its powers.
We are informed that a report of the Commissioner in another
suit was  not considered  by the Prescribed Authority and by
the learned Second Additional District Judge, and therefore,
it is  urged, the  High Court  was justified  in taking that
report into  consideration and	entering into an examination
of the	material on  the record. We have examined the report
of the	Commissioner and  we find that an objection had been
filed to  that report  and the	trial Court  had  failed  to
dispose	 it   of.  In	other  words,	the  report  of	 the
Commissioner is	 not a	final document	and cannot  be taken
into consideration  as it  stands. It  must,  therefore,  be
ignored. That  being so, the finding of fact rendered by the
Prescribed Authority  and affirmed  by	the  learned  Second
Additional District  Judge remains  undisturbed. The finding
is that	 Madan Lal  sat in the shop conducting the vegetable
selling business on behalf of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_9">     The next  point to	 consider is whether the shop can be
deemed to  be vacant  within the  meaning of<a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_14"> s. 12</a> (l)(b) of
the <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_15">U.P. Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_16">Section 12</a> provides :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "12. Deemed vacancy of building in certain cases -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  (l) A	 landlord or  tenant of	 a building shall be
	  deemed to  have ceased to occupy the building or a
	  part thereof if -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  (a) he has substantially removed his effects there
	  from, or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  (b) he has allowed it to be occupied by any person
	  who is not a member of his family, or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	  (c) in  the case  of a residential building, he as
	  well as  members  of	his  family  have  taken  up
	  residence,   not    being   temporary	  residence,
	  elsewhere.
</blockquote>	  x    x     x	  x    x    x	 x    x	   x"
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">638</span>
<p id="p_10">The deemed  vacancy  of	 a  building  is  relevant  for	 the
regulation of  letting such  a building.  A  building  which
falls vacant  is available  for allotment  under s.16 of the
Act to	a tenant.  Under<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_17"> s.  12</a> (1)(b),	 with which  we	 are
concerned here,	 a tenant  of a	 building is  deemed to have
ceased to  occupy the  building if  he has  allowed it to be
occupied by  any person	 who is	 not a member of his family.
The occupation	of a  person envisaged	here cannot possibly
include the  occupation by  any person	as the	agent of the
tenant. If  the contrary construction is accepted, and it is
held that  a person  who is  a mere  agent or servant of the
original occupant  falls  within  the  contemplation  of <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_18"> s.
12(1)(b)</a>, it  would be	impossible for the original occupant
to engage  any person  to assist him in the discharge of his
responsibilities in the place where he does so. It cannot be
conceived that	the  U.P.  Legislature	intended  a  person,
occupying a building as a tenant, to live or operate in such
a building  with members  of his  family and no one else. In
the present  case, Madan  Lal sat in the shop conducting the
vegetable business  on behalf  of the appellant. When he did
so, it must be considered as an occupation by the appellant.
Our attention  has been drawn to Smt. Keshar Bal v. District
Judge, Mathura	and Ors.,  [1980] 6 A.L.R. 165, where a Full
Bench of  the Allahabad	 High  Court  held  that  a  "deemed
vacancy" would	arise within  the meaning  of<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_19"> s.  12</a>  (1)(b)
where a	 person other  than a family member was found in the
occupation of  a building.  It	does  not  appear  that	 the
learned Judges specifically considered the full significance
and scope  of the  expression "occupied"  in<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_20"> s. 12(1)(b)</a>. We
are of	opinion that  when a person sits in the premises and
carries on  a business	on behalf  of and  for the  original
occupant, it  cannot be	 said that the original occupant has
thereby allowed	 the accommodation to be occupied within the
meaning of<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_21"> s. 12(1)(b)</a>.
</p><p id="p_11">     In our  judgment, the  High Court	is wrong  in holding
that the  case attracts the provisions of<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_22"> s. 12(1)(b)</a> of the
U.P. Act.
</p><p id="p_12">     Upon the  aforesaid considerations,  we set  aside	 the
judgment and order of the High Court and restore that of the
Prescribed  Authority  and  the	 learned  Second  Additional
District Judge. The appeal is allowed with costs.
</p><pre id="pre_2">M.L.A.					     Appeal allowed.
