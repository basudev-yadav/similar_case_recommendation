ACT:
Land Reform-Distribution   of  ownership  and	control	  of
agricultural   land--Purchase	by   tenants--Validity	  of
enactment--Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Amendment)
Act, 1956 (Bom. XIII of 1956), ss. 32 to 32R-Constitution of
India,	Arts.  14, 19, 31, 31A, Entry 18, List	II,  Seventh
Schedule.



HEADNOTE:
The petitions challenged the constitutional validity of	 the
Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural lands <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1">(Amendment) Act</a>, 1956,
(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 303.

490
(Bom.	XIII of 1956) which, in further amending the  Bombay
Tenancy	 and  Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (Bom.   LXVII  of
1948),	;Ought	to distribute the ownership and	 control  of
agricultural  lands  in	 implementation	 of  the   Directive
principles  of State policy laid down by Arts. 38 and 39  of
the  Constitution.   The impugned Act  sought  to  distribut
equitably the lands between the landholders and the tenants,
except	 where	 the  landholder  required  the	  same	 for
cultivation  by himself, by way of compulsory  _Purchase  of
all  surplus  lands by tenants in  possession  thereof	with
effect	from April 1, 1957, called the 'tiller's day'.	 The
basic  idea underlying the Act was to prevent  concentration
of agricultural lands in the hands of the landholders.	 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_2">The
Act</a>  thus, being a legislation in respect of rights  in	 and
over land, affected the-relation between landlord and tenant
and provided for the transfer and alienation of agricultural
lands.	The petitioners, who were landholders as defined  by
s.  2(9)  of  the  Act	contended  that	 (1)  the   impugned
legislation   was  beyond  the	competence  of	 the   State
Legislature,  (2) that, not being protected by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_3">Art. 31A</a>,  of
the  Constitution, it infringed Arts. 14, 19 and 31  of	 the
Constitution  and  (3)	that it was a  piece  of  colourable
legislation  vitiated  in part by  excessive  delegation  of
legislative power to the State.	 On behalf of the respondent
it was urged that the impugned legislation fell within Entry
18  in List 11 Of the Seventh Schedule to the  Constitution,
that  'provided	 for the extinguishment or  modification  of
rights	to estates and was as such protected by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_4">Art. 31A</a>  of
the Constitution and that there was no excessive  delegation
of legislative power.
Held, that it was well settled that the heads of legislation
specified in Entry 18 in List 11 of the Seventh Schedule  to
the  Constitution  should not be construed in a	 narrow	 and
pedantic  sense	 but  should be given a	 large	and  liberal
interpretation.	  There could, therefore, be no	 doubt	that
the impugned Act fell within the purview of Entry 18 in List
11 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the	plea
of legislative incompetence must fail.
British	 Coal  Corporation v. The King, (1935)	A.C.  500  ;
United	Provinces  v . Atiqa Begum, [1940]  F.C.R.  110	 and
<a href="/doc/1126318/" id="a_5">Navinchandra  Mafatlal	v. The Commissioner  of	 Income-tax,
Bombay City</a>, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 829, relied on.
There  could be no doubt that the Bombay Land Revenue  Code,
1879, was the existing law relating to land tenures in force
in the State of Bombay within the meaning of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_6">Art.  31A(2)(a)</a>
of  the Constitution and the word 'estate' as defined by  S.
2(5)  Of the Code clearly applied not only to lands held  by
the  various tenure-holders of alienated lands but  also  to
land-holders and occupants of unalienated lands.  There	 was
no   ambiguity	in  that  definition  and,   therefore,	  no
justification  for putting a narrower construction  on	that
word  so as to mean the land-holders of the former  category
alone  and  not of the latter; even if there  was  any,	 the
wider  meaning of the word was the one to be adopted in	 the
context of the objective of the Act.
491
Case law discussed.
The word 'landholder' as defined in<a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_7"> s. 2(9)</a> of the Act	also
made no distinction between alienated and unalienated  lands
and  showed  that  the interest of such	 a  landholder	fell
within	the definition of 'estate' contained in s.  2(5)  of
the Code.
There was no warrant for the proposition that extinguishment
or modification of any rights in estates as contemplated  by
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_8">Art.  31A(1)(a)</a>	 of  the Constitution must  mean  only	what
happened  in the process of acquisition of any estate or  of
any  rights  therein  by the State.   The  language  of	 the
Article was clear and unambiguous and showed that it treated
the two concepts as distinct and different from each other.
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_9">Sections 32</a> to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_10">32R</a> of the impugned Act clearly	contemplated
the  vesting  of the title in the tenure on  the    titter's
day,  defeasible  only on certain  specified  contingencies.
They  were designed to bring about an extinguishment  or  in
any  event  a modification of the landlord's rights  in	 the
estate	 within	 the  meaning  of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_11">Art.	 31A(1)(a)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	 The  impugned	Act,  therefore,   was	 not
vulnerable  as being violative of Arts.14, 19 and 31 of	 the
Constitution.	It would not be correct to contend that	 the
sections   merely   contemplated   a   suspension   of	 the
landholders' right and not their extinguishment.
Thakur	Raghubir  Singh	 v. Court of  Wards,  Ajmer,  [1953]
S.C.R. 1049, held inapplicable.
Where	the  Legislature  settled  the	policy	 and   broad
principles of the legislation, there could be no bar against
leaving	 matters of detail to be fixed by the executive	 and
such  delegation of power could not vitiate  the  enactment.
In the instant case, since the Legislature had laid down the
policy	of  the Act in the preamble,  enunciated  the  broad
principles in<a href="/doc/758150/" id="a_12"> ss. 5</a> and <a href="/doc/582772/" id="a_13">6</a> and fixed the four criteria in <a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_14"> s.
7</a>  itself,  the	 last of which had necessarily	to  be	read
ejusdem	 generis with the others, it was not correct to	 say
that  the  impugned Act by<a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_15"> s. 7</a> had  conferred	uncontrolled
power  on the State Government to vary the ceiling  area  or
the  economic  holding	or  that<a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_16"> s. 7</a>  was  vitiated  by  an
excessive delegation of legislative power to the State.

by
BHAGWATI,  J.-These  six  petitions under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_22">Art.	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution  challenge the vires of the Bombay Tenancy	 and
Agricultural  Lands  (Amendment) Act, 1956  (Bom.   XIII  of
1956) (hereinafter referred to as the " impugned Act ").  It
was  an	 Act  further  to  amend  the  Bombay  Tenancy	 and
Agricultural   Lands  Act,  1948  (Bom.	  LXVII	  of   1948)
(hereinafter called the 1948 Act ").
</p><p id="p_7">The petitioners are citizens of India and landholders within
the  meaning of the 1948 Act holding several acres  of	land
within	the  State of Bombay out of which a  few  acres	 are
under  their  own cultivation, the bulk of the	lands  being
under  the cultivation of tenantsexcept in the case of	-the
petitioners  in Petition No. 58 of 1958 where the  whole  of
the lands are under the cultivation of tenants.
The  1948 Act had been passed by the State Legislature as  a
measure of agrarian reform on December 28, 1948, with a view
to amend the law relating to tenancies of agricultural lands
and  to	 make certain other provisions in  regard  to  those
lands and the objectives sought to be achieved were thus set
out in the second paragraph of the preamble:-
"  AND WHEREAS on account of the neglect of a landholder  or
disputes   between  a  landholder  and	his   tenants,	 the
cultivation of his estate has seriously suffered, or for the
purpose	 of improving the economic and social conditions  of
peasants or ensuring the full and efficient use of land	 for
agricultural purposes, it is expedient to assume  management
of  estates held by landholders and to regulate	 and  impose
restrictions on the transfer of agricultural lands, dwelling
houses, sites and lands appurtenant thereto belonging to  or
occupied by agriculturists, agricultural labourers and
(1)		       493
artisans  in the Province of Bombay and to  make  provisions
for	  certain      other	  purposes	 hereinafter
appearing................
</p><p id="p_8"><a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_23">Section 2(8)</a> of the said Act defined " Land " to mean:
"(a)  land  which  is used for	agricultural  purposes,	 and
includes-
</p><p id="p_9">(a)  the  sites of farm buildings appurtenant to such  land;
and used for agricultural purposes, and
</p><p id="p_10">(b).........................................................
</p><p id="p_11">(i) the sites of dwelling houses occupied by agriculturists,

"Landholder  "	was defined in<a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_24"> s. 2(9)</a> of the  said  Act  to
mean:-
</p><p id="p_13">"a zamindar, jagirdar, saranjandar, inamdar, talukdar, malik
or a khot or any person not hereinbefore specified who is  a
holder	of land or who is interested in land, and  whom	 the
State  Government has declared on account of the extent	 and
the value of the land or his interests therein to be a land-
bolder for the purposes of this Act."
</p><p id="p_14">Under <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_25"> s.  2(21)</a> of the said Act the words  and	 expressions
used  in  the Act but not defined were to have	the  meaning
assigned to them in the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879,	 and
the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_26">Transfer of Property Act</a>, 1882, as the case may be.
With  a	 view  to achieve the objective	 of  establishing  a
socialistic  pattern  of  society in the  State	 within	 the
meaning of Articles 38 and 39 of the Constitution, a further
measure	 of  agrarian  reform  was  enacted  by	 the   State
Legislature,  being the impugned Act, hereinbefore  referred
to,  which was designed to bring about such distribution  of
the  ownership and control of agricultural lands as best  to
subserve  the common good thus eliminating concentration  of
wealth and means of production to the common detriment.	 The
said  Act received the assent of the President on March	 16,
1956, was published in the Bombay Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">494</span>
Gazette	 on March 29, 1956, and came into  force  throughout
the State on August 1, 1956.
</p><p id="p_15">In  about November, 1956, certain landholders from  Kolhapur
and  Sholapur  districts  in  the  State  of  Bombay   filed
petitions  in  the Bombay High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Art. 226</a>  of	 the
Constitution   challenging  the	 constitutionality  of	 the
impugned  Act on various grounds.' A Division Bench  of	 the
Bombay	High Court pronounced its judgment on  February	 21,
1957, dismissing those petitions with costs except in regard
to a declaration as regards the invalidity of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_28">section 88D</a> of
the  Act.   The	 petitioners herein  thereupon	filed  these
petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_29">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution challenging	 the
vires of the impugned Act and praying for a writ of mandamus
against	 the State of Bombay ordering them to  forbear	from
enforcing  or  taking any steps in enforcement of  the	act,
costs and further  reliefs.
</p><p id="p_16">Petition  No.  13  of 1957 appears to  have  been  filed  on
December  3,  1956, but effective steps therein	 were  taken
only when an application for, stay with a prayer for an	 ex-
parte order being C.M.P. No. 359 of 1957 was filed herein on
March 21, 1957.	 Petitions Nos. 38 to 41 of 1957 were  filed
on March 21, 1957, and Petition No. 55 of 1958 was filed  on
March 19, 1958.
</p><p id="p_17">All  these petitions followed a common pattern and the	main
grounds	 of attack were: that the State Legislature was	 not
competent to pass the said Act, the topic of legislation not
being covered by any 'entry in the State List; that the said
Act  was beyond the am bit of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_30">Art. 31-A</a> of the	Constitution
and  was therefore vulnerable as infringing the	 fundamental
rights	enshrined in Arts. 14, 19 and 31 thereof;  that	 the
provisions of the said Act in fact infringed the fundamental
rights	of the petitioners conferred upon them by Arts.	 14.
119  and  31 of the Constitution; that the said	 Act  was  a
piece  of colourable legislation and in any event a part  of
the provisions thereof -suffered from the vice of  excessive
delegation  of legislative power.  The answer of  the  State
was  that  the impugned Act was covered by Entry No.  18  in
List 11 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, that it
was  a	piece  of  legislation	for  the  extinguishment  or
modification of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">495</span>
rights in relation to estates within the definition  thereof
in  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_31">Art. 31-A</a> of the Constitution and that therefore it	 was
not open to challenge under Arts. 14, 19 and 31 thereof	 and
that  it was neither a piece of colourable  legislation	 nor
did  any part thereof come within the mischief of  excessive
delegation.
</p><p id="p_18">As to the legislative competence of the State Legislature to
pass the impugned Act the question lies within a very narrow
compass.  As already stated, the impugned Act was a  further
measure	 of agrarian reform enacted with a view	 to  further
amend  the 1948 Act and the object of the enactment  was  to
bring about such distribution of the ownership and,  control
of  agricultural lands as best to subserve the common  good.
This  object  was sought to be achieved	 by  fixing  ceiling
areas  of  lands  which could be held by a per	son  and  by
prescribing  what  was an economic holding.   It  sought  to
equitably  distribute the lands between the landholders	 and
the  tenants and except in those cases where the  landholder
wanted	the  land for cultivating the  same  personally	 for
which due provision was made in the Act, transferred by	 way
of  compulsory	purchase all the other lands to	 tenants  in
possession of the same with effect from April 1, 1957, which
was called the " tillers day ". Provision 'Was also made for
disposal  of balance of lands after purchase by tenants	 and
the basic idea underlying the provisions of the impugned Act
was  to prevent the concentration of agricultural  lands  in
the  hands  of	landholders to the  common  detriment.	 The
tiller	or  the cultivator was brought into  direct  contact
with the State eliminating thereby the landholders who	were
in  the	 position  of intermediaries.	The  enactment	thus
affected the relation between landlord and tenant,  provided
for the transfer and-alienation of agricultural lands, aimed
at land improvement and was broadly stated a legislation  in
regard	 to   the  rights  in	or   over   land:-categories
specifically  referred	to  in Entry 18 in List	 11  of	 the
Seventh	 Schedule to the Constitution, which  specifies	 the
head of legislation as " land, that is to say, rights in  or
over  land, land tenures including the relation of  landlord
and tenant, and the collection of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">496</span>
rents;	transfer and alienation of agricultural	 land;	land
improvement and agricultural loans; colonization ".
It  is well settled that these heads of	 legislation  should
not  be construed in a narrow and pedantic sense but  should
be  given  a  large  and  liberal  interpretation.   As	 was
observed  by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  in
British Coal Corporation v. The King (1):-
"Indeed,  in interpreting a constituent or  organic  statute
such  as the Act, that construction most beneficial  to	 the
widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adopted."
The  Federal  Court also in the United	Provinces  V.  Atiqa
Begum (2) pointed out that none of the items in the Lists is
to  be	read in a narrow or restricted sense and  that	each
general	 word should be held to extend to all  ancillary  or
subsidiary  matters which can fairly and reasonably be	said
to  be	comprehended  in it.   This  Court  in	<a href="/doc/1126318/" id="a_32">Navinchandra
Mafatlal v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City</a>	 (3)
also expressed the same opinion and stated:-
"The cardinal rule of interpretation, however, is that words
should	be read in their ordinary, natural  and	 grammatical
meaning subject to this rider, that in construing words in a
constitutional	enactment conferring legislative  power	 the
most  liberal construction should be put upon words so	that
the  same may have effect in their widest  amplitude."	(See
also <a href="/doc/1750663/" id="a_33">Thakur Amar Singhji v. State of Rajasthan</a>(4)).
Having	regard to the principle of  construction  enunciated
above, it is clear that the impugned Act is covered by Entry
18  in List II of the Seventh Schedule to  the	Constitution
and is a legislation with reference to "land " and this plea
of  legislative	 incompetence of the  State  Legislature  to
enact the impugned Act therefore fails.
</p><p id="p_19">If,  then, the State Legislature was competent to enact	 the
impugned  Act,	is the Act ultra vires the  Constitution  as
infringing any of the fundamental

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">497</span>
<p id="p_23">rights conferred upon the petitioners ? In the course Of the
arguments  before  us learned counsel  for  the	 petitioners
confined  their attack only to the constitutionality of	<a href="/doc/1272508/" id="a_34"> ss.

Act  as violative of the fundamental right guaranteed  under
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_44">Art.  19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.  The first	question  to
consider in this context however is whether the impugned Act
is protected by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_45">Art. 31-A</a> of the Constitution because if  it
in  so	protected, no challenge on the score of	 the  provi-
sions  thereof	violating  Arts. 14,19 and 31  of  the	Con-
stitution would be available to the petitioners.
The  relevant  portions	 of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_46">Art.  31-A</a>	 which	fall  to  be
considered here read as follows:-

</p><p id="p_30">The question which we have to address ourselves intially  is
whether the lands held by the petitioners,who are admittedly
landholders  within the 8 Act, are of the term contained  in
s. 2.(9) of the 194 "estates " within the meaning of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_51">Art. 31</a>
A of the constitution.
</p><p id="p_31">Before	we launch upon that enquiry it would perhaps  be  of
helP  to  note	how the	 various  land	tenures	 originated.
Baden-Powell  in  his Land-Systems of  British	India  (1892
Ed.), Vol. 1, dealing with the general view of land  tenures
traced the origin and growth at @p. 97 of different  tenures
in the manner following at pp. 97-99 (Chapter IV):-
"  4.  Effects of Land-Revenue Administration  and  Revenue-
farming.  Then again the greater Oriental governments  which
</p><p id="p_32">-preceded  ours,  have	always, in  one	 -form	or  another,
derived the bulk of their State-revenues and Royal  property
from  the land.	 In one system known to us, "Royal  lands  "
were  allotted in the principal villages, and this fact	 may
have suggested to the Mughals their plan of allotting spcial
farms  and villages to furnish the privy Purse, and has	 had
other  survivals.   But, speaking generally,  the  universal
plan of taking	revenue was by taking a share of the  actual
grain  heap  on the the threshing-floor	 from  each  payment
levied	on  each  estate or each field	as  the	 case  might
be...............   To	collect	 this  revenue,	 the   ruler
appointed or recognized not only a headman and accountant in
each  village, but also a hierarchy of graded  officials  in
districts  and	minor  divisions  of  territory	 formed	 for
administrative	 purposes.    These  officers	were   often
remunerated  by	 holdings  of  land, and  a  class  of	land
</p><p id="p_33">-tenures  will	be found in some parts of India	 owning	 its
origin to these hereditary official holding s. Not only	 so,
but  during  the  decline which	 Oriental  governments	have
usually	 undergone, the Revenue official have been  commonly
found  to  merge in, or be superseded,	by  revenue-farmers-
persons who
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">499</span>
contracted for a certain sum of revenue to be paid int,	 the
Treasury from a given area, I as representing the State dues
exigible  from	the land-holdings within  that	area.	Such
revenue-farmers,  or officials, whatever their origin,	have
always tended to absorb the interest of the land-holders and
to become in time the virtual landlords over them.
Nor is it only that landlord tenures arise in this way.	  No
sooner does the superior right take shape than we find	many
curious	 new tenures created by the landlord or arising	 out
of his attempts to conciliate or provide for certain eminent
claims in the grade below him.
</p><p id="p_34">S.   5. Effects of Assignment or Remission of LandRevenue.
Yet  another class of tenures arises in connection with	 the
State  Revenue-administration;	and that is when  the  ruler
either	excuses	 an  existing land-holder  from	 paying	 his
revenue,  either  wholly  or in part; or "  alienates  "  or
assigns the revenue of a certain estate or tract of  country
in  favour of some chief, or other person of importance,  or
to provide funds for some special objects, or to serve as  a
recompense for services to be rendered.
</p><p id="p_35">At  first such grants are carefully regulated, are for	life
only, and strictly kept to their purpose, and to the  amount
fixed.	 But  as matters go on, and the ruler is  a  bad  or
unscrupulous  one, his treasury is empty, and he makes	such
grants to avoid the dificulty of finding a cash salary.	 The
grants become permanent and hereditary; they are also issued
by officials who have no right to make them; and not only do
they  then  result  in landlord tenures	 and  other  curious
rights, but are a burden to after times, and have  furnished
a  most	 troublesome legacy to our own	Government  when  it
found  the revenues eaten up by grantees whose	titles	were
invalid, and whose pretensions, though grown old in times of
disorder, were inadmissible.
</p><p id="p_36">Such  grants  may have begun with no title to the  land	 but
only a right to the revenue, but want of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">500</span>
supervision and control has resulted in the grantee  seizing
the landed right also.
</p><p id="p_37">Here  we find the distinction between the State owned  lands
which  are  unalienated where the tenures arise out  of	 the
exigencies  of	revenue collection and alienated  lands	 the
revenue	 whereof is remitted either wholly or in part or  in
other  words  "	 alienated " or	 assigned  to  grantees	 for
various purposes.
</p><p id="p_38">Various	  land	 tenures  thus	developed  and	 series	  of
proprietorships came into existence.  The main tenures which
the  British found when they came into power comprised:	 (1)
the Khas or tenure by Government; (2)the Raiyatwari  tenure;
(3)  the Zamindari or landlord tenure and (4) the  Taluqdari
or double tenure.
</p><p id="p_39">It  is	interesting to note in this connection that  in	 the
table compiled by Baden-Powell in Vol.III of his Book at  p.
142  giving some idea of the distribution of  the  different
classes of landed estates in Madras the different classes of
landed	 estates   described  therein  included	  not	only
Zamindaris  but	 also  " estates " hold	 by  Raiyats  paying
diverse sums as and by way of land revenue.
</p><p id="p_40">So far as the area within the State of Bombay was  concerned
the position is thus summed up in Dande-
</p><p id="p_41">kar's Law of Land Tenures, Vol. 1 at p. 12:-
</p><p id="p_42">Section III.  Classification of land according to the
interest of the holder:
</p><p id="p_43">"Land is either Government land or not Government land; that
is,  it is either unalienated or alienated.  The  expression
for unalienated land is khalsa or ryatawari in some parts as
opposed to dumala or inam lands, that is, alienated lands In
Gujrat Government lands are called " sarkari " as opposed to
"baharkhali"lands   meaning   alienated	  lands-lands	 the
produce.of  which  had	not  to be  brought  to	 the  common
threshing  ground.   In	 some parts of	Gujrat	there  are,"
talpad	" (Government) lands as opposed to " Wanta "  lands.
In old Regulations two kinds of land have been referred	 to,
namely, malguzarry land and lakhiraj land.  The former meant
land paying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">501</span>
assessment to Government, whereas the latter meant land free
from  payment of assessment.  Khalsa land in  the  permanent
occupation  of holders was denominated, before	the  survey-
settlements,  in the different parts of 'the  Presidency  by
the expressions mirasi, dhara, suti and muli.  I  Government
arable	land not in the permanent occupation of an  occupant
was  and  is  described by the	name  sheri.   In  alienated
villages,  lands corresponding to Government "sheri "  lands
are denominated by the expressions, "sheri " ".Khas Kamath "
and  " Ghar Khedu ". Lands in leasehold or  farmed  villages
are called khoti lands.	 Lands which are given under  leases
and  the  assessment  of which is  regulated  by  the  terms
thereof are called kauli lands."
</p><p id="p_44">It  will be observed that Mirasi, Dhara, Suti and Muli	were
all  tenures  in regard to unalienated	lands,	the  tenure-
holders	 being permanent holders of land  having  hereditary
interests  in  their holdings. , The Khoti  tenures  in	 the
Konkan and the Bhagdari and Narvadari tenures in some  parts
of Gujrat were also tenures in regard to unalienated  lands,
there venue being assessed on those lands on entire villages
and not on specific pieces of land either in lump or on	 the
basis  of a fixed Bighoti assessment on each field  and	 the
tenure-holders being responsible for the payment of the, sum
in certain specified modes.  The general prevailing  tenure,
however,  was the Raiyatwari tenure where the Raiyat or	 the
tenant	had  the right of an occupant in his  holding.	 The
right of an occupant was a heritable right and on the  death
of a registered occupant the name of his heir was entered in
his  place.   All  these were land  tenures  in	 respect  of
unalienated  lands and the Bombay Survey and <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_52">Settlement	 Act</a>
(Bom.  1 of 1865) passed in 1865. applied, generally to	 the
same.	There were of course certain Acts which	 dealt	with
specific   tenures  mentioned  above,  e.g.,  Bhagdari	 and
Narvadari   Tenures  Act  (Bom.	  V  of	 1862),	 and   Khoti
Settlement Act (Bom. 1 of 1880); but by and large they	were
tenures in regard to unalienated lands and were governed  by
the  Bombay  Survey and <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_53">Settlement Act</a>, 1865.  In  1879	 the
State Legislature
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">502</span>
enacted, the Bombay Land Revenue Code (Bom.  V of 1879) with
a view to consolidate and amend the law relating to  Revenue
Officers, to the assessment and recovery of land revenue and
to other matters connected with land revenue administration.
<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_54">This  Act</a>  extended  to the whole of  the  State  of  Bombay
excluding the City of Bombay and certain other areas therein
mentioned.   We	 shall	have occasion to  refer	 to  certain
provisions of this Act hereafter.
</p><p id="p_45">Turning	 now  to  alienated lands  in  which  category	were
comprised  lands not belonging to government and  lands	 not
paying	revenue to government which were exceptions  to	 the
principles of State proprietorship and of liability of land-
holders	 to pay land revenue to government we find that	 the
alienations  were classified as: (1) political tenures	such
as  Jagirs and Saranjams; (2) Service Inams ;  (3)  Personal
Inams	and   (4)  Religious  endowments.    The   principal
alienations  were  Inams, Jagirs or  Saranjams	and  Watans.
Each  of  them was considered as a tenure, had got  its	 own
history,  its  own  features  and  peculiarities.    Summary
settlements  were  effected  by the  government	 with  these
tenure-holders	and their rights as such  recognized.  There
were Taluqdari tenures or estates in Gujrat which also	came
under this category and it may be noted that several  pieces
of  legislation	 were  passed by the  State  Legislature  in
regard	to those several tenures of alienated lands, e.	 g.,
Titles	to  Rent-Free  Estates	Act  (Bom.   XI	 of   1852);
Ahmedabad   Taluqdar's	Act  (Bom.   VI	 of  1862);   Bombay
Hereditary Offices Act (Bom.  III of 1874); Broach and Kaira
Encumbered Estates Act (Bom.  XIV of 1877); Broach and Kaira
Encumbered  Estates  Act (Bom.	XXI of 1881);  Matadars	 Act
(Bom.	VI  of 1887) and Gujrat Taluqdars Act (Bom.   VI  of
1888).	 Our attention was also drawn in this connection  to
the  various Acts passed by the State  Legislature  (between
1949 and 1955) abolishing the several land tenures in Bombay
where  the  government was not in direct  contact  with	 the
tiller	of  the	 soil  but there  was  an  interposition  of
intermediaries	between	 them,	the  intermediaries   having
leased out parts of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">503</span>
the  lands to the tenants who actually cultivated  the	soil
and it was urged that the interests of these  intermediaries
were estates properly so called.
</p><p id="p_46">It is to be noticed, however, that the several land  tenures
which  were thus abolished were not only tenures in  respect
of  alienated  lands but also  comprise	 unalienated  lands,
e.g.,  the Bombay Bhagdari and Narvadari  Tenures  Abolition
Act, 1949 (Bom.	 XXXII of 1949); The Bombay Khoti  Abolition
Act,  1949  (Bom.   VI	of  1950)  and	the  Bombay   Merged
Territories  (Janjira and Bhor) Khoti Tenure Abolition	Act,
1953  (Bom.  LXXI of 1953).  There was no  distinction	made
thus  between land tenures in regard to alienated lands	 and
those in regard to unalienated lands.  It may also be  noted
that  all  these Acts followed a common pattern,  viz.,	 the
abolition  of these land tenures, award of  compensation  to
the tenure holders whose tenures were thus abolished and the
establishment of direct relations between the government  on
the  one hand and the tenure-holders cultivating  the  lands
personally  and	 the  tenants cultivating the  soil  on	 the
other.	 All these persons, thus cultivating the  soil	were
given  the status of occupants and direct  relationship	 was
thus  established  between the government and  them.   <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_55">These
Act</a>s  so  far as our present purpose is concerned  are	only
mentioned to show the different types of land tenures  which
existed	 in the State of Bombay prior to their abolition  as
aforesaid.
</p><p id="p_47">These  were the various land tenures known in the  State  of
Bombay	and we may at this stage appropriately refer to	 the
statistics (1886-87) of these tenures given by	Baden-Powell
in Vol.III of his said Book at

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">505</span>
<p id="p_50">It  is to be noted that the holdings of the  landholders  in
Ryatwari villages apart from others were also styled therein
as estates or holdings.
</p><p id="p_51">It was vehemently urged before us by learned counsel for the
petitioners  that  the expression " estate "  aptly  applied
only  to  lands	 held  by  the	various	 tenure	 holders  of
alienated  lands  above referred to, and that it  could	 not
apply to the holdings of occupants who had merely a right of
occupancy in specific pieces of unalienated lands.  The word
" estate " had been defined in the Bombay Land Revenue Code,
1879,  in<a href="/doc/95498655/" id="a_56"> s. 2(5)</a> to mean : " any interest in lands and	 the
aggregate of such interests vested in a person or  aggregate
of  persons  capable of holding the same," and	would  prima
facie cover not only an interest in alienated lands but also
in  unalienated	 lands.	  It  was  however  urged  that	 the
expression  "  estate " should be construed  in	 a  narrower
sense	having	regard	to  the	 legislative   history	 and
particularly  to the fact that the lands held by the  tenure
holders	 of  alienated	lands only had prior  to  1879	been
recognized as estates and the holding of an occupant was not
treated	 as  such.  The distinction thus sought to  be	made
between	  holders  of  unalienated  lands  and	holders	  of
alienated lands. is not of much consequence because even  in
regard to unalienated lands besides the occupants there were
tenure holders called Bhagdars and Narwadars and Khotes	 who
had  interests	in lands held by them  under  those  several
tenures	 which lands were unalienated lands.  The  interests
which these tenure holders enjoyed in the lands held by them
were " estates " and it could not therefore be predicated of
the  expression	 "estate"  that it could  only	be  used  in
connection  with alienated lands.  If this  distinction	 was
therefore of no avail, we have only got to consider if there
is any reason why a narrow interpretation should be put upon
the  expression	 "estate" as suggested by  the	petitioners.
Reliance   was	placed	by  the	 learned  counsel  for	 the
petitioners  on	 a  decision of	 this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1800386/" id="a_57">Hariprasad
Shivshankar  Shukla  v.	 A. D. Divikar</a> (1)  where  the	word

<p id="p_52">retrenchment  "	 in<a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_59"> s. 25F</a> of the Industrial  Disputes	Act,
1947,  as amended by Act XLIII of 1953 were held to have  no
wider  meaning	than the ordinary  accepted  connotation  of
those  words and were held to mean the discharge of  surplus
labour	or staff by the employer for any reason	 whatsoever,
otherwise  than	 as  a	punishments  inflicted	by  way	  of
disciplinary  action,  and did not  include  termination  of
services  of all workmen on a bona fide closure of  industry
or  on	change	of ownership or	 management  thereof.	Even
though	the word " retrenchment" was defined as meaning	 the
termination  of services by an employer of the	workmen	 for
any  reason  whatsoever,  otherwise  than  as  a  punishment
inflicted  by way of disciplinary action, which	 words	were
capable	 of including within their scope the termination  of
services  of all workmen on a bona fide closure of  industry
or on change of ownership or management thereof, the word  "
retrenchment  " was construed in a narrow sense because	 the
word  " retrenchment " connoted in its	ordinary  acceptance
that  the business itself was being conducted and a  portion
of  the staff or labour force was discharged as	 surplusage.
This  Court observed in the course of the judgment  at	page
132:-
</p><p id="p_53">"  In the absence of any compelling words to  indicate	that
the intention was even to include a bona fide closure of the
whole  business,  it  would,  we  think,  be  divorcing	 the
expression  altogether	from its context to give it  such  a
wide meaning as is contended for by learned counsel for	 the
respondent.  What is being defined is retrenchment, and that
is  the	 context  of the definition.  It  is  true  that  an
artificial  definition may include a meaning different	from
or  in excess of the ordinary acceptation of the word  which
is  the	 subject  of  definition; but  there  must  then  be
compelling words to show that such a meaning different	from
or  in excess of the ordinary meaning is  intended.   Where,
within	the  framework of the ordinary	acceptation  of	 the
word,  every single requirement of the definition clause  is
fulfilled,  it	would  be wrong to take	 the  definition  as
destroying the essential meaning of the word defined."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">507</span>
<p id="p_54">Reliance  was  also  placed on a decision of  the  Court  of
Appeal in England in Re The Vexatious Actions Act, 1896,  In
re Bernard Boaler (1) where the words " legal proceedings  "
were  held not to include criminal proceedings, in spite  of
the  words being prima facie capable of including the  same.
Kennedy,  C. J., expressed his view at page 32 that  it	 was
impossible to say that the meaning of the expression " legal
proceedings  "	was  in	 itself	 and  by  itself  clear	 and
unambiguous and followed the dictum of Lord Esher in Rex  v.
City of London Court(2):-
</p><p id="p_55">"  If the words of an Act admit of two interpretations	then
they  are not clear ; and if one interpretation leads to  an
absurdity  and the other does not, the Court  will  conclude
that the Legislature did not intend to lead to an absurdity,
and will adopt the other interpretation.  "
Scrutton, J., also expressed the same opinion at p. 41 :-
"  I  find  general words used in the  Act  capable  of	 two
meanings, a wider and a narrower one.  On the whole I  think
the  language is more suited to the narrower than the  wider
meaning.  The narrower meaning will affect the liberties  of
the  subject  to some extent; the wider	 meaning  will	most
seriously  affect the liberties of the subject in a  matter,
his  personal liberty and safety, which I see no  reason  in
the  Act  to  believe  was  in	the  contemplation  of	 the
Legislature.	I   decline  to	 make  this   more   serious
interference  with  the liberty of the subject,	 unless	 the
Legislature  uses language clear enough to convince me	that
that  was  its	intention,  and I  think  ample	 meaning  is
provided for its words, and ample remedy is provided for the
grievance in respect of which Parliament was legislating  by
putting	 the narrower construction on the general  words  it
has used.  "
</p><p id="p_56">Are there any circumstances in the present case which  would
compel us to put a narrower construction on the expression "
estate " in s. 2(5) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879  ?
It is true that the expression " estate " was used prior  to
1879 in connection
(1) [1915] 1 K.B. 21.
</p><p id="p_57">(2) [1892] 1 Q.B. 273, 290.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">508</span>
<p id="p_58">with  the  interests  which the various	 tenure	 holders  of
alienated  lands held in their respective lands but it	does
not therefore follow that that expression could be used only
in  connection	with  those interests and  no  others.	 The
Watandars, Saranjamdars, Inamdars and Taluqdars and the like
were  no  doubt holders of " estates " but  does  that	fact
militate  against the occupants also holding " estates "  in
the  lands which were the subject-matter of  their  tenures.
The  words  of the definition contained in s.  2(5)  of	 the
Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, were clear and	unambiguous.
They meant any interest in lands and the expression "  lands
"  was capable of comprising within its ambit alienated	 and
unalienated lands.
</p><p id="p_59">As  a matter of fact, the definition of " Superior holder  "
in<a href="/doc/95498655/" id="a_60"> s. 2(13)</a> and the definition of " alienated " in s.  2(20)
of  the	 Code,	provisions of<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_61"> s. 111</a> in	 regard	 to  revenue
management  of	villages  or estates not  belonging  to	 the

estates	 and  of <a href="/doc/80424683/" id="a_63"> s. 36</a> prescribing  liability	for  revenue
amongst others refer not only to alienated lands but also to
unalienated  lands  and	 the expression	 "  estates  "	used
therein	 can have reference not only to alienated lands	 but
also  to  unalienated  lands.	If  the	 definition  of	 the
expression  "  estate " in the context of the Code  is	thus
clear  and  unambiguous	 as comprising both  the  types	 -of
lands,	there  is no reason why a narrower  construction  as
suggested  by  the  petitioners	 should	 be  put  upon	 the
expression " estate ". (See the observations of Kennedy,  L.
J., in Vexatious Actions Act, 1896, In re.  Boaler (1) at p.
31 and the observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/1392373/" id="a_64">Baia Sri  Sailendra
Narayan	 Bhanja	 Deo v. The State of Orissa</a>  (2).   Even  if
there  was  any	 ambiguity  in	the  expression,  the  wider
significance  should  be  adopted  in  the  context  of	 the
objectives of the Act as stated above.
</p><p id="p_60">We  are, therefore, of opinion that the expression estate  "
had  the  meaning  of any interest in land and	it  was	 not
confined merely to the holdings of landholders of  alienated

holders	  but  also  to	 land  holders	and   occupants	  of
unalienated lands.

<p id="p_63">It  was however contended on behalf of the petitioners	that
the Bombay Land Revenue Code was not a law relating to	land
tenures	 in force in the State of Bombay and  therefore	 the
definition  of the expression " estate "  contained  therein
would not avail the respondent.	 It was urged that the	Code
was passed by the State Legislature in order to	 consolidate
and  amend the law relating to Revenue Officers, and to	 the
assessment  and	 recovery  of Land  Revenue,  and  to  other
matters	 connected with the Land Revenue  Administration  in
the  Presidency of Bombay and was merely concerned with	 the
collection  of land revenue by the State and had nothing  to
do  with  land	tenures as such.   This	 argument,  however,
ignores the various provisions of the Code which define	 the
status	as also the rights and obligations of  the  occupant
who  has  been defined in s. 2(16) of the Code to  mean	 the
holder in actual possession of unalienated lands other	than
a tenant provided that where the holder in actual possession
is  a  tenant, the landholder or superior landlord,  as	 the
case may be, shall be deemed to be the occupant.  Chapter VI
deals with the Grant, Use and Relinquishment of	 unalienated
lands  and <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_65"> s. 65</a> thereof prescribes the uses  to  which  an
occupant  of  land for purposes of agriculture may  put	 his
land.	Under<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_66"> s. 68</a> an occupant-is entitled to the  use	 and
occupation of his land for the period therein prescribed  on
fulfilling the conditions therein mentioned and under<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_67"> s.  73</a>
occupancy  is  stated  to  be  transferable  and  heritable.
<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_68">Section 73</a> as it was enacted in 1879 read as follows: "	 The
right of occupancy shall subject to the provisions contained
in <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_69">section 56</a>, and to any conditions lawfully annexed to the
occupancy and save as otherwise prescribed by law, be deemed
an heritable and transferable property." Certain  amendments
have  been  made  in this section  by  various	Bombay	Land
Revenue	 Amendment Acts, (Bom.	VI of 1901 and Bom.   IV  of
1913)  and  the section as it stands at present	 reads:"  An
occupancy  shall,  subject to the  provisions  contained  in
<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_70">section	 56</a>, and to any conditions lawfully annexed  to	 the
tenure,	 and save as otherwise prescribed by law, be  deemed
an heritable and transferable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">510</span>
property." This goes to show that an occupant holds the land
under  a tenure and occupancy is a species of land  tenures.
The  provisions contained in<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_71"> s. 73(A)</a> relating to the  power
of  the State Government to restrict the right	of  transfer
and the provisions in regard to relinquishments contained in
ss. 74, 75 and 76 also point to the same conclusion.   These
and  similar provisions go to show that occupancy is one  of
the  varieties of land tenures and the Bombay  Land  Revenue
Code, 1879, comes within the description of " existing	laws
relating  to land tenures in force" in the State  of  Bombay
within	the  meaning of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_72">Art. 31A  (2)(a).</a>   BadenPowell	 has
similar	 observations to make in regard to these  provisions
in his Land Systems in British India, Vol.  1 at p. 321:-
"Nothing  whatever  is said in the Revenue  Code  about	 the
person in possession (on his own account) being " owner " in
the  Western sense.  He is simply called the "	occupant  ",
and  the Code says what he can do and what he  cannot.	 The
occupant may do anything he pleases to improve the land, but
may  not  without permission do anything which	diverts	 the
holding	 from  agricultural purposes.  He has  no  right  to
mines or minerals.
</p><p id="p_64">These are the facts of the tenure; you may theorize on	them
as  you please; you may say this amounts to  proprietorship,
or this is a dominium minus plenum; or anything else."
There  is  no doubt therefore that the Bombay  Land  Revenue
Code, 1879, was an existing law relating to land tenures  in
force  in Bombay at the time when the  Constitution  (Fourth
Amendment) Act, 1955, was passed and <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_73">Art. 31A</a> in its amended
form was introduced therein and the expression "estate " had
a  meaning  given to it under<a href="/doc/95498655/" id="a_74"> s. 2(10)</a> there,  viz.,  "	 any
interest  in  land  "  which  comprised	 within	 its   scope
alienated  as  well  as unalienated lands  and	covered	 the
holdings of occupants within the meaning thereof.
The 1948 Act was passed by the State Legislature in order to
amend the law which governed the relations between landlords
and  tenants of agricultural lands the object sought  to  be
achieved being as hereinbefore
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">511</span>
set out.  <a href="/doc/95498655/" id="a_75">Section 2</a> of the Act defined the expressions "  to
cultivate personally " (s. 2(6)); ,landholder " (s. 2(9)); "
protected tenant " (s. 2(14) ) amongst other expressions and
provided in<a href="/doc/95498655/" id="a_76"> s. 2(21)</a> that words and expressions used in this
Act but not defined shall have the meaning assigned to	them
in  the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, and the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_77">Transfer  of
Property Act</a>, 1882, as the case may be.	 This brought in the
definition of the expression " estate " which had the  mean-
ing assigned to it in that Code, viz., any interest in	land
". The expression " landholder in<a href="/doc/1920937/" id="a_78"> s. 2(9)</a> above was  defined
to  mean  "  a	zamindar,  jagirdar,  saranjamdar,  inamdar,
talukdar,  malik  or a khot or any person  not	hereinbefore
specified  who is a holder of land or who is  interested  in
land, and whom the State Government has declared on  account
of the extent and value of the land or his interests therein
to be a landholder for the purposes of this Act." The latter
part  of this definition is significant and shows  that	 not
only  holders  of  alienated  lands  but  also	holders	  of
unalienated lands were comprised therein provided,  however,
the extent and value of the land or their interests  therein
were such as to deserve a declaration in that behalf at	 the
hands of the State Government.	The only point to note	here
is  that  no distinction was made even in this	Act  between
alienated  lands and unalienated lands and all interests  in
land howsoever acquired were treated on a par so far as	 the
holdings  were concerned, necessarily implying that even  an
occupant would come within the description of landholder and
his interests therein would come within the definition of  "
estate	" as defined in the Bombay Land Revenue Code,  1879.
Chapter	 III  made provisions for protected  tenants,  their
special	 rights and privileges and whoever came	 within	 the
category of protected tenant was given the right to purchase
from  the  landlord the land held by him as  such  protected
tenant notwithstanding any. thing contrary in law, usage  or
contract subject to the provisions of sub-s. 6 which imposed
restrictions  on  the  holdings	 of  landlords	as  well  as
tenants.  These provisions were analogous to the  provisions
contained in ss. 32 to 32 R of the impugned Act except	that
in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">512</span>
1948 Act the protected tenant had the option to purchase the
land  whereas under the impugned Act there was	a  provision
for  compulsory	 purchase  of the land by the  tenant  on  a
specified   date  subject  to  certain	conditions   therein
mentioned.  <a href="/doc/1316739/" id="a_79">Section 34</a> of the 1948 Act gave the landlord the
right	to   determine	protected  tenancy   under   certain
conditions  and was analogous to<a href="/doc/1901550/" id="a_80"> s. 31</a> of the  impugned	 Act
which  empowered the landlord to terminate the	tenancy	 for
personal cultivation and non-agricultural purposes. 50 acres
of  land were prescribed as the limit of the holding  either
by the landlord or the protected tenant which provision	 was
analogous to the one found in the impugned Act in regard  to
ceiling area and economic holdings.  Power was given to	 the
State Government under<a href="/doc/1933944/" id="a_81"> s. 36</a> to reduce the limit of 50 acres
by a notification in the official gazette and power was also
given similarly to direct that the limits of fifty acres  or
the  reduced  limit  specified in  such	 notification  shall
comprise  such kind or kinds of lands in the area as may  be
specified  in  the notification.  This power  was  analogous
again to the power given to the State Government under<a href="/doc/1839218/" id="a_82"> s.  7</a>
of  the	 impugned Act to vary the ceiling area	or  economic
holding originally prescribed in<a href="/doc/1272508/" id="a_83"> ss. 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1230613/" id="a_84">6</a> of the Act.
These  instances culled out from some of the  provisions  of
the  1948 Act go to show that the agrarian reform which	 was
initiated by that Act was designed to achieve the very	same
purpose	 of  distribution of the ownership  and	 control  of
agricultural  lands  so as to subserve the common  good	 and
eliminate   the	 concentration	of  wealth  to	the   common
detriment  which  purpose  became more	prominent  when	 the
Constitution  was  ushered in on January 26, 1950,  and	 the
directive principles of State Policy were enacted inter alia
in Arts. 38 and 39 of the Constitution.	 With the advent  of
the Constitution these provisions contained in the 1948	 Act
required to be tested on the touch-stone of the	 fundamental
rights	 enshrined  in	Part  III  thereof  and	  when	 the
Constitution   (First  Amendment)  Act,	 1951,	was   passed
introducing Arts. 31A and 31B in the Constitution, care	 was
taken to specify the 1948 Act in the Ninth Schedule so as to
make it immune from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">		    513</span>
attack on the score of any provision thereof being violative
of  the	 fundamental  rights  enacted in  Part	III  of	 the
Constitution.	The  1948 Act was the second  item  in	that
schedule and was expressly saved from any attack against the
constitutionality thereof by the express terms of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_85">Art. 31B.</a>
The  impugned Act which was passed by the State	 Legislature
in  1956 was a further measure of agrarian  reform  carrying
forward	 the  intentions which had their roots in  the	1948
Act.   Having  regard  to the  comparision  of	the  various
provisions of the 1948 Act and the impugned Act referred  to
above  it  could be legitimately urged that if	the  cognate
provisions of the 1948 Act were immune from attack in regard
to their constitutionality, on a parity of reasoning similar
provisions  contained in the impugned Act, though they	made
further	 strides  in the achievement of the objective  of  a
socialistic  pattern  of society would be  similarly  saved.
That  position, however, could not obtain  because  whatever
amendments  were  made by the impugned Act in the  1948	 Act
were  future  laws within the meaning of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_86">Art. 13(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  and  required to be tested  on  the  self-same
touchstone.   They would not be in terms saved by  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_87">Art.	 31B</a>
and would have to be scrutinized on their own merits  before
the  courts  came to the conclusion that they  were  enacted
within	the constitutional limitations.	 The very  terms  of
<a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_88">Art. 31B</a> envisaged that any competent legislature would have
the  power to repeal or amend the Acts and  the	 Regulations
specified  in  the  9th Schedule thereof  and  if  any	such
amendment  was ever made the vires of that would have to  be
tested.	 (<a href="/doc/1261101/" id="a_89">Vide	Abdul Rahiman Jamaluddin  Hurjuk  v.  Vithal

That</a>  brings us back to the provisions of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_90">Art. 31A</a> and to  a
consideration	as  to	whether	 the  impugned	Act  was   a
legislation  for the acquisition by the State of any  estate
or  of	any  rights    therein	or  the	 extinguishment	  or
modification of any such rights within, the meaning of	sub-
<a href="/doc/498442/" id="a_91">article (1)(a)</a> thereof We have already held that the  Bombay

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">65</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">514</span>
<p id="p_65">an  existing  law relating to land tenures in force  in	 the
State of Bombay and that the interests of occupants  amongst
others	fell  within  the expression "	estate	"  contained
therein.  That, however, was not enough for the	 petitioners
and  it	 was  further contended on their  behalf  that	even
though	the  impugned  Act may be a law in regard  to  an  "
estate	" within the meaning of the definition contained  in
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_92">Art. 31A(2)(a)</a> it was not law providing for the	 acquisition
by the State of any estate or any rights therein or for	 the
extinguishment	or  modification of any	 such  rights.	 The
impugned Act was certainly not a law for the acquisition  by
the  State  of any estate or of any rights  therein  because
even  the provisions with regard to the compulsory  purchase
by tenants of the land on the specified date transferred the
title  in those lands to the respective tenants and  not  to
the  State.   There was no compulsory acquisition of  any  "
estate " or any rights therein by the State itself and	this
provision  could not help the respondent.   The	 respondent,
however, urged that the provisions contained in the impugned
Act  were enacted for the extinguishment or modification  of
rights	in  " estates " and were, therefore, saved  by	<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_93">Art.
31A(1)(a).</a>    It  was  on  the	other  hand  urged  by	 the
petitioners  (1) that the extinguishment or modification  of
any  such,  rights  should only be in  the  process  of	 the
acquisition  by	 the ,State of any estate or of	 any  rights
therein	 and  (2) that the provisions in  the  impugned	 Act
amounted  to  a	 suspension of those rights but	 not  to  an
extinguishment or modification thereof We shall now  proceed
to examine these contentions of the petitioners.
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_94">Art. 31A(1)(a)</a> talks of two distinct objects of legislation;
one  being the acquisition by the State of any estate or  of
any  rights therein and the other being	 the  extinguishment
or modification of any such., rights,.	If the = acquires an
estate or any rights therein that acquisition would have  to
be  a  compulsory  acquisition within the  meaning  of	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_95">Art.
31(2)(A)</a>  which was also introduced in the  Constitution  by
the    Constitution    (Fourth	 Amendment)    Act,    1955,
simultaneously	with  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_96">Art.  31A(1)</a> thereof.   There  was  no
provision  made	 for the transfer of the  ownership  of	 any
property to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">515</span>
State  or  a Corporation owned or controlled by	 'the  State
with  the result that even though,these provisions  deprived
the  landholders of their property they did not amount to  a
compulsory  acquisition	 of the property by the	 State.	  If
this  part of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_97">Art. 31A(1)(a)</a> is thus eliminated what we	 are
left  with is whether these provisions of the  impugned	 Act
provided for an extinguishment or modification of any rights
in  " estates ". That is a distinct concept  altogether	 and
could  not be in the process of acquisition by the State  of
any " estate " or of any rights therein.  Acceptance of	 the
interpretation which is sought to be put upon these words by
the petitioners would involve the addition of words " in the
process of the acquisition by the State of any estate or  of
any rights therein " or " in the process of such acquisition
"  which according to the well known canons of	construction
cannot	be done.  If the language of the enactment is  clear
and unambiguous it would not be legitimate for the Courts to
add any words thereto and evolve therefrom some sense  which
may  be	 said to carry out the supposed	 intentions  of	 the
legislature.   The  intention of the Legislature  is  to  be
gathered  only	from  the  words used  by  it  and  no	such
liberties  can	be taken by the Courts	for  effectuating  a
supposed intention of the Legislature.	There is no  warrant
at all, in our opinion,' for adding these words to the plain
terms of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_98">Art. 31A (1)(a)</a> and the words	extinguishment	  or
modification of any such rights	   must	 be  understood	  in
their plain grammatical sense without any limitation of	 the
type suggested by the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_66">It,  therefore,	 remains to consider  whether  the  relevant
provisions of the impugned Act were designed to bring  about
an  extinguishment or modification of the landlord's  rights
in their " estates ". These provisions are contained in	<a href="/doc/324708/" id="a_99"> ss.
32</a>  to <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_100">32R</a> of the impugned Act and are under the  heading  "
Purchase  of lands by Tenants ". <a href="/doc/324708/" id="a_101">Section 32</a> provides that  "
on the first day of April, 1957 (hereinafter referred to  as
"  the	tillers day ") every tenant shall,  subject  to	 the
provisions  of	the next succeeding sections, be  deemed  to
have purchased from his landlord, free of all incumbrances
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">516</span>
subsisting thereon on the said day, the land held by him  as
tenant........................	provided certain  conditions
are  fulfilled.	 Under<a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_102"> s. 32A</a> the tenant shall be deemed  to
have  purchased	 the lands up to the ceiling  area  and	 the
tenant	shall not be deemed to have purchased lands held  by
him  as	 such tenant if he holds lands partly as  owner	 and
partly	as tenant but the area of the land held as owner  is
equal to or exceeds the ceiling area (s. 32B).	<a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_103">Section	 32C</a>
empowers the tenant to chose the land to be purchased if  he
holds  lands separately from more than one landlord  and  in
spite  of  anything contained in the  Bombay  Prevention  of
Fragmentation and Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1947  (Bom.
LXII  of 1947) the tenant shall be deemed to have  purchased
even  such fragments of the land held on tenancy  (s.  32D).
The balance of any land after the purchase by the tenant  as
above is to be disposed of as if it were land surrendered by
the tenant (s. 32E); and the right of the tenant to purchase
such  land where the landlord is a minor, or a widow,  or  a
person	subject	 to any mental or physical disability  or  a
serving	 member	 of the armed forces is postponed  till	 one
year  after  the cessation of disability.  The price  to  be
paid  by the tenant is to be determined by the	Tribunal  as
soon as may be after the tiller's day and the Tribunal is in
the  first instance to record in the prescribed	 manner	 the
statement  of  the tenant whether lie is willing or  is	 not
willing to purchase the land held by him as a tenant and  if
the  tenant fails to appear or makes a statement that he  is
not willing to purchase the land, the Tribunal is to declare
by  an order in writing that such tenant is not	 willing  to
purchase  the land and that the purchase is ineffective	 (S.
32G).	These  provisions also apply to a  sub-tenant  of  a
permanent  tenant who is deemed to have purchased  the	land
subject	 to  the conditions specified in<a href="/doc/1936732/" id="a_104"> ss. 32</a> to  <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_105">32E</a>	 (S.
</p><p id="p_67">321).	<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_106">Section	 32J</a>  provides for an appeal  to  the  State
Government  against the decision of Tribunal.	<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_107">Section	 32K</a>
prescribes  the mode of payment of price by the tenant;	 and
the purchase price is recoverable as arrears of land revenue
(S. 32L).  Under<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_108"> s. 32M</a> on the deposit of the price in	lump
sum or of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">517</span>
the last instalment of such price, the Tribunal is to  issue
a  certificate of purchase to the tenant in respect  of	 the
land,  which  certificate of purchase  shall  be  Conclusive
evidence of purchase.  If a tenant fails to pay the lump sum
within the period prescribed or is at any time in arrears of
four  instalments the purchase is to be ineffective and	 the
land  is  to  be at the disposal of the	 Collector  and	 any
amount	deposited  by such tenant towards the price  of	 the
land  is  to  be refunded to him.   <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_109">Section  32N</a>  gives	 the
landlord  a  right  to recover rent  when  purchase  becomes
ineffective,  as if the land had not been purchased at	all.
<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_110">Section	 32P</a> gives the power to the Collector to resume	 and
dispose	 of  land not purchased by tenants.  The  amount  of
purchase  price	 is to be applied  towards  satisfaction  of
debts  (s. 320) ; and the, purchaser is to be  evicted	from
the  land  purchased  by him as aforesaid  if  he  fails  to
cultivate the land personally (s. 32R).
</p><p id="p_68">It is argued on the strength of these provisions that  there
is  no	effective  purchase or effective sale  of  the	land
between	 the landlord and the tenant on the tiller's day  or
the  alternative  period  prescribed in	 that  behalf  until
certain conditions are fulfilled.  To start with it is	only
an  inchoate right which is given to the tenant to  purchase
the  land which he can perfect on a statement being made  by
him  before the Tribunal that he is willing to purchase	 the
land.	Even  if he does so, the land does not vest  in	 him
because only on the payment of the purchase price either  in
lump  or  by  instalments  can he  get	the  certificate  of
purchase  from the Tribunal.  If he commits default in	pay-
ment,  the purchase is ineffective and he gets no  title  to
the  land.  These provisions, it is submitted, do  not	vest
the  title to the land in the tenant at all until all  these
conditions  are fulfilled and if any one or more of them  is
not fulfilled the purchase becomes ineffective-in fact it is
no  purchase  at all-with the result that the title  to	 the
land which is already vested in the landlord is not at,	 all
transferred  to the purchaser.	If that is so, there  is  no
compulsory  sale  or  compulsory purchase  of  the  land  in
question  on the tiller's day or the alternative  period  of
time prescribed therefor and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">518</span>
there  is no extinguishment of the rights of  the  landlord.
His  rights  in	 the  land are	merely	suspended  and	such
suspension is certainly not an extinguishment of his  rights
therein nor a modification thereof within the meaning of the
expression  used in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_111">Art. 31A (1)(a).</a>  Reliance is placed  in
support	 of  this proposition on the  observations  of	this
Court in Thakur Raghubir Singh v. Court of Wards, Ajmer (1).
In that case, this Court considered the provisions of s. 112
of  the	 Ajmer Tenancy and Land Records Act (XLII  of  1950)
which  provided that if a landlord habitually infringes	 the
rights of a tenant under the Act he would be deemed to be  a
landlord who is disqualified to manage his own property	 and
his  property  would  be  liable  to  be  taken	 under	 the
superintendence of the Court of Wards.	Mahajan, J., (as  he
then was) observed at p. 1055:-
</p><p id="p_69">" Section 112 of the Act XLII of 1950, intended to  regulate
the rights. of landlords and tenants, is obviously not a law
providing  for	"  the acquisition by the  State  "  of	 the
estates of the landlords, or of any rights in those estates.
It  is	also not a law providing for the  extinguishment  or
modification  of  any such rights.   The  learned  Attorney-
General	 laid emphasis on the word " modification"  used  in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_112">Article	 31</a> A. That word in the context of the article	only
means  a modification of the proprietary right of a  citizen
like  an  extinguishment of that right	and  cannot  include
within	its  ambit  a  mere  suspension	 of  the  right	  of
management of estate for a time, definite or indefinite."
These observations were confined to suspension of the  right
of  management of the estate and not to a suspension of	 the
title  to the estate.  Apart from the question	whether	 the
suspension  of the title to the estate for a time,  definite
or  indefinite would amount to a modification of a right  in
the  estate  within  the meaning of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_113">Art.  31A	(1)(a</a>),	 the
position  as  it obtains in this case is that  there  is  no
suspension  of the title of the landlord at all.  The  title
of the landlord to-the land passes immediately to the tenant
on the tiller's
(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 1049.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">		    519</span>
<p id="p_70">day  and  there is a completed purchase or sale	 thereof  as
between the landlord and the tenant.  The tenant is no doubt
given a locus penitentiae and an option of declaring whether
he is or is not willing to purchase the land held by him  as
a  tenant.  If he fails to appear or makes a statement	that
he  is not willing to purchase the land, the Tribunal  shall
by  an	order  in writing declare that such  tenant  is	 not
willing	 to  purchase  the land and  that  the	purchase  is
ineffective.   It  is  only by such  a	declaration  by	 the
Tribunal that the purchase becomes ineffective.	 If no	such
declaration is made by the Tribunal the purchase would stand
as  statutorily	 effected  on  the  tiller's  day  and	will
continue to be operative, the only obligation on the  tenant
then  being the payment of price in the mode  determined  by
the Tribunal.  If the tenant commits default in the  payment
of such price either in lump or by instalments as determined
by  the	 Tribunal, <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_114"> s.	32M</a>  declares  the  purchase  to  be
ineffective but in that event the land shall then be at	 the
disposal  of the Collector to be disposed of by him  in	 the
manner	provided therein.  Here also the purchase  continues
to be effective as from the tiller's day until such  default
is  committed  and  there is no question  of  a	 conditional
purchase  or  sale  taking place between  the  landlord	 and
tenant.	  The title to the land which was vested  originally
in the landlord passes to the tenant on the tiller's day  or
the  alternative  period prescribed in	that  behalf.	This
title is defeasable only in the event of the tenant  failing
to  appear or making a statement that he is not	 willing  to
purchase  the land or committing default in payment  of	 the
price  thereof	as determined by the Tribunal.	 The  tenant
gets a vested interest in the land defeasable only in either
of  those  cases and it cannot therefore be  said  that	 the
title  of landlord to the land is suspended for	 any  period
definite  or indefinite.  If that is so, there is an  extin-
guishment  or in any event a modification of the  landlord's
right  in the estate well within the meaning of those  words
as used in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_115">Art. 31A(1)(a).</a>
</p><p id="p_71">We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the impugned
Act is covered by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_116">Art. 31A</a> and is protected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">520</span>
from  attack against its constitutionality on the  score  of
its  having  violated the fundamental rights,  enshrined  in
Arts. 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution.  That being so, the
attack	levelled against ss. 5, 6, 8, 9, 17A, 31 A to  31  D
and  32 to 32R on the score of their being violative of	 the
fundamental  rights conferred upon the petitioners is of  no
avail  to the petitioners.  This being the true position  it
is  not	 necessary  for	 us  to	 consider  the	 interesting
questions which were argued before us at some length,  viz.,
the nature, scope and extent of the provisions contained  in
Arts.  31(1) and 31(2) of the Constitution and the  line  of
demarcation between them as also the impact of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_117">Art. 31(1)</a> on
the  fundamental  right enshrined in <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_118">Art.  19(1)(f)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	Suffice	 it to say that	 under	the  circum-
stances no fundamental right of the petitioners before us is
infringed by the impugned Act or the provisions thereof	 and
the petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_119">Art. 32</a> cannot be sustained.
The impugned Act being within the legislative competence  of
the State Legislature no question as to its being a piece of
colourable  legislation can arise.  It is not a	 legislation
resorted to by the State Legislature with a view to  by-pass
the  provisions	 of List II of the seventh schedule  to	 the
Constitution,  attempting   to	do something  which  it	 was
otherwise  not	competent  to  do.   The  legislation  being
covered	 by  Entry 18 of the said List is really  a  further
measure	 for  agrarian reform which it was well	 within	 its
competence to enact.  It is not an expropriatory legislation
in  the guise of one covered by Entry 18 in the	 said  List.
It only fixes the ceiling area for the holding of the  land-
lord  cultivating  the	land personally	 and  transfers	 the
excess	holding to the tenant in actual cultivation  thereof
and there too the price of the land as fixed by the Tribunal
has  got  to  be paid by the tenant to	the  landlord.	 The
tenant also is not entitled to hold land beyond the  ceiling
area and there is a balance sought to be struck between	 the
interests  of the landlord and those of the tenants so	that
the means of production are not concentrated in the hands of
one  party  to the common detriment.  The price	 payable  is
also either
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">521</span>
in  lump or in such instalments as may be determined by	 the
Tribunal  and on default committed by the tenant in  payment
thereof the purchase becomes ineffective and the land deemed
to  have  been	purchased  by  the  tenant  reverts  to	 the
Collector to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions
contained  in  the  Act	 in that behalf.   It  may  be	that
instalments may be spread over a particular period which may
thus  be  determined by the Tribunal and unless	 default  is
committed  by the tenant in payment of four instalments	 the
purchase does not become ineffective.  That, however, is not
a  provision which makes the payment of price in any  manner
illusory.  The landlord is entitled to the rents of the land
as  if there had been no purchase of the land by the  tenant
and the payment of such rent is made the first charge on the
land.	There is, therefore, no scope for the argument	that
the  provisions	 in this behalf contained in  the  Act	were
illusory  or that the impugned Act is a piece of  colourable
legislation.

It is contended that<a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_131"> s. 7</a> does not fix any criteria for	 the
guidance of the State Government and that the power which is
given  to the State Government to vary the ceiling area	 and
economic  holding is unguided and unfettered and that it  is
possible to exercise it at the sweet will and discretion  of
the State Government even in favour of a, single  individual
or  in	favour of political sufferers and the like.   It  is
urged that no broad principle or policy is enunciated by the
Legislature in this behalf and it would be open to the State
Government to exercise this power arbitrarily and even in  a
discriminatory manner and that such entrustment of power  to
the  State  Government amounts to  excessive  delegation  of
legislative  power  and<a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_132"> s. 7</a> therefore must be	held  to  be
void.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">		    523</span>
<p id="p_85">The  principles	 by  which  the courts	are  guided  in	 the
determination of this question are now well settled.  <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_133">In the
State  of  Bihar v. Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar  Singh  of
Darbhanga</a> (1) Mahajan, J., (as he then was observed):-
The  legislature  applied its mind to the  question  Of	 the
method	and manner of payment of compensation.	 It  settled
its  policy  and the broad principles.	It  gave  the  State
Government  the power to determine matters of  detail  after
having	settled vital matters of policy.  It cannot be	said
that the legislature did not apply its mind to the  subject-
matter	of  the legislation and did not lay down  a  policy.
The proportion in which compensation was payable in cash  or
in  bonds or whether the whole of it was to be paid in	cash
is  a matter which only the State Government could  fix	 and
similarly,  the	 interval of instalments and the  period  of
redeemability of the bonds were also matters of detail which
the executive could more appositely determine in exercise of
its rule-making power.	It cannot be said in this case	that
any  essential legislative power has been delegated  to	 the
executive  or  that the legislature did	 not  discharge	 the
trust  which  the Constitution had reposed in  it.   If	 the
rule-making authority abuses its power or makes any  attempt
to  make  the payment illusory the  expropriated  proprietor
will not be without a remedy."
</p><p id="p_86">If  the	 legislature  settles  the  policy  and	 the   broad
principles  of legislation, there is no bar against  leaving
the matters of detail to be fixed by the executive and	such
delegation  will  not  amount  to  excessive  delegation  of
legislative power such as to vitiate the enactment.  In	 the
case before us the preamble to the Act says what the  policy
of the impugned Act is, viz., further to amend the 1948	 Act
which  as  we  have  already  observed	sets  out   specific
objectives  to be achieved.  <a href="/doc/1493140/" id="a_134">Sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1850878/" id="a_135">6</a> prescribe	 the
ceiling area and the economic holding which are fixed by the
legislature  itself having regard to the  normal  conditions
then prevailing within the State.  The legislature knew what
were the different types, of land, their situation
(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 889, 954.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">524</span>
<p id="p_87">and  productive	 capacity  and	having	regard	to  all	 the
relevant  factors  determined the ceiling area as  also	 the
economic   holding.   There  were,  however,  bound  to	  be
differences  between district and district and one  part  of
the  State and another and having therefore  enunciated	 the
broad principles and policy which were embodied in<a href="/doc/1493140/" id="a_136"> ss. 5</a> and
<a href="/doc/1850878/" id="a_137">6</a>  of  the Act the legislature enacted<a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_138"> s. 7</a>  empowering	 the
State  Government to vary the ceiling area and the  economic
holding	 if it was satisfied that it was expedient so to  do
in  the	 public interest, regard being had  to	the  various
criteria therein specified.  The State Government was to  be
guided	in  arriving at its satisfaction in  regard  to	 the
expediency thereof by (a) the situation of the land, (b) its
productive  capacity, (c) the fact that the land is  located
in  a backward area, and (d) any other factors which may  be
prescribed.  In so far as the situation of the land and	 its
productive  capacity were variable factors, more so  if	 the
land  was located in a backward area, the  State  Government
was enjoined to have regard to these factors as	 determining
the variations one way or the other from the normal standard
adopted by the Legislature in<a href="/doc/1493140/" id="a_139"> ss. 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1850878/" id="a_140">6</a> of the Act.  " Any
other  factors	which may be prescribed " would	 be  factors
ejusdem	 generis  to the factors mentioned  earlier  in	 the
section and could not be any and every factor which  crossed
the  mind of the executive.  The very terms of	the  section
preclude any single individual being treated in this  manner
because	 it talks of the variation in the ceiling  area	 and
the   economic	holding	 being	considered  by	 the   State
Government  to be expedient in the public interest  and	 the
satisfaction of any individual interest could hardly be said
to be a matter of public interest.
</p><p id="p_88">No  doubt individuals would be benefited by  the  variations
contemplated  in <a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_141"> s.  7</a>	 but  for  that	 purpose  the  State
Government  has got to be satisfied that it is expedient  in
the  public interest to do so and no variation in regard  to
ceiling area or the economic holding of a single  individual
can ever be said to have been contemplated within the  terms
of<a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_142"> s. 7</a>. It appears however that this argument found  favour
with  the  Bombay High Court in its  decision  in  Parashram
Damodhar v.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">525</span>
<p id="p_89">State of Bombay (1) where the Court observed that the  power
to  issue  a notification may be exercised in  favour  of  a
single	individual under the authority reserved under <a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_143"> s.  7</a>
and  may  lay  the  State Government open  to  a  charge  of
favouritism.   With great respect to the learned  judges  of
that  High Court, we are of the view that no such  thing  is
ever contemplated in the terms of<a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_144"> s. 7</a> of the Act.  There is
also no warrant for the suggestion that the State Government
might  vary the ceiling area and the economic  holding,	 say
for instance, for benefiting the political sufferers  within
the State.  If the situation of the land and its  productive
capacity  as  also the fact that the land is  located  in  a
backward  area are the criteria to be determined before	 the
State  Government is satisfied that it is expedient to	vary
the  ceiling  area and the economic holding  in	 the  public
interest  and " any other factors which may be prescribed  "
are  to	 be read ejusdem generis with the above	 as  already
observed, no question of benefiting political sufferers	 can
ever  enter into the picture.  That would be  an  extraneous
consideration.	 It  does  not	come  within  the   criteria
specified  in <a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_145"> s.  7</a>.  of the Act  on  a  true	construction
thereof.   Such	 considerations therefore  do  not  militate
against	 the  validity of the provisions contained  in	that
section.   In our opinion, the broad principles	 and  policy
have  been laid down by the legislature, the  criteria	have
been fixed according to which the State Government has to be
satisfied that it is expedient to vary the ceiling area	 and
economic  holding already prescribed by the legislature	 and
the mere matter of working out the details having regard  to
those  criteria	 which are  specifically  mentioned  therein
which  has been delegated to the State Government  does	 not
amount to any excessive delegation of legislative power.
It is also to be remembered that this power of variation  of
the  ceiling area and the economic holding is vested in	 the
State Government and is left to its subjective	satisfaction
having	regard	to the criteria therein specified.   As	 was
observed  by Kania, C. J., in <a href="/doc/1321505/" id="a_146">Dr.  N. B. Khare v. The  State
of Delhi</a> (2):-
</p><p id="p_90">(1) A. I. R. 1957 Bom, 252.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">526</span>
<p id="p_92">This  whole  argument is based on the  assumption  that	 the
Provincial Government when making the order will not perform
its duty and may abuse the provisions of the section.  In my
opinion,  it is not proper to start with such an  assumption
and  decide the legality of an Act on that basis.  Abuse  of
the power given by a law sometimes occurs; but the  validity
of   the  law  cannot  be  contested  because  of  such	  an
apprehension."
</p><p id="p_93">These  observations  of	 Karda,	 C.  J.,  were	quoted	with
approval  by Patanjali Sastri, C. J., in <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_147">The State  of	West
Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar</a> (1) where -it was stated:-
"  Whether  a  law conferring  discretionary  powers  on  an
administrative	authority is constitutionally valid  or	 not
should	not  be	 determined  on	 the  assumption  that	such
authority will act in an arbitrary manner in exercising	 the
discretion committed to it."
</p><p id="p_94">The above observations of Kania, C. J., were then quoted and
the judgment proceeded:-
</p><p id="p_95">"  On  the  contrary, it is to be  presumed  that  a  public

We  may	 lastly refer to the observations of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/1677837/" id="a_148">Pannalal Binjraj v. Union of India</a> (2):-
</p><p id="p_96">" It may also be remembered that this power is vested not in
minor  officials  but in top-ranking  authorities  like	 the
Commissioner of Income-tax and the Central Board of  Revenue
who  act on the information supplied to them by the  Income-
tax Officers concerned.	 This power is discretionary and not
necessarily  discriminatory  and abuse of  power  cannot  be
easily	assumed where the discretion is vested in such	high
officials.  (<a href="/doc/701977/" id="a_149">Vide Matajog Dobey v. H. S. Bhari</a>, [1955] 2  S.

public officials will discharge their duties honestly and in
accordance with the rules of law. (Vide People of the  State
of  New York v. John E. Van De Carr, etc., (1950-310-199  U.
S. 552; 50 L. Ed. 305)).  It has also been observed by	this
Court in A. Thangal Kunju
(1) (1952] S. C. R. 284, 301.

the  Income-tax Investigation Commission that " it is to  be
presumed,   unless  the	 contrary  were	 shown,	  that	 the
administration of a particular law would be done " not	with
an evil eye and unequal hand " and the selection made by the
Government  of	the  cases of persons  to  be  referred	 for
investigation	 by    the   Commission	  would	   not	  be
discriminatory."
</p><p id="p_99">This  presumption, however, cannot be stretched too far	 and
cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there
must  be some undisclosed and unknown reason for  subjecting
certain	  individuals	or  corporations  to   hostile	 and
discriminatory treatment (Vide Gulf, Colorado, etc. v. W. H.
Ellis,	(1897) 165 U.S. 150; 41 L. Ed. 666).  There  may  be
cases  where  improper	execution of power  will  result  in
injustice  to the parties.  As has been	 observed,  however,
the  possibility  of such  discriminatory  treatment  cannot
necessarily invalidate the legislation and where there is an
abuse  of such power, the parties aggrieved are not  without
ample  remedies	 under the law (Vide  Dinabandhu.   <a href="/doc/1002719/" id="a_151">Sahu  v.
Jadumony Mangaraj</a>, [1955] 1 S. C. R. 140,146).	What will be
struck	down in such cases will not be the  provision  which
invests the authorities with such power but the abuse of the
power itself."
</p><p id="p_100">It,  therefore,	 follows  that<a href="/doc/1036957/" id="a_152"> s. 7</a> of	the  Act  cannot  be
impugned   on	the  ground  of	 excessive   delegation	  of
legislative power.
</p><p id="p_101">All  the  various  contentions	urged  by  the	 petitioners
therefore fail and the result is that the petitions filed by
