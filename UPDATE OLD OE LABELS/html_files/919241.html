<p id="p_2">COURT'S JURISDICTION UNDER SECTION 34 OF THE
ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1966


Before dealing with the issues involved in this appeal, we
would first decide the main point in controversy, namely - the ambit
and scope of Court's jurisdiction in case where award passed by the
Arbitral Tribunal is challenged under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration
and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as the
decision in this appeal would depend upon the said finding. In other
words - whether the Court would have jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_3">Section 34</a>
of the Act  to set aside an award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal which
is patently illegal or in contravention of the provisions of the Act or
any other substantive law governing the parties or is against the terms
of the contract?
</p>
<p id="p_3">Learned senior counsel Mr. Ashok Desai appearing for the
appellant submitted that in case where there is clear violation of
<a href="/doc/597719/" id="a_4">Sections 28</a> to <a href="/doc/1882318/" id="a_5">31</a> of the Act or the terms of the Contract between the
parties, the  said award can be and is required to be set aside by the
Court while exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_6">Section 34</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf
of respondent - company submitted to the contrary and contended that
the Court's jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_7">Section 34</a> is limited and the award
could be set aside mainly on the ground that the same is in conflict
with the 'Public Policy of India'.  According to his submission, the
phrase 'Public Policy of India' cannot be interpreted to mean that in
case of violation of some provisions of law, the Court can set aside the
award.
</p>
<p id="p_5">For deciding this controversy, we would refer to the relevant
part of <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_8">Section 34</a> which reads as under:-
</p><p id="p_6">"34.	Application for setting aside arbitral award -
(1) Recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be
made only by an application for setting aside such award
in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
</p>
<p id="p_7">(2)	An arbitral award may be set aside by the court
only if-
</p>
<p id="p_8">(a)	the party making the application furnishes proof
that-
</p>
<p id="p_9">(i)	a party was under some incapacity, or

</p><p id="p_10">(ii)	the arbitration agreement is not valid under
the law to which the parties have subjected it
or, failing any indication thereon, under the
law for the time being in force; or

</p><p id="p_11">(iii)	the party making the application was not
given proper notice of the appointment of an
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or
was otherwise unable to present his case; or

</p><p id="p_12">(iv)	the arbitral award deals with a dispute not
contemplated by or not falling within the
terms of the submission to arbitration, or it
contains decisions on matters beyond the
scope of the submission to arbitration;
</p>
<p id="p_13">Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted
to arbitration can be separated from those not so
submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which
contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration
may be set aside; or

</p><p id="p_14">(v)	the composition of the arbitral tribunal or
the arbitral procedure was not in
accordance with the agreement of the
parties, unless such agreement was in
conflict with a provision of this Part from
which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing
such agreement, was not in accordance with
this Part; or

</p><p id="p_15">(b)	the court finds that-
</p>
<p id="p_16">(i)	the subject-matter of the dispute is not
capable of settlement by arbitration under
the law for the time being in force, or

</p><p id="p_17">(ii)	the arbitral award is in conflict with the
public policy of India.
</p>
<p id="p_18">Explanation-Without prejudice to the generality
of sub-clause (ii), it is hereby declared, for the avoidance
of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the public
policy of India if the making of the award was induced
or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_9">Section 75</a> or <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_10">Section 81</a>."
</p>

<p id="p_19">For our purpose, it is not necessary to refer to the scope of self
explanatory Clauses (i) to (iv) of sub-section (2)(a) of <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_11">Section 34</a> of
the Act and it does not require elaborate discussion. However, clause
</p><p id="p_20">(v) of sub-<a href="/doc/1430346/" id="a_12">section 2(a)</a> and clause (ii) of sub-<a href="/doc/1311823/" id="a_13">section 2(b)</a> require
consideration.	For proper adjudication of the question of jurisdiction,
we shall first consider what meaning could be assigned to the term
'Arbitral Procedure'.
</p>
<p id="p_21">'ARBITRAL PROCEDURE'

The ingredients of clause (v) are as under:-
</p><p id="p_22">1)	The Court may set aside the award:-
</p><p id="p_23">(i)	(a)  if the composition of the arbitral
Tribunal was not in accordance with
the agreement of the parties,

</p><p id="p_24">(b)	failing such agreement, the
composition of the arbitral tribunal
was not in accordance with Part-I of
the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(ii)	if the arbitral procedure was not in
accordance with:-
</p>
<p id="p_26">a)	the agreement of the parties, or

</p><p id="p_27">b)	failing such agreement, the arbitral
procedure was not in accordance with
Part-I of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_28">However, exception for setting aside the award on the ground
of composition of arbitral tribunal or illegality of arbitral procedure is
that the agreement should not be in conflict with the provisions of
Part-I of the Act from which parties cannot derogate.
</p>
<p id="p_29">In the aforesaid sub-clause (v), the emphasis is on the
agreement and the provisions of Part-I of the Act from which parties
cannot derogate.  It means that the composition of arbitral tribunal
should be in accordance with the agreement.  Similarly, the procedure
which is required to be followed by the arbitrators should also be in
accordance with the agreement of the parties.  If there is no such
agreement then it should be in accordance with the procedure
prescribed in the Part-I of the Act i.e. <a href="/doc/738672/" id="a_14">Sections 2</a> to <a href="/doc/354483/" id="a_15">43</a>.  At the same
time, agreement for composition of arbitral tribunal or arbitral
procedure should not be in conflict with the provisions of the Act
from which parties cannot derogate.  Chapter V of Part-I of the Act
provides for conduct of arbitral proceedings.  <a href="/doc/1633982/" id="a_16">Section 18</a> mandates
that parties to the arbitral proceedings shall be treated with equality
and each party shall be given full opportunity to present his case.
<a href="/doc/710617/" id="a_17">Section 19</a> specifically provides that arbitral tribunal is not bound by
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_18">Indian Evidence Act</a>, 1872
and parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by the
arbitral tribunal in conducting its proceedings.  Failing any agreement
between the parties subject to other provisions of Part-I, the arbitral
tribunal is to conduct the proceedings in the manner it considers
appropriate.  This power includes the power to determine the
admissibility, relevance, the materiality and weight of any evidence.
<a href="/doc/811701/" id="a_19">Sections 20</a>, <a href="/doc/157537/" id="a_20">21</a> and <a href="/doc/1310890/" id="a_21">22</a> deal with place of arbitration, commencement
of arbitral proceedings and language respectively.  Thereafter,
<a href="/doc/238279/" id="a_22">Sections 23</a>, <a href="/doc/363170/" id="a_23">24</a> and <a href="/doc/631064/" id="a_24">25</a> deal with statements of claim and defence,
hearings and written proceedings and procedure to be followed in case
of default of a party.
</p>
<p id="p_30">At this stage, we would refer to <a href="/doc/363170/" id="a_25">Section 24</a> which is as under:-
"24.	Hearings and written proceedings- (1) Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal
shall decide whether to hold oral hearings for the
presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether
the proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of
documents and other materials;
</p>
<p id="p_31">	Provided that the arbitral tribunal shall hold oral
hearings, at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, on
a request by a party, unless the parties have agreed that
no oral hearing shall be held.
</p>
<p id="p_32">(2)	The parties shall be given sufficient
advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the
arbitral tribunal for the purposes of inspection of
documents, goods or other property.
</p>
<p id="p_33">(3)	All statements, documents or other
information supplied to, or applications made to the
arbitral tribunal by one party shall be communicated to
the other party, and any expert report or evidentiary
document on which the arbitral tribunal may rely in
making its decision shall be communicated to the
parties."
</p>




<p id="p_34">Thereafter, Chapter VI deals with making of arbitral award and
termination of proceedings.  Relevant Sections which require
consideration are <a href="/doc/597719/" id="a_26">Sections 28</a> and <a href="/doc/1882318/" id="a_27">31</a>.  <a href="/doc/597719/" id="a_28">Sections 28</a> and <a href="/doc/1882318/" id="a_29">31</a> read as
under:-
</p><p id="p_35">"28.  Rules applicable to substance of dispute-
</p>
<p id="p_36">(1)  Where the place of arbitration is situate in
India-
</p>
<p id="p_37">(a)	in an arbitration other than an international
commercial arbitration, the arbitral tribunal
shall decide the dispute submitted to

</p>
<p id="p_38">(b)	in international commercial arbitration,-
</p><p id="p_39">(i)	the arbitral tribunal shall decide the

</p>
<p id="p_40">(ii)	any designation by the parties of the

expressed, as directly referring to the
substantive law of that country and
not to its conflict of law rules;
</p>
<p id="p_41">(iii)	failing any designation of the law
under clause (a) by the parties, the
arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules
of law it considers to be appropriate
given all the circumstances

expressly authorised it to do so.
</p>

</p>
<p id="p_44">31.  Form and contents of arbitral award- (1) An
arbitral award shall be made in writing and shall be

</p>
<p id="p_45">(2)	For the purposes of sub-section (1), in

<p id="p_49">(4)	The arbitral award shall state its date and the
place of arbitration as determined in accordance with
<a href="/doc/811701/" id="a_31">section 20</a> and the award shall be deemed to have been

</p>
<p id="p_50">(5)	After the arbitral award is made, a signed
copy shall be delivered to each party.
</p>
<p id="p_51">(6)	The arbitral tribunal may, at any time during
the arbitral proceedings, make an interim arbitral award
on any matter with respect to which it may make a final

as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the
money, for the whole or any part of the period between
the date on which the cause of action arose and the date
on which the award is made.
</p>
<p id="p_53">(b)	A sum directed to be paid by an arbitral
award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, carry
interest at the rate of eighteen per centum per annum

</p>
<p id="p_61">Explanation: For the purpose of clause (a), "costs"
means reasonable costs relating to,-
</p>
<p id="p_62">(i)	the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and

supervising the arbitration, and
</p><p id="p_65">(iv)	any other expenses incurred in connection
with the arbitral proceedings and the arbitral
award."
</p>

<p id="p_66">The aforesaid provisions prescribe the procedure to be followed
by the arbitral tribunal coupled with its powers.  Power and procedure
are synonymous in the present case.  By prescribing the procedure, the
arbitral tribunal is empowered and is required to decide the dispute in
accordance with the provisions of the Act, that is to say, the
jurisdiction of the tribunal to decide the dispute is prescribed.  In these
sections there is no distinction between the jurisdiction/power and the
procedure.  <a href="/doc/1925650/" id="a_32">In Harish Chandra Bajpai  v. Triloki Singh</a> [1957 SCR
370], while dealing with <a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_33">Sections 90</a> and <a href="/doc/61691132/" id="a_34">92</a> of the Representation of
the People Act, 1951 (as it stood), this Court observed thus:-
"It is then argued that<a href="/doc/61691132/" id="a_35"> S. 92</a> confers powers on the
Tribunal in respect of certain matters, while<a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_36"> S. 90(2)</a>
applies the CPC in respect of matters relating to
procedure that there is a distinction between power and
procedure, and that the granting of amendment being a
power and not a matter of procedure, it can be claimed
only under <a href="/doc/61691132/" id="a_37">section 92</a> and not under<a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_38"> S. 90(2)</a>.  We do not
see any antithesis between 'procedure' in<a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_39"> S. 90(2)</a> and
'powers' under<a href="/doc/61691132/" id="a_40"> S. 92</a>.  When the respondent applied to
the Tribunal for amendment, he took a procedural step,
and that he was clearly entitled to do under<a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_41"> S. 90(2)</a>.	The
question of power arises only with reference to the order
to be passed on the petition by the Tribunal. Is it to be
held that the presentation of a petition is competent, but
the passing of any order thereon is not?  We are of
opinion that there is no substance in the contention
either."
</p>

<p id="p_67">Hence, the jurisdiction or the power of the arbitral tribunal is
prescribed under the Act and if the award is de hors the said
provisions, it would be, on the face of it, illegal.  The decision of the
Tribunal must be within the bounds of its jurisdiction conferred under
the Act or the contract.  In exercising jurisdiction, the arbitral tribunal
can not act in breach of some provision of substantive law or the
provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_68">The question, therefore, which requires consideration is -
whether the award could be set aside, if the arbitral tribunal has not
followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under <a href="/doc/1171649/" id="a_42">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/556387/" id="a_43">28</a> or
31(3), which affects the rights of the parties?	 Under sub-section (1)(a)
of <a href="/doc/556387/" id="a_44">Section 28</a> there is a mandate to the arbitral tribunal to decide the
dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in
force in India.	 Admittedly, substantive law would include the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_45">Indian
Contract Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_46">Transfer of Property Act</a> and other such laws in
force.	Suppose, if the award is passed in violation of the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_47">Transfer of Property Act</a> or in violation of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_48">Indian Contract Act</a>,
the question would be - whether such award could be set aside?
Similarly, under sub-section (3), arbitral tribunal is directed to decide
the dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract and also after
taking into account the usage of the trade applicable to the transaction.
If arbitral tribunal ignores the terms of the contract or usage of the
trade applicable to the transaction, whether the said award could be
interfered?  Similarly, if the award is non-speaking one and is in
violation of <a href="/doc/92048108/" id="a_49">Section 31(3)</a>, can such award be set aside?  In our view,
reading <a href="/doc/165215034/" id="a_50">Section 34</a> conjointly with other provisions of the Act, it
appears that the legislative intent could not be that if the award is in
contravention of the provisions of the Act, still however, it couldn't be
set aside by the Court.	 If it is held that such award could not be
interfered, it would be contrary to basic concept of justice.  If the
arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed
under the Act, it would mean that it has acted beyond its jurisdiction
and thereby the award would be patently illegal which could be set
aside under <a href="/doc/165215034/" id="a_51">Section 34</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_69">The aforesaid interpretation of the clause (v) would be in
conformity with the settled principle of law that the procedural law
cannot fail to provide relief when substantive law gives the right.
Principle is - there cannot be any wrong without a remedy.  <a href="/doc/1515069/" id="a_52">In M.V.
Elisabeth and others v. Harwan Investment &amp; Trading Pvt. Ltd</a>.
[1993 Supp. (2) SCC 433] this Court observed that where substantive
law demands justice for the party aggrieved and the statute has not
provided the remedy, it is the duty of the Court to devise procedure by
drawing analogy from other systems of law and practice.	 Similarly, in
Dhanna Lal v. Kalawatibai and others [(2002) 6 SCC 16] this Court
observed that wrong must not be left unredeemed and right not left
unenforced.
</p>
<p id="p_70">Result is - if the award is contrary to the substantive
provisions of law or the provisions of the Act or against the terms of
the contract, it would be patently illegal, which could be interfered
under <a href="/doc/165215034/" id="a_53">Section 34</a>.  However, such failure of procedure should be
patent affecting the rights of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_71">WHAT MEANING COULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE PHRASE
'PUBLIC POLICY	OF INDIA'?
</p>
<p id="p_72">The next clause which requires interpretation is clause (ii) of
sub-section 2(b) of Section 34 which inter alia provides that the Court
may set aside arbitral award if it is in conflict with the 'Public Policy
of India'.  The phrase 'Public Policy of India' is not defined under the
Act.  Hence, the said term is required to be given meaning in context
and also considering the purpose of the section and scheme of the Act.
It has been repeatedly stated by various authorities that the expression
'public policy' does not admit of precise definition and may vary from
generation to generation and from time to time.	 Hence, the concept
'public policy' is considered to be vague, susceptible to narrow or
wider meaning depending upon the context in which it is used.
Lacking precedent the Court has to give its meaning in the light and
principles underlying the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_54">Arbitration Act</a>, <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_55">Contract Act</a> and
Constitutional provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_73">For this purpose, we would refer to few decisions referred to by
the learned counsel for the parties.  While dealing with the concept of
'public policy, this Court in <a href="/doc/477313/" id="a_56">Central Inland Water Transport
Corporation Limited and another v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and
another</a> [(1986) 3 SCC 156] has observed thus: -
"92.	<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_57">The Indian Contract Act</a> does not define the
expression "public policy" or "opposed to public policy".
From the very nature of things, the expressions "public
policy", "opposed to public policy", or "contrary to
public policy" are incapable of precise definition.  Public
policy, however, is not the policy of a particular
government.  It connotes some matter which concerns the
public good and the public interest.  The concept of what
is for the public good or in the public interest or what
would be injurious or harmful to the public good or the
public interest has varied from time to time.  As new
concepts take the place of old, transactions which were
once considered against public policy are now being
upheld by the courts and similarly where there has been a
well recognized head of public policy, the courts have
not shirked from extending it to the new transactions and
changed circumstances and have at times not even
flinched from inventing a new head of public policy.
There are two schools of thought- "the narrow view"
school and "the broad view" school.   According to the
former, courts cannot create new heads of public policy
whereas the latter countenances judicial law-making in
this area.  The adherents of "the narrow view" school
would not invalidate a contract on the ground of public
policy unless that particular ground had been well-
established by authorities.  Hardly ever has the voice of
the timorous spoken more clearly and loudly than in
these words of Lord Davey in Janson v. Driefontein
Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. [(1902) AC 484, 500] :
"Public Policy is always an unsafe and treacherous
ground for legal decision".  That was in the year 1902.
Seventy-eight years earlier, Burrough, J., in Richardson
v. Mellish [(1824) 2 Bing 229, 252] described public
policy as "a very unruly horse, and when once you get
astride it you never know where it will carry you."  The
Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, however, was not a
man to shy away from unmanageable horses and in
words which conjure up before our eyes the picture of the
young Alexander the Great taming Bucephalus, he said in
Enderby Town Football Club Ltd. v. Football Assn. Ltd.
[(1971) Ch. 591, 606]; "With a good man in the saddle,
the unruly horse can be kept in control. It can jump over
obstacles".  Had the timorous always held the field, not
only the doctrine of public policy but even the Common
Law or the principles of Equity would never have
evolved.  Sir William Holdsworth in his "History of
English Law", Volume III, page 55, has said:
</p>
<p id="p_74">In fact, a body of law like the
common law, which has grown up gradually
with the growth of the nation, necessarily
acquires some fixed principles, and if it is to
maintain these principles it must be able, on
the ground of public policy or some other
like ground, to suppress practices which,
under ever new disguises, seek to weaken or
negative them.
</p>
<p id="p_75">It is thus clear that the principles governing public
policy must be and are capable, on proper occasion, of
expansion or modification. Practices which were
considered perfectly normal at one time have today
become obnoxious and oppressive to public conscience.
If there is no head of public policy which covers a case,
then the court must in consonance with public conscience
and in keeping with public good and public interest
declare such practice to be opposed to public policy.
Above all, in deciding any case which may not be
covered by authority our courts have before them the
beacon light of the Preamble to the Constitution.
Lacking precedent, the court can always be guided by
that light and the principles underlying the Fundamental
Rights and the Directive Principles enshrined in our
Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_76">93.	The normal rule of Common Law has been
that a party who seeks to enforce an agreement which is
opposed to public policy will be non-suited.  The case of
A. Schroeder Music Public Co. Ltd. v. Macaulay [(1974)
1 WLR 1308], however, establishes that where a contract
is vitiated as being contrary to public policy, the party
adversely affected by it can sue to have it declared void.
The case may be different where the purpose of the
contract is illegal or immoral.	 <a href="/doc/1409676/" id="a_58">In Kedar Nath Motani v.
Prahlad Rai</a> [(1960) 1 SCR 861], reversing the High
Court and restoring the decree passed by the trial court
declaring the appellants' title to the lands in suit and
directing the respondents who were the appellants'
benamidars to restore possession, this Court, after
discussing the English and Indian law on the subject, said
(at page 873):
</p>
<p id="p_77">The correct position in law, in our
opinion, is that what one has to see is
whether the illegality goes so much to the
root of the matter that the plaintiff cannot
bring his action without relying upon the
illegal transaction into which he had entered.
If the illegality be trivial or venial, as stated
by Williston and the plaintiff is not required
to rest his case upon that illegality, then
public policy demands that the defendant
should not be allowed to take advantage of
the position.  A strict view, of course, must
be taken of the plaintiff's conduct, and he
should not be allowed to circumvent the
illegality by resorting to some subterfuge or
by misstating the facts.   If, however, the
matter is clear and the illegality is not
required to be pleaded or proved as part of
the cause of action and the plaintiff recanted
before the illegal purpose was achieved,
then, unless it be of such a gross nature as to
outrage the conscience of the court, the plea
of the defendant should not prevail.
</p>
<p id="p_78">The types of contracts to which the principle formulated
by us above applies are not contracts which are tainted
with illegality but are contracts which contain terms
which are so unfair and unreasonable that they shock the
conscience of the court.  They are opposed to public
policy and require to be adjudged void."
</p>


<p id="p_79">Further, in <a href="/doc/86594/" id="a_59">Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co</a>.
[1994 Supp. (1) SCC 644], this Court considered <a href="/doc/447722/" id="a_60">Section 7(1)</a> of the
Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937 which inter alia
provided that a foreign award may not be enforced under the said Act,
if the Court dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of
the award will be contrary to the Public Policy.  After elaborate
discussion, the Court arrived at the conclusion that Public Policy
comprehended in <a href="/doc/21814193/" id="a_61">Section 7(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Foreign Awards
(Recognition and <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_62">Enforcement) Act</a>, 1961 is the 'Public Policy of
India' and does not cover the public policy of any other country.  For
giving meaning to the term 'Public Policy', the Court observed
thus:-
</p><p id="p_80">"66.	Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention of
1958 and <a href="/doc/21814193/" id="a_63">Section 7(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Foreign Awards Act
do not postulate refusal of recognition and enforcement
of a foreign award on the ground that it is contrary to the
law of the country of enforcement and the ground of
challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement
being contrary to the public policy of the country in
which the award is set to be enforced.	There is nothing
to indicate that the expression "public policy" in Article
V(2)(b) of the New York Convention and <a href="/doc/21814193/" id="a_64">Section
7(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Foreign Awards Act is not used in the
same sense in which it was used in Article I(c) of the
Geneva Convention of 1927 and <a href="/doc/447722/" id="a_65">Section 7(1)</a> of the
Protocol and Convention Act of 1937.  This would mean
that "public policy" in <a href="/doc/1552876/" id="a_66">Section 7(1)(b)(ii)</a> has been used
in a narrower sense and in order to attract to bar of
public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke
something more than the violation of the law of India.
Since the Foreign Awards Act is concerned with
recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which are
governed by the principles of private international law,
the expression "public policy" in <a href="/doc/21814193/" id="a_67">Section 7(1)(b)(ii)</a> of
the Foreign Awards Act must necessarily be construed in
the sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the
field of private international law.  Applying the said
criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a
foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is
contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be
contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (ii)
the interests of India; or (iii) justice or morality."
</p>
<p id="p_81">The Court finally held that:-
</p>
<p id="p_82">"76.	Keeping in view the aforesaid objects underlying
FERA and the principles governing enforcement of
exchange control laws followed in other countries, we are
of the view that the provisions contained in FERA have
been enacted to safeguard the economic interests of India
and any violation of the said provisions would be
contrary to the public policy of India as envisaged in
<a href="/doc/1552876/" id="a_68">Section 7(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Act."
</p>

<p id="p_83">This Court in <a href="/doc/1906138/" id="a_69">Murlidhar Agarwal and another v. State of U.P.
and others</a> [1974 (2) SCC 472] while dealing with the concept of
'public policy' observed thus:-
</p><p id="p_84">"31.  Public policy does not remain static in any
given community.  It may vary from generation to
generation and even in the same generation.  Public
policy would be almost useless if it were to remain in
fixed moulds for all time.
</p>
<p id="p_85">32.	... The difficulty of discovering what public
policy is at any given moment certainly does not absolve
the Judges from the duty of doing so.  In conducting an
enquiry, as already stated, Judges are not hide-bound by
precedent.  The Judges must look beyond the narrow
field of past precedents, though this still leaves open the
question, in which direction they must cast their gaze.
The Judges are to base their decision on the opinions of
men of the world, as distinguished from opinions based
on legal learning.  In other words, the Judges will have to
look beyond the jurisprudence and that in so doing, they
must consult not their own personal standards or
predilections but those of the dominant opinion at a given
moment, or what has been termed customary morality.
The Judges must consider the social consequences of the
rule propounded, especially in the light of the factual
evidence available as to its probable results. .... The
point is rather that this power must be lodged somewhere
and under our Constitution and laws, it has been lodged
in the Judges and if they have to fulfil their function as
Judges, it could hardly be lodged elsewhere."
</p>

<p id="p_86">Mr. Desai submitted that the narrow meaning given to the term
'public policy' in Renusagar's case is in context of the fact that the
question involved in the said matter was with regard to the execution
of the award which had attained finality.  It was not a case where
validity of the Award is challenged before a forum prescribed under
the Act.  He submitted that the scheme of <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_70">Section 34</a> which deals with
setting aside the domestic arbitral award and <a href="/doc/369807/" id="a_71">Section 48</a> which deals
with enforcement of foreign award are not identical.  A foreign award
by definition is subject to double exequatur.  This is recognized inter
alia by <a href="/doc/369807/" id="a_72">Section 48</a> (1) and there is no parallel provision to this clause
in <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_73">Section 34</a>.	For this, he referred to Lord Mustill &amp; Stewart C.
Boyd QC's "Commercial Arbitration" 2001 wherein [at page 90] it is
stated as under:-
</p><p id="p_87">	"Mutual recognition of awards is the glue which
holds the international arbitrating community together,
and this will only be strong if the enforcing court is
willing to trust, as the convention assumes that they will
trust, the supervising authorities of the chosen venue.	 It
follows that if, and to the extent that the award has been
struck down in the local court it should be a matter of
theory and practice be treated when enforcement is
sought as if to the extent it did not exist."
</p>

<p id="p_88">He further submitted that in foreign arbitration, the award
would be subject to being set aside or suspended by the competent
authority under the relevant law of that country whereas in the
domestic arbitration the only recourse is to <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_74">Section 34</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_89">The aforesaid submission of the learned senior counsel requires
to be accepted.	 From the judgments discussed above, it can be held
that the term 'public policy of India' is required to be interpreted in
the context of the jurisdiction of the Court where the validity of award
is challenged before it becomes final and executable.  The concept of
enforcement of the award after it becomes final is different and the
jurisdiction of the Court at that stage could be limited.  Similar is the
position with regard to the execution of a decree.  It is settled law as
well as it is provided under Code of Civil Procedure that once the
decree has attained finality, in an execution proceeding, it may be
challenged only on limited grounds such as the decree being without
jurisdiction or nullity.  But in a case where the judgment and decree is
challenged before the Appellate Court or the Court exercising
revisional jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of such Court would be wider.
Therefore, in a case where the validity of award is challenged there is
no necessity of giving a narrower meaning to the term 'public policy
of India'.  On the contrary, wider meaning is required to be given so
that the 'patently illegal award' passed by the arbitral tribunal could
be set aside.  If narrow meaning as contended by the learned senior
counsel Mr. Dave is given, some of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_75">Arbitration
Act</a> would become nugatory.  Take for illustration a case wherein
there is a specific provision in the contract that for delayed payment of
the amount due and payable, no interest would be payable, still
however, if the Arbitrator has passed an award granting interest, it
would be against the terms of the contract and thereby against the
provision of <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_76">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act which specifically provides that
"arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the
contract".  Further, where there is a specific usage of the trade that if
the payment is made beyond a period of one month, then the party
would be required to pay the said amount with interest at the rate of
15 per cent.  Despite the evidence being produced on record for such
usage, if the arbitrator refuses to grant such interest on the ground of
equity, such award would also be in violation of sub-sections (2) and
(3) of <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_77">Section 28</a>.  <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_78">Section 28(2)</a> specifically provides that arbitrator
shall decide ex aequo et bono [according to what is just and good]
only if the parties have expressly authorised him to do so.  Similarly,
if the award is patently against the statutory provisions of substantive
law which is in force in India or is passed without giving an
opportunity of hearing to the parties as provided under <a href="/doc/1649313/" id="a_79">Section 24</a> or
without giving any reason in a case where parties have not agreed that
no reasons are to be recorded, it would be against the statutory
provisions.  In all such cases, the award is required to be set aside on
the ground of 'patent illegality'.
</p>
<p id="p_90">The learned senior counsel Mr. Dave submitted that the
Parliament has not made much change while adopting <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_80">Article 34</a> of
UNCITRAL Model Law by not providing error of law as a ground of
challenge to the arbitral award under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_81">Section 34</a> of the Act.  For this
purpose, he referred to <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_82">Sections 68</a>, <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_83">69</a> and <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_84">70</a> of the Arbitration Act,
1996 applicable in England and submitted that if the legislature
wanted to give a wider jurisdiction to the Court, it would have done so
by adopting similar provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_91"><a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_85">Section 68</a> of the law applicable in England provides that the
award can be challenged on the ground of serious irregularities
mentioned therein. <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_86">Section 68</a> reads thus: -
"68.  Challenging the award: serious irregularity-
(1)	A party to arbitral proceedings may (upon notice to
the other parties and to the tribunal) apply to the court
challenging an award in the proceedings on the ground of
serious irregularity affecting the tribunal, the proceedings
or the award.
</p>
<p id="p_92">A party may lose the right to object (see <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_87">Section 73</a>) and
the right to apply is subject to the restrictions in <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_88">section
70(2)</a> and (3).
</p>
<p id="p_93">(2)	Serious irregularity means an irregularity of one or
more of the following kinds which the court considers
has caused or will cause substantial injustice to the
applicant-
</p>
<p id="p_94">(a)	failure by the tribunal to comply with
<a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_89">section 33</a> (general duty of tribunal);
</p>
<p id="p_95">(b)	the tribunal exceeding its powers (otherwise
than by exceeding its substantive
jurisdiction: see <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_90">section 67</a>);
</p>
<p id="p_96">(c)	failure by the tribunal to conduct the
proceedings in accordance with the
procedure agreed by the parties;
</p>
<p id="p_97">(d)	failure by the tribunal to deal with all the
issues that were put to it;
</p>
<p id="p_98">(e)	any arbitral or other institution or person
vested by the parties with powers in relation
to the proceedings or the award exceeding
its powers;
</p>
<p id="p_99">(f)	uncertainty or ambiguity as to the effect of
the award;
</p>
<p id="p_100">(g)	the award being obtained by fraud or the
award or the way in which it was procured
being contrary to public policy;
</p>
<p id="p_101">(h)	failure to comply with the requirement as to
the form of the award; or

</p><p id="p_102">(i)	any irregularity in the conduct of the
proceedings or in the award which is
admitted by the tribunal or by any arbitral or
other institution or person vested by the
parties with powers in relation to the
proceedings or the award.
</p>
<p id="p_103">(3)	If there is shown to be serious irregularity affecting
the tribunal, the proceedings or the award, the court
may-
</p>
<p id="p_104">(a)	remit the award to the tribunal, in whole or
in part, for reconsideration;
</p>
<p id="p_105">(b)	set the award aside in whole or in part, or

</p><p id="p_106">(c)	declare the award to be of no effect, in
whole or in part.
</p>
<p id="p_107">The Court shall not exercise its power to set aside or to
declare an award to be of no effect, in whole or in part,
unless it is satisfied that it would be inappropriate to
remit the matters in question to the tribunal for
reconsideration.
</p>
<p id="p_108">(4)	The leave of the Court is required for any appeal
from a decision of the court under this section."
</p>

<p id="p_109">	Similarly, <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_91">Section 69</a> provides that appeal on point of law
would be maintainable and the procedure thereof is also provided.
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_92">Section 70</a> provides supplementary provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_110">It is true that Legislature has not incorporated exhaustive
grounds for challenging the award passed by the arbitral tribunal or
the ground on which appeal against the order of the Court would be
maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_111">On this aspect, eminent Jurist &amp; Senior Advocate Late Mr.
Nani Palkhivala while giving his opinion to 'Law of Arbitration and
Conciliation' by Justice Dr. B.P. Saraf and Justice S.M.
Jhunjhunuwala, noted thus:-
</p><p id="p_112">"I am extremely impressed by your analytical
approach in dealing with the complex subject of
arbitration which is emerging rapidly as an alternate
mechanism for resolution of commercial disputes.  The
new arbitration law has been brought in parity with
statutes in other countries, though I wish that the Indian
law had a provision similar to section 68 of the English
Arbitration Act, 1996 which gives power to the Court to
correct errors of law in the award.
</p>
<p id="p_113">I welcome your view on the need for giving the
doctrine of "public policy" its full amplitude.	 I
particularly endorse your comment that Courts of law
may intervene to permit challenge to an arbitral award
which is based on an irregularity of a kind which has
caused substantial injustice.
</p>
<p id="p_114">If the arbitral tribunal does not dispense justice, it
cannot truly be reflective of an alternate dispute
resolution mechanism.  Hence, if the award has resulted
in an injustice, a Court would be well within its right in
upholding the challenge to the award on the ground
that it is in conflict with the public policy of India."
</p>
<p id="p_115">From this discussion it would be clear that the phrase 'public
policy of India' is not required to be given a narrower meaning.  As
stated earlier, the said term is susceptible of narrower or wider
meaning depending upon the object and purpose of the legislation.
Hence, the award which is passed in contravention of <a href="/doc/363170/" id="a_93">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/597719/" id="a_94">28</a>
or 31 could be set aside.  In addition to <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_95">Section 34</a>, <a href="/doc/862520/" id="a_96">Section 13(5)</a> of
the Act also provides that constitution of the arbitral tribunal could
also be challenged by a party.	Similarly, <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_97">Section 16</a> provides that a
party aggrieved by the decision of the arbitral tribunal with regard to
its jurisdiction could challenge such arbitral award under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_98">Section 34</a>.
In any case, it is for the Parliament to provide for limited or wider
jurisdiction to the Court in case where award is challenged.  But in
such cases, there is no reason to give narrower meaning to the term
'public policy of India' as contended by learned senior counsel Mr.
Dave.  In our view, wider meaning is required to be given so as to
prevent frustration of legislation and justice.	  This Court in <a href="/doc/527706/" id="a_99">Rattan
Chand Hira Chand v. Askar Nawaz Jung (Dead) By LRs and others</a>
[(1991) 3 SCC 67], this Court observed thus:-
"17.	.. It cannot be disputed that a contract which
has a tendency to injure public interests or public
welfare is one against public policy.  What constitutes
an injury to public interests or welfare would depend
upon the times and climes. ... The legislature often fails
to keep pace with the changing needs and values nor as
it realistic to expect that it will have provided for all
contingencies and eventualities.  It is, therefore, not only
necessary but obligatory on the courts to step in to fill
the lacuna.  When courts perform this function
undoubtedly they legislate judicially.	But that is a kind
of legislation which stands implicitly delegated to them
to further the object of the legislation and to promote the
goals of the society.  Or to put it negatively, to prevent
the frustration of the legislation or perversion of the
goals and values of the society."
</p>

<p id="p_116">Learned senior counsel Mr. Dave submitted that the purpose of
giving limited jurisdiction to the Court is obvious and is to see that the
disputes are resolved at the earliest by giving finality to the award
passed by the forum chosen by the parties.  As against this, learned
senior counsel Mr. Desai submitted that in the present system even the
arbitral proceedings are delayed on one or the other ground including
the ground that the arbitrator is not free and the matters are not
disposed of for months together.  He submitted that the legislature has
not provided any time limit for passing of the award and this indicates
that the contention raised by the learned counsel for the respondent
has no bearing in interpreting <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_100">Section 34</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_117">It is true that under the Act, there is no provision similar to
<a href="/doc/238279/" id="a_101">Sections 23</a> and <a href="/doc/597719/" id="a_102">28</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1940, which specifically
provided that the arbitrator shall pass award within reasonable time as
fixed by the Court.  It is also true that on occasions, arbitration
proceedings are delayed for one or other reason, but it is for the
parties to take appropriate action of selecting proper arbitrator(s) who
could dispose of the matter within reasonable time fixed by them.  It is
for them to indicate the time limit for disposal of the arbitral
proceedings.  It is for them to decide whether they should continue
with the arbitrator(s) who cannot dispose of the matter within
reasonable time.  However, non-providing of time limit for deciding
the dispute by the arbitrators could have no bearing on interpretation
of <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_103">Section 34</a>.	Further, for achieving the object of speedier disposal of
dispute, justice in accordance with law cannot be sacrificed.  In our
view, giving limited jurisdiction to the Court for having finality to the
award and resolving the dispute by speedier method would be much
more frustrated by permitting patently illegal award to operate.
Patently illegal award is required to be set at naught, otherwise it
would promote injustice.
</p>
<p id="p_118">Therefore, in our view, the phrase 'Public Policy of India' used
in <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_104">Section 34</a> in context is required to be given a wider meaning.  It
can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter
which concerns public good and the public interest.  What is for
public good or in public interest or what would be injurious or
harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to
time.  However, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in
violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest.
Such award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the
administration of justice.  Hence, in our view in addition to narrower
meaning given to the term 'public policy' in Renusagar's case
(supra), it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it
is patently illegal.  Result would be - award could be set aside if it is
contrary to: -
</p><p id="p_119">(a)	fundamental policy of Indian law; or
</p><p id="p_120">(b)	the interest of India; or
</p><p id="p_121">(c)	justice or morality, or
</p><p id="p_122">(d)	in addition, if it is patently illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_123">Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of
trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy.
Award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it
shocks the conscience of the Court.  Such award is opposed to public
policy and is required to be adjudged void.
</p>
<p id="p_124">	NOW ON FACTS:-
</p>
<p id="p_125">The brief facts of the case are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_126">Appellant - ONGC which is a Public Sector Undertaking, has
challenged the arbitral award dated 2nd May, 1999 by filing
Arbitration Petition No. 917/1999 before the High Court of Bombay.
Learned Single Judge dismissed the same.  Appeal No.256/2000
preferred before the Division Bench of the High Court was also
dismissed.  Hence, the present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_127">It is stated that in response to a tender, respondent-Company
which is engaged in the business of supplying equipment for Offshore
Oil exploration and maintenance by its letter dated 27th December,
1995 on agreed terms and conditions, offered to supply to the
appellants 26" diameter and 30" diameter casing pipes.	The appellant
by letter of intent dated 3rd June, 1996 followed by a detailed order
accepted the offer of the respondent-Company.  As per terms and
conditions, the goods were required to be supplied on or before 14th
November, 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_128">It was the contention of the respondent that as per clause (18) of
the agreement, the raw materials were required to be procured from
the reputed and proven manufacturers/suppliers approved by the
respondent as listed therein.  By letter dated 8th August, 1996,
respondent placed an order for supply of steel plates, that is, the raw
material required for manufacturing the pipes with Liva Laminati,
Piani S.P.A., Italian suppliers stipulating that material must be
shipped latest by the end of September 1996 as timely delivery was of
the essence of the order.  It is also their case that all over Europe
including Italy there was a general strike of the steel mill workers
during September/October 1996.	Therefore, respondent by its letter
dated 28th October, 1996 conveyed to the appellant that Italian
suppliers had faced labour problems and was unable to deliver the
material as per agreed schedule.  Respondent, therefore, requested for
an extension of 45 days time for execution of the order in view of the
reasons beyond its control.  By letter dated 4th December, 1996, the
time for delivery of the pipes was extended with a specific statement
inter alia that the amount equivalent to liquidated damages for delay
in supply of pipes would be recovered from the respondent.  It is the
contention of the respondent that the appellant made payment of the
goods supplied after wrongfully deducting an amount of US $
3,04,970.20 and Rs.15,75,559/- as liquidated damages.  That
deduction was disputed by the respondent and, therefore, dispute was
referred to the arbitral tribunal.  The arbitral tribunal arrived at the
conclusion that strikes affecting the supply of raw material to the
claimant are not within the definition of  'Force Majeure' in the
contract between the parties, and hence, on that ground, it cannot be
said that the amount of liquidated damages was wrongfully withheld
by the appellant.  With regard to other contention on the basis of
customs duty also, the arbitral tribunal arrived at the conclusion that it
would not justify the delay in the supply of goods.  Thereafter, the
arbitral tribunal considered various decisions of this Court regarding
recovery of liquidated damages and arrived at the conclusion that it
was for the appellant to establish that they had suffered any loss
because of  the breach committed by the respondent in not supplying
the goods within the prescribed time limit.  The arbitral tribunal
thereafter appreciated the evidence and arrived at the conclusion that
in view of the	statement volunteered by Mr. Arumoy Das, it was clear
that shortage of casing pipes was only one of the other reasons which
led to the change in the deployment plan and that it has failed to
establish its case that it has suffered any loss in terms of money
because of delay in supply of goods under the contract.	 Hence, the
arbitral tribunal held that appellant has wrongfully withheld the
agreed amount of US $ 3,04,970.20 and Rs.15,75,559/- on account of
customs duty, sales tax, freight charges deducted by way of liquidated
damages.  The arbitral tribunal further held that the respondent was
entitled to recover  the said amount with interest at the rate of 12 per
cent p.a. from 1st April 1997 till the date of the filing of statement of
claim and thereafter having regard to the commercial nature of the
transaction at the rate of 18 per cent per annum pendente lite till
payment is made.
</p>
<p id="p_129">For challenging the said award, learned senior counsel Mr.
Desai submitted that:-
</p><p id="p_130">(1)	the award is vitiated on the ground that there was delay
on the part of respondent in supplying agreed goods/
pipes and for the delay, appellant was entitled to recover
agreed liquidated damages i.e. a sum equivalent to 1% of
the contract price for whole unit per week of such delay
or part thereof.  Thereby, the award was contrary to
<a href="/doc/597719/" id="a_105">Section 28(3)</a> which provides that the arbitral tribunal
shall decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of
the contract;
</p>
<p id="p_131">(2)	the award passed by the arbitrator is on the face of it
illegal and erroneous as it arrived at the conclusion that
the appellant was required to prove the loss suffered by it
before recovering the liquidated damages.  He submitted
that the arbitral tribunal misinterpreted the law on the
subject;
</p>
<p id="p_132">(3)	in any set of circumstances, the award passed by the
arbitrator granting interest on the liquidated damages
deducted by the appellant is, on the face of it, unjustified,
unreasonable and against the specific terms of the
contract, namely clause 34.4 of the agreement, which
provides that on 'disputed claim', no interest would be
payable.
</p>
<p id="p_133">As against this, learned senior counsel Mr. Dave submitted that
it is settled law that for the breach of contract provisions of <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_106">Section 74</a>
of the Contract Act would be applicable and compensation / damages
could be awarded only if the loss is suffered because of the breach of
contract.  He submitted that this principle is laid down by the Privy
Council as early as in 1929 in Bhai Panna Singh and others v. Bhai
Arjun Singh and others [AIR 1929 PC 179], wherein the Privy
Council observed thus: -
</p><p id="p_134">"The effect of<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_107"> S. 74</a>, <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_108">Contract Act</a> of 1872, is to
disentitle the plaintiffs to recover simplicitor the sum of
Rs.10,000/- whether penalty or liquidated damages.  The
plaintiffs must prove the damages they have suffered."
</p>
<p id="p_135">He submitted that this Court has also held that the plaintiff
claiming liquidated damages has to prove the loss suffered by him.  In
support of this contention, he referred to and relied upon various
decisions.  In any case, it is his contention that even if there is any
error in arriving at the said conclusion, the award cannot be interfered
with under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_109">Section 34</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_136">At this stage, we would refer to the relevant terms of the
contract upon which learned counsel for the appellant has based his
submissions, which are as under: -
</p><p id="p_137">"11.	Failure and Termination Clause/Liquidated
Damages:-
</p>
<p id="p_138">	Time and date of delivery shall be essence of the
contract.  If the contractor fails to deliver the stores, or
any installment thereof within the period fixed for such
delivery in the schedule or at any time repudiates the
contract before the expiry of such period, the purchaser
may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy,
available to him to recover damages for breach of the
contract:-
</p>
<p id="p_139">(a)	Recovery from the contractor as agreed
liquidated damages are not by way of penalty, a
sum equivalent to 1% (one percent) of the contract
price of  the whole unit per week for such delay or
part thereof (this is an agreed, genuine pre-
estimate of damages duly agreed by the parties)
which the contractor has failed to deliver within
the period fixed for delivery in the schedule, where
delivery thereof is accepted after expiry of the
aforesaid period.  It may be noted that such
recovery of liquidated damages may be upto 10%
of the contract price of whole unit of stores which
the contractor has failed to deliver within the
period fixed for delivery, or

</p><p id="p_140">(e)	It may further be noted that clause (a) provides for
recovery of liquidated damages on the cost of
contract price of delayed supplies (whole unit) at
the rate of 1% of the contract price of the whole
unit per week for such delay or part thereof upto a
ceiling of 10% of the contract price of delayed
supplies (whole unit).	Liquidated damages for
delay in supplies thus accrued will be recovered
by the paying authorities of the purchaser
specified in the supply order, from the bill for
payment of the cost of material submitted by the
contractor or his foreign principals in accordance
with the terms of supply order or otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_141">(f)	Notwithstanding anything stated above, equipment
and materials will be deemed to have been
delivered only when all its components, parts are
also delivered.	 If certain components are not
delivered in time the equipment and material will
be considered as delayed until such time all the
missing parts are also delivered.
</p>
<p id="p_142">12.	Levy of liquidated damages (LD) due to delay in
supplies.
</p>
<p id="p_143">LD will be imposed on the total value of the order
unless 75% of the value ordered is supplied within the
stipulate delivery period.  Where 75% of the value
ordered has been supplied within stipulated delivery
period.	 LD will be imposed on the order value of
delayed supply(ies).  However, where in judgment of
ONGC, the supply of partial quantity does not fulfill the
operating need, LD will be imposed on full value of the
supply order.
</p>
<p id="p_144">34.4	Delay in Release of Payment: -
</p>
<p id="p_145">In case where payment is to be made on
satisfactory receipt of materials at destination or where
payment is to be made after satisfactory commissioning
of the equipment as per terms of the supply order.
ONGC shall make payment within 60 days of receipt of
invoice / claim complete in all respects.  Any delay in
payment on undisputed claim / amount beyond 60 days
of the receipt of invoice / claim will attract interest @ 1%
per month.  No interest will be paid on disputed claims.
For interest on delayed payments to small scale and
Ancillary Industrial Undertakings, the provisions of the
"Interest of delayed payments to small scale and
Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 will
govern."
</p>

<p id="p_146">Mr. Desai referred to the decision rendered by this Court in
<a href="/doc/1578200/" id="a_110">Delta International Ltd. v. Shyam Sundar Ganeriwalla and another</a>
[(1999) 4 SCC 545] and submitted that for the purpose of construction
of contracts, the intention of the parties is to be gathered from the
words they have used and there is no intention independent of that
meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_147">It cannot be disputed that for construction of the contract, it is
settled law that the intention of the parties is to be gathered from the
words used in the agreement.  If words are unambiguous and are used
after full understanding of their meaning by experts, it would be
difficult to gather their intention different from the language used in
the agreement.	If upon a reading of the document as a whole, it can
fairly be deduced from the words actually used therein that the parties
had agreed on a particular term, there is nothing in law which prevents
them from setting up that term. {Re: <a href="/doc/514087/" id="a_111">Modi &amp; Co. v. Union of India</a>
[(1968) 2 SCR 565]}.  Further, in construing a contract, the Court
must look at the words used in the contract unless they are such that
one may suspect that they do not convey the intention correctly.  If the
words are clear, there is very little the court can do about it. {Re:
<a href="/doc/762747/" id="a_112">Provash Chandra Dalui and another v. Biswanath Banerjee and
another</a> [1989 Supp (1) SCC 487]}.
</p>
<p id="p_148">Therefore, when parties have expressly agreed that recovery
from the contractor for breach of the contract is pre-estimated genuine
liquidated damages and is not by way of penalty duly agreed by the
parties, there was no justifiable reason for the arbitral tribunal to
arrive at a conclusion that still the purchaser should prove loss
suffered by it because of delay in supply of goods.
</p>


<p id="p_149">Further, in arbitration proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is
required to decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of the
contract.  The agreement between the parties specifically provides that
without prejudice to any other right or	 remedy if the contractor fails
to deliver the stores within the stipulated time, appellant will be
entitled to recover from the contractor, as agreed, liquidated damages
equivalent to 1% of the contract price of the whole unit per week for
such delay.  Such recovery of liquidated damage could be at the most
up to 10% of the contract price of whole unit of stores.  Not only this,
it was also agreed that:-
</p><p id="p_150">(a)	liquidated damages for delay in supplies will be
recovered by paying authority from the bill for payment
of cost of material submitted by the contractor;
</p>
<p id="p_151">(b)	liquidated damages were not by way of penalty and it
was agreed to be genuine, pre-estimate of damages duly
agreed by the parties;
</p>
<p id="p_152">(c)	This pre-estimate of liquidated damages is  not assailed
by the respondent as unreasonable assessment of
damages by the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_153">Further, at the time when respondent sought extension of time
for supply of goods, time was extended by letter dated 4.12.1996 with
a specific demand that the clause for liquidated damages would be
invoked and appellant would recover the same for such delay.
Despite this specific letter written by the appellant, respondent had
supplied the goods which would indicate that even at that stage,
respondent was agreeable to pay liquidated damages.
</p>
<p id="p_154">On this issue, learned counsel for the parties referred to the
interpretation given to <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_113">Sections 73</a> and <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_114">74</a> of the Indian Contract Act
in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. [1962 Supp. (3) SCR 549], <a href="/doc/584252/" id="a_115">Fateh Chand v.
Balkishan Das</a> [(1964) 1 SCR 515 at 526], <a href="/doc/158693/" id="a_116">Maula Bux v. Union of

Iron Foundry</a> [(1974) 2 SCC 231].
</p>
<p id="p_155">Relevant part of <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_119">Sections 73</a> and <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_120">74</a> of Contract Act are as
under:-
</p><p id="p_156">"73.	Compensation for loss or damage caused by
breach of contract:- When a contract has been broken,
the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to
receive, from the party who has broken the contract,
compensation for any loss or damage caused to him
thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of
things from such breach, or which the parties knew,
when they made the contract, to be likely to result from
the breach of it.
</p>
<p id="p_157">Such compensation is not to be given for any
remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason
of the breach.
</p>
<p id="p_158"> 74.	Compensation for breach of contract
where penalty stipulated for.- When a contract has
been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the
amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the
contract contains any other stipulation by way of
penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled,
whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have
been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has
broken the contract reasonable compensation not
exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be,
the penalty stipulated for.
</p>
<p id="p_159">Explanation.- A stipulation for increased interest
from the date of default may be a stipulation by way of
penalty."
</p>
<p id="p_160">From the aforesaid Sections, it can be held that when a contract
has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to
receive compensation for any loss which naturally arise in the usual
course of things from such breach.  These sections further
contemplate that if parties knew when they made the contract that a
particular loss is likely to result from such breach, they can agree for
payment of such compensation.  In such a case, there may not be any
necessity of leading evidence for proving damages, unless the Court
arrives at the conclusion that no loss is likely to occur because of such
breach.	 Further, in case where Court arrives at the conclusion that the
term contemplating damages is by way of penalty, the Court may
grant reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named in
the contract on proof of damages.  However, when the terms of the
contract are clear and unambiguous then its meaning is to be gathered
only from the words used therein.  In a case where agreement is
executed by experts in the field, it would be difficult to hold that the
intention of the parties was different from the language used therein.
In such a case, it is for the party who contends that stipulated amount
is not reasonable compensation, to prove the same.
</p>
<p id="p_161">Now, we would refer to various decisions on the subject.  In
Fateh Chand's case (supra), the plaintiff made a claim to forfeit a
sum of Rs.25000/- received by him from the defendant.  The sum of
Rs.25000/- consisted of two items - Rs.1000/- received as earnest
money and Rs.24000/- agreed to be paid by the defendant as out of
sale price against the delivery of possession of the property.	With
regard to earnest money, the Court held that the plaintiff was entitled
to forfeit the same.  With regard to claim of remaining sum of
Rs.24000/-, the Court referred to <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_121">Section 74</a> of Indian Contract Act
and observed that <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_122">Section 74</a> deals with the measure of damages in
two classes of cases (i) where the contract names a sum to  be paid in
case of breach, and (ii) where the contract contains any other
stipulation by way of penalty. The Court observed thus: -
"The measure of damages in the case of breach of
a stipulation by way of penalty is by<a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_123"> S. 74</a> reasonable
compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for.
In assessing damages the Court has, subject to the limit
of the penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to award such
compensation as it deems reasonable having regard to all
the circumstances of the case.	Jurisdiction of the Court
to award compensation in case of breach of contract is
unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; but
compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes
upon the Court duty to award compensation according to
settled principles.  The section undoubtedly says that the
aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from
the party who has broken the contract, whether or not
actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused by
the breach.  Thereby it merely dispenses with  proof of
"actual loss or damages"; it does not justify the award
of compensation when in consequence of the breach no
legal injury at all has resulted, because compensation
for breach of contract can be awarded to make good
loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual
course of things, or which the parties knew when they
made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach.
</p>
<p id="p_162">The Court further observed as under: -
</p>
<p id="p_163">.... Duty not to enforce the penalty clause but only
to award reasonable compensation is statutorily imposed
upon courts by<a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_124"> S. 74</a>.  In all cases, therefore, where there
is a stipulation in the nature of penalty for forfeiture of an
amount deposited pursuant to the  terms of contract
which expressly provides for forfeiture, the court has
jurisdiction to award such sum only as it considers
reasonable, but not exceeding the amount specified in the
contract as liable to forfeiture."
</p>

<p id="p_164">From the aforesaid decision, it is clear that the Court was not
dealing with a case where contract named a sum to be paid in case of
breach but with a case where the contract contained stipulation by
way of penalty.
</p>
<p id="p_165">The aforesaid case and other cases were referred to by three
Judge Bench in Maula Bux's case (supra) wherein the Court held
thus: -
</p><p id="p_166">"... It is true that in every case of breach of contract the
person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove
actual	loss or damage suffered by him before he can
claim a decree, and the Court is competent to award
reasonable compensation in case of breach even if no
actual damage is proved to have been suffered in
consequence of the breach of contract.	But the
expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is
proved to have been caused thereby" is intended to cover
different classes of contracts which come before the
Courts.	 In case of breach of some contracts it may be
impossible for the Court to assess compensation arising
from breach, while in other cases compensation can be
calculated in accordance with established rules.  Where
the Court is unable to assess the compensation, the sum
named by the parties if it be regarded as a genuine pre-
estimate may be taken into consideration as the measure
of reasonable compensation, but not if the sum named is
in the nature of a penalty.  Where loss in terms of money
can be determined, the party claiming compensation must
prove the loss suffered by him."
</p>

<p id="p_167">In Rampur Distillery and Chemical Co. Ltd.'s (supra) also,
two Judge Bench of this Court referred to Maula Bux's case and
observed thus: -
</p><p id="p_168">" ... It was held by this Court that forfeiture of
earnest money under a contract for sale	 of property does
not fall within <a href="/doc/1454268/" id="a_125">Section 70</a> of the Contract Act, if the
amount is reasonable, because the forfeiture of a
reasonable sum paid as earnest money does not amount
to the imposition of a penalty.	 But, "where under the
terms of the contract the party in breach has undertaken
to pay a sum of money or to forfeit a sum of money
which he has already paid to the party complaining of a
breach of contract, the undertaking is of the nature of a
penalty."
</p>

<p id="p_169">In Raman Iron Foundry's case (supra), this Court considered
clause 18 of the Contract between the parties and arrived at the
conclusion that it applied only where the purchaser has a claim for a
sum presently due and payable by the contractor.  Thereafter, the
Court observed thus: -
</p><p id="p_170">"11.	Having discussed the proper interpretation of
Clause 18, we may now turn to consider what is the real
nature of the claim for recovery of which the appellant is
seeking to appropriate the sums due to the respondent
under other contracts.	The claim is admittedly one for
damages for breach of the contract between the parties.
Now, it is true that the damages which are claimed are
liquidated damages under Clause 14, but so far as the law
in India is concerned, there is no qualitative difference in
the nature of the claim whether it be for liquidated
damages or for unliquidated damages.  <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_126">Section 74</a> of the
Indian Contract Act eliminates the somewhat elaborate
refinements made under the English common law in
distinguishing between stipulations providing for
payment of liquidated damages and stipulations in the
nature of penalty.  Under the common law a genuine pre-
estimate of damages by mutual agreement is regarded as
a stipulation naming liquidated damages and binding
between the parties : a stipulation in a contract in
terrorem is a penalty and the Court refuses to enforce it,
awarding to the aggrieved party only reasonable
compensation.  The Indian Legislature has sought to cut
across the web of rules and presumptions under the
English common law, by enacting a uniform principle
applicable to all stipulations naming amounts to be paid
in case of breach, and stipulations by way of penalty, and
according  to this principle, even if there is a stipulation
by way of liquidated damages, a party complaining of
breach of contract can recover only reasonable
compensation for the injury sustained by him, the
stipulated amount being merely the outside limit.  It,
therefore, makes no difference in the present case that the
claim of the appellant is for liquidated damages.  It stands
on the same footing as a claim for unliquidated damages.
Now the law is well settled that a claim for unliquidated
damages does not give rise to a debt until the liability is
adjudicated and damages assessed by a decree or order of
a Court or other adjudicatory authority.  When there is a
breach of contract, the party who commits the breach
does not eo instanti incur any pecuniary obligation, nor
does the party complaining of the breach becomes
entitled to a debt due from the other party.  The only right
which the party aggrieved by the breach of the contract
has is the right to sue for damages."
</p>

<p id="p_171">Firstly, it is to be stated that in the aforesaid case Court has not
referred to earlier decision rendered by the five Judge Bench in Fateh
Chand's case or the decision rendered by the three Judge Bench in
Maula Bux's case.  Further, in <a href="/doc/42742762/" id="a_127">M/s H.M. Kamaluddin Ansari and
Co. v. Union of India and others</a> [(1983) 4 SCC 417], three Judge
Bench of this Court has over-ruled the decision in Raman Iron
Foundry's case (supra) and the Court while interpreting similar term
of the contract observed that it gives wider power to Union of India to
recover the amount claimed by appropriating any sum then due or
which at any time may become due to the contractors under other
contracts and the Court observed that clause 18 of the Standard
Contract confers ample powers on the Union of India to withhold the
amount and no injunction order could be passed restraining the Union
of India from withholding the amount.
</p>
<p id="p_172">In the light of the aforesaid decisions, in our view, there is
much force in the contention raised by the learned counsel for the
appellant.  However, the learned senior counsel Mr. Dave submitted
that even if the award passed by the arbitral tribunal is erroneous, it is
settled law that when two views are possible with regard to
interpretation of statutory provisions and or facts, the Court would
refuse to interfere with such award.
</p>
<p id="p_173">	It is true that if the arbitral tribunal has committed mere error of
fact or law in reaching its conclusion on the disputed question
submitted to it for adjudication then the Court would have no
jurisdiction to interfere with the award.  But, this would depend upon
reference made to the arbitrator: (a) If there is a general reference for
deciding the contractual dispute between the parties and if the award
is based on erroneous legal proposition, the Court could interfere; (b)
It is also settled law that in a case of reasoned award, the Court can set
aside the same if it is, on the face of it, erroneous on the proposition of
law or its application; (c) If a specific question of law is submitted to
the arbitrator, erroneous decision in point of law does not make the
award bad, so as to permit of its being set aside, unless the Court is
satisfied that the arbitrator had proceeded illegally.
</p>
<p id="p_174">In the facts of the case, it cannot be disputed that if contractual
term, as it is, is to be taken into consideration, the award is, on the
face of it, erroneous and in violation of the terms of the contract and
thereby it violates <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_128">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act.  Undisputedly, reference
to the arbitral tribunal was not with regard to interpretation of
question of law.  It was only a general reference with regard to claim
of respondent.	Hence, if the award is erroneous on the basis of record
with regard to proposition of law or its application, the Court will
have jurisdiction to interfere with the same.
</p>
<p id="p_175">	Dealing with the similar question, this Court in <a href="/doc/1989300/" id="a_129">M/s Alopi
Parshad &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Union of India</a> [(1960) 2 SCR 793]
observed that the extent of jurisdiction of the Court to set aside the
award on the ground of an error in making the award is well defined
and held thus:-
</p><p id="p_176">"The award of an arbitrator may be set aside on the
ground of an error on the face thereof only when in the
award  or in any document incorporated with it, as for
instance, a note appended by the arbitrators, stating the
reasons for his decision, there is found some legal
proposition which is the basis of the award and which is
erroneous-<a href="/doc/525017/" id="a_130">Champsey Bhara and Company v. Jivaraj
Balloo Spinning and Weaving Company Limited [L.R</a>. 50
IA 324].  If however, a specific question is submitted to
the arbitrator and he answers it, the fact that the answer
involves an erroneous decision in point of law, does not
make the  award bad on its face so as to permit of its
being set aside-In the matter of an arbitration between
King and Duveen and others [LR (1913) 2 KBD 32] and
Government of Kelantan v. Duff Development Company
Limited [LR 1923 AC 395].
</p>

<p id="p_177">Thereafter, the Court held that if there was a general reference and not
a specific reference on any question of law then the award can be set
aside if it demonstrated to be erroneous on the face of it.  The Court,
in that case, considering <a href="/doc/648614/" id="a_131">Section 56</a> of the Indian Contract Act held
that the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_132">Indian Contract Act</a> does not enable a party to a contract to
ignore the express provisions thereof and to claim payment of
consideration for performance of  the contract at rates different from
the stipulated rates, on some vague plea of equity and that the
arbitrators were not justified in ignoring the expressed terms of the
contract prescribing the remuneration payable to the agents.  The
aforesaid law has been followed continuously.  {<a href="/doc/662824/" id="a_133">Re. Rajasthan State
Mines &amp; Minerals Ltd. v. Eastern Engineering Enterprises and
another</a> [(1999) 9 SCC 283], <a href="/doc/164262/" id="a_134">Sikkim Subba Associates v. State of
Sikkim</a> [(2001) 5 SCC 629] and <a href="/doc/1913738/" id="a_135">G.M., Northern Railway and
another v. Sarvesh Chopra</a> [(2002) 4 SCC 45]}.
</p>
<p id="p_178">There is also elaborate discussion on this aspect in <a href="/doc/1961694/" id="a_136">Union of
India v. A.L. Rallia Ram</a> [(1964) 3 SCR 164] wherein the Court
succinctly observed as under:-
</p><p id="p_179">".. But it is now firmly established that an award is bad
on the ground of error of law on the face of it, when in
the award itself or in	a document actually incorporated
in it, there is found some legal proposition which is the
basis of the award and which is erroneous.  An error in
law on the face of the award means : "you can find in the
award or a document actually incorporated thereto, as for
instance, a note appended by the arbitrator stating the
reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is
the basis of the award and which you can then say is
erroneous.  It does not mean that if in a narrative a
'reference is made to a contention of one party, that
opens the door to setting first what that contention is, and
then going to the contract on which the parties' rights
depend to see if that contention is sound"  <a href="/doc/525017/" id="a_137">Champsey
Bhara and Company v. Jivraj Balloo Spinning and
Weaving Company Ltd</a>. [(1932) L.R. 50 I.A. 324]	But
this rule does not apply where questions of law are
specifically referred to the arbitrator for his decision; the
award of the arbitrator on those questions is binding upon
the parties, for by referring specific questions the parties
desire to have a decision from the arbitrator on those
questions rather than from the Court, and the Court will
not unless it is satisfied that the arbitrator had proceeded
illegally interfere with the decision."
</p>

<p id="p_180">The Court thereafter referred to the decision rendered in <a href="/doc/318186/" id="a_138">Seth
Thawardas Pherumal v. The Union of India</a> [(1955) 2 SCR 48]
wherein Bose, J. delivering the judgment of the Court had observed:
	"Therefore, when a question of law is the point at
issue, unless both sides specifically agree to refer it and
agree to be bound by the arbitrator's decision, the
jurisdiction of the Courts to set an arbitration right when
the error is apparent on the face of the award is not
ousted.	 The mere fact that both parties submit incidental
arguments about point of law in the course of the
proceedings is not enough."
</p>
<p id="p_181">The learned Judge also observed at p. 59 after
referring to F.R. Absalom Ltd. v. Great Western
(London) Garden Village Society [1933] AC 592, 616:
</p>
<p id="p_182">Simply because the matter was referred to
incidentally in the pleadings and arguments
in support of, or against, the general issue
about liability for damages, that is not
enough to clothe the arbitrator with
exclusive jurisdiction on a point of law."
</p>

<p id="p_183">The Court also referred to the test indicated by Lord Russell of
Killowen in F.R. Absalom Ltd. v. Great Western (London) Garden
Village Society Ltd., and observed that the said case adequately brings
out a distinction between a specific reference on a question of law,
and a question of law arising for determination by the arbitrator in the
decision of the dispute.  The Court quoted the following observations
with approval: -
</p><p id="p_184">" .. it is, I think, essential to keep the case where
disputes are referred to an arbitrator in the decision of
which a question of law becomes material distinct from
the case in which a specific question of law has been
referred to him for decision. x	 x  x  x  The authorities
make a clear distinction between these two cases, and, as
they appear to me, they decide that in the former case
the Court can interfere if and when any error of law
appears on the face of the award, but that in the latter
case no such interference is possible upon the ground
that it so appears that the decision upon the question of
law is an erroneous one."
</p>
<p id="p_185">Further, in <a href="/doc/267492/" id="a_139">Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Sterilite
Industries (India) and Another</a> [(2001) 8 SCC 482], the Court
observed as under:-
</p><p id="p_186">"9.	The position in law has been noticed by this
Court in <a href="/doc/1961694/" id="a_140">Union of India v. A.L. Rallia Ram</a> [AIR 1963
SC 1685] and <a href="/doc/1553220/" id="a_141">Madanlal Roshanlal Mahajan v.
Hukumchand Mills Ltd</a>. [(1967) 1 SCR 105] to the
effect that the arbitrator's award both on facts and law is
final  that there is no appeal from his verdict; that the
court cannot review his award and correct any mistake in
his adjudication, unless the objection to the legality of the
award is apparent on the face of it.  In understanding
what would be an error of law on the face of the award,
the following observations in <a href="/doc/525017/" id="a_142">Champsey Bhara &amp; Co. v.
Jivraj Balloo Spg and Wvg. Co. Ltd</a>, [(1922-23) 50 IA
324] a decision of the Privy Council, are relevant (IA p.
</p><p id="p_187">331)
"An error in law on the face of the
award means, in Their Lordship's view,
that you can find in the award on a
document actually incorporated thereto, as
for instance, a note appended by the
arbitrator stating the reasons for his
judgment, some legal proposition which is
the basis of the award and which you can
then say is erroneous."
</p><p id="p_188">10.    <a href="/doc/899181/" id="a_143">In Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India</a>
[1999 (9) SCC 449], this Court again examined this
matter and stated that where the error of finding of fact
having a bearing on the award is patent and is easily
demonstrable without the necessity of carefully weighing
the various possible viewpoints, the interference in the
award based on an erroneous finding of fact is
permissible and similarly, if an award is based by
applying a principle of	 law which is patently erroneous,
and but for such erroneous application of legal principle,
the award could not have been made, such award is liable
to be set aside by holding that there has been a legal
misconduct on the part of the arbitrator."
</p>

<p id="p_189">Next question is - whether the legal proposition which is the
basis of the award for arriving at the conclusion that ONGC was not
entitled to recover the stipulated liquidated damages as it has failed to
establish that it has suffered any loss is erroneous on the face of it?
The arbitral tribunal after considering the decisions rendered by this
Court in the cases of Fateh Chand, Maula Bux and Rampur
Distillery (supra) arrived at the conclusion that "in view of these three
decisions of the Supreme Court, it is clear that it was for the
respondents to establish that they had suffered any loss because of the
breach committed by the claimant in the supply of goods under the
contract between the parties after 14th November, 1996.	 In the words
we have emphasized in Maula Bux decision, it is clear that if loss in
terms of money can be determined, the party claiming the
compensation 'must prove' the loss suffered by him".
</p>
<p id="p_190">Thereafter the arbitral tribunal referred to the evidence and the
following statement made by the witness Das:
"The re-deployment plan was made keeping in mind
several constraints including shortage of casing pipes."
</p>

<p id="p_191">Further, the arbitral tribunal came to the conclusion that under
these circumstances, the shortage of casing pipes of 26" diameter and
30" diameter pipes was not the only reason which led to redeployment
of rig Trident II to Platform B 121.  The arbitral tribunal also
appreciated the other evidence and held that the attempt on the part of
the ONGC to show that production of gas on Platform B 121 was
delayed because of the late supply of goods by the claimant failed.
Thereafter, the arbitral tribunal considered the contention raised by the
learned counsel for the ONGC that the amount of 10% which had
been deducted by way of liquidated damages for the late supply of
goods under the contract was not by way of penalty.  In response
thereto, it was pointed out that it was not the case of learned counsel
Mr. Setalwad on behalf of the claimants that "these stipulations in the
contract for deduction of liquidated damages was by way of penalty".
Further, the arbitral tribunal observed that in view of the decisions
rendered in Fateh Chand and Maula Bux cases, "all that we are
required to consider is whether the respondents have established their
case of actual	loss in money terms because of the delay in the supply
of the Casing Pipes under the contract between the parties".  Finally,
the arbitral tribunal held that as the appellant has failed to prove the
loss suffered  because of delay in supply of goods as set out in the
contract between the parties, it is required to refund the amount
deducted by way of liquidated damages from the specified amount
payable to the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_192">It is apparent from the aforesaid reasoning recorded by the
arbitral  tribunal that it failed to consider <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_144">Sections 73</a> and <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_145">74</a> of the
Indian Contract Act and the ratio laid down in Fateh Chand's case
(supra) wherein it is specifically held that jurisdiction of the Court to
award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified
except as to the maximum stipulated; and compensation has to be
reasonable.  Under <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_146">Section 73</a>, when a contract has been broken, the
party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive compensation
for any loss caused to him which the parties knew when they made the
contract to be likely to result from the breach of it.	This Section is to
be read with <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_147">Section 74</a>, which deals with penalty stipulated in the
contract, inter alia [relevant for the present case] provides that when a
contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the
amount to be  paid in case of such breach, the party complaining of
breach is entitled, whether or not actual loss is proved to have been
caused, thereby to receive from the party who has broken the contract
reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named.
<a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_148">Section 74</a> emphasizes that in case of breach of contract, the party
complaining of the breach is entitled to receive reasonable
compensation whether or not actual loss is proved to have been
caused by such breach.	Therefore, the emphasis is on reasonable
compensation.  If the compensation named in the contract is by way
of penalty, consideration would be different and the party is only
entitled to reasonable compensation for the loss suffered.  But if the
compensation named in the contract for such breach is genuine pre-
estimate of loss which the parties knew when they made the contract
to be likely to result from the breach of it, there is no question of
proving such loss or such party is not required to lead evidence to
prove actual loss suffered by him.  Burden is on the other party to lead
evidence for proving that no loss is likely to occur by such breach.
Take for illustration: if the parties have agreed to purchase cotton
bales and the same were only to be kept as a stock-in-trade.  Such
bales are not delivered on the due date and thereafter the bales are
delivered beyond the stipulated time, hence there is breach of the
contract.  Question which would arise for consideration is - whether
by such breach party has suffered any loss.  If the price of cotton bales
fluctuated during that time, loss or gain could easily be proved.  But if
cotton bales are to be purchased for manufacturing yarn, consideration
would be different.
</p>
<p id="p_193">In Maula Bux's case (supra), plaintiff - Maula Bux entered
into a contract with the Government of India to supply potatoes at the
Military Head Quarters, U.P. Area and deposited an amount of
Rs.10000/- as security for due performance of the contract.  He
entered into another contract with the Government of India to supply
at the same place poultry eggs and fish for one year and deposited an
amount of Rs.8500/- for due performance of the contract.  Plaintiff
having made persistent default in making regular and full supplies of
the commodities agreed to be supplied, the Government rescinded the
contracts and forfeited the amounts deposited by the plaintiff, because
under the terms of the agreement, the amounts deposited by the
plaintiff as security for the due  performance of the contracts were to
stand forfeited in case plaintiff neglected to perform his part of the
contract.  In context of these facts, Court held that it was possible for
the Government of India to lead evidence to prove the rates at which
potatoes, poultry, eggs and fish were purchased by them when the
plaintiff failed to deliver "regularly and fully" the quantities stipulated
under the terms of the contracts and after the contracts were
terminated.  They could have proved the rates at which they had to be
purchased and also the other incidental charges incurred by them in
procuring the goods contracted for.  But no such attempt was made.
Hence, claim for damages was not granted.
</p>
<p id="p_194"> In Maula Bux's case (supra), the Court has specifically held
that it is true that in every case of breach of contract the person
aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage
suffered by him before he can claim a decree and the Court is
competent to award reasonable compensation in a case of breach even
if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of
the breach of contract.	 The Court has also specifically held that in
case of breach of some contracts it may be impossible for the Court to
assess compensation arising from breach.
</p>
<p id="p_195">Take for illustration construction of a road or a bridge.  If there
is delay in completing the construction of road or bridge within
stipulated time, then it would be difficult to prove how much loss is
suffered by the Society / State.  Similarly, in the present case, delay
took place in deployment of rigs and on that basis actual production of
gas from platform B-121 had to be changed.  It is undoubtedly true
that the witness has stated that redeployment plan was made keeping
in mind several constraints including shortage of casing pipes.
Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, took into consideration the aforesaid
statement volunteered by the witness that shortage of casing pipes was
only one of the several reasons and not the only reason which led to
change in deployment of plan or redeployment of rigs Trident-II
platform B-121.	 In our view, in such a contract, it would be difficult
to prove exact loss or damage which the parties suffer because of the
breach thereof.	 In such a situation, if the parties have pre-estimated
such loss after clear understanding, it would be totally unjustified to
arrive at the conclusion that party who has committed breach of the
contract is not liable to pay compensation.  It would be against the
specific provisions of <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_149">Section 73</a> and <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_150">74</a> of the Indian Contract Act.
There was nothing on record that compensation contemplated by the
parties was in any way unreasonable.  It has been specifically
mentioned that it was an agreed genuine pre-estimate of damages duly
agreed by the parties.	It was also mentioned that the liquidated
damages are not by way of penalty.  It was also provided in the
contract that such damages are to be recovered by the purchaser from
the bills for payment of the cost of material submitted by the
contractor. No evidence is led by the claimant to establish that
stipulated condition was by way of penalty or the compensation
contemplated was, in any way, unreasonable. There was no reason for
the tribunal not to rely upon the clear and unambiguous terms of
agreement stipulating pre-estimate damages because of delay in
supply of goods.  Further, while extending the time for delivery of the
goods, respondent was informed that it would be required to pay
stipulated damages.
</p>
<p id="p_196">From the aforesaid discussions, it can be held that:-
</p>
<p id="p_197">(1)	Terms of the contract are required to be taken into
consideration before arriving at the conclusion whether
the party claiming damages is entitled to the same;
</p>
<p id="p_198">(2)	If the terms are clear and unambiguous stipulating the
liquidated damages in case of the breach of the contract
unless it is held that such estimate of
damages/compensation is unreasonable or is by way of
penalty, party who has committed the breach is required
to pay such compensation and that is what is provided in
<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_151">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act.
</p>
<p id="p_199">(3)	<a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_152">Section 74</a> is to be read along with <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_153">Section 73</a> and,
therefore, in every case of breach of contract, the person
aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual
loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a
decree.	 The Court is competent to award reasonable
compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage
is proved to have been suffered in consequences of the
breach of a contract.
</p>
<p id="p_200">(4)	In some contracts, it would be impossible for the Court to
assess the compensation arising from breach and if the
compensation contemplated is not by way of penalty or
unreasonable, Court can award the same if it is genuine
pre-estimate by the parties as the measure of reasonable
compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_201">For the reasons stated above, the impugned award directing the
appellant to refund the amount deducted for the breach as per
contractual terms requires to be set aside and is hereby set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_202">WHETHER THE CLAIM OF REFUND OF THE AMOUNT DEDUCTED
BY THE APPELLANT FROM THE BILLS IS DISPUTED OR
UNDISPUTED CLAIM?
</p>
<p id="p_203">As the award directing the appellant to refund the amount
deducted is set aside, question of granting interest on the same would
not arise.  Still however, to demonstrate that the award passed by the
arbitral tribunal is, on the face of it, erroneous with regard to grant of
interest, we deal with the same.
</p>
<p id="p_204">Arbitral Tribunal arrived at the conclusion that the appellant
wrongfully withheld/deducted the aggregate amount of US $
3,04,970.20 on account of delay in supply of goods and amount of
Rs.15,75,559/- on account of excise duty, sales tax, freight charges
deducted as and by way of liquidated damages from the amount
payable by the respondent and thereafter arrived at the conclusion that
the said amount was deducted from undisputed invoice amount,
therefore, the said claim of the respondent cannot be held to be
'disputed claim'.
</p>
<p id="p_205">It is apparent that the claim of the contractor to recover the said
amount was disputed mainly because it was agreed term between the
parties that in case of delay in supply of goods appellant was entitled
to recover damages at the rate as specified in the agreement.  It was
also agreed that the said liquidated damages were to be recovered by
paying authorities from the bills for payment of the cost of material
submitted by the contractor.  If this agreed amount is deducted and
thereafter contractor claims it back on the ground that the appellant
was not entitled to deduct the same as it has failed to prove loss
suffered by it, the said claim undoubtedly would be a 'disputed
claim'.	   The arbitrators were required to decide by considering the
facts and the law applicable, whether the deduction was justified or
not?  That itself would indicate that the claim of the contractor was
'disputed claim' and not 'undisputed'.	The reason recorded by the
arbitrators that as the goods were received and bills are not disputed,
therefore, the claim for recovering the amount of bills cannot be held
to be 'disputed claim' is, on the face of it, unjust, unreasonable,
unsustainable and patently illegal as well as against the expressed
terms of the contract.	As quoted above, clause 34.4 in terms provides
that no interest would be payable on 'disputed claim'.	It also provides
that in which set of circumstances, interest amount would be paid in
case of delay in payment of undisputed claim.  In such case, the
interest rate is also specified at 1% per month on such undisputed
claim amount.  Despite this clause, the arbitral tribunal came to the
conclusion that it was undisputed claim and held that in law, appellant
was not entitled to withhold these two payments from the invoice
raised by the respondent and hence directed that the appellant was
liable to pay interest on wrongful deductions at the rate of 12% p.a.
from 1.4.1997 till the date of filing of the statement of claim and
thereafter having regard to the commercial nature of the transaction at
the rate of 18% p.a. pendente lite till payment.
</p>
<p id="p_206">	It is to be reiterated that it is the primary duty of the arbitrators
to enforce a promise which the parties have made and to uphold the
sanctity of the contract which forms the basis of the civilized society
and also the jurisdiction of the arbitrators.  Hence, this part of the
award passed by the arbitral tribunal granting interest on the amount
deducted by the appellant from the bills payable to the respondent is
against the terms of the contract and is, therefore, violative of <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_154">Section
28(3)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_207">CONCLUSIONS:-
</p>

<p id="p_208">In the result, it is held that:-
</p>
<p id="p_209">A.	(1)	The Court can set aside the arbitral award under
<a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_155">Section 34(2)</a> of the Act if the party making the
application furnishes proof that:-
</p>
<p id="p_210">(i)	a party was under some incapacity, or

</p><p id="p_211">(ii)	the arbitration agreement is not valid under
the law to which the parties have subjected it
or, failing any indication thereon, under the
law for the time being in force; or

</p><p id="p_212">(iii)	the party making the application was not
given proper notice of the appointment of an
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or
was otherwise unable to present his case; or

</p><p id="p_213">(iv)	the arbitral award deals with a dispute not
contemplated by or not falling within the
terms of the submission to arbitration, or it
contains decisions on matters beyond the
scope of the submission to arbitration;
</p>

<p id="p_214">2)	The Court may set aside the award:-
</p><p id="p_215">(i)	(a)  if the composition of the arbitral tribunal
was not in accordance with the agreement of
the parties,

</p><p id="p_216">(b)	failing such agreement, the
composition of the arbitral tribunal was not
in accordance with Part-I of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_217">(ii)	if the arbitral procedure was not in
accordance with:-
</p>
<p id="p_218">(a)	the agreement of the parties, or

</p><p id="p_219">(b)	failing such agreement, the arbitral
procedure was not in accordance with
Part-I of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_220">However, exception for setting aside
the award on the ground of
composition of arbitral tribunal or
illegality of arbitral procedure is that
the agreement should not be in
conflict with the provisions of Part-I
of the Act from which parties cannot
derogate.
</p>
<p id="p_221">(c)	If the award passed by the arbitral
tribunal is in contravention of
provisions of the Act or any other
substantive law governing the parties
or is against the terms of the contract.
</p>
<p id="p_222">(3)	The award could be set aside if it is against the
public policy of India, that is to say, if it is
contrary to:-
</p>
<p id="p_223">(a)	fundamental policy of Indian law;
</p><p id="p_224">(b)	the interest of India; or
</p><p id="p_225">(c)	justice or morality, or
</p><p id="p_226">(d)	if it is patently illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_227">(4)	It could be challenged:-
</p>
<p id="p_228">(a)	as provided under <a href="/doc/1463968/" id="a_156">Section 13(5)</a>; and

</p><p id="p_229">(b)	<a href="/doc/568692/" id="a_157">Section 16(6)</a> of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_230">B.	(1)	The impugned award requires to be set aside
mainly on the grounds:-
</p>
<p id="p_231">(i)	there is specific stipulation in the agreement
that the time and date of delivery of the
goods was the essence of the contract;
</p>
<p id="p_232">(ii)	in case of failure to deliver the goods within
the period fixed for such delivery in the
schedule, ONGC was entitled to recover
from the contractor liquidated damages as
agreed;
</p>
<p id="p_233">(iii)	it was also explicitly understood that the
agreed liquidated damages were genuine
pre-estimate of damages;
</p>
<p id="p_234">(iv)	on the request of the respondent to extend
the time limit for supply of goods, ONGC
informed specifically that time was extended
but stipulated liquidated damages as agreed
would be recovered;
</p>
<p id="p_235">(v)	liquidated damages for delay in supply of
goods were to be recovered by paying
authorities from the bills for payment of cost
of material supplied by the contractor;
</p>
<p id="p_236">(vi)	there is nothing on record to suggest that
stipulation for recovering liquidated
damages was by way of penalty or that the
said sum was in any way unreasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_237">(vii)	In certain contracts, it is impossible to assess
the damages or prove the same.	Such
situation is taken care by <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_158">Sections 73</a> and <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_159">74</a>
of the Contract Act and in the present case
by specific terms of the contract.
</p>

<p id="p_238">For the reasons stated above, the impugned award directing the
appellant to refund US $ 3,04,970.20 and Rs.15,75,559/- with interest
which were deducted for the breach of contract as per the agreement
requires to be set aside and is hereby set aside.  The appeal is allowed
accordingly.  There shall be no order as to costs.
