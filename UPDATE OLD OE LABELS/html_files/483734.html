ACT:
     <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes  Act</a>  1947,  <a href="/doc/1869167/" id="a_2">Section  10(1)(d)</a>	 and
Madhya Pradesh	Industrial Relations  Act 1960.	 <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_3">Section 51-</a>
Tribunals whether  have jurisdiction  to go behind the terms
of reference.



HEADNOTE:
     The  respondent  was  engaged  in	the  manufacture  of
stoneware  pipes   and	other  refractory  material  at	 its
factory. It  had taken	lease of  reference. The  respondent
issued a  notice of  closure of	 the factory  and mines,  on
account of  financial difficulties. The factory was governed
by the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Relations Act, 1960 and the
Mines were governed by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_4">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947.
     A dispute	having been  raised by the workmen, the case
relating to the factory was referred under <a href="/doc/1633931/" id="a_5">section 51</a> of the
State Act to an Industrial Court, while the dispute relating
to the	Mines was  referred under  <a href="/doc/760439/" id="a_6">section 10(1)</a>  (d) of the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_7">Central Act</a>  to the  Central Government	 Industrial Tribunal
cum-Labour Court.
     The main  question referred  under the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_8">State  Act</a>	 was
whether the proposed closure was proper and justified, while
the  reference	 under	the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_9">Central  Act</a>  was	whether	 the
employers were justified in closing down the mines.
     The Industrial  Court held	 that it had no jurisdiction
either to  inquire into	 the propriety	of the closure or to
consider whether  there was or was not a real closure, while
the Central  Government Industrial Tribunal held that though
it had	no jurisdiction	 to inquire whether the management's
decision  to   close  down   the  business  was	 proper	 and
justified, it was entitled to consider whether, in fact, the
business was closed.
     In writ  petitions filed  by both sides, the High Court
came to the conclusion that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
in industrial disputes is limited to the points specifically
referred for  its adjudication	and  to	 matters  incidental
thereto and  that the Tribunal cannot go beyond the terms of
reference made of. it.
     Dismissing the appeals,
^
     HELD: 1.  The references  being limited  to the  narrow
question whether  the closure  was proper and justified, the
Tribiunals by  the very	 terms of  the	references,  had  no
jurisdiction to	 go behind  the fact  of closure and inquire
into the  question whether  the business  was in fact closed
down by the management. [130 E]
     2. The  terms of  the references show that the point of
dispute between	 there parties	was  not  the  fact  of	 the
closure of  business but  the propriety and justification of
the respondents	 decision to  close down  the business.	 The
Tribunals.
127
		    (Chandrachud, C. J.)
were not  called upon  to adjudicate upon the question as to
whether under  the   pretence of  closing the  business	 the
workers were locked out by the management. [130 C-D]
     3. The  history  of  the  dispute	indicated  that	 the
dispute between	 the parties  related not to the question as
to  whether  the  business,  in	 fact,	was  closed  by	 the
management  but	 whether  there	 was  any  justification  or
propriety on the part of the management in deciding to close
down  the   business.  There  is  a  clear  and	 unequivocal
admission on  the part	of the	workers before the Tribunals
that the  business was	in fact	 closed by  the	 respondent.
[130F, 131D]
     4. The  concept of	 'closure' as  envisaged in  <a href="/doc/1755673/" id="a_10">section
2(8)</a> of the State Act is perhaps wider than what is commonly
understood by  that expression	but that  cannot assist	 the
appellant to contend that under the terms of the references,
the Tribunals were entitled to enter into the question as to
the fact  OF the  closure. If  ever it	was the	 case of the
appellant that	there was  in fact  no closure and there was
really an  illegal lock-out,  the reference  would have been
asked for  and made  not under section Sl under which it was
made, but under <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_11">section 82</a>. 1132B. D]
     5. The propriety of or justification for the closure of
a business  in fact  and truly	effected,  cannot  raise  an
industrial dispute  as contemplated by the State and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_12">Central
Act</a>s. [132 <a href="/doc/468790/" id="a_13">F]

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">     CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 293-295
of 1971.
</p><p id="p_2">     From the  Judgment and  Order dated  30-4-1970  of	 the
Madhya Pradesh	High Court  in M.P. No. 333/68 and 48 and 27
of 1969.
</p><p id="p_3">     Gulab Gupta and Vineet Kumar for the Appellant.
     V. M.  Tarkunde, D.  N. Misra  and O.C.Mathur  for	 the
Respondent.
</p><p id="p_4">     The Judgmnent of the Court was delivered by
     CHANDRACHUD, C. J. The respondent, M/s. Perfect Pottery
Co. Ltd.,  was engaged in the manufacture of stoneware pipes
and other  refractory  material	 at  its  factory  known  as
Perfect Pottery	 Works, where it employed about 900 workmen.
For the	 purposes of  its factory,  respondent had  taken  a
lease of  Poly Pather  Clay Mines,  wherein about 81 workmen
were employed.	On April 24, 1967 respondent issued a notice
of closure  of the  factory and	 the Mines stating, that the
management. had	 decided  to  close  down  the	business  on
account of financial difficulties and other reasons.
</p><p id="p_5">     Consequent upon  the notice  of closure,  the appellant
herein,	 the   Pottery	Mazdoor	  Panchayat,   applied	 for
initiation of conciliation pro
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">128</span>
ceedings to  the Deputy	 Labour Commissioner, Madhya Pradesh
and to	the Regional  Labour Commissioner (C), Jabalpur. The
reason	for   initiation  of   two  different	conciliation
proceedings was	 that Perfect  Pottery Works was an industry
to which  the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Relations Act, 1960,
applied, whereas  Poly Pather  Clay Mines  was	an  industry
governed by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_14">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947. We will refer
to these  two Acts  as 'the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_15">State Act</a>' and 'me <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_16">Central Act</a>'
respectively
     Conciliation  proceedings	having	failed,	 the  Madhya
Pradesh State  Government, on  June 26,	 1967,	referred  an
industrial dispute  to the  arbitration	 of  the  Industrial
Court under  <a href="/doc/1633931/" id="a_17">section 51</a> of the State Act. The main questions
referred to the Industrial Court were:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  Whether the  proposed closure by the management of
     the  Perfect  Pottery  Co.	 Ltd.,	Jabalpur,  of  their
     pottery factory  at Jabalpur,  with effect from July 1,
     1967, is proper and justified,  and
	  To  what   retrenchment   compensation   are	 the
     employees entitled, if it is decided that 'the proposed
     closure is proper and justified ?</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">     The reference was evidently made in order, in the first
instance,  to	avert  the   closure  of  the  factory.	 The
Industrial Court  was there  fore  also	 asked	to  consider
whether any  interim relief should be granted by restraining
the management	from closing  down  the	 factory  until	 the
reference was finally adjudicated upon. The Industrial Court
by an  interim Award dated June 30, 1967, having declined to
issue a	 prohibitory injunction,  the appellant	 filed	Writ
Petition No.  337 of  67 in  the Madhya	 Pradesh High Court.
That Petition  became infructuous  after the  closure of the
factory and was not pressed.
</p><p id="p_7">     On July  1, 1967 the respondent purported to close down
the  business.	We  say	 "purported",  because	whether	 the
business was,  truly and  in fact, closed or not is a matter
on which  the parties  have joined  issue. The	case of	 the
appellant  is  that  respondent	 had  closed  the  place  of
business and  not the business itself. After the closure, or
shall we  say the  'alleged closure', the Central Government
on September  16,  1967,  made	a  reference  under  <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_18">section
10(1)(d)</a> of  the  Central  Act	to  the	 Central  Government
Industrial  Tribunal-cum  Labour  Court,  Jabalpur,  on	 the
following question:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  Whether the  employers in  relation  to  the	Poly
     Pather  Clay   Mines  of	Perfect	 Pottery  Co.  Ltd.,
     Jabalpur, were  justified in closing down the said mine
     and retrenching the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">129</span>
		    (Chandrachud, C. J.)
     following 81  workers with effect from July 1, 1967. If
     not, to what relief are the workmen entitled ?</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">     In the  two references, one before the Industrial Court
and the	 other	before	the  Central  Government  Industrial
Tribunal-cum-Labour Court,  'the respondent  contended	that
the respective Tribunals had no jurisdiction to consider the
question as  regards the  propriety or	justification of the
management's decision  to close	 down the  business  on	 the
other question, the respondent did not dispute its liability
to pay	retrenchment compensation  to  the  workmen  but  it
contended that neither of the two Tribunals had jurisdiction
to go into that question.
</p><p id="p_9">     The appellant's  case before the Tribunals was that the
so-called closure  of the  business was	 merely a camouflage
and was	 in substance and essence, a lock out. In support of
this contention	 the appellant	pleaded that  the respondent
was making  large profits  in its business, that no economic
or financial  reasons could  have impelled  it to close down
its business and the true reason of the supposed closure was
to victimize  the workers  for their  Trade Union activities
and to defeat the rights which flowed out of the Award given
by the	Industrial Court, Madhya Pradesh, on March 16, 1966,
under which  the workers  were entitled	 to receive enhanced
dearness allowance
     The two  Tribunals came  to contrary  conclusion on the
principal question  as to  whether they	 had jurisdiction to
inquire into  the propriety  of	 or  justification  for	 the
closure. The  Central  Government  Industrial  Tribunal-cum-
Labour Court  held by  its award  dated July 3, 1968 that it
had no	jurisdiction to	 inquire whether the decision of the
management  to	close  down  the  business  was	 proper	 and
justified but  that it	was entitled to consider whether, in
fact, the  business was	 closed.  On  the  other  hand,	 the
Industrial Court,  by its  award dated	p November  15, 1968
held that  it had no jurisdiction either to inquire into the
propriety of  the  closure  or,	 because  of  the  terms  of
reference, to  consider whether	 there was or was not a real
closure.
</p><p id="p_10">     As against	 these decisions,  three Writ Petitions were
filed in  the High  Court of  Madhya  Pradesh,	one  by	 the
appellant and  two by  the respondent which were disposed of
by the High Court by a common judgment dated April 30, 1970.
Dismissing the	Writ Petition  filed by	 the  appellant	 and
allowing the  Writ Petitions filed by the respondent, it has
granted to  the appellant a certificate to file an appeal to
this Court under <a href="/doc/780609/" id="a_19">Article 133(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_11">     Two  questions  were  argued  before  the	High  Court:
Firstly, whether  the tribunals had jurisdiction to question
the propriety  or justification of the closure and secondly,
whether they had jurisdiction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">130</span>
to go  into the	 question of  retrenchment compensation. The
High  Court   has  held	 on  the  first	 question  that	 the
jurisdiction of	 the  Tribunal	in  industrial	disputes  is
limited	 to   the  points   specifically  referred  for	 its
adjudication and  to matters incidental thereto and that the
Tribunal cannot go beyond the terms of the reference made to
it. on	the second  question the High Court has accepted the
respondent's contention	 that the  question of	retrenchment
compensation has  to be	 decided under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_20">section 33C(2)</a> of the
Central Act.
</p><p id="p_12">     Having heard a closely thought out argument made by Mr.
Gupta on behalf of the appellant, we are of the opinion that
the High  Court is  right in its view on the first question.
The very  terms of  the references  show that  the point  of
dispute between	 the parties was not the fact of the closure
of its	business by  the respondent  but the  propriety	 and
justification of the respondent's decision to close down the
business. That	is why	the references were expressed to say
whether the  proposed closure of the business was proper and
justified. In  other words, by the references, the Tribunals
were not  called upon  by the  Government to adjudicate upon
the question  as to  whether there  was in fact a closure of
business or  whether  under  the  pretence  of	closing	 the
business the  workers were locked out by the management. The
references being  limited  to  the  narrow  question  as  to
whether the  closure was proper and justified, the Tribunals
by the	very terms of the references, had no jurisdiction to
go behind  the fact of closure and inquire into the question
whether	 the  business	was  in	 fact  closed  down  by	 the
management.
</p><p id="p_13">     It is not necessary to rely exclusively on the terms of
references for coming to this conclusion. The history of the
dispute	 and   the  various   documents	 on  record  of	 the
references themselves  indicate that the dispute between the
parties related	 not to	 the  question	as  to	whether	 the
business, in  fact, was closed by the management but whether
there was  any justification or propriety on the part of the
management in  deciding to  close down the business. On June
22,1967,  the  General	Secretary  of  the  appellant  Union
addressed a  letter to	the  Regional  Labour  Commissioner,
Jabalpur, by which the present dispute was raised. The first
paragraph  of  that  letter  says:  "that  the	Company	 had
notified is decision to close down the mine with effect from
July 1,	 1967, that  some of  the workers  were served	with
notices of  retrenchment individually  but that retrenchment
compensation was  not  paid  by	 the  management  which	 was
illegal and  violative of  the provisions  of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_21">Industrial
Disputes Act</a>".	This grievance	 assumes the validity of the
decision to  close down	 the business and proceeds to make a
claim arising  out of  a valid	closure namely,	 a claim for
retrenchment compensation. The second paragraph of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">131</span>
		    (Chandrachud, C. J.)
the aforesaid  letter begins  by saying that "the closure of
the mine  and the  factory is malafide". The reasons for the
closure are then set out in that paragraph which winds up by
saying that  the Union	was of	the opinion that the closure
was not	 for business  reasons but  was a  malafide decision
taken in  order to  drive the  Union out of existence and to
cheat the workers of their lawful dues.
</p><p id="p_14">     On	 June	28,  1967,  the	 Managing  Director  of	 the
respondent sent	 a reply to the Regional Labour Commissioner
dealing with the contentions made by the Union in its letter
of June	 22,, 1967.  The Managing Director contended that no
industrial dispute  existed or	was apprehended and that the
Conciliation officer  had, therefore,  no jurisdiction under
the Act	 to hold  any proceedings.  In the order dated April
30, 1970,  of	the  Industrial	 Tribunal-cum-Labour  Court,
Jabalpur, reference  has been made to an affidavit which was
filed on  behalf of  the workers for the purpose of securing
an interim  award. We  have, looked  at	 the  affidavit	 for
ourselves and  are in  agreement with  the view expressed by
the Tribunal that there is a clear and unequivocal admission
on the	part of	 the workers in that affidavit to the effect
that the  business was in fact closed by the respondent. The
High Court  has also  referred to a statement dated June 16,
1967, in  which it  was stated on behalf of the workmen that
since the  establishment had  already closed down, there was
no necessity for making submissions on the point relating to
the reduction in the number of employees and revision of the
workload.
</p><p id="p_15">     Learned  counsel	for  the  appellant  relies  upon  a
judgment  of   this  Court  in	<a href="/doc/468790/" id="a_22">The  Management	 of  Express
Newspapers Ltd.	 v. Workers  and Staff Employed</a> under it and
others,(1) in  which it was observed that if, in fact and in
substance, the closure of the business is a lock out and the
business has  been apparently  closed  for  the	 purpose  of
disguising a  lock out and a dispute is raised in respect of
such a	closure it  would be  an industrial dispute which an
Industrial Tribunal  is competent  to deal with. There, can,
with respect,  be no  quarrel with  this proposition but the
true question  which arises  for consideration is whether in
the instant case there was any dispute at all, whether there
was in fact a closure or whether the management purported to
close the  business as	a cloak or disguise for what in fact
and substance  was a  lock out.	 As we have shown earlier no
such dispute  was ever raised, the limited dispute which was
raised by  the appellant  being whether	 the closure  of the
business was effected for a proper and a justifiable reason.
</p><p id="p_16">     The appellant's  counsel also drew our attention to the
definition of  'closure' in  <a href="/doc/1755673/" id="a_23">section 2(8)</a>  of the  State Act
according to which 'closure'
     (1) [1963] 3 S.C.R. 540, 548
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">132</span>
to the	extent material,  means the  closing of any place or
part of	 a place  of employment	 or  the  total	 or  partial
suspension of  work by	an employer  or the total or partial
refusal	 by  an	 employer  to  continue	 to  employ  persons
employed by  him whether such closing, suspension or refusal
is or is not in consequence of an industrial dispute. It may
perhaps be that the concept of 'closure' in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_24">State Act</a> is
wider than  what is  commonly understood  by that expression
but we	do not	appreciate how	the circumstance that even a
partial closure	 of a business is closure within the meaning
of the	<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_25">State Act</a> can assist the appellant in its contention
that  under   the  terms  of  the  present  references,	 the
Tribunals were entitled to enter into the question as to the
fact of	 the closure.  In this	connection the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_26">section 82</a> of the state Act, to which Mr. Tarkunde appearing
on behalf  of the  respondent drew  our attention,  are very
significant. That section provides that the State Government
may make  a reference  to a  Labour Court  or the Industrial
Court for  a declaration  whether any proposed strike, lock-
out, closure or stoppage will be illegal. If ever it was the
case of	 the appellant that there was in fact no closure and
there was  really an  illegal lock-out,	 the reference would
have been  asked for  and made	not under  <a href="/doc/1633931/" id="a_27">section 51</a>  under
which it was made, but under <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_28">section 82</a>.
</p><p id="p_17">     We are,  therefore, of the view that the High Court was
right in coming to the conclusion that the two Tribunals had
no jurisdiction to go behind the references and inquire into
the question  whether the  closure of business, which was in
fact effected"	was decided  upon  for	reasons	 which	were
proper and  justifiable. The  propriety of  or justification
for the	 closure of  a business, in fact and truly effected,
cannot raise  an industrial  dispute as	 contemplated by the
State and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_29">Central Act</a>s.
</p><p id="p_18">     It is  unnecessary to  consider the  second question as
regards the  payment of	 retrenchment  compensation  and  we
will, therefore,  express  no  opinion	as  to	whether	 the
Tribunals  had	 jurisdiction  to  go  into  that  question.
Happily, the  parties have  arrived at	a settlement on that
question under	which, the respondent agrees to fix within a
period	of   six  months   from	  today	  the	retrenchment
compensation payable to the retrenched workers in accordance
with the  provisions of	 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_30">section 25FFF</a>	of the	Central Act,
namely, the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_31">Industrial Disputes  Act</a>, 1947, without the aid
of the	proviso to  that  section.  After  the	retrenchment
compensation is	 so fixed, a copy of the decision fixing the
compensation payable  to each of the workers will be sent by
the respondent	to the appellant Union. The workers or their
legal representatives,	as the	case may  be, will  then  be
entitled to  receive the  retrenchment compensation from the
respondent, which  agrees to  pay  the	same  to  them.	 The
respondent will	 be entitled  to set  off of  the amounts of
retrenchment compen-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">133</span>
<p id="p_19">		    (Chandrachud, C.J.)
sation already paid to the workers against the amounts found
due to	  them	under  this  settlement.  On  receiving	 the
retrenchment  compensation   the  workers   concerned  shall
withdraw the  applications, if any, filed by them for relief
in that behalf.
</p><p id="p_20">     We would  only like  to add that the compensation which
will be	 paid to  the workers  will be	without prejudice to
their right,  if any,  to get employment from the respondent
in the new business as and when occasion arises.
</p><p id="p_21">     The appeals are accordingly dismissed but there will be
no order as to costs.
