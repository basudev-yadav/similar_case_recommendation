Criminal Procedure 1973 (for short '<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>.'), this appeal has been placed 
before the present Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.    The facts of the case may be noticed in brief.  The appellant nos.1 and 2 
are real brothers of Mukhtar Singh Marwah, while respondent nos.1 and 2 
are his widow and son respectively. Mukhtar Singh Marwah died on 
3.6.1993.   The appellant no.1 filed Probate Case No.363 of 1993 in the 
Court of District Judge, Delhi, for being granted probate of the will allegedly 
executed by Mukhtar Singh Marwah on 20.1.1993.  The petition was 
contested by the respondents on the ground that the will was forged.  On 
their application the appellant no.1 filed the original will in the Court of 
District Judge on 10.2.1994.  Thereafter, the respondents moved an 
application under <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_5">Section  340</a> Cr.P.C. requesting the Court to file a criminal 
complaint against appellant no.1 as the will set up by him was forged.   A 
reply to the said application was filed on 27.7.1994 but the application has 
not been disposed of so far.   Thereafter, the respondents filed a criminal 
complaint in May 1996 in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New 
Delhi, for prosecution of the appellants and their mother Smt. Trilochan 
Kaur Marwah under <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_6">Sections 192</a>, <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_7">193</a>, <a href="/doc/1328629/" id="a_8">463</a>, <a href="/doc/1745798/" id="a_9">464</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_10">465</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_11">467</a>, <a href="/doc/1827979/" id="a_12">469</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_13">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1041742/" id="a_14">499</a> 
and <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_15">500</a> IPC on the ground that the will of Mukhtar Singh Marwah set up by 
the appellants is a forged and fictitious document.  It is stated in the 
complaint that though Mukhtar Singh Marwah was an educated person, but 
the will bears his thumb impression. He had accounts in Bank of Tokyo and 
Standard Chartered Bank which he used to operate by putting his signature.   
Under the will he had completely divested the respondents, who were his 
widow and son respectively and also a daughter who was spastic and had 
bequeathed his entire property to his mother and after her death to his 
brothers and sisters.   The appellant no.1 Iqbal Singh Marwah was appointed 
as the sole executor and trustee of the will.   Before the learned Metropolitan 
Magistrate, the complainant examined six witnesses including two persons 
from the banks who brought the relevant records and deposed that Mukhtar 
Singh Marwah used to operate the accounts by putting his signature.   The 
learned Metropolitan Magistrate held that as the question whether the will 
was a genuine document or a forged one, was an issue before the District 
Judge in the probate proceedings where the will had been filed, <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_16">Sections 195</a> 
(1)(b)(i) and (ii) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>. operated as a bar for taking cognizance of the 
offences under <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_18">Sections 192</a>, <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_19">193</a>, <a href="/doc/1328629/" id="a_20">463</a>, <a href="/doc/1745798/" id="a_21">464</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_22">471</a>, <a href="/doc/118906/" id="a_23">475</a> and <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_24">476</a> IPC.   The 
complaint was accordingly dismissed by the order dated 2.5.1998.   The 
respondents thereafter filed a criminal revision against the order of the 
learned Metropolitan Magistrate, before the Sessions Judge, who, relying 
upon <a href="/doc/1743953/" id="a_25">Sachida Nand Singh vs. State of Bihar</a> 1998 (2) SCC 493, held that 
the bar contained in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_26">Section  195</a> (1)(b)(ii) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_27">Cr.P.C</a>. would not apply where 
forgery of a document was committed before the said document was 
produced in Court.  The revision petition was accordingly allowed and the 
matter was remanded to the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate for proceeding 
in accordance with law.   The appellants challenged the order passed by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge by filing a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_28">Section  482</a> 
Cr.P.C. before Delhi High Court, but the same was dismissed on 15.9.2000 
following the law laid down in Sachida Nand Singh.  Feeling aggrieved, 
the appellants have preferred the present appeal in this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.	Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_29">Section 195</a> Cr.P.C., which according to the 
appellants, creates a bar in taking cognizance on the complaint filed by the 
respondents, reads as under :

</p> 
	
<p id="p_14">5.	The principal controversy revolves round the interpretation of the 
expression "when such offence is alleged to have been committed in respect 
of a document produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court" 
occurring in clause (b)(ii) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_40">Section  195</a> Cr.P.C.  The 
appellants place reliance on the following observations made in para 10 of 
the report in <a href="/doc/466182/" id="a_41">Surjit Singh vs. Balbir Singh</a> : 
</p>
<p id="p_15">	"It would thus be clear that for taking cognizance of an 
offence, the document, the foundation of forgery, if 
produced before the court or given in evidence, the bar of 
taking cognizance under <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_42">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> gets 
attracted and the criminal court is prohibited from taking 
cognizance of offence unless a complaint in writing is 
filed as per the procedure prescribed under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_43">Section 340</a> 
of the Code by or on behalf of the Court.   The object 
thereby is to preserve purity of the administration of 
justice and to allow the parties to adduce evidence in 
proof of certain documents without being compelled or 
intimidated to proceed with the judicial process.   The bar 
of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_44">Section 195</a> is to take cognizance of the offence 
covered thereunder." 
</p>			

<p id="p_16">to contend that once the document is produced or given in evidence in Court, 
the taking of cognizance on the basis of private complaint is completely  
barred.   
</p>
<p id="p_17">	In Sachida Nand Singh after analysis of the relevant provisions and 
noticing a number of earlier decisions (but not Surjit Singh), the Court 
recorded its conclusions in paragraphs 11, 12 and 23 which are being 
reproduced below : 
</p>
<p id="p_18">"11.	The scope of the preliminary enquiry envisaged in 
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_45">Section 340(1)</a> of the Code is to ascertain whether any 
offence affecting administration of justice has been 
committed in respect of a document produced in court or 
given in evidence in a proceeding in that Court.  In other 
words, the offence should have been committed during 
the time when the document was in custodia legis.
</p>
<p id="p_19">12.	It would be a strained thinking that any offence 
involving forgery of a document if committed far outside 
the precincts of the Court and long before its production 
in the Court, could also be treated as one affecting 
administration of justice merely because that document 
later reached the court records. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">23.	The sequitur of the above discussion is that the bar 
contained in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_46">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Code is not 
applicable to a case where forgery of the document was 
committed before the document was produced in a 
court."   
</p>

<p id="p_21">6.	On a plain reading clause (b)(ii) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_47">Section  195</a> is 
capable of two interpretations.  One possible interpretation is that when an 
offence described in <a href="/doc/1328629/" id="a_48">Section 463</a> or punishable under <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_49">Section  471</a>, <a href="/doc/118906/" id="a_50">Section 
475</a> or <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_51">Section  476</a> IPC is alleged to have been committed in respect of a 
document which is subsequently produced or given in evidence in a 
proceeding in any Court, a complaint by the Court would be necessary.   The 
other possible interpretation is that when a document has been produced or 
given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court and thereafter an offence 
described as aforesaid is committed in respect thereof, a complaint by the 
Court would be necessary.   On this interpretation if the offence as described 
in the Section  is committed prior to production or giving in evidence of the 
document in Court, no complaint by Court would be necessary and a private 
complaint would be maintainable. The question which requires consideration 
is which of the two interpretations should be accepted having regard to the 
scheme of the Act and object sought to be achieved. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">7.	Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel for the appellants, submitted 
that the purpose of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_52">Section  195</a> is to bar private prosecution where the cause 
of justice is sought to be perverted leaving it to the Court itself to uphold its 
dignity and prestige.  If a very restricted interpretation is given to <a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_53">Section 
195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C., as held in Sachida Nand Singh, the protection 
afforded by the provision will be virtually reduced to a vanishing point, 
defeating the very object of the enactment.  The provision, it is urged,  does 
not completely bar the prosecution of a person who has committed an 
offence of the type described thereunder, but introduces a safeguard in the 
sense that he can be so prosecuted only on the complaint of the Court where 
the document has been produced or given in evidence or of some other Court 
to which that Court is subordinate.  Learned counsel has also submitted that 
being a penal provision, giving a restricted meaning as held in Sachida 
Nand Singh, would not be proper as a person accused of having committed 
an offence would be deprived of the protection given to him by the 
legislature.  He has also submitted that on the aforesaid view there is a 
possibility of conflicting findings being recorded by the civil or revenue 
Court where the document has been produced or given in evidence and that 
recorded by the criminal Court on the basis of private complaint and 
therefore an effort should be made to interpret the Section  in the manner 
which avoids such a possibility.
</p>
<p id="p_23">8.	Shri Y.P. Narula, learned counsel for the respondents has submitted 
that the language of the Section  is clear and there being no ambiguity 
therein, the only possible manner in which it can be interpreted is that the 
complaint by a Court would be necessary when the offences enumerated in 
the Section  are committed at a time when the document has already been 
produced or given in evidence in Court i.e. when it is in the proceedings of 
the Court.  The provision has to be strictly construed as it creates a bar on 
the power of the Court to take cognizance of an offence and any provision 
which ousts the jurisdiction of the Court, which it otherwise possesses, must 
be strictly construed and cannot be given an enlarged meaning.  Since the 
provision deprives a person who is a victim and is aggrieved by the offences 
described under <a href="/doc/1328629/" id="a_54">Section  463</a> or punishable under <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_55">Sections 471</a>, <a href="/doc/118906/" id="a_56">475</a> or 476 
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_57">IPC</a> to initiate a criminal prosecution by filing a complaint, his interest 
cannot be overlooked and therefore the provision should not be given an 
enlarged meaning, but only a restricted meaning should be given.   Learned 
counsel has also submitted that in certain situations where the forgery has 
been committed at any time prior to the production or giving in evidence of 
the document in Court, it may not at all be possible for such Court to 
effectively form an opinion as to whether it is expedient to file a complaint 
and that may facilitate the escape of a guilty person.  Shri Narula has also 
submitted that in Sachida Nand Singh, the Court has reiterated and has 
adopted the same view which has been taken in several earlier decisions of 
this Court, and only in Surjit Singh a discordant note has been struck which 
is not correct.
</p>
<p id="p_24">9.	The scheme of the statutory provision may now be examined. 
Broadly, <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_58">Section  195</a> Cr.P.C. deals with three distinct categories of offences  
which have been described in clauses (a),  (b)(i) and (b)(ii) and they relate to 
(1) contempt of lawful authority of public servants, (2) offences against 
public justice, and (3) offences relating to documents given in evidence.  
Clause (a) deals with offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_59">Sections 172</a> to <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_60">188</a> IPC 
which occur in Chapter X of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_61">IPC</a> and the heading of the Chapter is  'Of 
Contempts Of The Lawful Authority Of Public Servants'.  These are 
offences which directly affect the functioning of or discharge of lawful 
duties of a public servant.  Clause (b)(i) refers to offences in Chapter XI of 
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62">IPC</a> which is headed as  'Of False Evidence And Offences Against Public 
Justice'.  The offences mentioned in this clause clearly relate to giving or 
fabricating false evidence or making a false declaration in any judicial 
proceeding or before a Court of justice or before a public servant who is 
bound or authorized by law to receive such declaration, and also to some 
other offences which have a direct co-relation with the proceedings in a 
Court of justice (<a href="/doc/1346193/" id="a_63">Sections 205</a> and <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_64">211</a> IPC).  This being the scheme of two 
provisions or clauses of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_65">Section  195</a>, viz., that the offence should be such 
which has direct bearing or affects the functioning or discharge of lawful 
duties of a public servant or has a direct correlation with the proceedings in a 
court of justice, the expression "when such offence is alleged to have been 
committed in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in a 
proceeding in a Court" occurring in clause (b)(ii) should normally mean 
commission of such an offence after the document has actually been 
produced  or given in evidence in the Court. The situation or contingency 
where an offence as enumerated in this clause has already been committed 
earlier and later on the document is produced or is given in evidence in 
Court, does not appear to be in tune with clauses (a)(i) and (b)(i) and 
consequently with the scheme of <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_66">Section  195</a> Cr.P.C.  This indicates that 
clause (b)(ii) contemplates a situation where the offences enumerated therein 
are committed with respect to a document subsequent to its production or 
giving in evidence in a proceeding in any Court.
</p>
<p id="p_25">10.	<a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_67">Section 195(1)</a> mandates a complaint in writing of the Court for 
taking cognizance of the offences enumerated in clauses (b) (i) and (b)(ii) 
thereof.   <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_68">Sections 340</a> and <a href="/doc/661069/" id="a_69">341</a> Cr.P.C. which occur in Chapter XXVI give 
the procedure for filing of the complaint and other matters connected 
therewith.  The heading of this Chapter is --'Provisions As To Offences 
Affecting The Administration Of Justice'.  Though, as a general rule, the 
language employed in a heading cannot be used to give a different effect to 
clear words of the Section  where there cannot be any doubt as to their 
ordinary meaning, but they are not to be treated as if they were marginal 
notes or were introduced into the Act merely for the purpose of classifying 
the enactments.  They constitute an important part  of the Act itself, and may 
be read not only as explaining the Sections which immediately follow them, 
as a preamble to a statute may be looked to explain its enactments, but as 
affording a better key to the constructions of the Sections which follow them 
than might be afforded by a mere preamble.(See Craies on Statute Law, 7th 
Ed. Pages 207, 209).   The fact that the procedure for filing a complaint by 
Court has been provided in Chapter XXVI dealing with offences affecting 
administration of justice, is a clear pointer of the legislative intent that the 
offence committed should be of such type which directly affects the 
administration of justice, viz., which is committed after the document is 
produced or given in evidence in Court.  Any offence committed with 
respect to a document at a time prior to its production or giving in evidence 
in Court cannot, strictly speaking, be said to be an offence affecting the 
administration of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_26">11.	It will be useful to refer to some earlier decisions touching the 
controversy in dispute which were rendered on <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_70">Section  195</a> of Code of 
Criminal Procedure 1908 (for short 'old Code').  Sub-section (1) (c) of 
Section 195 of Old Code read as under:
</p>
<p id="p_27">"<a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_71">Section 195</a>   
		
		(1)  	No Court shall take cognizance -
</p>			
<p id="p_28">(c) Prosecution for certain offences relating to 
documents given in evidence. --  of any offence 
described in <a href="/doc/1328629/" id="a_72">Section 463</a> or punishable under <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_73">Section 
471</a>, <a href="/doc/118906/" id="a_74">Section 475</a> or <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_75">Section 476</a> of the same Code, when 
such offence is alleged to have been committed by a 
party to any proceeding in any Court in respect of a 
document produced or given in evidence in such 
proceeding, except on the complaint in writing of such 
Court, or of some other Court to which such Court is 
subordinate"   
</p>      

<p id="p_29">It may be noticed that language used in <a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_76">Section  195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C. 
is similar to the above provision except that the words "by a party to any 
proceeding in any Court" occurring therein have been omitted.  We will 
advert to the effect of this omission later on.
</p>
<p id="p_30">12.	A Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in <a href="/doc/236931/" id="a_77">Emperor vs. Kushal Pal 
Singh</a>  AIR 1931 All 443 considered the scope of the aforesaid provision and 
held, that clause (c) of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_78">Section 195</a> applies only to cases where an offence is 
committed by a party, as such, to a proceeding to any Court in respect of a 
document which has been produced or given in evidence  in such 
proceeding. It was held that an offence which has already been committed 
by a person who does not become a party till, say, 30 years after the 
commission of the offence,  cannot be said to have been committed by a 
party within the meaning of clause (c).   A three Judge Bench of this Court 
in Patel Lalji Bhai Somabhai vs. The State of Gujarat  1971(2) SCC 376 
after examination of the controversy in considerable detail observed that as a 
general rule the Courts consider it expedient in the interest of justice to start 
prosecutions as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_79">Section  476</a>  (of the old Code which now 
corresponds to <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_80">Section  340</a> Cr.P.C.) only if there is a reasonable foundation 
for the charge and there is a reasonable likelihood of conviction. The 
requirement of a finding as to the expediency is understandable in case of an 
offence alleged to have been committed either in or in relation to a 
proceeding in that Court in case of offences specified in clause (b) [of the 
old Code corresponding to clause (b)(i) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_81">Cr.P.C</a>.] because of the close nexus 
between the offence and the proceeding.  In case of offences specified in 
clause (c)   they are required to be committed by a party to a proceeding in 
that Court with respect to a document produced or given in evidence in that 
Court.  The Court approved the view taken by Allahabad High Court in 
<a href="/doc/236931/" id="a_82">Emperor vs. Kushal Pal Singh</a> (supra) and held as under in para 7 of the 
report :
</p>
<p id="p_31">"(i)  The underlying purpose of enacting <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_83">Section 
195(1)(b)</a> and (c) <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_84">Section 476</a> seems to be to control the 
temptation on the part of the private parties to start 
criminal prosecution on frivolous vexations or 
unsufficient grounds inspired by a revengeful desire to 
harass or spite their opponents.  These offences have 
been selected for the court's control because of their 
direct impact on the judicial process.  It is the judicial 
process or the administration of public justice which is 
the direct and immediate object or the victim of these 
offences.  As the purity of the proceedings of the court is 
directly sullied by the crime, the court is considered to be 
the only party entitled to consider the desirability of 
complaining against the guilty party.  The private party 
who might ultimately suffer can persuade the Civil Court 
to file complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_32">(ii)  the offences about which the court alone is clothed 
with the right to complain may, therefore, be 
appropriately considered  to be only those offences 
committed by a party to a proceeding in that court, the 
commission of which has a reasonably close nexus with 
the proceeding in that court so that it can without 
embarking upon a completely independent and fresh 
inquiry, satisfactorily consider by reference principally to 
its records the expediency of prosecuting the delinquent 
party.  It, therefore, appears to be more appropriate to 
adopt the strict construction of confirming the prohibition 
contained in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_85">Section 195(1)(c)</a> only to those cases in 
which the offences specified therein were committed by a 
party to the proceeding in character as such party.  The 
Legislature could not have intended to extend the 
prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_86">Section 195(1)(c)</a> to the offences 
mentioned therein, when committed by a party to a 
proceeding in that court prior to his becoming such 
party.".     
</p>

<p id="p_33">The court clearly rejected any construction being placed on the 
provision by which a document forged before the commencement of the 
proceeding in which it may happen to be used in evidence later on, to come 
within the purview of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_87">Section  195</a>, as that would unreasonably restrict the 
right to initiate prosecution possessed by a person and recognized by <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_88">Section  
190</a> Cr.P.C. 
</p>

<p id="p_34">13.	The aforesaid decision was considered in <a href="/doc/304146/" id="a_89">Raghunath vs. State of U.P</a>. 
1973(1) SCC 564.  Here, the accused had obtained sale deed of the property 
of a widow by setting up of an imposter and thereafter filed a mutation  
application before the Tehsildar  The widow contested the mutation 
application on the ground that she had never executed the sale deed and 
thereafter filed a criminal complaint under <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_90">Sections 465</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_91">468</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_92">471</a> IPC in 
which the accused were convicted.  In appeal, it was contended that the 
private complaint was barred by virtue of <a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_93">Section  195(1)(c)</a> Cr.P.C. and the 
revenue court alone could have filed the complaint.  The court repelled the 
aforesaid contention after relying upon the ratio of Patel Lalji Bhai vs. State 
of Gujarat and the private complaint was held to be maintainable.  <a href="/doc/1301049/" id="a_94">In Mohan 
Lal  vs. State of Rajasthan</a> 1974(3) SCC 628, the above noted two decisions 
were relied upon for holding that provisions of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_95">Section  195(1)(c)</a> (old Code) 
would not be applicable where mutation proceedings were commenced after 
a will had been forged.  <a href="/doc/413624/" id="a_96">In Legal Remembrancer, Govt. of West Bengal vs. 
Haridas Mundra</a>  1976(1) SCC 555 Bhagwati, J. (as His Lordship then was),  
speaking  for a three Judge Bench observed that earlier there was divergence 
of opinion in various High Courts, but the same was set at rest by this Court 
in Patel Lalji Bhai Somabhai (supra) and approved the view taken therein 
that the words of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_97">Section  195(1)(c)</a> clearly meant the offence alleged to 
have been committed by a party to the proceeding in his character as such 
party, i.e. after having become a party to the proceeding, and <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_98">Sections 
195(1)(c)</a>, <a href="/doc/1666702/" id="a_99">476</a> and <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_100">476-A</a> (of the old Code) read together indicated beyond 
doubt that the legislature could not have intended to extend the prohibition 
contained in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_101">Section  195(1)(c)</a> to the offences mentioned in the said Section  
when committed by a party to a proceeding prior to his becoming such party. 
Similar view has been taken in  <a href="/doc/993255/" id="a_102">Mahadev Bapuji Mahajan vs. State of 
Maharashtra</a> 1994(3) Supp SCC 748 where the contention that the absence 
of a complaint by the revenue court was a bar to taking cognizance by the 
criminal court in respect of offences under <a href="/doc/367467/" id="a_103">Sections 446</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_104">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_105">471</a> read with 
<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_106">Section  120-B</a> IPC which were committed even before the start of the 
proceedings before the revenue court, was not accepted. 
</p>
<p id="p_35">14.	Dr. Singhvi, learned senior counsel for the appellants, in support of 
his contention has placed strong reliance on <a href="/doc/942570/" id="a_107">Gopalkrishna Menon vs. D. 
Raja Reddy</a> 1983 (4) SCC 240  which is a decision rendered by a Bench of 
two learned Judges.  In this case, the appellants filed a civil suit for refund of 
Rs.20,000/- which they claimed to have deposited with the first respondent 
and for recovery of certain amount. Along with the plaint the appellants 
produced a receipt for Rs.20,000/- in support of their claim.  Thereafter the 
first respondent filed a criminal complaint against the appellants alleging 
forgery of his signature on the money receipt and thereby commission of 
offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_108">Sections 467</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_109">471</a> IPC. The appellants moved 
the High Court for quashing of the proceedings on the ground that in 
absence of a complaint by the court, the prosecution was barred under 
<a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_110">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C.  The High Court dismissed the petition holding 
that <a href="/doc/1328629/" id="a_111">Section 463</a> cannot be construed to include <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_112">Section 467</a> IPC as well and, 
therefore, the Magistrate was competent to take cognizance on the 
complaint.  This Court reversed the view taken by the High Court observing 
that as <a href="/doc/1328629/" id="a_113">Section  463</a> defines the offence of forgery and <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_114">Section  467</a> punishes 
forgery of a particular category, <a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_115">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C. would be 
attracted  and in the absence of a complaint by the Court the prosecution 
would not be maintainable.   After briefly referring to Patel Lalji Bhai 
(supra), the Court observed that "not the conclusion but the ratio" of the said 
case supported the view taken by it.  The judgment does not show that 
applicability of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_116">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> was examined with regard to the 
question as to whether the alleged forged receipt was prepared before or 
after commencement of the civil suit, nor any such principle has been laid 
down that the bar would operate even if the forgery was committed prior to 
commencement of the proceeding in the civil court.
</p>
<p id="p_36">15.	The other case which is the sheet-anchor of the argument of learned 
counsel for the appellants is <a href="/doc/466182/" id="a_117">Surjit Singh vs. Balbir Singh</a> 1996(3) SCC 
</p><p id="p_37">533.  The facts as stated in paras 1 &amp; 11 of the report show that a criminal 
complaint was filed by the respondent under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_118">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_119">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_120">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_121">471</a> 
read with 120-B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_122">IPC</a> alleging that the appellants had conspired and 
fabricated an agreement dated 26.7.1978 and had forged the signature of 
Smt. Dalip Kaur and on the basis thereof, they had made a claim to remain 
in possession of a house.  The Magistrate took cognizance of the  offence on 
27.9.1983.  The appellants thereafter filed a civil suit on 9.2.1984 wherein 
they produced the agreement.  It may be noticed that the cognizance by the 
criminal Court had been taken much before filing of the Civil Suit wherein 
the agreement had been filed.  During the course of discussion, the court not 
only noticed Gopalkrishna Menon  (supra), but also quoted extensively from 
Patel Lalji Bhai (supra).  Reference was then made to Sanmukh Singh vs. 
The King AIR 1950 Privy Council 31 and <a href="/doc/1100079/" id="a_123">Sushil Kumar vs.  State of 
Haryana</a>  AIR 1988 SC 419 wherein it has been held that the bar of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_124">Section  
195</a> would not apply if the original document had not been produced or 
given in evidence in Court.  Then comes the passage in the judgment (para 
10 of the reports) which we have reproduced in the earlier part of our 
judgment. The observations therein should not be understood as laying down 
anything contrary to what has been held in Patel Lalji Bhai, but was made in 
the context that bar contained in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_125">Section 195</a> (1)(b)(ii) would not be attracted 
unless the original document was filed.  It is for this reason that in the very 
next paragraph, after observing that the cognizance had been taken prior to 
filing of the civil suit and the original agreement in Court, the view taken by 
the High Court that the Magistrate could proceed with the trial of the 
criminal case was upheld and the appeal was dismissed. 
</p>
<p id="p_38">16.	As mentioned earlier, the words "by a party to any proceeding in any 
Court" occurring in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_126">Section  195</a> (1)(c) of the old Code have been omitted in 
<a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_127">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C. Why these words were deleted in the 
corresponding provision<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_128"> of Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 will be 
apparent from the 41st report of the Law Commission which said as under in 
para 15.39 :
</p><p id="p_39">"15.39   The purpose of the section is to bar private 
prosecutions where the course of justice is sought to be 
perverted leaving to the court itself to uphold its dignity 
and prestige.  On principle there is no reason why the 
safeguard in clause (c) should not apply to offences 
committed by witnesses also.  Witnesses need as much 
protection against vexatious prosecutions as parties and 
the court should have as much control over the acts of 
witnesses that enter as a component of a judicial 
proceeding, as over the acts of parties.   If, therefore, the 
provisions of clause (c) are extended to witnesses, the 
extension would be in conformity with the broad 
principle which forms the basis of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_129">Section 195</a>."
</p>

<p id="p_40">	Since the object of deletion of the words "by a party to any 
proceeding in any Court" occurring in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_130">Section 195(1)(c)</a> of the old Code is 
to afford protection to witnesses also, the interpretation placed on the said 
provision in the earlier decisions would still hold good. 
</p>
<p id="p_41">17.	<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_131">Section 190</a> Cr.P.C. provides that a Magistrate may take cognizance  
of any offence (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such 
offence, (b) upon a police report of such facts, and (c) upon information 
received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own 
knowledge, that such offence has been committed.  <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_132">Section 195</a> Cr.P.C. is a 
sort of exception to this general provision and creates an embargo  upon the 
power of the Court to take cognizance of certain types of offences 
enumerated therein. The procedure for filing a complaint by the Court as 
contemplated by <a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_133">Section 195(1)</a> Cr.P.C. is given in <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_134">Section 340</a> Cr.P.C. and 
sub-section (1) and (2) thereof are being reproduced below : 
</p>
<p id="p_42">340.	 Procedure  in  cases  mentioned  in  <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_135">Section  195</a>    - 
</p><p id="p_43">(1) When, upon an application made to it in this behalf or 
otherwise, any Court is of opinion that it is expedient in the 
interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into any 
offence referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_136">Section 
195</a>, which appears to have been committed in or in relation to 
a proceeding in that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a 
document produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in that 
Court, such Court may, after such preliminary inquiry, if any, 
as it thinks necessary, - 
</p>
<p id="p_44">(a)	record a finding to that effect;
</p><p id="p_45">(b)	make a complaint thereof in writing;
</p><p id="p_46">(c)	send it to a Magistrate of the first class having 
jurisdiction;
</p>
<p id="p_47">(d)	take sufficient security for the appearance of the accused 
before such Magistrate, or if the alleged offence is non-
bailable and the Court thinks it necessary so to do, send 
the accused in custody to such Magistrate; and 

</p><p id="p_48">(e)	bind over any person to appear and give evidence before 
such Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_49">(2)	The power conferred on a Court by sub-section (1) in 
respect of an offence may, in any case where that Court has 
neither made a complaint under sub-section (1) in respect of 
that offence nor rejected an application for the making of such 
complaint, be exercised by the Court to which such former 
Court is subordinate within the meaning of sub-section (4) of 
<a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_137">Section 195</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_50">	<a href="/doc/661069/" id="a_138">Section 341</a> Cr.P.C. provides for an appeal to the Court to which such 
former Court is subordinate within the meaning of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_139">Section  
195</a>, against the order refusing to make a complaint or against an order 
directing filing of a complaint and in such appeal the superior Court may 
direct withdrawal of the complaint or making of the complaint.   Sub-section 
(2) of <a href="/doc/589866/" id="a_140">Section 343</a> lays down that when it is brought to the notice of a 
Magistrate to whom a complaint has been made under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_141">Section  340</a> or 341 
that an appeal is pending against the decision arrived at in the judicial 
proceeding out of which the matter has arisen, he may, if he thinks fit, at any 
stage, adjourn the hearing of the case until such appeal is decided.  
</p>
<p id="p_51">18.	In view of the language used in <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_142">Section 340</a> Cr.P.C. the Court is not 
bound to make a complaint regarding commission of an offence referred to 
in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_143">Section 195(1)(b)</a>, as the Section  is conditioned by the words "Court is of 
opinion that it is expedient in the interest of justice."  This shows that such a 
course will be adopted only if the interest of justice requires and not in every 
case.  Before filing of the complaint, the Court may hold a preliminary 
enquiry and record a finding to the effect that it is expedient in the interests 
of justice that enquiry should be made into any of the offences referred to in 
<a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_144">Section 195(i)(b)</a>.  This expediency will normally be judged by the Court by 
weighing not the magnitude of injury suffered by the person affected by 
such forgery or forged document, but having regard to the effect or impact, 
such commission of offence has upon administration of justice.  It is possible 
that such forged document or forgery may cause a very serious or substantial 
injury to a person in the sense that it may deprive him of a very valuable 
property or status or the like, but such document may be just a piece of 
evidence produced or given in evidence in Court, where voluminous 
evidence may have been adduced and the effect of such piece of evidence on 
the broad concept of administration of justice may be minimal.  In such 
circumstances, the Court may not consider it expedient in the interest of 
justice to make a complaint.  The broad view of clause (b)(ii), as canvassed 
by learned counsel for the appellants, would render the victim of such 
forgery or forged document remedyless.  Any interpretation which leads to a 
situation where a victim of a crime is rendered remedyless, has to be 
discarded.
</p>
<p id="p_52">19.	There is another consideration which has to be kept in mind.  Sub-
section (1) of <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_145">Section 340</a> Cr.P.C. contemplates holding of a preliminary 
enquiry.  Normally, a direction for filing of a complaint is not made during 
the pendency of the proceeding before the Court and this is done at the stage 
when the proceeding is concluded and the final judgment is rendered.  
<a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_146">Section 341</a> provides for an appeal against an order directing filing of the 
complaint.  The hearing and ultimate decision of the appeal is bound to take 
time.  <a href="/doc/589866/" id="a_147">Section 343(2)</a> confers a discretion upon a Court trying the complaint 
to adjourn the hearing of the case if it is brought to its notice that an appeal 
is pending against the decision arrived at in the judicial proceeding out of 
which the matter has arisen.  In view of these provisions, the complaint case 
may not proceed at all for decades specially in matters arising out of civil 
suits  where decisions are challenged in successive appellate fora which are 
time consuming.  It is also to be noticed that there is no provision of appeal 
against an order passed under <a href="/doc/589866/" id="a_148">Section 343(2)</a>, whereby hearing of the case is 
adjourned until the decision of the appeal.  These provisions show that, in 
reality, the procedure prescribed for filing a complaint by the Court is such 
that it may not fructify in the actual trial of the offender for an unusually 
long period.   Delay in prosecution of a guilty person comes to his advantage 
as witnesses become reluctant to give evidence and the evidence gets lost.  
This important consideration dissuades us from accepting the broad 
interpretation sought to be placed upon clause (b)(ii).    
</p>
<p id="p_53">20.	An enlarged interpretation to <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_149">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a>, whereby the bar 
created by the said provision would also operate where after commission of 
an act of forgery the document is subsequently produced in Court, is capable 
of great misuse.  As pointed out in Sachida Nand Singh, after preparing a 
forged document or committing an act of forgery, a person may manage to 
get a proceeding instituted in any civil, criminal or revenue court, either by 
himself or through someone set up by him and simply file the document in 
the said proceeding.  He would thus be protected from prosecution, either at 
the instance of a private party or the police until the Court, where the 
document has been filed, itself chooses to file a complaint.  The litigation 
may be a prolonged one due to which the actual trial of such a person may 
be delayed indefinitely.  Such an interpretation would he highly detrimental 
to the interest of society at large.  
</p>
<p id="p_54">21.	Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that the Courts are normally  
reluctant to direct filing of a criminal complaint and such a course is rarely 
adopted.   It will not be fair and proper to give an interpretation which leads 
to a situation where a person alleged to have committed an offence of the 
type enumerated in clause (b)(ii) is either not placed for trial on account of 
non-filing of a complaint or if a complaint is filed, the same does not come 
to its logical end.  Judging from such an angle will be in consonance with 
the principle that an unworkable or impracticable result should be avoided.  
In Statutory Interpretation by Francis Bennion (Third ed.) para 313, the 
principle has been stated in the following manner :
</p>
<p id="p_55">"The court seeks to avoid a construction of an enactment 
that produces an unworkable or impracticable result, 
since this is unlikely to have been intended by 
Parliament.  Sometimes however, there are overriding 
reasons for applying such a construction, for example 
where it appears that Parliament really intended it or the 
literal meaning is too strong."
</p>

<p id="p_56">	The learned author has referred to Sheffield City Council v. Yorkshire 
Water Services Ltd. (1991) 1 WLR 58 at 71, where it was held as under :
</p>
<p id="p_57">"Parliament is taken not to intend the carrying out of its 
enactments to be unworkable or impracticable, so the 
court will be slow to find in favour of a construction that 
leads to these consequences.   This follows the path taken 
by judges in developing the common law. ' the 
common law of England has not always developed on 
strictly logical lines, and where the logic leads down a 
path that is beset with practical difficulties the courts 
have not been frightened to turn aside and seek the 
pragmatic solution that will best serve the needs of 
society."
</p>

<p id="p_58">	<a href="/doc/1410968/" id="a_150">In S.J. Grange Ltd. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners</a> (1979) 2 
All ER 91, while interpreting a provision in the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_151">Finance Act</a> , 1972, Lord 
Denning observed that if the literal construction leads to impracticable 
results, it would be necessary to do little adjustment so as to make the 
section workable. Therefore, in order that a victim of a crime of forgery, 
namely, the person aggrieved is able to exercise his right conferred by law to 
initiate prosecution of the offender, it is necessary to place a restrictive 
interpretation on clause (b)(ii). 
</p>
<p id="p_59">22.	Dr. Singhvi has also urged that since we are dealing with a penal 
provision it should be strictly construed and in support of his proposition he 
has placed reliance upon a Constitution Bench decision in <a href="/doc/1014504/" id="a_152">Tolaram Relumal 
vs. State of Bombay</a>, 1955(1) SCR 158, wherein it was  held that it is well 
settled rule of construction of penal statutes that if two possible and 
reasonable constructions can be put upon a penal provision, the Court must 
lean towards that construction which exempts the subject from penalty rather 
than the one which imposes penalty and it is not competent for the Court to 
stretch out the meaning of expression used by the legislature in order to 
carry out the intention of the legislature.  The contention is that since <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_153">Section  
195(1)(b)(ii)</a> affords protection from private prosecution, it should not be 
given a restrictive interpretation to curtail its scope.   We are unable to 
accept such broad proposition as has been sought to be urged.  In Craies on 
Statute Law (1971 ed.  Chapter 21), the principle regarding penal 
provisions has been stated as under :
</p>
<p id="p_60">"But penal statutes must never be construed so as to 
narrow the words of the statute to the exclusion of cases 
which those words in their ordinary acceptations would 
comprehend. . But where the thing is brought 
within the words and within the spirit, there a penal 
enactment is to be construed, like any other instrument, 
according to the fair commonsense meaning of the 
language used, and the court is not to find or make any 
doubt or ambiguity in the language of a penal statute, 
where such doubt or ambiguity would clearly not be 
found or made in the same language in any other 
instrument."
</p>

<p id="p_61">	<a href="/doc/819416/" id="a_154">In Lalita Jalan vs. Bombay Gas Co</a>. 2003 (6) SCC 107 this question 
was examined in considerable detail and it was held that the principle that a 
statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty is to be strictly construed is 
not of universal application which must necessarily be observed in every 
case.  The Court after referring to Murlidhar Meghraj Loya vs. State of 
Maharasthra AIR 1976 SC 1929, <a href="/doc/1508633/" id="a_155">Kisan Trimbak Kothula vs. State of 
Maharashtra</a> AIR 1977 SC 435, <a href="/doc/1034761/" id="a_156">Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal 
Affairs to Govt. of West Bengal vs. Abani Maity</a> AIR 1979 SC 1029 and 
<a href="/doc/6596/" id="a_157">State of Maharashtra vs. Natwarlal Damodardas Soni</a> AIR 1980 SC 593 held 
that the penal provisions should be construed in a manner which will 
suppress the mischief and advance the object which the legislature had in 
view.
</p>
<p id="p_62">23.	That apart, the section which we are required to interpret is not a penal 
provision but is part of a procedural law, namely, Code of Criminal 
Procedure which elaborately gives the procedure for trial of criminal cases.   
The provision only creates a bar against taking cognizance of an offence in 
certain specified situations except upon complaint by Court. A penal statute 
is one upon which an action for penalties can be brought by a public officer 
or by a person aggrieved and a penal act in its wider sense includes every 
statute creating an offence against the State, whatever is the character of the 
penalty for the offence.   The principle that a penal statute should be strictly 
construed, as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants can, 
therefore, have no application here.   
</p>
<p id="p_63">24.	Coming to the last contention that an effort should be made to avoid 
conflict of findings between the civil and criminal Courts, it is necessary to 
point out that the standard of proof required in the two proceedings are 
entirely different.  Civil cases are decided on the basis of preponderance of 
evidence while in a criminal case the entire burden lies on the prosecution 
and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given.  There is neither any 
statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one 
proceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both the cases 
have to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced therein.  While 
examining a similar contention in an appeal against an order directing filing 
of a complaint under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_158">Section 476</a> of old Code, the following observations 
made by a Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/500548/" id="a_159">M.S. Sheriff vs. State of Madras</a> AIR 1954 
SC 397 give a complete answer to the problem posed :
</p><p id="p_64">"(15)	As between the civil and the criminal proceedings 
we are of the opinion that the criminal matters should be 
given precedence.  There is some difference of opinion in 
the High Courts of India on this point.  No hard and fast 
rule can be laid down but we do not consider that the 
possibility of conflicting decisions in the civil and 
criminal Courts is a relevant consideration.  The law 
envisages such an eventuality when it expressly refrains 
from making the decision of one Court binding on the 
other, or even relevant, except for certain limited 
purposes, such as sentence or damages.  The only 
relevant consideration here is the likelihood of 
embarrassment.
</p>
<p id="p_65">(16)	Another factor which weighs with us is that a civil 
suit often drags on for years and it is undesirable that a 
criminal prosecution should wait till everybody 
concerned has forgotten all about the crime.  The public 
interests demand that criminal justice should be swift and 
sure; that the guilty should be punished while the events 
are still fresh in the public mind and that the innocent 
should be absolved as early as is consistent with a fair 
and impartial trial.  Another reason is that it is 
undesirable to let things slide till memories have grown 
too dim to trust. 
</p>
<p id="p_66">This, however, is not a hard and fast rule.  Special 
considerations obtaining in any particular case might 
make some other course more expedient and just.  For 
example, the civil case or the other criminal proceeding 
may be so near its end as to make it inexpedient to stay it 
in order to give precedence to a prosecution ordered 
under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_160"> S. 476</a>.  But in this case we are of the view that the 
civil suits should be stayed till the criminal proceedings 
have finished." 
</p>

<p id="p_67">25.	In view of the discussion made above, we are of the opinion that  
Sachida Nand Singh has been correctly decided and the view taken therein 
is the correct view.  <a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_161">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C. would be attracted only 
when the offences enumerated in the said provision have been committed 
with respect to a document after it has been produced or given in evidence in 
a proceeding in any Court i.e. during the time when the document was in 
custodia legis. 
</p>
<p id="p_68">26.	In the present case, the will has been produced in the Court 
subsequently.  It is nobody's case that any offence as enumerated in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_162">Section  
195(b)(ii)</a> was committed in respect to the said will after it had been 
produced or filed in the Court of District Judge.  Therefore, the bar created 
by <a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_163">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C. would not come into play and there is no 
embargo on the power of the Court to take cognizance of the offence on the 
basis of the complaint filed by the respondents.   The view taken by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court is perfectly correct 
and calls for no interference. 
</p>
<p id="p_69">27.	The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.  
</p><p id="p_70">Criminal Appeal No. 904/1998


</p><p id="p_71">28.   This appeal has been preferred by the complainant against the judgment 
and order dated 6.2.1998 of the Madras High Court by which the criminal 
revision petition preferred by the second respondent Ramaraj was allowed 
and he was acquitted of the charges under <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_164">Section 467</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_165">471</a> IPC on the 
ground that in view of the bar created by <a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_166">Section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> Cr.P.C., the 
learned Magistrate could not have taken cognizance on the police report.   
According to the case of the prosecution, the sale deed had been forged 
earlier and thereafter the same was filed in the Civil Court.   For the reasons 
already discussed, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court 
is set aside.   The criminal revision petition filed by the second respondent 
shall be heard and decided by the High Court afresh and in accordance with 
law.
</p>

<p id="p_72">Criminal Appeal Nos. 1069-1070 of  1998

</p><p id="p_73">30.	The High Court in the impugned order dismissed the petition filed by 
the appellant under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_167">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. relying upon the decision of this 
Court in Sachida Nand Singh.   In view of the reasons already discussed, 
the appeals lack merit and are hereby dismissed.
