HEADNOTE:
By sub-sec. (1) of<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_7"> s. 164</a> of the Code of Criminal  Procedure
it   was   provided,   "Any   Presidency   Magistrate,	 any
Magistrate  of	the first class and any	 Magistrate  of	 the
second	class  specially empowered in this behalf  by  State
Government  may, if he is not a police -officer	 record	 any
statement  or  confession made to him in the  course  of  an
investigation under this Chapter or under any other law	 for
the time being in force or at any time afterwards before the
commencement  of  the inquiry or trial." In a case  where  a
confession had been recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_8"> s. 164(1)</a> by a Magistrate
of the second class not specially empowered,
Held,  the confession had not been recorded under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_9"> s. 164</a>  of
the  Code and the record could not be put in evidence  under
ss. 74 and 80 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_10">Evidence Act</a> to prove confession.
Oral evidence of the Magistrate to prove the confession	 was
not admissible.	 If a statute has conferred a power to do an
act and had laid down the method in which that power has  to
be exercised, it accessorily prohibits the doing of the	 act
in any other manner than that which has been prescribed.

A Magistrate recording a confession under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_11"> s. 164</a> of the Code
is  bound to follow the procedure laid down in it.   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Section
533</a> of the Code does not show that the procedure  prescribed
by <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_13"> s. 164</a> of the Code was not mandatory.  The object of <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_14"> s.
164</a>  of	 the  Code  was not  to	 give  the  prosecution	 the
advantage  of<a href="/doc/1227984/" id="a_15"> ss. 74</a> and <a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_16">80</a> of the Evidence Act so that	 the
only result of the disregard of these pre-provisions was  to
deprive the prosecution of that advantage.  Nazir Ahmed case
was rightly decided.

August 16, 1963.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
SARKAR	J.--On	March 20, 1959, Raja Ram, a  shopkeeper,  of
Afzalgarh  in  the State of Uttar Pradesh  was	murdered  by
gunshot	 in  his shop.	Seven persons  including  the  three
respondents,  Singhara Singh, Bir Singh and Tega Singh	were
prosecuted for this murder.  The learned Additional Sessions
judge  of Bijnor before whom the trial was  held,  convicted
the respondent Singhara Singh of the murder under<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_23"> S. 302</a>  of
the  Indian  Penal  Code and sentenced	him  to	 death.	  He
convicted  the	respondents  Bir Singh	and  Tega  Singh  of
abetment of the murder under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_24"> S. 302</a> read with<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_25"> ss. 120B</a>,	 <a href="/doc/1630403/" id="a_26">109</a>
and  <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_27">114</a> of the said Code and sentenced Bir Singh  to  death
and  Tega Singh to imprisonment for life.  He acquitted	 the
other accused persons.
</p><p id="p_5">The  respondents  appealed from the conviction to  the	High
Court  at Allahabad and the State from the  acquittal.	 The
High  Court  had  also before it  the  usual  reference	 for
Confirmation  of  the sentences of death.   The	 High  Court
allowed the appeals of the respondents, dismissed the appeal
of the State and rejected the, reference.  The State has now
filed this appeal against the judgment of the High Court  by
special leave.	This Court however granted the leave
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">487</span>
only so far as the judgment of the High Court concerned	 the
three  respondents.  We are not, therefore,  concerned	with
the other accessed persons and the order acquitting them  is
no more in question.
</p><p id="p_6">The  only  point  argued  in  this  appeal  was	 as  to	 the
admissibility of certain oral evidence.	 It is conceded that
if that evidence was not admissible, then there is no  other
evidence  on  which the respondents can	 be  convicted.	  In
other words, it is not in dispute that if that evidence	 was
not  admissible	 the High Court's  decision  acquitting	 the
respondents  cannot  be	 questioned.  It  is  therefore	 not
necessary to state the facts in detail.
</p><p id="p_7">Now,  the  evidence with which this case  is  concerned	 was
given by a learned magistrate, Mr. Dixit, of confessions  of
guilt  made to him by the respondents and purported to	have
been  recorded by him under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_28"> s. 164</a> of the Code	of  Criminal
Procedure.   The  terms of that section	 and  certain  other

case depends, are as follows:

	      ernment  may,  if he is not  a  police-officer
	      record any statement or confession made to him
	      in  the course of an investigation under	this
	      Chapter  or under any other law for  the	time

</blockquote><p id="p_8">A confession duly recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_36"> s. 164</a> would no doubt be  a
public document under<a href="/doc/1227984/" id="a_37"> s. 74</a> of the Evidence Act which  would
prove  itself  under <a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_38"> s. 80</a> of that  Act.   Mr.	 Dixit,	 who
recorded  the  confession in this case was  a  second  class
magistrate  and the prosecution was unable to prove that  he
had  been  specially empowered by the  State  Government  to
record	a statement or confession under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_39"> s. 164</a> of the  Code.
The trial, therefore, proceeded on the basis that he had not
been so empowered.  That being so, it was rightly held	that
the  confessions had not been recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_40"> s. 164</a> and	 the
record	could not be put in evidence under<a href="/doc/1227984/" id="a_41"> ss. 74</a> and <a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_42">80</a>  of
the Evidence Act to prove them.	 The prosecution,  thereupon
called	Mr.  Dixit to prove these  confessions,	 the  record
being  used only to refresh his memory under<a href="/doc/1945359/" id="a_43"> s. 159</a>  of	 the
Evidence Act.  It is the admissibility of this oral evidence
that is in question.
</p><p id="p_9">The Judicial Committee in Nazir Ahmed v. The King Emperor(1)
held  that  when a magistrate of the first class  records  a
confession  under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_44"> s. 164</a> but does not follow  the  procedure
laid  down in that section, oral evidence of the  confession
is inadmissible.  Nazir Ahmed's(1) case natu-

rally  figured	largely in the arguments presented  to	this
Court  and the Courts below.  The learned trial	 Judge	fol-
lowing	Ashrafi	 v. The State(1) to which we  will  have  to
refer  latter,	held  that  Nazir  Ahmed's  case(2)  had  no
application where, as in the present case, a magistrate	 not
authorised to do so purports to record a confession under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_45"> s.
164</a>,  and  on that basis admitted the  oral  evidence.	 The
learned	 judges of the High Court observed that the  present
case  :was  governed  by  Nazir	 Ahmed's  case(2)  and	that
Askarfis  case(1) had no application because it dealt  "with
the question of identification parades held by	Magistrates,
There was no occasion to discuss the question of confessions
recorded before Magistrates." In this view of the matter the
learned	 judges	 of the High Court held	 the  oral  evidence
inadmissible  and acquitted the respondents.  It would	help
to clear the ground to state that it had not been argued  in
Nazir  Ahmed's	case(2)	 that<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_46"> s. 533</a> of	 the  Code  had	 any
operation  in  making any oral evidence admissible  and	 the
position  is  the same in the present case.  It	 would	not,
therefore, be necessary for us to consider whether that sec-
tion  had  any effect in this case in  making  any  evidence
admissible.
</p><p id="p_11">In  Nazir  Ahmed's case(2) the Judicial	 Committee  observed
that  the  principle  applied in Taylor v.  Taylor(3)  to  a
Court,	namely, that where a power is given to do a  certain
thing  in a certain way, the thing must be done in that	 way
or  not	 at all and that other methods	of  performance	 are
necessarily forbidden, applied to judicial officers making a
record	under <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_47"> s. 164</a> and, therefore, held  that  magistrate
could  not give oral evidence of the confession made to	 him
which  he had purported to record under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_48"> s. 164</a> of the  Code.
It  was	 said that otherwise all the precautions  and  safe-
guards laid down in<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_49"> ss. 164</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_50">364</a>, both of which had to be
read together, would become of such trifling value as to  be
almost idle and that "it would be an unnatural	construction
to  hold  that any other procedure was permitted  than	that
which  is  laid down with such minute particularity  in	 the
sections themselves."
</p><p id="p_12">The  rule adopted in Taylor v. Taylor(3) is well  recognised
and is founded on sound principle.  Its result is
(1)  I.L.R. [1960] 2 All. 488.
</p><p id="p_13">(2)  L.R. 63 IA. 372.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">491</span>
<p id="p_15">that if a statute has conferred a power to do an act and has
laid  down  the	 method	 in  which  that  power	 has  to  be
exercised,  it necessarily prohibits the doing of th act  in
any  other manner than that which has been prescribed.	 The
principle  behind the rule is that if this were not so,	 the
statutory provision might as well not have been enacted.   A
magistrate, therefore, cannot in the course of investigation
record	a  confession except in the manner laid down  in  s.
</p><p id="p_16">164.  The power to record the confession had obviously	been
given  so that the confession might be proved by the  record
of  it	made  in  the manner laid down.	  If  proof  of	 the
confession  by	other  means  was  permissible,	 the   whole
provision of<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_51"> s. 164</a> including the safeguards contained in it
for  the  protection of accused persons	 would	be  rendered
nugatory.    The  section,  therefore,	by   conferring	  on
magistrates  the power to record statements or	confessions,
by  necessary  implication,  prohibited	 a  magistrate	from
giving	oral evidence of the statements or confessions	made
to him.
</p><p id="p_17">Mr.  Aggarwala	does  not  question  the  validity  of	 the
principle  but says that Nazir Ahmed's case(1)	was  wrongly
decided	 as the principle was not applicable to	 its  facts.
He  put his challenge to the correctness of the decision  on
two  grounds, the first of which was that the principle	 ap-
plied  in Taylor v. Taylor(2) had no application  where	 the
statutory  provision conferring the power was not  mandatory
and  that  the provisions of<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_52"> s. 164</a> were  not  mandatory  as
would appear from the terms of<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_53"> s. 533</a>.
</p><p id="p_18">This contention seems to us to be without foundation.  Quite
clearly, the power conferred by<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_54"> s. 164</a> to record a statement
or  confession	is  not one which must	be  exercised.	 The
Judicial  Committee  expressly	said  so  in  Nazir  Ahmed's
case(3) and we did not understand Mr. Aggarwala to  question
this part of the judgment.  What he meant was that<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_55"> s. 533</a> of
the Code showed that in recording a statement or  confession
under <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_56"> s. 164</a>, it was not obligatory for the  magistrate  to
follow the procedure mentioned in it.  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_57">Section 533</a> says that
if  the court before which a statement or confession  of  an
accused person purporting to be recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_58"> s. 164</a> or <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_59"> s.
364</a>  is	 tendered,  in	evidence, "finds  that	any  of	 the

<p id="p_20">riot  been complied with by -the magistrate  recording	the'
statements  it	shall take evidence, that such	person	duly
made  the  statement recorded."	 Now a statement  would	 not
have been "duly made" unless the procedure for, make in	 it,
laid down in<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_60"> s. 164</a> had been followed. What<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_61"> s. 533</a> therefore
does  is to permit oral evidence to be given to	 prove	that
the procedure laid down in<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_62"> s. 164</a> had,in fact-been  followed
when the court finds that the record produced before it does
not show that was so. If the oral evidence establishes	that
the procedure had been followed, then only can the record be
admitted.   Therefore, far from showing that  the  procedure
laid down in<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_63"> s. 164</a> is not intended to be obligatory,<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_64"> s. 533</a>
really	emphasises that procedure has to be  followed.	 The
section	 only  permits	oral  evidence	to  prove  that	 the
procedure had actually been followed in certain cases  where
the record which ought to show that does not on the face  of
it do so.
</p><p id="p_21">The  second  ground on which Mr.  Aggarwala  challenged	 the
decision in Nazir Ahmed's case(1) was that the object of <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_65"> s.
164</a>  of the Code is to permit a record being kept so  as  to
take  advantage	 of<a href="/doc/1227984/" id="a_66"> ss. 74</a> and <a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_67">80</a> of the  Evidence  Act	 and
avoid the inconvenience of having to call the magistrate  to
whom the statement or confession bad been made, to prove it.
The  contention	 apparently  is that the  section  was	only
intended  to  confer  a	 benefit  on  the  prosecution	and,
therefore,   the  sole	effect	of  the	 disregard  of	 its
provisions  would  be  to deprive the  prosecution  of	that
benefit,  for  it cannot then rely on<a href="/doc/1227984/" id="a_68"> ss. 74</a> and <a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_69">80</a>  of	 the
Evidence  Act  and  has to prove  the  confession  by  other
evidence  including  the  oral evidence	 of  the  magistrate
recording  it.	It was, therefore, said that  the  principle
adopted	 in  Nazir  Ahmed's case(1) had	 no  application  in
interpreting<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_70"> s. 164</a>.
</p><p id="p_22">A similar argument was advanced in Nazir Ahmed's case(1) and
rejected  by the judicial Committee.  We respectfully  agree
with that view.	 The section gives power to make a record of
the  confession	 made  by an accused which may	be  used  in
evidence  against  him	and at the  same  time	it  provides
certain	 safeguards  for his protection by laying  down	 the
procedure subject to which alone the record may be made	 and
used in evidence.  The
(1) L.R. 631. 372.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">493</span>
<p id="p_23">record,	 if duly made, may no doubt be admitted in  evidence
without	 further  proof but if it had not been so  made	 and
other  evidence was admissible to prove that the  statements
recorded had been made, then the creation of the  safeguards
would  have been futile.  The safeguards were obviously	 not
created for nothing and it could not have been intended that
the  safeguards	 might at the will of  the  prosecution,  be
bypassed.   That is what would happen if oral  evidence	 was
admissible  to	prove a confession purported  to  have	been
recorded  under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_71"> s. 164</a>.	 Therefore it seems to us  that	 the
object	of <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_72"> s.	164</a>  was not to	 give  the  prosecution	 the
advantage  of <a href="/doc/1227984/" id="a_73"> ss.  74</a> and <a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_74">80</a> of the  Evidence	Act  but  to
provide for evidence being made available to the prosecution
subject to due protection of the interest of the accused.
We have to point out that the correctness of the decision of
Nazir Ahmed's case(1) has been accepted by this Court in  at
least two cases, namely, <a href="/doc/1786180/" id="a_75">Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. The State
of   Vindhya   Pradesh</a>(2)  and	<a href="/doc/794815/" id="a_76">Deep  Chand  v.	  State	  of
Rajasthan</a>(3).	We have found no reason to take a  different
view.
</p><p id="p_24">Mr. Aggarwala then contended that Nazir Ahmed's case(1)	 was
distinguishable.   He  said  that  all	that  the   Judicial
Committee  decided  in	Nazir Ahmed's case  was	 that  if  a
Presidency Magistrate, a Magistrate of the first class or  a
Magistrate  of the second class specially empowered in	that
behalf	records a statement or confession under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_77"> s.  164</a>	 but
the  procedure	laid  down in it is not	 complied  with,  he
cannot	give  oral  evidence  to  prove	 the  statement	  or
confession.  According to Mr. Aggarwala, it does not  follow
from  that  decision that a Magistrate of a class  not	men-
tioned	in  the	 section, for example a	 magistrate  of	 the
second class not specially empowered by the State Government
cannot give oral evidence of a confession made to him  which
he had purported to record under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_78"> s. 164</a> of the Code.
It is true that the Judicial Committee did not have to	with
a  case	 like  the present one where a	magistrate  'of	 the
second	class  not  specially"empowered	 had  purported	 -to
record a confession under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_79"> s. 164</a>.  The principle applied
(1) L.R. 63 I.A. 372.	  (2)  [1954] S.C.R.  1098.
(3)  [1962] 1. S.C.R. 662.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">494</span>
<p id="p_25">in  that  decision  would however  equally  prevent  such  a
magistrate  from  giving oral evidence	of  the	 confession.
When a statute confers a power on certain judicial officers,
that  power  can  obviously  be	 exercised  only  by   those
officers.  No other officer can exercise that power, for  it
has not been given to him.  Now the power has been conferred
by <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_80"> s.	164</a>  on	 certain  magistrates  of  higher   classes.
Obviously,  it	was  not intended to  confer  the  power  on
magistrates  of	 lower	classes.  If,  therefore,  a  proper
construction  of <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_81"> s.  164</a>,  as	we  have  held,	 is  that  a
magistrate  of a higher class is prevented from giving	oral
evidence  of  a confession made to him because	thereby	 the
safeguards  created for the benefit of an accused person  by
s. 164 would be rendered nugatory, it would be an  unnatural
construction  of the section to hold that  these  safeguards
were  not thought necessary and could be ignored, where	 the
confession  had been made to a magistrate of a	lower  class
and that such a magistrate was, therefore, free to give oral
evidence  of the confession made to him.  We cannot  put  an
interpretation	on <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_82"> s. 164</a> which produces the  anomaly	that
while  it  is not possible for higher class  magistrates  to
practically  abrogate the safeguards created in<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_83"> s.  164</a>	 for
the benefit of an accused person it is open to a lower class
magistrate to do so. We, therefore, think that the  decision
in  Nazir Ahmed's case(1) also covers the case in  hand	 and
that on the principles there applied, here too oral evidence
given  by  Mr. Dixit of the confession made to him  must  be
held inadmissible.
</p><p id="p_26">It remains now to notice some of the decisions on which	 Mr.
Aggarwala relied in support of his contention.	First of all
we have to refer to Asharfis case(1).  That was a case which
was  concerned	with  the memorandum  of  an  identification
parade prepared by a magistrate of the first class.  It	 was
observed  in  that  case  that	Nazir  Ahmed's	case(2)	 was
authority  for	the  proposition  that	where  a  magistrate
belongs to a class mentioned in<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_84"> s. 164</a>, be must act in terms
of  it	or not at all, but where the  proceedings  are	held
before	any other magistrate the statement is one under	 the
unwritten  general  law	 and  Nazir  Ahmed's  case  had	  no
application.   It was also observed that  an  identification
memorandum  was a statement recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_85"> s. 164</a>  when	 the
record was
(1) L.R. 63 I.A. 372.	  (2) I L.R. [1960] 2 All. 488.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">495</span>
<p id="p_27">made  by a magistrate of a class mentioned in it  but  where
the memorandum was prepared by a magistrate of another class
it  was	 not  a	 record made  under  that  section  and	 the
magistrate making the record can give oral evidence in proof
of the statements in the memorandum.  We are not very  clear
as to what exactly was intended to be laid down in this case
about<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_86"> s. 164</a>.  Furthermore it does not appear to us from the
report how the observations referred to above were necessary
for  the decision of the case, for, as earlier	stated,	 the
identification memorandum considered there had been prepared
by a magistrate of the first class.  It is not necessary for
us  in	this  judgment	to  decide  whether  or	 how  far  a
memorandum  of	identification	proceeding  is	a  statement
recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_87"> s. 164</a> and we do not wish to be understood as
lending	 our support to the view expressed on that  question
in  Asharfis case(1).  We think it enough to state that	 for
the  reasons earlier mentioned, we are unable to  share	 the
view-if	 that was the view expressed in Asharfi's  case-that
where  a statement or confession is made in tile  course  of
investigation  to a magistrate not belonging to one  of	 the
classes	 mentioned in<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_88"> s. 164</a>, he can prove the statement  or
confession by oral evidence.  We may state here that a later
judgment  of  the same High Court has expressed	 some  doubt
about  the  correctness	 of that case:	see  Ram  Sanchi  v.
State(2).
</p><p id="p_28">The  next case to which reference was made by Mr.  Aggarwala
was <a href="/doc/1903900/" id="a_89">Ghulam Hussain v. The King</a>(3).  That case dealt with the
question whether a statement recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_90"> s. 164</a> which did
not amount to a confession, could be used against the  maker
as  an admission by him within<a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_91"> ss. 18</a> to <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_92">21</a> of the  Evidence
Act and it was held,, that it could.  The Judicial Committee
observed  that	"the  fact that an admission is	 made  to  a
Magistrate while he, is functioning under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_93"> s. 164</a> of the Code
of  Criminal Procedure cannot take it outside the  scope  of
the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_94">Evidence Act</a>." That case only held that the relevancy of
a  statement recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_95"> s. 164</a> had to be decided by	 the
provisions, of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_96">Evidence Act</a>.  We have nothing to do with
any  question  as to relevancy of  evidence.   The  question
before
(1)  I.L.R. [1960] 2 All. 488.
</p><p id="p_29">(2) A.I.R. [1963] All. 308.	 (3)  L.R. 77 I.A. 65.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">496</span>
<p id="p_30">us  is whether a confession which is relevant can be  proved
by  oral evidence in view of the provision of<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_97"> s. 164</a> of	 the
Code.	The question dealt with in Ghulam Hussain's  case(1)
was  quite  different and that case has no  bearing  on	 the
question before us.
</p><p id="p_31">It is clear that the observation quoted earlier from  Ghulam
Hussain's  case(1)  does  not as argued	 by  Mr.  Aggarwaia,
support	 the  contention that where a  confession  has	been
purported  to be recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_98"> s. 164</a> but by  a  magistrate
who  is not one of those mentioned in it, the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_99">Evidence	 Act</a>
can  still be called in aid to admit oral evidence to  prove
the confession.	 All that the judicial Committee did in that
case  was  to  hold that an admission in  a  statement	duly
recorded under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_100"> s. 164</a> was substantive evidence of the  facts
stated	in it under<a href="/doc/565566/" id="a_101"> ss. 18</a> to <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_102">21</a> of the Evidence  Act.	 The
Judicial  Committee made that observation for  this  purpose
only  and  to  reject an argument that	the  cases  of	Brij
Bhushan	 Singh v. King Emperor(2), and <a href="/doc/299175/" id="a_103">Bhuboni Sahu  v.	 The
King</a>(3)	 showed	 that the admission made  in  the  statement
recorded  under<a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_104"> s. 164</a> could not be used against an  accused
person	as  substantive evidence of the	 fact  stated.	 The
judicial  Committee  pointed out that "In  these  cases	 the
Board was considering whether a statement made by a  witness
under<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_105"> s. 164</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure could be used
against	 the  accused as substantive evidence of  the  facts
stated,	 and it was held that such a statement could not  be
used in that way."
</p><p id="p_32">Another	 case cited was <a href="/doc/1047947/" id="a_106">Emperor v. Ram Naresh</a>(4).  What	 had
happened there was that two accused persons walked into	 the
court of a magistrate and wanted to make a confession.	 The
magistrate called a petition-writer and the accused  persons
dictated  an application to him and that was taken  down  by
the  petition-writer and signed by them.  That petition	 was
admitted  in evidence under<a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_107"> s. 21</a> of the Evidence  Act.	  It
was  held, and we think rightly, that Nazir Ahmed's  case(5)
did  not  prevent the petition being  admitted	in  evidence
because it only forbade certain oral

</p><p id="p_33">(3)   L.R. 76 I.A. 147..   (4)	I.L.R. [1939] All. 377.
(5)  L.R. 63 I.A. 372.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">497</span>
<p id="p_34">evidence being given.  This case turned on wholly  different
facts and is of no assistance.
</p><p id="p_35">We  may	 also  refer  to, In re Natesan	 (1)  where  it	 was
observed  that the decision in Nazir Ahmed's  case(2)  might
require reconsideration in view of the observations of	this
Court  in <a href="/doc/1347962/" id="a_108">Willie Slaney v. The State of	 Madhya	 Pradesh</a>(3).
The actual decision in In re Natesan(4) does not affect	 the
question  before  us  and  with	 regard	 to  the   aforesaid
observation  made  in it we think it enough on	the  present
occasion to say that we are unable to accept it as correct.
We  think  that the High Court in the present  case  rightly
rejected the oral evidence of Mr. Dixit.
</p><p id="p_36">The result is that the appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
