HEADNOTE:
The  appellant was 'Charged with gross dereliction of  duty.
The  appellant	in answer to the charge sheet  admitted	 the
mistakes  and contended that he was over-worked and that  it
was  the  duty of others also to check the  load  sheet	 and
balance	 chart	prepared by him.  Enquiry was  held  by	 the
Station Manager to whom the Appellant objected on the ground
of  bias.  On the findings of the enquiry the appellant	 was
dismissed  by the Regional Representative of the  respondent
company	 and  was given one month's wages and  was  informed
that the approval of the action taken was being sought	from
the Industrial Tribunal before whom some industrial disputes
were  pending.	The order of dismissal was  communicated  to
the  appellant on May 30, and the application  for  approval
was made the same day.	An application under s. 33A was made
on  June 3, 1960, by the appellant challenging the order  of
dismissal.  The appellant objected to the maintainability of
the  application  for  approval but  the  Tribunal  accorded
approval to the action taken by the respondent and dismissed
the application of the appellant under s. 33-A, on appeal by
special leave.
Held,  that the application for approval was  in  accordance
with the proviso of s. 33 and properly made.

The  Straw  Board  Manufacturing  Co.  Ltd.,  Saharanpur  v.
Govind, [1962] Supp. 3 S. C. R. 618, referred to.
Held,  further	that in the absence of any  positive  action
amounting  to  recognition of the appellant as	a  protected
person by the respondent (and the appellant had produced  no
such  evidence)	 he  could not be held	to  be	a  protected
workman for dismissing whom previous sanction was  necessary
under s. 3 3 (3).
Held,  further, that assuming that the Station	Manager	 who
held  the enquiry was biased though the order  of  dismissal
was  passed by the Regional Representative against  whom  no
such  allegation was made, the Tribunal was entitled  to  go
into the question whether the dismissal was justified on the
evidence laid before it.

Held,  further, that the dismissal of the appellant did	 not
amount to victimisation
Held,  also that even if the domestic enquiry was  defective
provided that there is a prima facie case for dismissal	 and
a bonafide conclusion is reached that the employee is guilty
of  misconduct, and if the labour Court in dealing with	 the
application under s. 33 (2) and after considering for itself
the  evidence adduced before it gives its approval it  would
relate	back  to when the employer came	 to  the  conclusion
after the enquiry that the dismissal is a proper punishment.

by
WANCHOO J.-This appeal by special leave challenges the order
of  the	 Second Labour Court, West Bengal, relating  to	 the
dismissal  of the appellant, who was in the service  of	 the
respondent company.  A charge-sheet was issued to the  appe-
llant  on April 23, 1960 under the signature of the  Station
Manager	  of  the  respondent-company.	  The	charge-sheet
contained two charges of gross dereliction of duty  inasmuch
as the appellant. had made mistakes in the preparation of  a
load-sheet  on one day and a balance chart on  another	day,
which  mistakes might have led to a serious accident to	 the
aircraft.   The appellant gave his reply to the	 chargesheet
on April 26 1960 in which he admitted the mistakes that	 had
been made.  He, however., contended that he was	 over-worked
and further that it was the duty of others also to check the
load-sheet  and balance chart prepared by him. 9th May	1960
was fixed for inquiry by the Station Manager.  The appellant
objected to the inquiry being held by Station Manager on the
ground	that the Station Manager was biased against  him  on
account	 of  the  evidence which he had	 given	against	 the
Station Manager in a customs case which was partly responsi-
ble  for  the infliction of a fine on the  Station  Manager.
His  objection	was however over-ruled and the	inquiry	 was
held  by the Station Manager and completed on May 10,  1960.
Thereafter it appears that the Station Manager forwarded his
findings and recommendations to the Regional  Representative
of  the respondent-company.  The appellant was dismissed  on
May  28, 1960 by the Regional Representative; the  order  of
dismissal provided for payment of one month's wages to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> 107</span>
appellant and also stated that an application was being made
before	the  First  Industrial Tribunal,  West	Bengal,	 for
approval of the action taken, apparently as some  industrial
dispute	 was pending before that tribunal.  It appears	that
the order of dismissal was communicated to the appellant  on
May  30,  and one month's wages were also tendered  to	him.
The same day the respondent filed an application before	 the
First Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal, seeking approval  of
the  action.   On  June	 3,  1960,  the	 appellant  made  an
application  under  s. 33-A of the Industrial  Disputes	 Act
NO.XIV	of  1947,  (hereinafter referred  to  as  the  Act),
challenging  the  legality of the action taken	on  a  large
number of grounds.
</p><p id="p_5">These grounds were considered by the Labour Court and all of
them were substantially decided against the appellant.	 The
Labour	Court held that the dismissal of the  appellant	 was
justified   and	  therefore  accorded  approval	  for	such
dismissal.   In particular, dealing with the various  points
raised	on  behalf of the appellant, the Labour	 Court	held
that  the  application under s. 33 (2) (b) of  the  Act	 was
validly made even though it had been made after the order of
dismissal  had been passed.  It further held that  the	case
was  not  covered  by s. 33 (1) of the Act and	it  was	 not
necessary to obtain the precious permission of the  tribunal
before	dismissing  the appellant.  It also  held  that	 the
appellant  was not a protected workman.	 Further as  to	 the
charge	that  the Station Manager was biased  and  therefore
there  was violation of the principles of  natural  justice,
the Labour Court was of the view that the contention of	 the
appellant  that the Station Manager was biased	against	 him
because	 of  the evidence he had given in the  customs	case
could not be brushed aside lightly.  But it went on to	hold
that  even if there was some violation of the principles  of
natural justice in as much as the Station Manager was biased
against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">108</span>
the  appellant, the respondent had adduced all the  evidence
before	it in support of its action and it had to decide  on
that evidence whether the action was justified and  approval
should	be granted.  In this connection.. the  Labour  Court
relied on the decision of this Court in Phulbari Tea  Estate
v. Its workmen (1).
</p><p id="p_6">The  Labour  Court  then went in-to  the  evidence  tendered
before	it.  It pointed out that the appellant had  admitted
the  two  mistakes which were the basis of the	charge.	  It
also  held that the mistakes were of a serious nature  which
might  have  resulted in 'an accident to the  aircraft.	  It
said  that the fact that other people were also	 responsible
for   checking	loadsheets  and	 balance-charts	 would	 not
mitigate  the mistakes committed' by the appellant  who	 was
primarily responsible for preparing them.  It also  repelled
the  charge  of	 victimisation	raised	on  behalf  of	 the
appellant on account of the delay in giving him the  charge-
sheet.	Finally, it came to the conclusion that the mistakes
committed  by the appellant were serious involving  possible
accident  to the aircraft and possible loss of	human  life.
It  was	 not prepared to accept the plea  of  over-work	 and
other  pleas raised on behalf of the appellant	to  mitigate
the  mistakes  committed by him.  It pointed  out  that	 the
mistakes  being	 of  a	serious	 nature	 the  punishment  of
dismissal  inflicted by the respondent could not be said  to
be  unconscionable  or	entirely out of	 proportion  to	 the
gravity	 of  the  offence.   It,  therefore,  dismissed	 the
application  of	 the appellant unders. 33-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_4">A of the  Act</a>	 and
accorded  approval  to the action taken by  the	 respondent.
This decision of the labour Court is being challenged by the
present appeal by special leave.
</p><p id="p_7">The  main  point  which was raised in  this  appeal  is	 now
concluded  by the decision of this Court in the Straw  Board
Manufacturing  Co. Limited, Saharanpur v. Govind (2 ).	This
Court has held in
(1) [1960] 1 S.C.R. 32,	 (2) [1962] Supp. 8 S.C.R. 618
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">109</span>
that  case that the proviso to s.33  (2)(b)contemplates	 the
three  things  mentioned therein,  namely,(i)  dismissal  or
discharges(ii)	payment	 of wages, and (iii)  making  of  an
application for approval, to be simultaneous and to be	part
of  the same transaction so that the employer when he  takes
the  action under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_5"> s. 33</a> (2) by dismissing or discharging  an
employee,  should  immediately pay him or offer to  pay	 him
wages  for  one month and also make an	application  to	 the
tribunal  for  approval at the same time".  It	was  further
held that "the employer's conduct should show that the three
things contemplated under the proviso, are parts of the same
transaction;  and the question whether the  application	 was
made  as  part of the same transaction or at the  same	time
when  the action was taken would be a question of  fact	 and
will  depend upon the circumstances of each case".   In	 the
present	 case  the  order of dismissal	was  passed  by	 the
Regional Representative on May 28, 1960 and was communicated
to the appellant on May 30th.  The wages were offered to the
appellant  at the same time when the order was	communicated
to him., though he did not accept them. The respondent also
made the application under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_6"> s. 33</a>  (2) (b) to the  industrial
tribunal  the  same  day.In these circumstances	 we  are  of
opinion that   the  Labour Court was right in  holding	that
the  application under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_7"> s. 33</a> (2) (b) was in accordance	with
the proviso to that section and was properly made.
Learned	 counsel for the appellant has further	raised	some
points	which were raised on behalf of the appellant  before
the Labour Court.  In the first place, he contends that	 the
appellant  was a protected workman and the Labour Court	 was
not  right  when  it  held that	 the  appellant	 was  not  a
protected  workman.   We are of opinion	 that  the  question
whether a particular workman is a protected workman or not
is  a question of fact, and the finding of the Labour  Court
on such a question will generally be accepted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">110</span>
by this Court as conclusive.  Besides, the Labour Court	 has
pointed out that the mere fact that a letter was written  to
the Manager of the respondent company by the  Vice-President
of  the	 union	in  which the  name  of	 the  appellant	 was
mentioned as a joint secretary of the union and the  manager
had  been  requested  to recognise  him	 along	with  others
mentioned  in the letter as protected workmen would  not  be
enough.	 The company had replied to that letter pointing out
certain	 legal defects therein and there was no evidence  to
show  what happened thereafter.	 The Labour Court  has	held
that according to the rules framed by the Government of West
Bengal	as  to the recognition of protected  workmen,  there
must be some positive action on the part of the employer  in
regard	to  the recognition of an employee  as	a  protected
workman before he could claim to be a protected workman	 for
the purpose of<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_8"> s. 33</a>.  Nothing has been shown to us  against
this  view.  In the absence therefore of any evidence as  to
recognition,   the  Labour  Court  rightly  held  that	 the
appellant was not a protected workman and therefore previous
permission under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_9"> s. 33</a> (3) of the Act would not be necessary
before his dismissal.
</p><p id="p_8">Then  it is urged that after the Labour Court held that	 the
Station	 Manager who held the inquiry was baised  and  there
had  been violation of the principles of natural  ..justice,
it was not open to the Labour Court to consider the question
whether the appellant was rightly dismissed itself.  On	 the
other  hand  it has been urged on behalf of  the  respondent
that  the Station Manager could not in the circumstances  of
this case be said to have violated the principles of natural
justice because the mistakes were
admitted by the appellant and the inquiry was really  formal
and_ all that the Station Manager had to do was to recommend
what  he considered suitable punishment for the	 misconduct,
which  had  taken place.  It is also pointed  out  that	 the
actual punishment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> 111</span>
was  awarded by the Regional Representative and not  by	 the
Station	 Manager.  There is some force in these	 contentions
on  behalf  of the respondent in the  circumstances  of	 the
present case.  But we do not think it necessary to pronounce
finally on the question whether in such circumstances  there
would  be  violation  of natural justice.  It  is  now	well
settled	 by a number of decisions of this Court that  it  is
open to the tribunal to go into the propriety of an order of
dismissal  itself,  when there is a defect in  the  domestic
inquiry.  In these circumstances even if it be held that the
Station	 Manager  was biased and therefore  there  was	some
violation  of the principles of natural justice inasmuch  as
the  inquiry  was field by him, the Labour  Court  would  be
entitled  to go into the question whether the dismissal	 was
justified on the evidence led before it and this is  exactly
what  the Labour Court did relying on the judgment  of	this
Court in Phulbari Tea Estate (1).  The contention  therefore
on  behalf  of the appellant that the Labour Court  was	 not
entitled  to go into the question whether the dismissal	 was
justified  once	 it  held  that	 the  domestic	inquiry	 was
defective, must be rejected.
</p><p id="p_9">Then it is urged that the Labour Court was wrong in  holding
that victimisation had not been proved.	 We however find  no
reason to differ from the finding of the Labour Court on the
question  of  victimisation,  apart from  the  fact  that  a
finding of victimisation is generally a question of fact and
cannot	be  agitated in this Court.  The  Labour  Court	 has
pointed	 out  that the plea of victimisation on	 the  ground
that there was some delay in giving the charge-sheet to	 the
appellant  cannot be sustained, because the Station  Manager
came  to know about the mistakes only a few days before	 the
charge-sheet  was  given, though the mistakes  had  actually
been  committed in January and March, and also	because	 the
appellant admitted the mistakes and there could be no  doubt
therefore that he had committed them.
</p><p id="p_10">(1)  [1960] 1 S. C R. 82.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">112</span>
<p id="p_11">We  agree  with	 the Labour Court that in the  face  of	 the
appellant's  admission	of the mistakes there  could  be  no
question of victimisation in this case.
</p><p id="p_12">Finally	 it  is	 urged	that as	 the  domestic	inquiry	 was
defective, there could be no approval of the action taken in
consequence of such an inquiry and the Labour Court even  if
it held that the dismissal was justified should have ordered
the   dismissal	 from  the  date  its  award  would   become
operative.   In this connection reliance was placed  on	 the
decision of this Court in Messrs.  <a href="/doc/544869/" id="a_10">Sasa Musa Sugar Works (P)
Ltd. v. Shobrati Khan</a>, (1), where the following observations
occur at p. 845 -.-
</p><p id="p_13">"......	 as the management held no inquiry after  suspending
the  workmen  and proceedings under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_11"> s. 33</a>  were	 practically
converted  into	 the inquiry which normally  the  management
should have held before applying to the Industrial Tribunal,
the management is bound to pay the wages of the workmen till
a  case for dismissal was made out in the proceedings  under
s. 33."
</p><p id="p_14">We  are of opinion that those observations cannot  be  taken
advantage  of  by the appellant.  That was a case  where  an
application  had  been made under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_12"> s. 33</a> (1) of the  Act	 for
permission to dismiss the employees and such permission	 was
asked for though no inquiry whatsoever had been held by	 the
employer  and  no  decision  taken  that  the  employees  be
dismissed.   It was in those circumstances that a  case	 for
dismissal  was made out only in the proceedings under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_13"> s.  33</a>
(1) and therefore the employees were held entitled to  their
wages till the decision of the application under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_14"> s. 33</a>.	 The
matter would have been different if in that case an  inquiry
had  been held and the employer had come, to the  conclusion
that dismissal was the proper punishment and then
(1)  [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 836,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> 113</span>
had  applied under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_15"> s. 33</a> (1) for permission to dismiss.	  In
those  circumstances the permission would have related	back
to the date when the employer came to the conclusion  after.
an inquiry that dismissal was the proper punishment and had'
applied for removal of the ban by an application under<a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_16"> s. 33</a>
(1)  :	(see the <a href="/doc/562455/" id="a_17">Management of Ranipur	Colliery  v.  Bhuban
Singh</a>  (1).   The present is a case where the  employer	 has
held  an inquiry though it was defective and has  passed  an
order of dismissal and seeks approval of that order.  If the
inquiry	 is not defective, the Labour Court has only to	 see
whether	 there	was a prima facie case	for  dismissal,	 and
whether	 the employer had come to the bona  fide  conclusion
that  the employee was guilty of misconduct.  Thereafter  on
coming	to  the conclusion that the employer had  bona	fide
come  to the conclusion that the employee was guilty  i.  e.
there  was no unfair labour practice and  no  victimisation,
the Labour Court would grant the approval which would relate
back  to  the date from which the employer had	ordered	 the
dismissal.  If the inquiry is defective for any reason,	 the
Labour	Court would also have to consider for itself on	 the
evidence  adduced  before  it  whether	the  dismissal	 was
justified.   However on coming to the conclusion on its	 own
appraisal  of evidence adduced before it that the  dismissal
was justified its approval of the order of dismissal made by
the employer in a defective inquiry would still relate	back
to  the date when the order was made.  The  observations  in
Messrs.	 Sasa  Musa Sugar Company's case (2), on  which	 the
appellant relies apply only to a case where the employer had
neither	  dismissed  the  employee  nor	 had  come  to	 the
conclusion that a case for dismissal had been made out.	 In'
that  case the dismissal of the employee takes	effect	from
the  date  of the award and so until then  the	relation  of
employer and employee continues in law and in fact.  In	 the
present	 case an inquiry has been held which is said  to  be
defective  in  one respect and dismissal has  been  ordered.
The
(1)  [1959]  Supp. 2 S.C.R. 719. (2) [1959] Supp.  2  S.C.R.
</p><p id="p_15">836.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">114</span>
respondent  had	 however to justify the order  of  dismissal
before	the  Labour  Court  in view of	the  defect  in	 the
inquiry.   It  has succeeded in doing so and  therefore	 the
approval of the Labour Court will relate back to the date on
which  the  respondent passed the order of  dismissal.	 The
contention of the appellant therefore that dismissal in this
case should take effect from the date from which the  Labour
Court's award came into operation must fail.
There is no force in this appeal and it is hereby dismissed.
In the circumstances we pass no order as to costs.
Appeal	dismissed.
