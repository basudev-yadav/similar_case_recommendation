</p>
<p id="p_20">3.     We are concerned herein with the branch of K. Sreenivasulu. He

had two wives, the first wife being Singaramma. Through his first wife

Singaramma, he had eleven children. Except Venajakshi, they are parties

to the suit.      Kanthamma and Ranganayakamma are the plaintiffs.

Through his second wife, Shri K. Sreenivasulu had nine children.



</p><p id="p_21">4.     Allegedly there was a partnership firm through which K.

Sreenivasulu was doing business in silk sarees.           Whether the said

partnership was a firm constituted under the <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_1">Partnership Act</a>, 1932 or a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>


Hindu joint family Firm is in dispute. However, the said firm was said to

have been dissolved. Thereafter K. Sreenivasulu had been carrying on

the said business either by himself or as a `Karta' of the joint family in

silk sarees. Very valuable properties were acquired by him. Three items

of the said properties are involved in this appeal. Item No. 1 is said to be

worth 1 crore. Item Nos. 2 is stated to be worth 3 crores, whereas Item

No.4 is said to be worth 1 crore.       Although valuations of the said

properties are stated by the contesting respondents i.e. respondents Nos.

1 &amp; 2 in their written statement so as to put forth a contention that the

valuation of the suit properties as disclosed by the plaintiff being

Rs.10,000/- was not correct and on the aforementioned amounts the court

fee would be payable, but there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the

properties are valuable.
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">      As through the first wife, Sreenivasulu did not have any male

issue, he married Venkatalakshamma. Allegedly item Nos. 2 and 3 of the

suit properties were purchased in the name of Sringaramma. The parties

are at issue whether the said properties were purchased from the joint

family funds or in the name of Srirangama for her own benefit.

Indisputably, again item No.1 was purchased by Sreenivasulu in his own

name. He died on 27th December, 1970. The family allegedly continued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>


to remain joint. One of the daughters of Sreenivasulu being Vanajakshi

released her rights by getting a consideration of Rs.39,615.79.

Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 herein, sons of K. Sreenivasulu through

Singaramma were the junior members of the family. At the time of her

death of Sreenivasulu, they were minors.
</p>
<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">5.     Indisputably, a suit for partition being O.S. No. 2459 of 1982 was

filed by the first respondent K.S. Prakash besides others.      Whereas,

according to the appellants, the said suit was filed by way of machination

on the part of respondent No.1 herein but admittedly all the parties were

plaintiffs therein.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">6.     The plaint in the said suit discloses that Sreenivasulu and his

brothers partitioned their properties in the year 1957 who constituted a

Joint Hindu Family.      The said Joint Hindu Family had extensive

immovable properties in the towns of Bangalore and Darmavara.

Allegedly some immovable properties falling in the share of K.

Sreenivasulu are still joint. A coparcenary was constituted between him

and his sons. Properties were purchased by him out of the nucleus of the

immoveable properties, which fell to the share of Sreenivasulu in the said

partition meaning thereby that the partition took place in 1957 and

several other moveable and immovable properties were acquired in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5</span>


name of Sreenivasulu and other members of the families. They were in

joint possession. Ten items of immovable properties, however, allegedly

were the subject matter of joint sale for the purpose of discharge of

income tax and wealth tax liabilities.    They have been excluded from

partition. It was furthermore alleged that some other properties had also

been transferred and deeds of sale were executed by the Bangalore

Development Authority in favour of plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 therein.

Paragraph 12 of the said plaint reads as under :-



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "12. Thus, item No. 1 to 8 (one to eight) mentioned
             in the plaint are the properties now available and
             standing in the names of persons referred to above.
             This being a suit for general partition even though
             some of the properties are in the name of individual
             members of the family and as per records, but
             nevertheless shown in detail with a view to avoid
             unnecessary controversies and to effect just, fair and
             equitable partition among the members of the family."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_28">7.    Indisputably both the branches of Sreenivasulu entered into a

compromise, i.e., amongst the children of the first and the second wives.

Both the branches divided the properties into half and half. The said

compromise was recorded.       A final decree was passed on the basis

thereof, directing :-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                       6</span><p id="p_29">




"In terms of compromise, it is ordered and decreed
that the plaintiffs are the owners of the properties
shown in items 1, 2(a) &amp; 2(b) and 3 in the schedule
hereto which are allotted to their shares.
</p>
<p id="p_30">It is further ordered and decreed declaring that the
defendants are the owners of the properties shown in
items 4 and 5 in the schedule hereto which are allotted
to their share.
</p>
<p id="p_31">It is further ordered and decreed that properties in
items 6 and 7 of the suit schedule properties shall be
sold by plaintiffs and defendants and the tax arrears
viz., Income Tax, Wealth Tax and Capital Gain Tax in
respect of the said items of the Schedule property that
is due and payable by the Hindu undivided family be
cleared and discharged out of the sale price of the
same and further out of the refund amount as shown
in item No.8 of the schedule properties. It is hereby
recorded that since the value of items 4 and 5 allotted
to the defendants is less than the value of properties
allotted to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have this day
paid to the defendants a sum of Rs.80,000/- (Rupees
eighty thousand only) which together with
Rs.30,000/- (Rupees thirty thousand only) paid earlier
by the plaintiff in all amounts to Rs.1,10,000/-
(Rupees one lakh ten thousand only).
</p>
<p id="p_32">It is further ordered and decreed that in case the
amounts realized by sale of items 6 and 7 and item 8
are insufficient to clear the Tax arrears, the plaintiffs
shall bear 2/5 share, the defendants shall bear 3/5
share of the tax liability and in case the amounts
realized by the sale and refund claimed in respect of
the said properties are in excess of the Tax liability,
the remaining balance amounts shall be shared by
plaintiffs and defendants in the proportion of 2/5 and
3/5 share respectively.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    7</span><p id="p_33">


</p><p id="p_34">             It is further ordered and decreed that the plaintiffs and
             defendants are not liable to each other with regard ti
             income accruing from the properties allotted to them
             and also for mesne profits."
</p>
<p id="p_35">


</p><p id="p_36">8.    Allegedly Singaramma was not keeping well.            She underwent

kidney operation at Vellore.
</p>
<p id="p_37">

</p><p id="p_38">9.    The plaintiffs-appellants alleged that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 used

to take signatures them as well as others representing that the same were

required for payment of tax and also for managing the properties. The

said signatures used to be made as they then had immense faith in their

brothers.   A Power of Attorney was executed by the first appellant

Ranganayakamma in favour of K.S. Prakash on 15th July, 1983, in terms

whereof he was authorized to enter into a partition on her behalf.       A

recital has also been made therein that Ranganayakamma, appellant No.2

herein, had agreed to relinquish her right as per the agreement. Another

Power of Attorney was executed by the 4th defendant in favour of

Singaramma



</p><p id="p_39">10.   A deed of partition was executed on 5th August, 1983 in terms

whereof Singaramma was allotted 1/3rd share in item No.3 and rest of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8</span>


properties were retained by the brothers.          The sisters allegedly

relinquished their share for a consideration of Re.1/- only; the relevant

parts whereof read as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "1.    The properties described in the Second
                   Schedule hereunder are hereby allotted to the
                   share of the parties of the First and Second
                   Parts.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">2.    The property described in the Third Schedule hereunder is
      hereby allotted to the share of the party of the Eleventh part.

</p><p id="p_42">            3.     The parties of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
                   Seventh, Eight, Ninth and Tenth parts do
                   hereby relinquish their right to claim a share in
                   the properties described in the First Schedule in
                   consideration of payment to each of them of a
                   sum of Re.1/- by parties of the First, Second
                   and Eleventh Parts the receipt of which they
                   hereby acknowledge."
</p>
<p id="p_43">


</p><p id="p_44">11.   Singaramma died on 10th September, 1983. So far as 1/3rd share of

Singaramma is concerned, no partition had taken place. However, a

Special Power of Attorney was executed by the appellants on 20th

December, 1983. In the said Power of Attorney detailed recitals had

been made in regard to the source of the properties, the partitions which

had taken place and the share of the sisters devolved on them from

Singaramma which was calculated at 1/11th.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  9</span><p id="p_45">


</p><p id="p_46">12.   Indisputably, again a deed of lease was executed by plaintiff-

appelalnt No.2 herein in favour of M/s. Voltas Company Ltd.



</p><p id="p_47">13.   According to the appellants, however, no deed of lease was

executed by appellant No.1, Ranganayakamma. A sum of Rs.4,050/- was

paid to Kanthamma, appellant No.2, towards rent for the period 1.1.1986

to 31.07.1987.
</p>
<p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">14.   According to the appellants when they came to learn about the

fraudulent act(s) on the part of respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 2 in getting the

Power of Attorneys executed by them, they cancelled the same.


</p><p id="p_50">      They, thereafter, filed a suit for partition and separate possession

claiming 1/10th share each. The said suit was filed on 21st March, 1990

and was marked as O.S. No.1760 of 1990.
</p>
<p id="p_51">

</p><p id="p_52">15.   A contention was raised therein that all properties acquired by

Sreenivasulu were his self-acquired properties. The plaintiffs-appellants

further contended that their brothers used to take their signatures on

some papers as they enjoyed immense confidence in them as would

appear from paragraph 6 of the plaint, the relevant portion whereof reads

as under :-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   10</span><p id="p_53">




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            "6     The said power of attorney was got executed by
            playing a fraud on the 2nd plaintiff taking advantage of
            her innocence, ignorance and her sex and in the
            absence of her husband or any other reliable male
            member of the family. The second plaintiff was not
            aware of the contents of the said power-of-attorney
            nor were they read out to her. It was got executed in
            the Office of the Advocate of the defendants 1 and 2
            and it was drafted and attested by the Advocates
            belonging to the said Firm of Advocates. Thereafter,
            in fraudulent abuse of the said power-of-attorney and
            on the basis of the fraudulent misrepresentations made
            to the first and second plaintiffs and defendants 3 to 8,
            an alleged deed of partition was got executed on
            5.8.1983, again taking fraudulent advantage of the
            said innocent and ignorance of the plaintiffs and
            defendants 2 to 8, resulting in an unjust, unfair,
            unequal and fraudulent partition of the schedule
            properties. The plaintiffs and defendants 3 to 8 were
            never told by the defendants 1 and 2 that it was a
            partition deed which was got executed on 5.8.1983
            and instead it was misrepresented as on earlier
            occasion that their signatures were necessary on the
            document for proper management of the properties
            and the estate of late K. Srinivasasalu."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_54">16.   Respondents, however, in their written statement denied and

disputed the averments made in the plaint.          They raised various

contentions including the maintainability of the suit as also the question

of limitation. It was categorically stated that the suit properties were

acquired by Sreenivasulu out of the properties allotted to him in the

family partition amongst his brothers dated 22nd June, 1957. It was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  11</span>


furthermore contended that the relinquishment of interests by the

appellants and other sisters were out of love and affection. They further

averred that upon the death of Singaramma the deeds of lease which were

executed in respect of her share, vested in the plaintiffs-appellants. It

was categorically stated that the Power of Attorneys were executed by

the appellants voluntarily. Parties in support of their respective cases

adduced their own evidence.

<p id="p_55">

<p id="p_58">17.   On issue No.1, the learned trial judge found that the same had not

been proved by the plaintiffs-appellants stating that they have failed to

explain the admission made by them in the earlier plaint. In regard to

issue Nos. 2 and 3 it was held that the properties were ancestral

properties and not separate properties of Sreenivasulu.         As regards

execution of Power of Attorneys as also the Deeds of Release, the trial

court opined that they were voluntary in nature. In regard to issue No.7

pertaining to limitation, it was held that the suit was barred by limitation

as the plaintiffs had not sought for cancellation of deed of partition. It

was held that since after partition, the deeds of lease have come into

cancellation of the deed of partition was not maintainable.

       application for adducing additional evidence to prove the

       deed of partition dated 22nd July, 1957 thus should not be

       allowed by this Court.

<p id="p_71">ii)    The averments made in the 1982 suit being fraught with the

       elements of fraud and mis-representation, no reliance could

       have been placed thereupon nor the plaintiffs-appellants

       could be said to have voluntarily made admissions in the

       said pleading.

       void ab initio being hit by <a href="/doc/1903729/" id="a_3">Section 25</a> of the Indian Contract

       Act, it was not necessary to pray for any relief for setting

       aside the said deeds.

       void being hit by <a href="/doc/1903729/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> of the Indian Contract Act as

       for the said purpose passing of adequate consideration was

       necessary, love and affection being not the requisite

       The partition of the properties being unfair and unequal,

       reopening of the partition is permissible, wherefor also it is

       not necessary to seek cancellation of the documents.

       thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_76">(vi)   As there is a mis-representation in regard to the nature of the

       document as the deed of partition ultimately turned out to be

       a deed of relinquishment and even otherwise, the same was

       opposed to public policy as contained in <a href="/doc/1903729/" id="a_9">Section 25</a> of the

<p id="p_78">viii) The trial court as also the High Court committed a serious

       illegality in opining that no issue had been framed in regard

       to the validity of the deeds, although such an issue being

             presumption of proper execution as also the contents thereof

             appellants to prove that they were vitiated by fraud or

             misrepresentation. Presumption of validity strengthens with

             the passage of time.

<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      ii)    Appellants having themselves admitted that the properties in

             acquired properties are bound thereby, which they

             themselves admitted in the list of dates.

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      iii)   The contention having been raised for the first time in this

             Court that there had been no partition in the year 1957, the

             respondents have produced the said document, which being

             a registered one, may be taken into consideration.

       there is no reason as to why 1957 partition should not have

       been believed by the courts below.

<p id="p_85">v)     In view of the fact that co-parcenary consisted of K.

</p><p id="p_86">       Sreenivasulu, the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and his three sons

       through his second wife Venkatalakshamma, it was

       permissible for the parties to partition the properties half and

       half between two branches, which per se was not an illegal

       transaction.
</p>
<p id="p_87">vi)    The fact that Venajakshi had relinquished her share and ten

       items of properties had been jointly sold in respect whereof

       no accusation had been made as against the respondents, the

       partition of the properties consisting of four houses must

       have to be considered in the said back drop of events,

       particularly the fact that they are not the subject matter of

       challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_88">vii)   The conduct of the parties, i.e., three amongst eight sisters

       did not claim any share and only one sister having filed her

       written statement supporting the case of the appellants, two

       others merely had adopted the said written statement was a

       relevant factor which has rightly been taken into

       consideration by the courts below.       However, defendant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                             21</span>


      No.5 in her deposition before the trial judge as DW-4 stated

      that she had not instructed any lawyer to file the written

      statement, the case of three others must also fall wherefrom

      it is evident that out of nine sisters, six did not contest,

      which would go to show that all the sisters had voluntarily

      relinquished their shares in the joint family properties.

      Attention in this behalf has also been drawn to the

      deposition of appellant No.1 as PW-1 wherein the fact of

      that earlier partition had taken place, has categorically been

      admitted which clearly proves not only 1957 partition but

      also the 1982 partition is legal and valid.
</p>
<p id="p_89">viii) Plaintiff-appellants made only general allegations of fraud

      and mis-representation without giving any particulars

      thereof, which being mandatory in nature, no evidence could

      have been led in that behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_90">ix)   As the deposition of the appellants categorically show that

      all the documents were executed with their knowledge and

      their signatures had not been obtained on blank papers, this

      Court should not entertain the plea of fraud, mis-

      representation on their part particularly when they had

      admitted their knowledge about the nature of the document.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                    22</span>


</p><p id="p_91">      x)    Even Appellant No.2, deposing as PW-2, has accepted

            execution of the power of attorney which was prepared at

            Cuddpath. It was only in respect of the mother's 1/3rd share

            in one of the properties that the plaintiffs had 1/11th share,

            which they had not only accepted in the power of attorney

            executed by them, but also in the list of dates stating that not

            only a lumpsum amount had been paid to the appellant No.1,

            but also the fact that they had been getting their share of rent

            through cheques and appropriating them. This conduct on

            the part of the appellant would clearly show that they not

            only executed the deeds voluntarily, but also have been

            getting the benefit thereof by way of receiving rent.

            Even she identified the document as a power of attorney and

            as such she would be deemed to have known about the

            nature thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_92">

</p><p id="p_93">23.   The source of title in respect of properties in suit is not in question.

It was Kasetty Rangappa's property.        K. Sreenivasulu being son of

Kasetty Rangappa used to do business in partnership. There were some

joint family properties. The business was a joint family business.

<p id="p_96">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">             "There is a presumption in Hindu law that a
             family is joint. There can be a division in status
             among the members of a joint Hindu family by
             refinement of shares which is technically called
             "division in status", or an actual division
             among them by allotment of specific property
             to each one of them which is described as

</p><p id="p_98">      Even after the dissolution of the partnership, the fact that it had all

along been treated as a joint family property by both the branches of K.

Sreenivasulu through his two wives Singaramma and Venkatalakshamma

is evident as they were the subject matter of the O.S. No. 2459 of 1982.

The fact that in the said suit the properties of K. Sreenivasulu were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                    24</span>


described as the joint family coparcenary property is not in dispute.

Plaintiffs contended that it was K.S. Prakash who was behind the said

machination. That may be so or may not be.
</p>
<p id="p_99">
</p><p id="p_100">      The fact remains that a consent decree was passed pursuant to a

settlement arrived at between the two branches. They decided that the

properties may be divided half and half. Indisputably, the said consent

decree has been acted upon. Once that consent decree has been acted

upon, the question of reopening the entire suit by setting aside the decree

passed in the said O.S. No. 2459 of 1982 would not arise. It is also not

in dispute that the properties which fell in the share of the parties hereto

and Smt. Venajakshi are only four houses. It is also of some significance

to note that the plaintiffs initially filed a suit in respect of the house in

which Singaramma had been given one-third share, after the partition

was brought about in terms of the decree passed in the said O.S. No.

2459 of 1982. The basis for the entire suit being commission of fraud in

obtaining the said consent decree, it was obligatory on the part of the

plaintiffs to pray for setting aside the said decree. The pleadings of the

appellants in the said suit in which they were parties are binding on them

in the subsequent proceedings proprio vigore. Unless fraud was proved,

they could not have got rid of the same.

</p><p id="p_102">      The said decree has been acted upon. Pursuant to or in furtherance

of the said decree, ten sale deeds have been executed.



</p><p id="p_103">24.   It may be true that although the properties were described as

coparcenary property and both the branches were granted equal share but

it must be remembered that the decree was passed on the basis of the

settlement arrived at. It was in the nature of a family settlement. Some

`give and take' was necessary for the purpose of arriving at a settlement.

A partition by meets and bounds may not always be possible. A family

settlement is entered into for achieving a larger purpose, viz., achieving

peace and harmony in the family.

</p><p id="p_108">25.   One of the grievances raised by Mr. Chandrasekhar is that the

original deed of partition 22nd July, 1957 was not produced. It was,

however, a registered document. A perusal of the averments made in the

plaint categorically goes to show that the partition referred to therein by

and between K. Sreenivasulu and his brothers related to the partition

effected in 1957. The plaintiffs - appellants were, thus, aware thereof.

They did not contend in the plaint that the said deed of partition dated 2nd

July, 1957 was in effect and substance a deed of dissolution of

partnership. They stated so for the first time in the list of dates in the

Special Leave Petition. In response thereto, only the respondents have

produced the said deed and sought to adduce additional evidence to

prove the said fact. In our opinion, it is not necessary to do so as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                   27</span>


admissions made by the appellants in their pleadings themselves are

sufficient to hold that the property was a joint family property and by

reason of the said deed of settlement culminating in passing of the

compromise decree dated 20.12.1982, a valid consent decree was passed.

It is not a case that there had been a fraud or misrepresentation on the

part of K.S. Prakash Respondent No.1 alone herein but if a fraud or

misrepresentation is to be attributed, the same must be attributed to the

entire family representing both the branches. They must have thought

that by reason of such averments a settlement can be brought about. The

averments made in the suit filed by one branch were accepted by the

other branch without any demur whatsoever.

when a son gets a property from his father, as soon as sons are born to

him, a joint family is constituted. It is not a case that sons from either

side of the family were born before the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_18">Hindu Succession Act</a> 1956 came

into force.
</p>
<p id="p_111">

</p><p id="p_112">27.   The said compromise decree was acted upon. A deed of partition

was entered into.

</p><p id="p_114">28.   All the parties including Singaramma came to the office of the

Sub-Registrar for the said purpose. There is nothing to show nor the

plaint contains any averments that a fraud or mis-representation had been

practised on Singaramma. It is true that she was not well and had

undergone an operation at Vellore but bereft of that there is nothing to

show that she was keeping unwell for a long time so as not to possess a

sound disposing mind. Before the said deed of partition was entered

into, on 15th July, 1983 a special power of attorney was executed by

Ranganayakamma in favour of Respondent No. 1. A clear recital was

made therein that she had agreed to relinquish her interest. The power of

attorney was being executed pursuant thereto.


</p><p id="p_115">      Mr. Chandrasekhar has drawn our attention to the statements made

in the power of attorney to contend that no other or further agreement

was entered into and the power of attorney should have been preceded by

a regular deed. In our opinion, it was not necessary. Relinquishment

may be unilateral.   A sister relinquishing her right in favour of the

brothers may do so in various ways. Expression to that effect may be

made in several ways.
</p>
<p id="p_116">

</p><p id="p_117">29.   A power of attorney need not disclose the purpose for which the

relinquishment is made or the consideration thereof. Another power of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                     29</span>


attorney was executed by Defendant No. 4 in favour of Singaramma to

enter into a deed of partition. It was not produced. But, the said power

of attorney concededly had nothing to do with the said property. It was

in respect of other business. Defendants - Respondents rely thereupon

only to show that for the purpose of better management of the properties

and business, the sisters used to execute power of attorneys. They knew

about the nature and character of the said documents. They never stated

that any fraud or misrepresentation had been practised in regard to the

character of the document; the effect whereof we would discuss a little

later.
</p>
<p id="p_118">

</p><p id="p_119">30.      Coming now to the deed of partition, admittedly, one-third share in

Item No. 3 had been given to the mother. Appellants and other sisters

relinquished their right, title and interest therein. The materials brought

on records by the parties would clearly go to show that they had taken a

decision in unison. A similar power of attorney was executed by one of

the sisters being Smt. Venajakshi, who, as noticed hereinbefore, upon

receipt of a sum of about Rs. 40,000/-, relinquished her right. It may be

true that in the said deed of partition dated 5th August, 1983, the amount

of consideration was shown at Re. 1/-. But whether the same by itself

would invalidate the said deed of partition is another question which we
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                    30</span>


intend to deal with at an appropriate stage. The fact, however, remains

that in the plaint filed in the present suit by the appellants, the execution

or validity of the document including the registered power of attorneys

and deeds of lease being Exhibit Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 executed

between 1983 and 1985 are not in question.            These documents in

categorical terms go to show that the partition effected in 1983 had been

acted upon.
</p>
<p id="p_120">

</p><p id="p_121">31.   It would be of some importance, furthermore, to notice that the

plaintiff - Appellant No. 1 Kanthamma in her deposition before the

learned Trial Judge admitted:

                     date, on which occasion all the sisters had put their

                     respective signatures. There had been a partition

                     between the children of the second wives of

                     Sreenivasulu and children of her mother.

        their brothers. She, however, could not say as to who

        they were. She speaks fluent English. She signed the

        documents in English.       She had been running a

        poultry business under the name and style of Kantha

        Poultry Farm. She had also been doing saree business

        with her husband. Her husband had a roller flour mill

        business.    He is also one of the partners in

        Singaramma Flour Mills, Bangalore.
</p>
<p id="p_126">(v)     One of the sisters of the plaintiff, viz., Defendant No.

        8 was a Science graduate from Mount Carmel

        College. Ranganayakamma although made an attempt

        to show that she had not signed any power of attorney

        but accepted that once she had signed some power of

        attorney. It is accepted that the power of attorney was

        executed at Cuddapah, her own place.

         presence of their own advocates and/or they had

         signatures/thumb impressions before the Registrar, no

<p id="p_128">(vii) She had been going to the Sub-Registrar's office as

         also to the offices of the Advocates. The power of

         attorney was signed in the Chamber of the Advocates.

         She accepted that her mother had been given one-

         third share in Item No. 2 properties. She accepted her

         signatures in the power of attorney dated 20.12.1983

         and the signature of her Advocate Mr. T.S.

                  she had been receiving Rs. 9000/- per month from the

                  said Company. In one of the documents even her

                  husband is an attesting witness. He is also a lawyer.


      It was, therefore, difficult to arrive at a conclusion that the

plaintiffs - appellants were not aware of the nature of the document or

any fraud had been practiced on them.
</p>
<p id="p_135">

</p><p id="p_136">32.   The aforementioned findings have a direct bearing on the question

as to whether the deed of partition as also the power of attorneys were

vitiated by reason of any fraud or mistake on the part of the respondent

Nos. 1 and 2 herein. It is a well-settled principle of law that a void

document is not required to be avoided whereas a voidable document

must be.   It is not necessary for us to advert to a large number of

decisions of this Court and other High Courts on this issue as more or

less it is concluded by a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1944891/" id="a_19">Prem Singh v. Birbal

<p id="p_150">35.   When a fraud is alleged, the particulars thereof are required to be

pleaded. No particular of the alleged fraud or misrepresentation has been

disclosed.
</p>
<p id="p_151">

</p><p id="p_152">36.   We have been taken through the averments made in the plaint.

The plea of fraud is general in nature. It is vague. It was alleged by the

plaintiffs that signatures were obtained on several papers on one pretext

or the other and they had signed in good faith believing the

representations made by the respondents, which according to them

appeared to be fraudulent representation. When such representations

were made, what was the nature of representation, who made the

representations and what type of representations were made, have not

been stated. Allegedly, on some occasions, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 used
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                   37</span>


to secure the signatures of one or more of the plaintiffs and defendants

No. 3 to 8 on several papers but the details therein had not been

disclosed.
</p>
<p id="p_153">

</p><p id="p_154">37.   Admittedly, the papers were signed either in the office of the

advocate or before the Sub-Registrar. It was, therefore, done at a public

place. No signature was obtained on the blank paper. No document was

executed in a hush-hush manner.         It has been alleged that taking

fraudulent advantage of the innocence and ignorance of the plaintiffs and

Defendant No. 2, the said deed of partition was executed resulting in an

unjust, unfair and unequal fraudulent partition of the unequal properties.

If their signatures had not been obtained on blank sheets of papers, it was

for the plaintiffs - appellants to show who had taken advantage and at

what point of time. Both the courts below have come to the conclusion

that the sisters jointly had taken a stand that they would not claim any

share in the property. One of the sisters, who wanted a share in the

property, had been paid a sum of Rs. 40,000/- and she had executed a

deed of relinquishment. The said fact is not denied. All other sisters

were, thus, aware thereof.         They knew what was meant by

relinquishment.   All deeds including the said deed of partition was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                    38</span>


executed with the knowledge that they had been signing the deed of

partition and no other document.
</p>
<p id="p_155">
</p><p id="p_156">        This has categorically been stated by the plaintiff No. 1

Kanthamma in her evidence which we may notice in the following terms:



</p><p id="p_157">   1.      "Each of the sisters have been given one rupee and signatures
           were obtained on partition deed on 5.8.1983"
</p><p id="p_158">   2.      "I had gone to Sub-Registrar's office at the time of registration
           of the said partition deed. Sub-Registrar did not explain the
           contents of the said partition deed.
</p><p id="p_159">   3.      "I do not remember the date on which I affixed my signature on
           partition deed. We all the sisters and mother had gone to Sub-
           Registrar's Office at the time of registration of the partition
           deed."
</p>
<p id="p_160">

        They were, therefore, aware that the deed in question was a deed

of partition. They admitted that they had put their signatures before the

Sub-Registrar and no where else. Their statements appear to be far-

fetched and beyond the ordinary human conduct. If a plea was to be

raised and evidence was required to be addressed that there had been a

fraudulent misrepresentation as regards the character of partition deed

(Exhibit D-6) and in absence of any particulars having been furnished as

regards alleged fraud and misrepresentation, the said deeds would not be

void but only voidable.

</p><p id="p_162">38.   We are, however, not oblivious of the decisions of this Court and

other High Courts that illegality of a contract need not be pleaded. But,

when a contract is said to be voidable by reason of any coercion,

misrepresentation or fraud, the particulars thereof are required to be

pleaded.

decree has been passed on the premise that the said compromise was

lawful, we are of the opinion that the same cannot be permitted to be

reopened only on the question as to whether the properties were joint

properties or the self-acquired property of Sreenivasulu.

</p><p id="p_179">41.   We may now consider the submission of Mr. Chandrasekhar as to

what is meant by `release'. Reliance has been placed on De'Souza's

Conveyancing, page 1075, wherein it has been stated:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">             "A deed of release does not create title. A
             release may be drafted in the same form as a
             deed of transfer or simply as a deed poll or a
             deed to which both parties may join stating the
             circumstances under which the release is based.
             Either the monetary consideration or "the
             premises", i.e., facts in consideration of which
             the release is made shall be stated."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_180">42.   Our attention has also been drawn to essentials of `release' from

the said treatise, which are as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                     45</span><p id="p_181">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">             "(i) Full recitals of the origin of the claim,
             which form the most important part;

             claim, intended to be released;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_62">             (iii) words and expressions sufficiently clear
             to convey the intention of the releaser to
             discharge the right or the claim."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_182">43.   A deed of `release' for a consideration is a transaction. When,

thus, a release is made for consideration, the particulars of consideration

and other particulars which are required to be averred in the deed being

essential elements thereof. Relinquishment of a property by a sister in

favour of her brother for a consideration or absence of it, stands on a

different footing. <a href="/doc/1903729/" id="a_35">Section 25</a> of the Indian Contract Act must be read and

construed having regard to the fact situation obtaining in the cases.

              the discord, disharmony, acrimony and
              bickering. Thus the consideration in such type

</blockquote>



<p id="p_185">44.   We would proceed on the basis that the consideration of rupee one

shown in the deed of partition is no consideration in the eye of law.

However, the question is as to whether a partition deed would be

violative of <a href="/doc/1903729/" id="a_38">Section 25</a> of the Indian Contract Act for want of

consideration. It is per se not a void document. No such plea was raised.

No issue has been framed. No evidence has been adduced. No ground

has been taken even in the memo of appeal before the High Court. The

validity of the partition deed (Ex. D-6) by reference to the recitals of the

release of shares by the daughters of Sreenivasulu has not been

questioned.

            two witnesses. Consequently, a registered
            instrument releasing the right, title and interest
            of the releasor without consideration may
            operate as a transfer by way of a gift, if the

</p><p id="p_190">      The said principle has been noticed by a Full Bench of the Madras

High Court in <a href="/doc/1159025/" id="a_41">Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, Referring Officer v.

Rustorn Nusserwanji Patel</a> [AIR 1968 Madras 159] stating :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">            "(8) In the present case, prima facie, it may be
            contended with great force and plausibility that
            the document rightly purports to be a release
            and should be received as such. For it cannot be
            disputed, we think, that the estate in question is
            owned by two parties or co-owners, that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                  48</span>


            releasee has already an undivided half share in
            the estate and that what the releasor purports to
            do by the document is to effect himself, in
            respect of both this title and his right to
            possession in favour of the releasee.
            Nevertheless, Sri Ramaswami for the State has
            contended, upon two main lines of reasoning,
            that the document has to be interpreted as a
            conveyance or should be held essentially to be
            such. The first line of reasoning is based upon
            the distinction well known to law borrowed
            from the English law of real Property between a
            joint tenant and a tenant-in-common. This
            distinction has also been applied to the concept
            of a Hindu Coparcenary as existing before a
            division in status and the state of rights
            between erstwhile co-parceners after division is
            status as would be apparent from cited passages
            in Mulla's Hindu law. The other line of
            reasoning is that upon the actual phraseology of
            <a href="/doc/1164414/" id="a_42">Article 55</a> of Schedule I such a document as
            this cannot amount to a release."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_191">46.   The question again came up for consideration before a Special

Bench of the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/1334818/" id="a_43">The Chief Controlling Revenue

Authority, Board of Revenue, Madras v. Dr. K. Manjunatha Rai</a> [AIR

1977 Madras 10], in the context of the Payment of Stamp Duty wherein it

was categorically held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">            "...For a release, in law, may be effected either
            for consideration or for no consideration. In
            either case, if the transaction operates as a
            relinquishment or a renunciation of a claim by
            one person against another or against a
            specified property, it will be a release..."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                      49</span>




<blockquote id="blockquote_67">       It is, therefore, not a pure question of law.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_192">47.    <a href="/doc/1903729/" id="a_44">Section 25</a> of the Indian Contract Act contains several exceptions,

that is to say : (i) if it is in writing; (ii) if it is registered or (iii) if the

same has been executed on account of love and affection. The deed of

partition is both in writing and registered. One of the questions which

had been bothering this Court is as to whether a document had been

executed out of love and affection or not. The fact that the parties are

near relatives is not in dispute. The love and affection of the sisters on

the brothers has categorically been accepted by Plaintiff No. 1

Kanthamma in her deposition, stating:
</p>
<p id="p_193">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_68">              "In the house of defendants 1-2 whenever there
              is a function, as our father died and since we
              had more affection and faith on defendants 1-2,
              we used to sign the documents without going
              through the contents."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_194">48.    The deed of partition could have also been entered into by way of

family arrangement where no registration was required. Such a course of

action had not been taken. The parties knew the nature of the document.

Appellants and other sisters being highly educated were supposed to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                   50</span>


know the contents thereof. Their husbands are well-off in the society.

The transaction, therefore, was transparent. Furthermore, the mother was

alive. She was also a party to the deed of partition. She must have

played a pivotal role. She even if suffering from illness might be anxious

to see that family properties are settled. Release by an heir other than a

co-parcenar does not need any consideration. A release is valid even

without consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_195">

</p><p id="p_196">49.   Mr. Chandrasekhar, however, has drawn our attention to Anson's

Law of Contract, page 154, wherein the law is stated to be as under:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">            "...Some additional factor is required to bring a
            case within one of the exceptions: for example,
            the existence of a relationship in which one
            party is able to take an unfair advantage of the
            other. In the absence of some such factor, the
            general rule applies that the courts will enforce
            a promise so long as some value for it has been
            given."</blockquote><p id="p_197">



</p><p id="p_198">      As regards, nominal and inadequate consideration, the learned

Author states:
</p>
<p id="p_199">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_70">            "'Nominal consideration' and `nominal sum'
            appear...., as terms of art, to refer to a sum or
            consideration which can be mentioned as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                  51</span>


            consideration but is not necessarily paid. This
            view was expressed by Lord Wilberforce (in a
            speech with which all the other members of the
            House of Lords concurred) in Midland Bank &amp;
            Trust Co. Ltd. v. Green. In that case a husband
            sold a farm, said to be wroth 40,000, to his
            wife for 500. It was held that the wife was,
            for the purposes of Section 13(2) of the Land
            Charges Act 1925, a "purchaser for money or
            money's worth" so that the sale to her prevailed
            over an unregistered option to purchase the
            land, which had been granted to one of the
            couple's children. It was not necessary to
            decide whether the consideration for the sale
            was nominal but Lord Wilberforce said that he
            would have "great difficulty" in so holding; and
            that "To equate `nominal' with `inadequate' or
            even `grossly inadequate' consideration would
            embark the law on inquiries which I cannot
            think were ever intended by Parliament. On the
            facts of the case the 500 was in fact paid and
            was more than a mere token, so that the
            consideration was not nominal on either of the
            two views stated above. But if the stated
            consideration had been only 1, or a
            peppercorn, it is submitted that it would have
            been nominal even if it had been paid, or
            delivered, in accordance with the intention of
            the parties."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_200">50.   The same principle might have been applied in the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_45">Indian Contract

Act</a>. "Consideration" has been defined in <a href="/doc/877630/" id="a_46">Section 2(d)</a> of the Indian

</blockquote>


<p id="p_202">51.   Consideration even in the Indian context would mean a reasonable

equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the promiser to the

promise or by the transferor to the transferee. Love and affection is also

a consideration within the meaning of <a href="/doc/881325/" id="a_47">Sections 122</a> and <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_48">123</a> of the

Malhan and another</a> [AIR 1997 SC 1411], it is stated that a distinction

must be made between a transaction which is invalid in law being ultra

vires the Articles of Association and other transactions.       What is

contemplated is the sense of ad idem for a concluded contract but when a

document can be executed for no consideration, pleading in that behalf

would be a must.

</p><p id="p_212">53.        The High Court, therefore, in our opinion, was correct in not

allowing the appellants to raise the said contention.



</p><p id="p_213">54.        We may, furthermore, notice that the deed of partition (Ex. D-6)

had been acted upon by the appellants and other sisters. They executed a

deed of lease in respect of their 1/11th share each in the 1/3rd share in one

of the items of the properties in favour of the tenant, Defendant No. 9.

The lease deed executed by Plaintiff No. 1 (Ex. D-14) is dated

16.02.1985.       In terms of the deed of partition, one of the plaintiffs

received rentals in respect of her share from the tenants. There are a

large number of documents brought on records by the parties wherefrom

a positive knowledge of execution of the said partition deed on the part

of the sisters is possible to be attributed. The said documents are:

Plaintiff No. 2. It appears that there were three such documents, viz. :

<p id="p_215">56.   It may be true that there is nothing on record to show that a lease

deed was executed by other plaintiff but then there is nothing to show

that she was not aware thereof. If she had not been paid her share from

the rental income, she had not prayed for mesne profit.

Chandrashekhar.

the one hand, and <a href="/doc/858095/" id="a_57">Article 59</a> thereof, on the other, would depend upon

the factual situation involved in a case.

"59. To cancel or set aside an Three years     When the facts entitling the

</p><p id="p_223">      Applicability of <a href="/doc/858095/" id="a_60">Article 59</a> would indisputably depend upon the

question as to whether the deed of partition was required to be set aside

or not. In view of our findings aforementioned, it was required to be set

aside. It is not a case where the deed of partition by reason of purported

wrong factual contention raised in the plaint leading to grant of a consent

decree was void ab initio. It was not. The effect of it would be that the

same was required be set aside. [See Prem Singh (supra), <a href="/doc/728989/" id="a_61">M/s. Bay Berry

      It must, therefore, be held that the suit was barred by limitation.
