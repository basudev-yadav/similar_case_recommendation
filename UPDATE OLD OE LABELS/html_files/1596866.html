ACT:
     <a href="/doc/190229/" id="a_1">National Security	Act</a>, 1980 (Act 65 of 1980)-Orders of
detention, passed  under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/682299/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of the
Act, on	 the ground  that "the subject who is in jail and is
likely to  be released	on bail,  if allowed to be at large,
will indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of
public order"-Whether  the detention  is bad  either on	 the
ground that  there was	no case made out for apprehension of
breach of  public order	 or that  the  criminal	 proceedings
having been  initiated,	 no  case  of  preventive  detention
arises or  that the  case is  one of law and order and not a
case of	 public order  or that	there being no allegation in
the First Information Report, the detaining authority cannot
invent a new ground to fall under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/682299/" id="a_3">section
3</a> of the Act.



HEADNOTE:
     Dismissing the petitions, the Court
^
     HELD: 1.  The clear  words of  the detention order show
that the  detaining authority was alive to the fact that the
petitioners were  in jail  custody on the date of passing of
the detention orders, but it was satisfied that if they were
enlarged on  bail, of which there was every likelihood, they
would create problems of public order and, therefore, it was
necessary to  prevent them from doing so. The position would
have been entirely different if the petitioners were in jail
and had	 to remain  in jail for a pretty long time, in which
situation there could be no apprehension of breach of public
order from them. [944 C-E]
     2. Preventive  detention is an anticipatory measure and
does not relate to an offence while the criminal proceedings
are to punish a person for an offence committed by him. They
are not	 parallel  proceedings.	 In  the  circumstances	 the
pendency of  a criminal prosecution is no bar to an order of
preventive  detention,	 nor  is   an  order  of  preventive
detention a  bar to  prosecution. It  is for  the  detaining
authority to  have the	subjective satisfaction	 whether  in
such a	case there  are sufficient  materials to  place	 the
person under  preventive detention  in order  to prevent him
from acting  in a  manner prejudicial to public order or the
like in future. [944 F-H]
     K.M. Chokshi  v. State  of Gujarat,  [1979] 4  SCC	 14,
applied.
     3.1. The difference between 'law and order' and 'Public
order' is  now well  settled. Applying	the well settled law
enunciated in Ram Ranjan Chatterjee
940
v. The	State of  West Bengal,	[1975]3 SCR  301, to the two
incidents, it  is clear	 that throwing	a bomb	in  a  large
gathering where	 a cultural  programme was  going on  at the
dead of	 night resulting  in the  public running  helter and
skelter to  save their	lives makes  out a  case of  'public
order' inasmuch	 as it	disturbed the  tranquillity and	 the
even  tempo  of	 life  of  the	public.	 Therefore,  if	 the
detaining authority  was satisfied  that the  two  incidents
make out  a case  of apprehension of breach of public order,
the detention order cannot be faulted. [945 G; 946 E-G]
     Ram Ranjan	 Chaterjee v. State of West Bengal, [1975] 3
S.C.R. 301 followed.
     <a href="/doc/203168/" id="a_4">Saya Mala	v. Home	 Secretary, Government of J &amp; K</a>, AIR
1982 SC. 1297, distinguished.
     3:2.  The	two  incidents	in  the	 instant  case	were
sufficient  for	  the  detaining   authority   to   initiate
proceedings  for   preventive  detention.   It	is  for	 the
detaining authority  to	 have  the  subjective	satisfaction
about the  apprehension of  the breach	of public order from
the incidents.	Even  one  incident  may  be  sufficient  to
satisfy the  detaining authority.  It all  depends upon	 the
nature of the incident. [947 G-H]
     4. The  absence of	 an allegation about the disturbance
of public  order in  the two  First Information Reports will
not  affect   the  position  because  there  was  additional
material before	 the detaining authority which satisfied him
about the  apprehension of  breach of  public order from the
petitioners in case they were enlarged on bail. [948 C-D]



JUDGMENT:

(Criminal) Nos. 678 and 679 of 1983.
</p><p id="p_2">     (Under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_5">article 32</a> of the Constitution of India)
     Miss R. Vaigai for the Petitioners.
</p><p id="p_3">     D. Goburdhan for the Respondent.
</p><p id="p_4">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     MISRA  J.	 These	two   connected	 petitions  seek  to
challenge the  orders of  detention dated 2nd December, 1982
passed by  the District	 Magistrate, Dhanbad  in exercise of
powers conferred  by subs.  (2) of <a href="/doc/682299/" id="a_6"> s.	3</a>  of  the  National
Security Act,  1980 (No.  65 of 1980) read with notification
No. 3183/C  dated 15th of October, 1982 of the Government of
Bihar.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">941</span>
<p id="p_5">     Alijan Mian,  the petitioner  in the first petition, is
an employee  of the  Eastern Coalfields	 Limited working  at
Khudia Colliery	 as a  dumper driver.  Jadunandan  Sah,	 the
petitioner in  the second  Petition, is also a dumper driver
in Gopi Nathpur Colliery.
</p><p id="p_6">     The object	 of the	 order of  detention as indicated in
the impugned  order was	 to  prevent  the  petitioners	from
acting in  any manner  prejudicial  to	the  maintenance  of
public order.  The grounds  of	detention  supplied  to	 the
petitioners are in identical terms and they are as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "1.  That	on  15/16.10.82,  at  about  2.30  A.M.	 the
	  subject alongwith Jadunandan Sah and 3 others went
	  to Khudia Colliery and dragged one Shri Ram Briksh
	  Chauhan who  were witnessing	a cultural programme
	  and started  assaulting him  in presence  of large
	  gathering who	 were  there  to  see  the  cultural
	  programme. This  created great  panic and alarm in
	  the area  and adversely affected the public order.
	  Hearing the  cry, Mussafir  Chauhan came there but
	  seeing the  subject and  his associates engaged in
	  the assault  of his  brother started	running away
	  for his life. The subject and his associates, with
	  an intention	to establish  criminal supremacy and
	  to kill  him threw  two bombs on him, resulting in
	  grievous injury  to Mussafir Singh. This adversely
	  affected the	public order  and persons  who	were
	  witnessing the  cultural programme started running
	  helter and skelter for their lives. This refers to
	  Nirsa P.S. Case No. 189 dated 6.10.1982 u/s 307/34
	  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>, 3/5  Explosive Sub.  Act.  Thus	the  subject
	  acted in  a manner  prejudicial to the maintenance
	  of the public order.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2.	  That on  8.11.82, at	about 11.30 A.M. the subject
	  alongwith Rambriksh  Singh, Jadunandan  Mahato and
	  Chandra Shekhar  Singh armed with bombs, gun, etc.
	  went to  the house of Ram Naresh Chauhan in Khudia
	  Colliery.  One   of  his   associates	 under	 the
	  direction and	 guidance of the subject opened fire
	  on Shri  Chauhan resulting  in grievous  injury to
	  him. Opening	of gun	fire in	 a thickly populated
	  residental colony of Khudia Colliery created great
	  panic and alarm in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">942</span>
	  the area and adversely affected public order. This
	  refers to  Nirsa P.S.	 case No.  208 dated 8.11.82
	  u/s. 307/34  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">I.P.C</a>. and <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_9"> s. 27</a>  Arms Act. Thus the
	  subject acted	 in  a	manner	prejudicial  to	 the
	  maintenance of  public order.	 The subject  is  in
	  jail and is likely to be released on bail. As such
	  the detention order was served in jail.
	  In the  circumstances I am satisfied that if he is
     allowed  to   remain  at  large,  he  will	 indulge  in
     activities prejudicial  to the  maintenance  of  public
     order.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  For prevention  of such activities, I consider his
     detention necessary.  Shri Alijan Mian is informed that
     he may  make a  representation in	writing against	 the
     order  under   which  he	has   been   detained.	 His
     representation, if	 any, may be addressed to the Deputy
     Secretary, Home  (Spl.)  Department,  Govt.  of  Bihar,
     Patna and forwarded through the Superintendent of jail,
     Dhanbad as early as possible."</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">     The orders of detention were sequal to two incidents of
15/16th October	 and 8th  November, 1982  giving rise to two
criminal cases,	 Nirsa P.S. Case No. 189 and Nirsa P.S. Case
No. 208 of 1982 respectively. The petitioner Alijan Mian was
arrested  on   8th  November,	1982  while  the  petitioner
Jadunandan Sah	was arrested  on 12th  of November,  1982 in
connection with the aforesaid incidents.
</p><p id="p_8">     The petitioners  made representation  against the order
of detention  in both the cases and the representations were
on the	same pattern.  Their stand was that they were active
members of  the union  of workers of the colliery, viz., the
Colliery Mazdoor  Sabha There  were other unions in the said
collieries and	due to	some inter  union  rivalry  a  first
information  report  against  them  was	 lodged	 by  persons
belonging to  a rival union for an alleged offence under<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_10"> ss.
307</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_11">34</a> IPC and 27<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_12">A of the Arms Act</a>. In the first information
report it was alleged that on 8th November the informant was
shot in	 his hand  near his house by one Ram Bilas Singh and
that at	 that time  the petitioners  were with	the said Ram
Bilas Singh.  Their intention was to kill him because he did
not participate	 in the strike in the colliery. In the first
information report regarding the other.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">943</span>
<p id="p_9">incident under	ss. 307/34  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a> and<a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_14"> ss. 3</a>/<a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_15">5</a> of the Explosive
Substances Act	it was	alleged that on the night of 15/16th
October 1982  around 2 A.M. the petitioners were beating the
brother of  the informant near a school, where some function
was going  on. On  seeing the  petitioners in the company of
others the  informant started  running but  he was chased by
others and a bomb was thrown at his back but he escaped. But
Alijan Mian,  the petitioner,  threw another  bomb  and	 the
informant was injured at his back and fell. The said persons
intended to kill him. The petitioners in both the cases were
later on  granted bail	but the two criminal cases mentioned
above are still going on.
</p><p id="p_10">     By an  order dated	 13th December,	 1982 the Government
approved the  detentions order	and informed the petitioners
by letter  dated 30th  December, 1982  of the  reference  of
their representation  to the  Advisory Board  asking them to
appear in  person before the Board. The petitioners appeared
in person before the Advisory Board.
</p><p id="p_11">     The Advisory  Board eventually gave an opinion that the
order of  detention was	 justified. On	the  basis  of	that
report the  Government ordered	detention of the petitioners
upto 2nd  December, 1983.  The	petitioners  challenged	 the
order of  detention by	filing writ  petitions in  the	High
Court but the same were dismissed in limine. The petitioners
instead of  filing an  appeal against  the order of the High
Court rejecting	 the writ  petitions have chosen to file the
present petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_16">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_12">     The contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners are
fourfold:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     1.	  The petitioners  were in  jail when  the detention
	  orders were  passed, when  there was absolutely no
	  apprehension of breach of public order from them.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     2.	  The two  incidents  on  the  basis  of  which	 the
	  proceedings  for  preventive	detention  had	been
	  started  were	  already  the	 subject  matter  of
	  criminal proceedings	and in the circumstances the
	  proceedings	for    preventive   detention	were
	  absolutely uncalled for.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     3.	  At the  most the  two incidents make out a case of
	  law and order and not a case of public order.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">944</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     4.	  In the  absence of  any allegation  in  the  first
	  information reports of the two incidents about the
	  apprehension of  the breach  of public  order from
	  the petitioners  the detaining authority could not
	  invent a  ground regarding  apprehension of breach
	  of public order from the petitioners.</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">     It may  be pointed	 out at	 the very  outset  that	 the
detaining  authority   was  alive   to	the  fact  that	 the
petitioners were  in jail custody on the date of the passing
of the	detention orders as will be clear from the following
statement in the grounds of detention:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  "The subject	is in  jail  and  is  likely  to  be
     released on  bail. In  the circumstances I am satisfied
     that if  he is  allowed to	 remain at  large,  he	will
     indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of
     public order."
</blockquote><p id="p_14">The position  would have  been	entirely  different  if	 the
petitioners were  in jail  and had  to remain  in jail for a
pretty long  time. In  such a  situation there	could be  no
apprehension  of   breach  of	'public	 order'	  from	 the
petitioners. But  the detaining authority was satisfied that
if the petitioners were enlarged on bail, of which there was
every likelihood,  they	 would	create	problems  of  public
order. It  was, therefore,  necessary to  prevent them	from
acting in any manner prejudicial to public order.
</p><p id="p_15">     As regards the contention that the criminal proceedings
as well	 as the	 proceedings for  preventive detention could
not go	together, it  may be  pointed  out  that  preventive
detention is  an anticipatory measure and does not relate to
an offence  while the  criminal proceedings  are to punish a
person for  an	offence	 committed  by	him.  They  are	 not
parallel proceedings. In the circumstances the pendency of a
criminal prosecution  is no  bar to  an order  of preventive
detention, nor	is an order of preventive detention a bar to
prosecution. It	 is for	 the detaining authority to have the
subjective satisfaction	 whether in  such a  case there	 are
sufficient materials  to place	the person  under preventive
detention in  order to	prevent him  from acting in a manner
prejudicial to public order or the like in future.
</p><p id="p_16">     The learned  counsel for  the petitioners	relied	upon
K.M. Chokshi  v. State	of  Gujarat(1)	in  support  of	 the
contention that in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">945</span>
view of	 the criminal prosecution of the petitioners for the
two incidents, proceedings for the preventive detention were
uncalled for.  In that	case the  Court after an analysis of
the various cases cited observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  The principles energing from a review of the above
     cases may	be summarised  in  the	following  way:	 The
     ordinary criminal	process is not to be circumvented or
     short-circuited   by   ready   resort   to	  preventive
     detention. But, the possibility of launching a criminal
     prosecution is  not an  absolute bar  to  an  order  of
     preventive detention.  Nor is it correct to say that if
     such possibility  is not  present to  the mind  of	 the
     detaining	authority   the	 order	 of   detention	  is
     necessarily bad.  However, the failure of the detaining
     authority to  consider the	 possibility of	 launching a
     criminal prosecution  may, in  the circumstances  of  a
     case,  lead   to  the  conclusion	that  the  detaining
     authority	had  not  applied  its	mind  to  the  vital
     question whether  it was  necessary to make an order of
     preventive detention."
</blockquote><p id="p_17">It is  obvious from  the above observation in the case cited
on behalf  of the  petitioners that  criminal prosecution is
not an	absolute bar to an order of preventive detention. If
the detaining authority has the subjective satisfaction that
it was	necessary to  detain the petitioners to prevent them
from indulging in activities prejudicial to public order, he
could certainly	 order detention  of the petitioners. In the
instant case  the detaining  authority clearly	stated	that
although the  petitioners were	in jail, they were likely to
be enlarged  on	 bail  and  in	that  case  there  would  be
apprehension from  the petitioners  regarding the  breach of
public order.
</p><p id="p_18">     This leads	 us to	the third  contention that  the	 two
incidents makes	 out a	case of law and order and not a case
of public  order. The difference between 'law and order' and
'public order'	is  by	now  well  settled.  <a href="/doc/630948/" id="a_17">In	 Ram  Ranjan
Chatterjee  v.	The  State  of	West  Bengal</a>(1)	 this  Court
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "It may be remembered that qualitatively, the acts
     which affect 'law and order' are not different from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">946</span>
     acts which	 affect 'public	 order'. Indeed,  a state of
     peace of  orderly	tranquillity  which  prevails  as  a
     result of	observance of  enforcement of  internal laws
     and regulations  by the Government, is a feature common
     to the  concept of	 'law and  order' and 'public order.
     Every kind	 of disorder or contravention of law affects
     that orderly  tranquillity. The distinction between the
     areas of  'law and order' and 'public order' as pointed
     out by  this Court	 in <a href="/doc/675104/" id="a_18">Arun  Ghosh	 v.  State  of	West
     Bengal</a>, "is  one of  degree and  extent of the reach of
     the act in question of society." It is the potentiality
     of the act to disturb the even tempo of the life of the
     community which makes it prejudicial to the maintenance
     of public	order. If the contravention in its effect is
     confined only to a few individuals directly involved as
     distinguished from	 a wide	 spectrum of  the public, it
     would raise  a problem  of law  and order	only.  These
     concentric concepts  of 'law  and	order'	and  'public
     order' may	 have a	 common 'epicentre',  but it  is the
     length, magnitude	and  intensity	of  the	 terror-wave
     unleashed by  a particular	 eruption of  disorder	that
     helps distinguish it as an act affecting 'public order'
     from that concerning 'law and order'."
</blockquote><p id="p_19">Applying the  well-settled law	on the	question we  have to
determine whether  the two incidents make out a case of 'law
and order'  or 'public	order'. It  was	 for  the  detaining
authority to have the subjective satisfaction that there was
apprehension of breach of public order from the petitioners.
In one	incident one  of the  petitioners threw	 a bomb in a
large gathering	 where a  cultural programme was going on at
the dead  of night  whereupon  the  public  started  running
helter and  skelter to	save their  lives. That	 will in our
opinion make  out a  case of 'public order' in as much as it
disturbed the tranquillity and the even tempo of life of the
public. The  second incident was also of the same nature. If
the detaining  authority in  the circumstances was satisfied
that the  two incidents	 make out  a case of apprehension of
breach of public order we find no infirmity in the order.
</p><p id="p_20">     Reliance  was  also  placed  upon	<a href="/doc/203168/" id="a_19">Jaya  Mala  v.	Home
Secretary, Govt.  of J.	 and K</a>.(1).  In	 that  case  also  a
criminal case was started on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">947</span>
the basis  of an incident and there being no suggestion that
the witnesses  were not	 forthcoming in	 connection with the
alleged infraction  of law  it	was  not  clear	 why  normal
procedure of  investigation, arrest  and trial was not found
adequate to  thwart the	 criminal activities  of the detenu,
and in	these circumstances  this Court	 held that there was
non-application of  mind of  the detaining  authority  which
became evident	from the  frivolity of	grounds on which the
detention order	 was founded.  The order  of detention	was,
therefore, invalid.  But this  Court did lay down the law in
the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "It is not for a moment suggested that power under
     the preventive  detention law cannot be exercised where
     a criminal conduct which could not be easily prevented,
     checked  or   thwarted,  would  not  provide  a  ground
     sufficient for detention under the preventive detention
     laws. But	it is equally important to bear in mind that
     every minor infraction of law cannot be upgraded to the
     height of an activity prejudicial to the maintenance of
     public order. If every infraction of law having a penal
     sanction by  itself is  a ground  for detention  danger
     looms  large   that  the  normal  criminal	 trials	 and
     criminal courts  set up  for administering justice will
     be substituted  by detention  laws often  described  as
     lawless law."
</blockquote><p id="p_21">The facts  of that  case were distinguishable from the facts
of the	present case.  In the  present	case  the  detaining
authority  had	the  subjective	 satisfaction  that  if	 the
petitioners are	 allowed  to  remain  at  large,  they	will
indulge in  activities prejudicial  to	the  maintenance  of
public order.
</p><p id="p_22">     Now the  question arises whether the two incidents were
sufficient  for	  the  detaining   authority   to   initiate
proceedings  for   preventive  detention.   It	is  for	 the
detaining authority  to	 have  the  subjective	satisfaction
about the  apprehension of  the breach	of the	public order
from the incidents mentioned above. Even one incident may be
sufficient  to	satisfy	 the  detaining	 authority.  It	 all
depends upon the nature of the incident. In the case in hand
the detaining  authority was  fully satisfied that there was
apprehension of	 breach of public order from the petitioners
in case	 they were  bailed out,	 of which  there  was  every
likelihood. This contention in our opinion has no force.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">948</span>
<p id="p_23">     This leads	 us to	the  last  contention  that  in	 the
absence of any allegation in the first information report in
the two	 cases about  the disturbance  of public  order	 the
detaining authority  could not invent a ground regarding the
apprehension from  the petitioners  about the disturbance of
public order.  A counter  affidavit has been filed on behalf
of the	detaining authority  and in  paragraph 3 it has been
averred that  apart from the first information report in the
two cases  there was  the supervision  note  of	 the  Deputy
Superintendent	of   Police,  Dhanbad	and  the   detaining
authority was satisfied on the basis of materials before him
that there  was apprehension  of breach of public order from
the petitioners.  The absence  of an  allegation  about	 the
disturbance of	public order  in the  two first	 information
reports will  not effect  the  position	 because  there	 was
