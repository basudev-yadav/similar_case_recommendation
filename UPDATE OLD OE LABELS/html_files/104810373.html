<p id="p_1">R.F. Nariman, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">       Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">1.     These appeals are from a judgment of the Delhi High

Court disposing off several appeals and cross appeals.   They


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                            2</span>
relate to two American Companies which are the assessees in

the present case, namely, e-Funds Corporation, USA (relating

to assessment years 2000-01 to 2002-03 and 2004-05 to 2007-
</p>
<p id="p_4">08) and e-Funds IT Solutions Group Inc., USA (relating to

assessment years 2000-01 to 2002-03 and 2005-06 to 2007-
</p>
<p id="p_5">08).   The appeals from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal

(ITAT) by the assessees were allowed by the High Court,

whereas cross-appeals by the department were rejected. After

framing several substantial questions of law, the High Court

narrated the undisputed facts as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       “6. Undisputed facts in brief may be first noticed.
       The assessees are companies incorporated in
       United States of America (USA, for short) and were
       residents of the said country. They were assessed
       and have paid taxes on their global income in USA.
       e-Fund Corp. was the holding company having
       almost 100% shares in IDLX Corporation, another
       company incorporated in USA. IDLX Corporation
       held almost 100% shares in IDLX International BV,
       incorporated in Netherlands and later in turn held
       almost 100% shares in IDLX Holding BV, which was
       a subsidiary again incorporated in Netherlands.</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">       IDLX Holding BV was almost a 100% shareholder of
       e-Funds International India Private Limited, a
       company incorporated and resident of India (e-Fund
       International India Private Limited has been
       described as ‘e-Fund India’). IDLX International BV
       was also the parent/holding company having almost

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                             3</span>
100% shares in e-Fund Inc., which as noticed
above, was a company incorporated in USA.
</p><p id="p_7">7. Both e-Fund Inc. and e-Fund Corp. have entered
into international transactions with e-Fund India.
The details of these transactions have to be
examined in depth and have to be referred below.
e-Fund India being a domestic company and
resident in India was taxed on the income earned in
India as well as its global income in accordance with
the provisions of the Act. The international
transactions between the assessees and e-Fund
India and the income of e-Fund India, it is accepted,
were made subject matter of arms length pricing
adjudication by the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO,
for short) and the Assessing Officer (AO, for short)
in the returns of income filed by e-Fund India. We
are not primarily concerned with the merits of the
computation of income declared and assessed in
the hands of e-Fund India in the present appeals,
though the factum that e-Fund India was assessed
to tax on its global income as per law or on arms
length pricing in relation to associated transactions
and the basis of the said computation of income
earned by e-Fund India, as noticed below, is a
relevant and an important fact. Revenue has not
disputed the said legal position. It is the contention
of the Revenue that income of the two assessees
were attributable to India because the two
assessees had PE in India and should be taxed in
India, irrespective of whether the said assessees
had paid taxes in USA. Income earned and taxed in
the hands of e-Fund India was different from the
income attributable to the two assessees. Thus the
balance or differential amount, i.e., income
attributable to the two assessees, which was not
included in income earned and taxed in the hands
of e-Fund India, should be taxed in India.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                         4</span>
<p id="p_8">     8. As a principle what is stated and submitted by the
     Revenue cannot be contested and in fact not
     contested by the assessees as it is a principle
     applicable to international taxation. A foreign or a
     non-resident company can be taxed in the country
     where it has a subsidiary, which is also a PE on the
     income attributable to the said PE, even if the
     subsidiary (in the present case of e-Fund India) is
     being taxed in the said country. The principle being
     that subsidiary being an independent and a distinct
     entity is taxed for its income, whereas the foreign
     entity, i.e., holding company is taxed for the income
     earned by the said independent entity attributable to
     the PE in the country where subsidiary is situated.
     The income of the subsidiary is not taxed in the
     hands of the non-resident principal and vice-versa.
     Thus, there is no double taxation in the hands of the
     holding company as income of the subsidiary is not
     taxed as income of foreign holding assessee. The
     principle is that a subsidiary constitutes an
     independent legal entity for the purpose of taxation.”


</p><p id="p_9">2.   The assessing authority decided that the assessees had

a permanent establishment (hereinafter referred to as PE) as

they had a fixed place where they carried on their own business

in Delhi, and that, consequently, <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_1">Article 5</a> of the India U.S.
</p>
<p id="p_10">Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement of 1990 (hereinafter

referred to as DTAA) was attracted. Consequently, the

assessees were liable to pay tax in respect of what they earned

from the aforesaid fixed place PE in India. The CIT (Appeals)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                              5</span>
dismissed the appeals of the assessees holding that <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_2">Article 5</a>

was attracted, not only because there was a fixed place where

the assessees carried on their business, but also because they

were “service PEs” and “agency PEs” under <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_3">Article 5.</a>       In an

appeal to the ITAT, the ITAT held that the CIT (Appeals) was

right in holding that a “fixed place PE” and “service PE” had

been made out under <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_4">Article 5</a>, but said nothing about the

“agency PE” as that was not argued by the Revenue before the

ITAT. However, the ITAT, on a calculation formula different

from that of the CIT (Appeals), arrived at a nil figure of income

for all the relevant assessment years. The appeal of the

assessees to the High Court proved successful and the High

Court, by an elaborate judgment, has set aside the findings of

all the authorities referred to above, and further dismissed the

cross-appeals of the Revenue. Consequently, the Revenue is

before us in these appeals.
</p>

<p id="p_11">3.   The learned Attorney General, Shri K.K. Venugopal, has

argued before us that, under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_5">Article 5(1)</a> of the DTAA, a fixed

place PE has been made out on the facts of these cases, and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                6</span>
relied heavily upon the United States Securities and Exchange

Commission Form 10K of e-Funds Corp. dated 31st March,

2003. According to the learned Attorney General:
</p>

<p id="p_12">•     Most of the employees are in India (In fact, the High

Court records that 40% of the employees of the entire group

are in India).
</p>
<p id="p_13">•     eFunds Corp has call centers and software development

centers only in India.
</p>
<p id="p_14">•     eFunds Corp is essentially doing marketing work only

and its contracts with clients are assigned, or sub-contracted to

eFunds India.
</p>
<p id="p_15">•     The master services agreement between the American

and the Indian entity gives complete control to the American

entity in regard to personnel employed by the Indian entity.
</p>
<p id="p_16">•     It is only through the proprietary database and software

of eFunds Corp, that eFunds India carries out its functions for

eFunds Corp (The High Court records that the software,

intangible data etc is provided free of cost and then states that

this is irrelevant).
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                7</span>
<p id="p_17">•     The Corporate office of eFunds India houses an

‘International Division’ comprising the President’s office and a

sales team servicing EFI and eFunds group entities in the

United Kingdom, South East Asia, Australia and Venezuela.
</p>
<p id="p_18">The President’s office primarily oversees operations of eFunds

India and eFunds group entities overseas. The sales team

undertakes marketing efforts for affiliate entities also.
</p>
<p id="p_19">•     The CIT(A) has referred to the Transfer Pricing Report

which says that eFunds India provides management support

and marketing support services to eFunds Corp group

companies outside India. Regarding supervision of personnel

rendering the services, the TP Report states as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      “The President’s office manages the operations of

      eFunds India and eFunds group entities in UK and

      Australia and accordingly, employees of these

      entities report to the President. The President’s

      overall reporting is to EFC.</blockquote>

<p id="p_20">      Though the personnel rendering marketing services

      are employees of EFI, they report to overseas group



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                               8</span>
       entities to the extent that they are engaged in

       rendering services to such entities.”

Applying the above facts, it is submitted that the assessees

satisfy the requirements of a fixed place PE. The Supreme

Court in the recent judgment in <a href="/doc/23544710/" id="a_6">Formula One World

Championship Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax,

International Taxation-3, Delhi and others</a>, (2017) SCC

Online SC 474 has held that “it universally accepted that for

ascertaining whether there is a fixed place or not, PE must

have     three   characteristics:   stability,   productivity   and

dependence. Further, fixed place of business connotes

existence of a physical location which is at the disposal of the

enterprise through which the business is carried on.” It was

further held that “the physically located premises have to be ‘at

the disposal’ of the enterprise” and that “the place will be

treated as ‘at the disposal’ of the enterprise when the enterprise

has right to use the said place and has control thereupon.
</p>
<p id="p_21">Consequently, he argued that physically located premises are

“at the disposal” of the assessees with the degree of

permanence required, namely, the entire year. In addition, he

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                  9</span>
argued that the High Court was in error in holding that the place

of management PE under <a href="/doc/360703/" id="a_7">Article 5(2)(a)</a> was prima facie made

out, but since the said provision had not been invoked and

requires factual determination, Revenue’s argument was

dismissed on this score. Further, under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_8">Article 5(2)(l)</a> of the

DTAA, he argued that a service PE is clearly made out on facts

because:
</p>
<p id="p_22">•    As per the consolidated Annual Report of eFunds Corp,

most of the employees are in India. eFunds Corp has call

centers and software development centers only in India.
</p>
<p id="p_23">•    eFunds Corp is essentially doing marketing work only

and its contracts with clients are assigned, or sub-contracted

to eFunds India.
</p>
<p id="p_24">•    Regarding supervision of personnel rendering the

services, the TP Report states as follows:

     eFunds India and eFunds group entities in UK and

     Australia and accordingly, employees of these

     entities report to the President. The President’s

<p id="p_25">      Though the personnel rendering marketing services

      are employees of EFI, they report to overseas group

      entities to the extent that they are engaged in

      rendering services to such entities.”

•     The Master sub-contractor agreement between eFunds

Corp and eFunds India discussed in the CIT(A)’s order

provides in clause 1.1(a) as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      “Subcontractors personnel assigned to work with

      eFunds IT or Customers located in the United

      States shall be directed by eFunds IT or by

      Subcontractors supervisor acting at the direction of

      eFunds IT. In the event Subcontractors personnel

      are assigned to perform such services in India, the

      Subcontractor shall supervise such work, acting at

      the direction of eFunds IT. eFunds IT shall be the

      sole judge of performance and capability of each of

      subcontractors personnel and may request the

      removal of one or more of Subcontractors personnel

      from a project covered by any statement of work as

      follows.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                             11</span>
•    It is submitted that the personnel engaged in providing

these services were ostensibly the employees of eFunds India

but were de facto working under the control and supervision of

eFunds Corp. In this regard, reference was made to Para 17 of

the judgment in <a href="/doc/584977/" id="a_9">DIT v. Morgan Stanley</a> (2007) 7 SCC 1,

where the Court held:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     “17……It is important to note that where the

     activities of the multinational enterprise entails it

     being responsible for the work of deputationists and

     the employees continue to be on the payroll of the

     multinational enterprise or they continue to have

     their lien on their jobs with the multinational

     enterprise, a service PE can emerge.”

•    Furthermore, the AO in the Assessment Order has

observed that eFunds Corp has seconded two employees to

eFunds India and these employees worked as Sr. Director-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">Technical Services and Country Head-Business Development.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">The activities of the seconded employees go beyond mere

‘stewardship activities’ in terms of Morgan Stanley.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                             12</span>
<p id="p_27">•     The term ‘Other Personnel’ has to be seen in the context

of the facts of this case which show that eFunds India was not

an independent subsidiary.
</p>


<p id="p_28">Further, he also argued that a dependent agent PE was made

out under Articles 5(4) and 5(5), there being a concurrent

finding of facts of the CIT (Appeals) and ITAT in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_29">Also, according to the learned Attorney General, since the

assessees failed to furnish information when sought for, an

adverse inference was sought to be drawn against them and

that, therefore, it is clear that once this inference is drawn, the

burden shifts on to the assessees, which they will then have

failed to discharge.
</p>

<p id="p_30">4.    The learned Attorney General also relied heavily upon an

admission made under the mutual agreement procedure (MAP)

under <a href="/doc/211413/" id="a_10">Article 27</a> of the DTAA, in which, for the assessment year

2003-04 qua e-Funds Corp., and assessment years 2003-04

and 2004-05 qua e-Funds IT Solution Inc., the assessees have

admitted that income tax will be attributable “to the Indian PEs”


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                 13</span>
based on a certain ratio and that, therefore, it is clear that this

admission would continue to bind the assessees in all

subsequent years as there was no change in the factual

position.
</p>

<p id="p_31">5.    As against this, Shri S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel

for the respondents, has argued that the tests for whether there

is a fixed place PE have now been settled by the judgment of

this Court in Formula One (supra), and that it is clear that for a

fixed place PE, it must be necessary that the said fixed place

must be “at the disposal” of the assessees, which means that

the assessees must have a right to use the premises for the

purpose of their own business, which has not been made out in

the facts of this case. He further argued that, on the facts of

this case, both the US companies as well as the Indian

company pay income tax, and the Transfer Pricing Officer by

his order dated 22nd February, 2006, has specifically held that

whatever is paid under various agreements between the US

companies and the Indian company are on arm’s length pricing

and that, this being the case, even if a fixed place PE is found,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                 14</span>
once arm’s length price is paid, the US companies go out of the

dragnet of Indian taxation.   He also adverted to <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_11">Article 5(6)</a> to

state that the mere fact that a 100% subsidiary may be carrying

on business in India does not by itself means that the holding

company would have a PE in India. Further, according to

learned counsel, so far as the service PE is concerned, even

the assessing officer did not find that such a PE existed.
</p>
<p id="p_32">According to him, under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_12">Article 5(2)(l</a>), it is necessary that the

foreign enterprises must provide services to customers who are

in India, which is not Revenue’s case as all their customers

exist only outside India.     Further, according to the learned

counsel, the entire personnel engaged in the Indian operations

are employed only by the Indian company and the fact that the

US companies may indirectly control such employees is only for

purposes of protecting their own interest. Ultimately, there are

four businesses that the assessees are engaged in, namely,

ATM Management Services, Electronic Payment Management,

Decision   Support    and     Risk   Management     and   Global

Outsourcing and Professional Services.          Since all these

businesses are carried on outside India and the property

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                               15</span>
through which these businesses are carried out, namely ATM

networks, software solutions and other hardware networks and

information technology infrastructure were all located outside

India, the activities of e-Funds India are independent business

activities on which, as has been noticed by the High Court,

independent profits are made and income assessed to tax

under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">Income Tax Act</a>.    According to the learned counsel,

“agency PE” was never argued before the assessing officer and

even before the ITAT. Therefore, no factual foundation for the

same has been laid. Equally, according to the learned counsel,

the settlement procedure availed for the assessment years in

</p><p id="p_76">10.   <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_29">The Income Tax Act</a>, in particular <a href="/doc/68317/" id="a_30">Section 90</a> thereof,

does not speak of the concept of a PE. This is a creation only

of the DTAA.     By virtue of <a href="/doc/839152/" id="a_31">Article 7(1)</a> of the DTAA, the

business income of companies which are incorporated in the

US will be taxable only in the US, unless it is found that they

were PEs in India, in which event their business income, to the

extent to which it is attributable to such PEs, would be taxable

in India. <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_32">Article 5</a> of the DTAA set out hereinabove provides for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                              25</span>
three distinct types of PEs with which we are concerned in the

present case: fixed place of business PE under Articles 5(1)

and 5(2)(a) to 5(2)(k); service PE under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_33">Article 5(2)(l)</a> and

agency PE under <a href="/doc/1744360/" id="a_34">Article 5(4).</a> Specific and detailed criteria are

set out in the aforesaid provisions in order to fulfill the

conditions of these PEs existing in India. The burden of proving

the fact that a foreign assessee has a PE in India and must,

therefore, suffer tax from the business generated from such PE

is initially on the Revenue. With these prefatory remarks, let us

analyse whether the respondents can be brought within any of

the sub-clauses of <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_35">Article 5.</a>
</p>

<p id="p_77">11.   Since the Revenue originally relied on fixed place of

business PE, this will be tackled first. Under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_36">Article 5(1</a>), a PE

means a fixed place of business through which the business of

an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. What is a “fixed

place of business” is no longer res integra. In Formula One

(supra), this Court, after setting out <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_37">Article 5</a> of the DTAA, held

as follows:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                26</span>
<p id="p_78">“32. The principal test, in order to ascertain as to
whether an establishment has a fixed place of
business or not, is that such physically located
premises have to be ‘at the disposal’ of the
enterprise. For this purpose, it is not necessary that
the premises are owned or even rented by the
enterprise. It will be sufficient if the premises are put
at the disposal of the enterprise. However, merely
giving access to such a place to the enterprise for
the purposes of the project would not suffice. The
place would be treated as ‘at the disposal’ of the
enterprise when the enterprise has right to use the
said place and has control thereupon.
</p>
<p id="p_79">xxx xxx xxx


</p><p id="p_80">34. According to Philip Baker, the aforesaid
illustrations confirm that the fixed place of business
need not be owned or leased by the foreign
enterprise, provided that is at the disposal of the
enterprise in the sense of having some right to use
the premises for the purposes of its business and
not solely for the purposes of the project undertaken
on behalf of the owner of the premises.
</p><p id="p_81">35. Interpreting the OECD <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_38">Article 5</a> pertaining to PE,
Klaus Vogel has remarked that insofar as the term
‘business’ is concerned, it is broad, vague and of
little relevance for the PE definition. According to
him, the crucial element is the term ‘place’.
Importance of the term ‘place’ is explained by him in
the following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">      “In conjunction with the attribute ‘fixed’,
      the requirement of a place reflects the
      strong link between the land and the
      taxing powers of the State. This
      territorial link serves as the basis not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                            27</span>
     only for the distributive rules which are
     tied to the existence of PE but also for a
     considerable       number      of    other
     distributive rules and, above all, for the
     assignment of a person to either
     Contracting State on the basis of
     residence (<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_39">Article 1</a>, read in conjunction
     with <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_40">Article 4</a> OECD and UN MC).”
</blockquote><p id="p_82">36. We would also like to extract below the
definition to the expression ‘place’ by Vogel, which
is as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">     “A place is a certain amount of space
     within the soil or on the soil. This
     understanding of place as a three-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">     dimensional zone rather than a single
     point on the earth can be derived from
     the French Version (‘installation fixe’) as
     well as the term ‘establishment’. As a
     rule, this zone is based on a certain
     area in, on, or above the surface of the
     earth. Rooms or technical equipment
     above the soil may qualify as a PE only
     if they are fixed on the soil. This
     requirement, however, stems from the
     term ‘fixed’ rather than the term ‘place’,
     given that a place (or space) does not
     necessarily consist of a piece of land.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">     On       the     contrary,    the     term
     ‘establishment’ makes clear that it is not
     the soil as such which is the PE but that
     the PE is constituted by a tangible
     facility as distinct from the soil. This is
     particularly evident from the French
     version of <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_41">Article 5(1)</a> OECD MC which
     uses the term ‘installation’ instead of
     ‘place’.</blockquote>
<p id="p_83">     The term ‘place’ is used to define the
     term ‘establishment’. Therefore, ‘place’
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                       28</span>
includes all tangible assets used for
carrying on the business, but one such
tangible asset can be sufficient. The
characterization of such assets under
private law as real property rather than
personal property (in common law
countries) or immovable rather than
movable property (in civil law countries)
is not authoritative. It is rather the
context (including, above all, the terms
‘fixed’/‘fixe’), as well as the object and
purpose of <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_42">Article 5</a> OECD and UN MC
itself, in the light of which the term
‘place’ needs to be interpreted. This
approach, which follows from the
general rules on treaty interpretation,
gives a certain leeway for including
movable property in the understanding
of ‘place’ and, therefore, we assume a
PE once such property has been ‘fixed’
to the soil.
</p><p id="p_84">For example, a work bench in a
caravan, restaurants on permanently
anchored river boats, steady oil rigs, or
a transformator or generator on board a
former railway wagon qualify as places
(and may also be ‘fixed’).
</p><p id="p_85">In contrast, purely intangible property
cannot qualify in any case. In particular,
rights such as participations in a
corporation, claims, bundles of claims
(like bank accounts), any other type of
intangible property (patents, software,
trademarks etc.) or intangible economic
assets (a regular clientele or the
goodwill of an enterprise) do not in
themselves constitute a PE. They can
only form part of PE constituted

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                             29</span>
otherwise. Likewise, an internet website
(being a combination of software and
other electronic data) does not
constitute   tangible   property     and,
therefore, does not constitute a PE.
</p><p id="p_86">Neither does the mere incorporation of a
company in a Contracting State in itself
constitute a PE of the company in that
State. Where a company has its seat,
according to its by-laws and/or
registration, in State A while the POEM
is situated in State B, this company will
usually be liable to tax on the basis of its
worldwide income in both Contracting
States under their respective domestic
tax law. Under the A-B treaty, however,
the company will be regarded as a
resident of State B only (<a href="/doc/1693108/" id="a_43">Article 4(3)</a>
OECD and UN MC). In the absence of
both actual facilities and a dependent
agent in State A, income of this
company will be taxable only in State B
under the 1st sentence of <a href="/doc/839152/" id="a_44">Article 7(1)</a>
OECD and UN MC.
</p><p id="p_87">There is no minimum size of the piece of
land. Where the qualifying business
activities consist (in full or in part) of
human activities by the taxpayer, his
employees or representatives, the mere
space needed for the physical presence
of these individuals is not sufficient (if it
were sufficient, <a href="/doc/500306/" id="a_45">Article 5(5)</a> OECD MC
and <a href="/doc/500306/" id="a_46">Article 5(5)(a)</a> UN MC and the
notion of agent PEs were superfluous).
This can be illustrated by the example of
a salesman who regularly visits a major
customer to take orders, and conducts
meetings in the purchasing director's

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                30</span>
     office. The OECD MC Comm. has
     convincingly denied the existence of a
     PE, based on the implicit understanding
     that the relevant geographical unit is not
     just the chair where the salesman sits,
     but the entire office of the customer, and
     the office is not at the disposal of the
     enterprise for which the salesman is
     working.”
</p><p id="p_88">37. Taking cue from the word ‘through’ in the Article,
Vogel has also emphasised that the place of
business qualifies only if the place is ‘at the
disposal’ of the enterprise. According to him, the
enterprise will not be able to use the place of
business as an instrument for carrying on its
business unless it controls the place of business to
a considerable extent. He hastens to add that there
are no absolute standards for the modalities and
intensity of control. Rather, the standards depend
on the type of business activity at issue. According
to him, ‘disposal’ is the power (or a certain fraction
thereof) to use the place of business directly. Some
of the instances given by Vogel in this behalf, of
relative standards of control, are as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">     “The degree of control depends on the
     type of business activity that the
     taxpayer carries on. It is therefore not
     necessary that the taxpayer is able to
     exclude others from entering or using
     the POB.</blockquote>
<p id="p_89">     The painter example in the OECD MC
     Comm. (no. 4.5 OECD MC Comm. on
     <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_47">Article 5</a>) (however questionable it might
     be with regard to the functional
     integration test) suggests that the type
     and extent of control need not exceed
     the level of what is required for the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                         31</span>
specific type of activity which is
determined by the concrete business.
By contrast, in the case of a self-
</p><p id="p_90">employed engineer who had free access
to his customer's premises to perform
the services required by his contract, the
Canadian Federal Court of Appeal ruled
that the engineer had no control
because he had access only during the
customer's regular office hours and was
not entitled to carry on businesses of his
own on the premises.
</p><p id="p_91">Similarly, a Special Bench of Delhi's
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal denied
the existence of a PE in the case
of Ericsson. The Tribunal held that it
was not sufficient that Ericsson's
employees had access to the premises
of Indian mobile phone providers to
deliver the hardware, software and
know-how required for operating a
network. By contrast, in the case of a
competing enterprise, the Bench did
assume an Indian PE because the
employees of that enterprise (unlike
Ericsson's)   had     exercised  other
businesses of their employer.
</p><p id="p_92">The OECD view can hardly be
reconciled with the two court cases. All
three examples do indeed shed some
light onto the method how the relative
standards for the control threshold
should be designed. While the OECD
MC Comm. suggests that it is sufficient
to require not more than the type and
extent of control necessary for the
specific business activity which the
taxpayer wants to exercise in the source
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                             32</span>
State, the Canadian and Indian
decisions advocate for stricter standards
for the control threshold.
</p><p id="p_93">The OECD MC shows a paramount
tendency (though no strict rule) that PEs
should be treated like subsidiaries (cf.
<a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_48">Article 24(3)</a> OECD and UN MC), and
that facilities of a subsidiary would rarely
been unusable outside the office hours
of one of its customers (i.e. a third
person), the view of the two courts is still
more convincing.
</p><p id="p_94">Along these lines, a POB will usually
exist only where the taxpayer is free to
use the POB:
</p><p id="p_95">- at any time of his own choice;
</p><p id="p_96">- for work relating to more than one
customer; and
</p><p id="p_97">- for his internal administrative and
bureaucratic work.
</p><p id="p_98">In all, the taxpayer will usually be
regarded as controlling the POB only
where he can employ it at his discretion.
This does not imply that the standards
of the control test should not be flexible
and adaptive. Generally, the less
invasive the activities are, and the more
they allow a parallel use of the same
POB by other persons, the lower are the
requirements under the control test.
There are, however, a number of
traditional PEs which by their nature
require an exclusive use of the POB by
only one taxpayer and/or his personnel.
A small workshop (cf. <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_49">Article 5(2)(e)</a>
OECD and UN MC) of 10 or 12 square

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                               33</span>
            meters can hardly be used by more than
            one person. The same holds true for a
            room where the taxpayer runs a noisy
            machine.”
</p><p id="p_99">      38. OECD commentary on Model Tax Convention
      mentions that a general definition of the term ‘PE’
      brings out its essential characteristics, i.e. a distinct
      “situs”, a “fixed place of business”. This definition,
      therefore, contains the following conditions:
</p><p id="p_100">      - the existence of a “place of business”, i.e. a facility
      such as premises or, in certain instances,
      machinery or equipment;
</p><p id="p_101">      - this place of business must be “fixed”, i.e. it must
      be established at a distinct place with a certain
      degree of permanence;
</p><p id="p_102">      - the carrying on of the business of the enterprise
      through this fixed place of business. This means
      usually that persons who, in one way or another,
      are dependent on the enterprise (personnel)
      conduct the business of the enterprise in the State
      in which the fixed place is situated.”


</p><p id="p_103">12.   Thus, it is clear that there must exist a fixed place of

business in India, which is at the disposal of the US companies,

through which they carry on their own business.         There is, in

fact, no specific finding in the assessment order or the appellate

orders that applying the aforesaid tests, any fixed place of

business has been put at the disposal of these companies. The

assessing officer, CIT (Appeals) and the ITAT have essentially


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                  34</span>
adopted a fundamentally erroneous approach in saying that

they were contracting with a 100% subsidiary and were

outsourcing business to such subsidiary, which resulted in the

creation of a PE. The High Court has dealt with this aspect in

some detail in which it held:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      “49. The Assessing Officer, Commissioner
      (Appeals) and the tribunal have primarily relied
      upon the close association between e-Fund India
      and the two assessees and applied functions
      performed, assets used and risk assumed, criteria
      to determine whether or not the assessee has fixed
      place of business. This is not a proper and
      appropriate test to determine location PE. The fixed
      place of business PE test is different. Therefore, the
      fact that e-Fund India provides various services to
      the assessee and was dependent for its earning
      upon the two assessees is not the relevant test to
      determine and decide location PE. The allegation
      that e-Fund India did not bear sufficient risk is
      irrelevant when deciding whether location PE exists.
      The fact that e-Fund India was reimbursed the cost
      of the call centre operations plus 16% basis or the
      basis of margin fixation was not known, is not
      relevant for determining location or fixed place PE.</blockquote>
<p id="p_104">      Similarly what were the direct or indirect costs and
      corporate allocations in software development
      centre or BPO does not help or determine location
      PE. Assignment or sub-contract to e-Fund India is
      not a factor or rule which is to be applied to
      determine applicability of <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_50">Article 5(1).</a> Further
      whether or not any provisions for intangible software
      was made or had been supplied free of cost is not

      separate entity and was/is entitled to provide
      services to the assessees who were/are
      independent separate taxpayers. Indian entity i.e.
      subsidiary company will not become location PE
      under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_51">Article 5(1)</a> merely because there is
      interaction or cross transactions between the Indian
      subsidiary and the foreign Principal under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_52">Article
      5(1).</a> Even if the foreign entities have saved and
      reduced their expenditure by transferring business
      or back office operations to the Indian subsidiary, it
      would not by itself create a fixed place or location
      PE. The manner and mode of the payment of
      royalty or associated transactions is not a test which
      can be applied to determine, whether fixed place PE
      exists.”


</p><p id="p_105">13.   It further went on to hold that the ITAT’s finding that the

assessees were a joint venture or sort of partnership with the

Indian subsidiary was wholly incorrect.     Also, none of these

arguments have been invoked by the Revenue and such a

finding would, therefore, be perverse. After citing Klaus Vogel

on Double Taxation Conventions, Arvid A. Skaar in Permanent

Establishment: Erosion of a Tax Treaty Principle and Bollinger

vs. Commissioner, 108 S.Ct. 1173, the High Court found

against the Revenue, holding that there is no fixed place PE on

the facts of the present case. We agree with the findings of the

High Court in this regard.

<p id="p_106">14. Reliance placed by the Revenue on the United States

Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10K Report, as

has been correctly pointed out by the High Court, is also

misplaced. It is clear that the report speaks of the e-Funds

only from going through the said report, but also from the

consolidated financial statements appended to the report, which

show the assets of the group worldwide.

eFunds US is an independent provider of ATMs and
it places ATMs in convenience, grocery, general
merchandise, and drug stores as well as gas
stations located throughout the United States and
Canada. The ATMs run on an operating software
which is generally owned by the original ATM
manufacturer whereas the datacentre, to which
such ATMs are connected, operate on the software
platforms such as ‘Connex’ which have been
developed and maintained by eFunds US.

transactions for regional ATM networks in the
United States. They also provide transaction
processing for retail point of sale (“POS”) terminals
that accept payments from debit cards and paper
cheques that have been converted into electronic

electronically transferring money from a person’s
checking or savings account according to his or her
instructions. To carry out the tasks required, each
ATM or POS device is typically connected to
several computer networks. None of these networks
is installed in India. These networks include private
networks that connect the devices of a single
owner, shared networks that serve several device
owners in a region, and national shared networks
that provide access to devices across regions. Each
shared network has numerous financial institution
members. eFunds US provides its Customers with
access across multiple networks.

<p id="p_113">eFunds US’s Government services EBT (Electronic
Benefits Transfer) business was started in response
to federal mandates that require state and local
Governmental agencies to convert to electronic
payment methods for the distribution of benefits
under entitlement programs, primarily food stamps
and Transitional Aid to Needy Families. The EBT

</p>
<p id="p_131">This outsourcing of work to India would not give rise to a fixed

place PE and the High Court judgment is, therefore, correct on

this score.
</p>

<p id="p_132">17.   Insofar as a service PE is concerned, the requirement of

<a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_53">Article 5(2)(l)</a> of the DTAA is that an enterprise must furnish

services “within India” through employees or other personnel.
</p>
<p id="p_133">In this regard, this Court has held, in Morgan Stanley (supra),

as follows:
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                              45</span>
<p id="p_134">“16. <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_54">Article 5(2)(l)</a> of DTAA applies in cases where
MNE furnishes services within India and those
services are furnished through its employees. In the
present case we are concerned with two activities,
namely, stewardship activities and the work to be
performed by deputationists in India as employees
of MSAS. A customer like MSCo who has worldwide
operations is entitled to insist on quality control and
confidentiality from the service provider. For
example in the case of software PE a server stores
the data which may require confidentiality. A service
provider may also be required to act according to
the quality control specifications imposed by its
customer. It may be required to maintain
confidentiality. Stewardship activities involve
briefing of the MSAS staff to ensure that the output
meets the requirements of MSCo. These activities
include monitoring of the outsourcing operations at
MSAS. The object is to protect the interest of
MSCo. These stewards are not involved in day-to-
day management or in any specific services to be
undertaken by MSAS. The stewardship activity is
basically to protect the interest of the customer. In
the present case as held hereinabove MSAS is a
service PE. It is in a sense a service provider. A
customer is entitled to protect its interest both in
terms of confidentiality and in terms of quality
control. In such a case it cannot be said that MSCo
has been rendering the services to MSAS. In our
view MSCo is merely protecting its own interests in
the competitive world by ensuring the quality and
confidentiality of MSAS services. We do not agree
with the ruling of AAR that the stewardship activity
would fall under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_55">Article 5(2)(l).</a> To this extent we find

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                           46</span>
merit in the civil appeal filed by the appellant
(MSCo) and accordingly its appeal to that extent
stands partly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_135">17. As regards the question of deputation, we are of
the view that an employee of MSCo when deputed
to MSAS does not become an employee of MSAS.
A deputationist has a lien on his employment with
MSCo. As long as the lien remains with MSCo the
said     company      retains    control    over   the
deputationist’s terms and employment. The concept
of a service PE finds place in the UN Convention. It
is constituted if the multinational enterprise renders
services through its employees in India provided the
services are rendered for a specified period. In this
case, it extends to two years on the request of
MSAS. It is important to note that where the
activities of the multinational enterprise entails it
being responsible for the work of deputationists and
the employees continue to be on the payroll of the
multinational enterprise or they continue to have
their lien on their jobs with the multinational
enterprise, a service PE can emerge.
</p>
<p id="p_136">18. Applying the above tests to the facts of this case
we find that on request/requisition from MSAS the
applicant deputes its staff. The request comes from
MSAS depending upon its requirement. Generally,
occasions do arise when MSAS needs the expertise
of the staff of MSCo. In such circumstances,
generally, MSAS makes a request to MSCo. A
deputationist under such circumstances is expected
to be experienced in banking and finance. On
completion of his tenure he is repatriated to his
parent job. He retains his lien when he comes to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                         47</span>
      India. He lends his experience to MSAS in India as
      an employee of MSCo as he retains his lien and in
      that sense there is a service PE (MSAS) under
      <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_56">Article 5(2)(l).</a> We find no infirmity in the ruling of
      ARR on this aspect. In the above situation, MSCo is
      rendering services through its employees to MSAS.
      Therefore, the Department is right in its contention
      that under the above situation there exists a service
      PE in India (MSAS). Accordingly, the civil appeal
      filed by the Department stands partly allowed.”

</p><p id="p_137">18.   It has already been seen that none of the customers of

the assessees are located in India or have received any

services in India. This being the case, it is clear that the very

first ingredient contained in <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_57">Article 5(2)(l)</a> is not satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_138">However, the learned Attorney General, relying upon paragraph

42.31 of the OECD Commentary, has argued that services

have to be furnished within India, which does not mean that

they have to be furnished to customers in India. Para 42.31 of

the OECD Commentary reads as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      “Whether or not the relevant services are furnished
      to a resident of a state does not matter: what
      matters is that the services are performed in the
      State through an individual present in that State.”


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                                               48</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_139">19.   Based upon the said paragraph, Shri Venugopal has

argued that in assessment year 2005-06, two employees of the

American firm were seconded in India and that, therefore, it is

clear that management of the American company through these

employees has obviously taken place.        The High Court, in

dealing with this contention, has found as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      “62. The appellants had pleaded before the
      authorities and the tribunal that prior to assessment
      year 2005-06 not even a single employee of the
      assessee ever visited India even for a short period
      and in 2005-06, two employees of e-Fund were
      transferred to e-Fund India and that the entire
      expenditure for these two employees were borne by
      e-Fund India. No employees were present in India
      after 2005-06. Presence of employees in India is
      relevant under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_58">Article 5(2)(l)</a> but the said employees
      should furnish services within the contracting State.</blockquote>
<p id="p_140">      These services should not be mere stewardship
      services. The Assessing Officer has recorded that
      employees were seconded to e-Fund India but the
      functions they performed and whether they
      performed functions and reported to e-Fund
      Corp/associated enterprise was not known or
      ascertained. This was not the correct way of
      determining and deciding whether service PE
      existed. Whether the seconded employees were
      performing stewardship services or were directly
      involved with the working operations was relevant. It
      is also not known whether the services were
      performed related to services provided to an
      associated enterprise in which case clause 5(2)(l)(ii)
      would be applicable. In the said situation, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                               49</span>
question of attribution of income etc. would also
arise.
</p><p id="p_141">63. Two employees of e-Fund Corp were deputed to
e-Fund India in the assessment years 2005-06. The
case of the assessee and e-Fund India is that they
were deputed to look towards development of
domestic work in India. Payment of these
employees as per the Revenue to the extent of 25%
was borne by e-Fund India and balance 75% was
borne by e-Fund Corp. The Assessing Officer on
this basis has observed that this reduced cost base
of e-Fund India as remuneration was paid by e-
Fund Corp and the said employees were at liberty
to perform functions of e-Fund Corp even while
working for e-Fund India. The response of the
assessee as quoted in the assessment order was
that e-Fund India, apart from export activities had
also domestic business in India. This was evident
from the return of income filed by e-Fund India
where domestic income was computed separately
as it was not eligible for deduction under <a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_59">Section
10A</a> of the Act. Copy of the return was furnished. It
was further stated that cost of personnel seconded
in India was fully borne by e-Fund India i.e. 100% of
the salary paid to the said employees seconded to
India were debited to profit and loss accounts. 75%
of the salary component was paid abroad by e-Fund
Corp but the same was reimbursed by e-Fund India.
This was in accordance with and permitted under
the Indian Exchange Control Regulations. It was
further stated that the Assessing Officer was wrong
in assuming that the two seconded employees were
at liberty to function for e-Fund Corp while they
were working for e-Fund India. The seconded
employees were working under the control and
supervision of e-Fund India. The Assessing Officer
thereupon has not commented on the reply of the
assessee, though he has recorded comments in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                        50</span>
      respect of replies to other issues raised by him (see
      paragraph 7 of the assessment order). The
      aforesaid factual assertion made by the assessee,
      therefore, was not negated or questioned by the
      Assessing Officer.”


</p><p id="p_142">20.   We entirely agree with the approach of the High Court in

this regard. <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_60">Article 42.31</a> of the OECD Commentary does not

mean that services need not be rendered by the foreign

assessees in India. If any customer is rendered a service in

India, whether resident in India or outside India, a “service PE”

would be established in India.      As has been noticed by us

hereinabove, no customer, resident or otherwise, receives any

service in India from the assessees. All its customers receive

services only in locations outside India. Only auxiliary

operations that facilitate such services are carried out in India.
</p>
<p id="p_143">This being so, it is not necessary to advert to the other ground

namely, that “other personnel” would cover personnel employed

by the Indian company as well, and that the US companies

through such personnel are furnishing services in India.       This

being the case, it is clear that as the very first part of <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_61">Article

5(2)(l)</a> is not attracted, the question of going to any other part of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                                  51</span>
the said Article does not arise. It is perhaps for this reason that

the assessing officer did not give any finding on this score.
</p>

<p id="p_144">21.   Shri Ganesh has argued before us that the “agency PE”

aspect of the case need not be gone into as it was given up

before the ITAT. He is right in this submission as no argument

on this score is found before the ITAT.    However, for the sake

of completeness, it is only necessary to agree with the High

Court, that it has never been the case of Revenue that e-Funds

India was authorized to or exercised any authority to conclude

contracts on behalf of the US company, nor was any factual

foundation laid to attract any of the said clauses contained in

<a href="/doc/1744360/" id="a_62">Article 5(4)</a> of the DTAA. This aspect of the case, therefore,

need not detain us any further.

      international transaction under which a non-resident
      compensates a PE at arm’s length price, no further

</p><p id="p_153">35. The object behind enactment of transfer pricing
regulations is to prevent shifting of profits outside
India. Under <a href="/doc/544105/" id="a_64">Article 7(2)</a> not all profits of MSCo
would be taxable in India but only those which have
economic nexus with PE in India. A foreign
enterprise is liable to be taxed in India on so much
of its business profit as is attributable to the PE in
India. The quantum of taxable income is to be
determined in accordance with the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_65">IT Act</a>. All provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_66">IT Act</a> are applicable,
including provisions relating to depreciation,
investment losses, deductible expenses, carry-
forward and set-off losses, etc. However, deviations
are made by DTAA in cases of royalty, interest, etc.
Such deviations are also made under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_67">IT Act</a> (for
example <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_68">Sections 44-BB</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_69">44-BBA</a>, etc.).
</p>
<p id="p_154">36. Under the impugned ruling delivered by AAR,
remuneration to MSAS was justified by a transfer
pricing analysis and, therefore, no further income
could be attributed to the PE (MSAS). In other
words, the said ruling equates an arm’s length
analysis (ALA) with attribution of profits. It holds that
once a transfer pricing analysis is undertaken, there
is no further need to attribute profits to a PE. The
impugned ruling is correct in principle insofar as an
associated enterprise, that also constitutes a PE,
has been remunerated on an arm’s length
basis taking into account all the risk-taking functions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                            55</span>
      of the enterprise. In such cases nothing further
      would be left to be attributed to PE. The situation
      would be different if transfer pricing analysis does
      not adequately reflect the functions performed and
      the risks assumed by the enterprise. In such a
      situation, there would be a need to attribute profits
      to PE for those functions/risks that have not been
      considered. Therefore, in each case the data placed
      by the taxpayer has to be examined as to whether
      the transfer pricing analysis placed by the taxpayer
      is exhaustive of attribution of profits and that would
      depend on the functional and factual analysis to be
      undertaken in each case. Lastly, it may be added
      that taxing corporates on the basis of the concept of
      economic nexus is an important feature of
      attributable profits (profits attributable to PE).”

the matter as the Department of Treasury in Washington, by a

letter dated 7th May, 2007, specifically stated, “although we do

not agree on the technical merits that e-Funds and IT Solutions

had a PE in India, we reached a mutual agreement with a view

to avoid double taxation”. Equally the same document states:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">      “Effect on Future Years: The competent authority
      determination made herein is not binding on
      subsequent years.”


</blockquote><p id="p_165">26.   To the same effect are the letters dated May 14, 2007

written by e-Funds Corp. to the Deputy Director of International

Tax Circle in India. Shri Ganesh has also referred to and relied

upon paragraph 3.6 of the OECD Manual on MAP Procedure,

which reads as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      “3.6. Competent Authority Agreements
      Competent authority agreements or resolutions are
      often case and time specific. They are not
      considered precedents for either the taxpayer or the
      tax administrations in regard to adjustments or
      issues relating to subsequent years or for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                                                 59</span>
      competent authority discussions on the same issues
      for other taxpayers. In fact, the letters exchanged
      between competent authorities to resolve a case
      often state as much. This is because the competent
      authorities have reached an agreement that often
      takes into account the facts of the particular
      taxpayer, the differences in the provisions of the tax
      law in each country, as well as the effects of the
      economic indicators on the particular transactions at
      the relevant time. Any review or adjustments of
      subsequent years by a taxpayer or tax
      administration is best based upon the particular
      circumstances, facts and documentary evidence
      existing for those years.”


</blockquote><p id="p_166">27.   However, the learned Attorney General relied upon

paragraph 1.3.1 of the OECD Manual and Best Practice No.3,

in particular, which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">      “Best Practice Nº3: Principled approach to
      resolution of cases
      In the resolution of MAP cases, a competent
      authority should engage in discussions with other
      competent authorities in a principled, fair, and
      objective manner, with each case being decided on
      its own merits and not by reference to any balance
      of results in other cases. To the extent applicable,
      the Commentary to the OECD Model Tax
      Convention and the OECD Transfer Pricing
      Guidelines are an appropriate basis for the
      development of a principled approach. As part of a
      principled approach to MAP cases, competent
      authorities should be consistent and reciprocal in
      the positions they take and not change position on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                               60</span>
      an issue from case to case, depending on which
      side of the issue produces the most revenue.</blockquote>
<p id="p_167">      Although a principled approach is paramount, where
      an agreement is not otherwise achievable, both
      competent authorities should look for appropriate
      opportunities for compromise in order to eliminate
      double taxation. To the extent possible, competent
      authorities who face significant recurring issues in
      their bilateral relationship may wish to reach
      agreement on the consistent treatment of such
      issues.”


      A perusal of the above would show that a competent

authority should engage in discussion with the other competent

authority in a principled, fair and objective manner, with each

case being decided on its own merits. It is also specifically

observed that where an agreement is not otherwise achievable,

then both parties should look for appropriate opportunities for

compromise in order to eliminate double taxation on the facts of

the case, even though a principled approach is important. The

learned Attorney General also relied upon Best Practice No.1 of

the said OECD Manual, which requires the publication of

mutual agreements reached that may apply to a general

category of taxpayers which would then improve guidance for

the future.   Best Practice No.1 has no application on the facts

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                                              61</span>
of the present case, as the agreement reached applies only to

the respondent companies, and not to any general category of

taxpayers. It is clear, therefore, that Shri Ganesh is right in

relying upon <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_76">Article 3.6</a> of the OECD Manual. It is very clear,

therefore, that such agreement cannot be considered as a

precedent for subsequent years, and the High Court’s

conclusion on this aspect is also correct.
</p>

<p id="p_168">28.   The learned Attorney General has also laid great

emphasis on non-disclosure of documents and has relied upon

a long list of documents that the assessees were asked to

disclose and which they did not. From this, according to the

learned Attorney General, an adverse inference should be

drawn, and from this alone it should be inferred that a PE of the

assessees, therefore, exists in India. We are afraid that this

argument cannot be countenanced at this stage as it has never

been raised before any of the authorities below and has not

been raised before the High Court also.      This being the case,

we do not think it necessary to get into this aspect of the matter.

<p id="p_169">29.   Having held in favour of the assessees that no permanent

establishment in India can possibly be said to exist on the facts

of the present case, we do not deem it necessary to go into the

cross-appeals that were filed before the High Court, which were

dismissed by the High Court agreeing with the ITAT that the

calculation of the ITAT would lead to nil taxation.   This point

would not arise in view of our decision on the facts of the

present case.    It is, therefore, unnecessary to go into this

aspect of the matter.
