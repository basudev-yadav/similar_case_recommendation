<p id="p_1">1.     This Intra-Court appeal impugns the judgment dated 03.05.2010 of
the learned Single Judge dismissing W.P.(C) No.2946/2010 preferred by the
appellant. The said writ petition was preferred impugning the order dated
10.11.2009 of the Central Information Commission (CIC) allowing the
appeal filed by the respondent and directing the appellant to disclose the
information sought.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The appellant had floated a tender titled „GSM Phase-VI‟ for the
installation of 93 million GSM lines in four parts. M/s KEC International
Ltd. was one of the bidders in the said tender. The respondent, claiming to
be one of the shareholders of the said KEC International Ltd., on 02.07.2009
applied under the provisions of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, 2005 seeking
the following information:

<p id="p_3">       The respondent further claimed that by then the financial bids had
been opened in February, 2009 and evaluation thereof was over.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.     The CPIO of the appellant vide letter dated 30.07.2009 declined the
request of the respondent for information on the ground that the information
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">LPA No.900/2010                                                  Page 2 of 13</span>
 sought was of "commercial confidence" in nature and claiming exemption
from disclosure under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_2">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.     The respondent preferred first appeal contending that, the appellant
was a Government of India enterprise carrying on works in public interest,
utilizing government funds; that the tenders were open tenders; the financial
bids were already read out to other bidders at the time of opening of the bids
and nothing confidential remained therein; that the bidding process having
attained finality, no issues of commercial confidence remained. The first
appellate authority however vide order dated 08.09.2009 confirmed the order
of the CPIO, also for the reason of the appellant having signed Non
Disclosure Agreements with all the participating vendors and the disclosure
of the information sought being in violation of the said agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.     The CIC in its order dated 10.11.2009 allowing the appeal of the
respondent observed / held, i) that the evaluation process stood completed
and thus the commercial position of any of the bidders could not be
adversely affected by such disclosure; ii) the exemption under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_3">Section
8(1)(d)</a> of the Act is not available since the information was already in
public domain owing to the finalization and completion of the bidding
process and evaluation and cannot pose a threat to the competitive position
of any of the bidders; iii) it was in the larger public interest to disclose such
information; iv) that the Non Disclosure Agreements were valid only for the
"Confidentiality Period" i.e. till the opening of the bids; v) even otherwise
such Non Disclosure Agreements debarring access to information and
thereby disrupting the transparency and accountability of the public
authority were in violation of the very spirit of the Act and therefore illegal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">LPA No.900/2010                                                    Page 3 of 13</span>
 to the extent they prevented disclosure beyond what was exempted under the
Act; vi) that thus the Non Disclosure Agreements if prevented disclosure
beyond the confidentiality period also, were illegal; vii) that the public
interest "far outweighs the weak contentions put up by the appellant to
protect the so called private interests"; viii) that even though the tender
process had been challenged in some of the High Courts but the same also
did not entitle the appellant to exemption.      Accordingly, directions for
disclosing the information were issued.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition preferred by the
appellant impugning the order aforesaid of the CIC observing / holding,
</p><p id="p_8">a) that the writ petition filed by KEC International Ltd. impugning the tender
process had been finally dismissed by the Supreme Court finding no
illegality in the decision making process and declaring the party which was
awarded the contract as the lowest bidder - thus the objection to disclosure
of information on the ground of the matter being sub judice did not survive;
</p><p id="p_9">b) that the plea of the appellant of the confidentiality period as per the Non
Disclosure Agreements being in vogue for the reason of the formal contract
having not been entered into with the successful bidder was of no avail since
the bidding process was complete and the selection of the successful bidder
stood finalized; c) again for the reason of the bidding process having stood
completed, the question of the commercial interest of any of the bidders
being adversely affected by the disclosure did not arise; d) <a href="/doc/1864010/" id="a_4">Section 22</a> of the
Act gives effect to the provisions of the Act notwithstanding anything
inconsistent therewith contained in the <a href="/doc/61492784/" id="a_5">Official Secrets Act</a>, 1923 and any
other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">LPA No.900/2010                                                  Page 4 of 13</span>
 virtue of any law other than the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_6">RTI Act</a> - consequently the Non Disclosure
Agreements cannot be used by the appellant to defeat the right to
information under the Act; e) even otherwise the Non Disclosure
Agreements cannot be said to extend beyond the confidentiality period
defined in the agreement itself as the period between the opening of the
tender and the finalization of the bids.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.     It was the contention of the appellant before this Bench that the bids
in the tender aforesaid had never been given the shape of the contract and
had been cancelled. This Bench before issuing notice of the appeal directed
the filing of an affidavit in this regard by the Chairman of the appellant. An
affidavit dated 24.01.2011 has been filed informing that the bids were
evaluated and L1, L2 etc. selected for Part-III and price negotiations held
with L1; that after negotiations the rates were recommended by the
Negotiation Committee to the competent authority for finalization /
approval; that since the case pertaining to GSM         Phase-VI was being
examined qua the allegation of irregularity, the competent authority in its
wisdom cancelled / scrapped the tender; as a result of the scrapping, no
contract came into existence and even the Advance Purchase Order was not
issued; that thus no question of giving any kind of information arose; that
making public the confidential information of the tenderers particularly in
view of signing of the Non Disclosure Agreements would certainly affect the
goodwill of the appellant and would result in reduction in number of
participating vendors / tenderers in subsequent tenders floated by the
appellant and which would further result in monetary loss as due to
reduction in competition there would be an increase in prices.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">LPA No.900/2010                                                  Page 5 of 13</span>
<p id="p_11"> 8.     The appellant during the hearing has placed reliance on judgment of
this Court in Exmar NV Vs. Union of India 2006 (1) RAJ 229 (DB) on the
aspect of when the contract can be said to be concluded. It has further been
contended that the learned Single Judge has failed to notice Clause 18 of the
Non Disclosure Agreement whereunder the obligations of confidentiality
were to survive the expiration or termination of the agreement, for a period
of two years from the date the confidential information was disclosed or the
completion of business purpose, whichever is later.      It is yet further urged
that the learned Single Judge has wrongly assumed that the contract stood
awarded to the successful bidder.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.     Per contra, the respondent in the reply filed to the appeal has pleaded
that the appellant inspite of numerous representations and Court cases
averring irregularities, stonewalled and did not come clean; that ultimately
on representations to the Prime Minister‟s Office, a High Powered
Committee was constituted which found irregularities in the evaluation
process and recommended the scrapping of the tender; that the objection of
the appellant to disclosure of information is not for protection of the
commercial and confidential information furnished by any of the bidders but
to safeguard its own misdeeds during the evaluation process; that the Non
Disclosure Agreements signed by the appellant with the bidders are contrary
to the spirit of the Act and illegal; that the reluctance of the appellant to
disclose information relating to the tender which had already been scrapped
was incomprehensible; that the commercial confidentiality of bids is over
once the financial bids are opened and prices of all items of all the bidders
including other details are disclosed to all the bidders; that in fact in one of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">LPA No.900/2010                                                   Page 6 of 13</span>
 the writ petitions aforesaid in other High Courts challenging the tender such
information had already been brought in public domain. The counsel for the
respondent during the hearing has also relied on the judgment dated
02.07.2009 of the High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana in W.P.(C)
No.9474/2009 titled Nokia Siemens Networks Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Union of India
and on Canara Bank Vs. The Central Information Commission AIR 2007
Kerala 225. He has also drawn attention to the proviso after <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_7">Section 8(1)(j)</a>
of the Act laying down that the information which cannot be denied to the
Parliament or State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. It is
contended that the information aforesaid cannot be denied to the Parliament
and hence the exemptions provided in <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_8">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act would not be
attracted.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10.    We, at the outset, deem it appropriate to discuss the issue generally as
the same is likely to arise repeatedly. Confidentiality or secrecy is the
essence of sealed bids. The same helps the contract awarding party to have
the most competitive and best rates / offer. The essential purpose of sealed
bidding is that the bids are secret bids that are intended by the vendor and
expected by bidders to be kept confidential as between rival bidders until
such time as it is too late for a bidder to alter his bid. Sealed bidding means
and must be understood by all those taking part in it to mean that each bidder
must bid without actually knowing what any rival has bid. The reason for
this, as every bidder must appreciate, is that the vendor wants to avoid the
bidders bidding (as they would do in open bidding such as at an auction) by
reference to other bids received and seeking merely to top those bids by the
smallest increment possible. The vendor's object is to get the bidders to bid

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">LPA No.900/2010                                                  Page 7 of 13</span>
 "blind" in the hope that then they will bid more than they would if they knew
how far other bidders had gone. Additionally, from each bidder's point of
view his own bid is confidential and not to be disclosed to any other bidder,
and he makes his bid in the expectation, encouraged by the invitation to
submit a sealed bid, that his bid will not be disclosed to a rival. If, therefore,
a rival has disclosed to him by the vendor the amount of another's bid and
uses that confidential information to pitch his own bid enough to outbid the
other, this is totally inconsistent with the basis on which each bidder has
been invited to bid, and the rival's bid is not a good bid; likewise if the rival
adopts a formula that necessarily means that he is making use of what should
be confidential information (viz. the bid of another) in composing his own
bid. In such a case, the amount of the other's bid is being constructively
divulged to him. The process of inviting tenders has an element of secrecy −
since nobody knows what would be the bid of the competitor, every one will
try to show preparedness for the best of the terms which will be acceptable
to the institution calling the tenders. This requires ensuring that the tenders
are not tampered with, the offers are not leaked to another bidder or even to
the officers of the institution for which the tenders are called. Secret bids
thus promote competition, guard against favouritism, improvidence,
extravagance, fraud and corruption and lead to award of contract, to secure
the best work at the lowest price practicable.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.    Over the years the secret bids are not confined to the price only, which
may cease to be of any value or lose confidentiality once the bids are
opened. The bids/tenders today require the bidders to submit in the bids a
host of information which may help and be required by the tender calling

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">LPA No.900/2010                                                     Page 8 of 13</span>
 institution to evaluate the suitability and reliability of the contracting party.
The bidders are often required to, in their bids disclose information about
themselves, their processes, turnover and other factors which may help the
tender calling institution to evaluate the capability of the bidder to perform
the contracted work. The secret bids/tenders are often divided into technical
and financial parts. The bidders in the technical part may reveal to the tender
calling institution their technology and processes evolved and developed by
them and which technology and processes may not otherwise be in public
domain and which the bidder may not want revealed to the competitors and
which technology/processes the bidder may be using works for the other
clients also and which technology/processes if revealed to the competitors
may lead to the bidder losing the competitive edge in subsequent awards of
contracts. If it were to be held that a bidder by virtue of participating in the
tender becomes entitled to all particulars in the bids of all the bidders, the
possibility of unscrupulous businessmen participating in the tender merely
for acquiring such information, cannot be ruled out. Such disclosure may
lead to the competitors undercutting in future bids. We may at this stage
notice that the <a href="/doc/411331/" id="a_9">Freedom of Information Act</a> prevalent in United States of
America as well as the <a href="/doc/411331/" id="a_10">Freedom of Information Act</a>, 2000 in force in United
Kingdom, both carve out an exception qua trade secrets and commercial or
financial information obtained from a person and which is privileged or
confidential.     The tests laid down in those jurisdictions also, is of „if
disclosure of information is likely to impair government‟s ability to obtain
necessary information in future or to cause substantial harm to competitive
position of person from whom information is obtained‟. It has been held

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">LPA No.900/2010                                                    Page 9 of 13</span>
 that unless persons having necessary information are assured that it will
remain confidential, they may decline to cooperate with officials and the
ability of government to make intelligent well-informed decisions will be
impaired. Yet another test of whether the information submitted with the
bids is confidential or not is of „whether such information is generally
available for public perusal‟ and of whether such information „is customarily
made available to the public by the business submitter‟. If it is not so
customarily made available, it is treated as confidential.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.    Though the report of the appellant of evaluation of tenders, is a
document of the appellant but the evaluation therein is of the tenders of the
various bidders and the report of evaluation may contain data and other
particulars from the bids and which data/particulars were intended to be
confidential. If any part of the bids is exempt from disclosure, the same
cannot be supplied obliquely through the disclosure of evaluation report.
</p>
<p id="p_16">13.    What thus emerges is that a balance has to be struck between the
principle of promoting honest and open government by ensuring public
access to information created by the government on the one hand and the
principle of confidentiality breach whereof is likely to cause substantial
harm to competitive position of the person from whom information is
obtained and the disclosure impairing the government‟s ability to obtain
necessary information in future on the other hand. Also, what has been
discussed above may not apply in a proceeding challenge wherein is to the
evaluation process.    It will then be up to the Court before which such
challenge is made, to decide as to what part of the evaluation process is to be
disclosed to the challengers.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">LPA No.900/2010                                                  Page 10 of 13</span>
<p id="p_17"> 14.    Questions also arise as to the information contained in the bids /
tenders of the unsuccessful tenderers. Often it is found that the same is
sought, to know the method of working and to adversely use the said
information in future contracts. Generally there can be no other reason for
seeking such information.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15.    Once we hold that the information of which disclosure is sought
relates to or contains information supplied by a third party and which the
third party may claim confidential, the third party information procedure laid
down in <a href="/doc/122227/" id="a_11">Section 11</a> of the Act is attracted. The said aspect has not been
considered either by the CIC or by the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_19">16.    What we find in the present case is that the tender process has been
scrapped. The information which is being sought relates to the evaluation of
the bids by the appellant. Though the Non Disclosure Agreement extended
the obligation of confidentiality beyond the date of opening of the tenders
also but only for a period of two years from the date of disclosure or to the
completion of business purpose whichever is later. The business purpose
stands abandoned with the scrapping of the tenders. More than two years
have elapsed from the date when the information was submitted. Thus the
said agreement now does not come in the way of the appellant disclosing the
information.      However, we are of the opinion that disclosure of such
information which would be part of the evaluation process would still
require the third party information procedure under <a href="/doc/122227/" id="a_12">Section 11</a> of the Act to
be followed.       As aforesaid, besides the bid price, there may still be
information in the bid and which may have been discussed in the evaluation


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">LPA No.900/2010                                                  Page 11 of 13</span>
 process, of commercial confidence and containing trade secret or intellectual
property of the bidders whose bids were evaluated.
</p>
<p id="p_20">17.    Though in the light of the view taken by us hereinabove, the question
of validity of the agreement need not to be adjudicated but since we have
heard the counsels, we deem it our duty to adjudicate upon the said aspect
also. <a href="/doc/411331/" id="a_13">Section 22</a> of the Act relied on by the learned Single Judge though
giving overriding effect to the provisions of the Act still saves the
instruments "having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act". This
Court in <a href="/doc/45224879/" id="a_14">Vijay Prakash v. Union of India</a> AIR 2010 Delhi 7 has held that
though <a href="/doc/411331/" id="a_15">Section 22</a> the Act overrides other laws, the opening non-obstante
clause in <a href="/doc/1669859/" id="a_16">Section 8</a> confers primacy to the exemptions enacted under <a href="/doc/618506/" id="a_17">Section
8(1)</a>. Thus, once the information is found to be exempt under <a href="/doc/618506/" id="a_18">Section 8(1)</a>,
reliance on <a href="/doc/411331/" id="a_19">Section 22</a> is misconceived. Whether the information is of such
nature as defined in <a href="/doc/753880/" id="a_20">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act, can be adjudicated only by
recourse to <a href="/doc/122227/" id="a_21">Section 11</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_21">18.    We however do not deem it necessary to adjudicate on the proviso
after <a href="/doc/618506/" id="a_22">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act and leave the same to be adjudicated in an
appropriate proceedings. We may however notice that a Division Bench of
the Bombay High Court in Surupsingh Hrya Naik Vs. State of
Maharashtra AIR 2007 Bombay 121 has held that the proviso has been
placed after <a href="/doc/618506/" id="a_23">Section 8(1)(j)</a> and would have to be so interpreted in that
context and the proviso applies only to <a href="/doc/618506/" id="a_24">Section 8(1)(j)</a> and not to other sub-
sections.

<p id="p_22"> 19.    The appeal is therefore partly allowed. The matter is remanded back
to the CIC. If the respondent is still desirous of the information sought, the
CIC shall issue notice to the parties whose bids are evaluated in the
evaluation process information qua which is sought by the respondent and
decide the request of the respondent after following the procedure under
