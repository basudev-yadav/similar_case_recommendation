		      J U D G M E N T
SEN, J.
</p><p id="p_2">     M/s. Shree	 Durga Oil  Mills,  respondent	herein,	 was
assessed to  tax by the Sales Tax officer for the assessment
years 1979-80, 1980-81 and 1981-82 for purchase of groundnut
from  unregistered   dealers.  There   is  no  dispute	that
groundnut from	unregistered dealers.  There is	 no  dispute
that groundnut	was purchased  from  time  to  time  by	 the
respondents  and   utilised  for   manufacturing  oil.	 The
assessment orders  were challenged by a writ petition on the
ground that  in view  of the  Industrial  policy  Resolution
(I.P.R) dated  18.7.1979 issued by the Industries Department
of the	Government of Orissa, sales tax was not payable by a
new industry  on the purchase of raw material for the period
prescribed in the I.P.R.
</p><p id="p_3">     It was  contended on behalf of the writ petitioner that
it had	applied for  a license	setting up  an	industry  at
Betnoti	 in  the  district  of	Mayurbhanj  and	 obtained  a
provisional  registration   certificate	 on   28.11.1979.  A
permanent  registration	  certificate  as   a  small   scale
industrial unit	 was granted  by the Director of Industries,
Orissa on  10.4.1980. The  industrial unit  also obtained  a
production   certificate  certifying  that  it	had  started
production on 19.3.1980. The certificate of registration was
renewed	 from  time  to	 time.	clause	(8)  of	 the  I.P.R.
effective for  the  period  1979-83  provided  that  village
cottage and  tiny industries  certified as such by the State
Government and	small scale  industries shall be exempt from
purchase/sales tax  for five years on construction material,
raw material, machinery and packaging materials. Small scale
industrial units  in non-backward areas would be entitled to
this exemption	only for  four years.  The case	 of the writ
petitioner before  the High  Court was	that it	 set up	 its
industry in  the district  of Mayurbhanj  pursuant  to	this
I.P.R. It  had obtained	 a huge loan from the united Bank of
India. In  term of  the	 I.P.R.,  it  was  entitled  to	 tax
exemption on purchase of groundnut, mustard seeds etc. which
were used as raw material for production of oil.
</p><p id="p_4">     The Sales	Tax Officer took the stand that there was no
notification in	 force under  Section 6	 of the Orissa Sales
Tax Act,  1947 granting	 exemption to  purchase or  sale  of
groundnut, mustard seeds etc. during the relevant period. In
the absence  of such  a notification, the assessee could not
gain immunity from payment of tax on its purchases.
</p><p id="p_5">     Section 6 of the Orissa Sales Tax Act Provides that the
State may  be notification,  subject to	 such conditions and
exceptions, if	any, exempt from tax the sale or purchase of
any goods  or class  of goods and likewise withdraw any such
exemption. A  notification dated  11.11.1969 had been issued
under Section  6  by  the  State  Government  by  which	 raw
materials which	 went into manufacture of the finished goods
were exempted  from sale  purchase tax	when such goods were
sold to	 a registered  dealer who  was a manufacturer inside
the State  and who  had started	 production after  1.4.1969.
This exemption	had been  given for  a period  of five years
from the  date on  which such  registered dealer had started
production.  A	similar	 notification  dated  23.4.1976	 was
issued granting	 exemption to  raw materials  purchased by a
manufacturer for  a further  period of	five years  from the
date  on   which  production   had  commenced.	 Both  these
notifications require  that in order to avail this exemption
the manufacturer should furnish declarations in Form 'D'.
</p><p id="p_6">     The exemptions granted by the two earlier notifications
were abrogated	by notification	 dated 20.5.1977.  The State
Government again  restored the	earlier two notifications by
another	 notification	dated  9.9.1977.  However,  in	that
notification dated 9.9.77, the exemption was limited only to
the  industries	  which	 had  started  production  prior  to
1.4.1977. Since	 the industry  set up by the writ petitioner
had commenced  production on  19.3.1980, it was not eligible
for the	 exemption given  by the notification dated 9.91977.
The case of the respondent in the writ petition was that the
I.P.R. was  effective for the period 1979-83. The petitioner
had set	 up its	 industry pursuant  to and  in terms of this
Resolution. Exemption  from tax	 had been granted by the two
notifications issued on 11.11. 1969 and 23.4.1976. The State
Government could  not  change  these  notifications  to	 the
detriment of  the assessee after the assessee had set up its
plant and  had taken  a huge loan from the bank for carrying
on  its	  business.  A	 prayer	 was   mad  to	declare	 the
notification dated 9.9.1977 as ultra vires <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_1">Article 19(1) (g)</a>
of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_7">     The High  Court allowed the writ petition on the ground
that in	 the I.P.R.,   a  clear and  unequivocal promise had
been made  by which  a legal  relationship  was sought to be
created between	 the State  and the persons who had acted on
the basis of the I.P.R. M/s. Shree Durga Oil Mills, the writ
petitioner, had	 set up	 its industry  on the  basis of	 the
declaration made  in the  I.P.R. and  the promise  held	 out
therein. There	was no	way the	 State Government could back
out from  the commitments made by it in the I.P.R. after the
petitioner had actually set up its industry pursuant to that
Resolution which  was effective	 for the  period 1977-83. On
the strength  of  this	reasoning,  the	 Orissa	 High  Court
quashed the  assessment	 orders	 passed	 by  the  Sales	 Tax
Officer. The State has now come up in appeal.
</p><p id="p_8">     One of the points raised in this Court on behalf of the
respondent is  that the	 High Court  had merely followed its
judgments in  the case	of <a href="/doc/143516/" id="a_2">Jagannath  Roller Flour Mills and
Ors. V.	 State of  Orissa</a> (1987) 65 STC 384 and also in M/s.
Industrial Packaging.  No appeal was preferred against these
two judgments. Therefore, it is not open to the state now to
contend in this case that the decision of the High Court was
erroneous. Since  the Sales  Tax Department had accepted the
aforesaid two  decisions as  final and binding, it could not
be permitted to challenge the settled law.
</p><p id="p_9">     On behalf	of the	appellant, it  has been	 pointed out
that although  the earlier two decisions were not challenged
in this	 Court, the High Court's view needs  reconsideration
in view	 of the	 decision of  this  Court  in  the  case  of
<a href="/doc/644832/" id="a_3">Commissioner of Sales Tax, Orissa and Anr. v. M/S. Jagannath
Cotton Mill</a> 99 STC 83 where it was pointed out:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "The  High	  Court	 seems	to  have
     proceeded on  the	assumption  that
     the I.P.R.	 by itself  is enough to
     provide  the   exemption  from  the
     sales tax. But where the provisions
     of	 the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_4">Sales  Tax  Act</a>  are  also
     amended  providing	 for  exemption,
     then the  Court has  to see whether
     they are  the same as the I.P.R. or
     are    they     different-and    if
     different, what  is the  effect  of
     such difference.  It is, therefore,
     necessary to ascertain the relevant
     provisions in  the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_5">Sales  Tax  Act</a>,
     Rules and	notifications,	if  any,
     issued thereunder before expressing
     a final opinion in the matter.:</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">     In our  view, this	 appeal cannot	be shut	 out on	 the
preliminary ground  that no appeal was preferred against the
two earlier  two decisions  of the  High  Court	 which	were
followed in  the instant case. It is for the Court to decide
whether to  entertain an  appeal or  not. In  our view,	 the
point of  law raised  in this  case  is	 of  general  public
importance and	this appeal cannot be dismissed in limine on
the preliminary	 issue of  maintainability. On behalf of the
appellant, it  has been	 pointed out  that in the High Court
itself, there  has been a change in the perception of law in
this regard.
</p><p id="p_11">     On the  merit of  the case,  it has  been contended  on
behalf of the respondent that the State cannot be allowed to
first grant  exemption and induce industries to be set up on
the basis  of  the  promise  held  out	in  its	 I.P.R.	 and
thereafter back out from the promise after it had been acted
upon. reliance	was placed  on a  decision of  this Court in
<a href="/doc/1877956/" id="a_6">Pournami Oil  Mills v.	State of  Kerala &amp; Anr</a>. (1987) 1 SCR
654 for	 granting exemption  from sales	 tax an	 I.P.R.	 was
sufficient by  itself.	A  Statutory  notification  was	 not
necessary to implement that policy. Persons who had acted on
the basis of the    I.P.R.  were  entitled  to	get  benefit
thereunder. It	has  been  contended  that  this  Court	 has
emphasised  this  rule	once  again  in	 the  case  of	Pine
Chemicals ltd. v. Assessing Authority, (1992) 2 SCC 683.
</p><p id="p_12">     Pine Chemicals case dealt with the exemption from sales
tax granted  under the J &amp; K General sales <a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_7">Tax Act</a>. 1962. It
was held  in that  case that if the exemption was claimed on
the basis  of a Minister's speech or a brochure published by
the Government	then the  claim of promissory estoppel could
not be	entertained on behalf of any person who claimed that
they had  changed their	 position on the basis of the speech
or  the	  brochure.  It	 was,  however,	 held  that  if	 the
Government in  exercise of  powers under  a statute  granted
exemption then	if appropriate	conditions existed a case of
promissory estoppel  could arise.  The Court  in  that	case
found  that   the  Government	had  not  made	any  general
declaration of	its intention  but had	actually  passed  an
order granting	exemption to  new industries from Sales Tax.
The order  was half  to new  industries from  Sales Tax. The
order was  held to  have been  issued under <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of the
General Sales Tax Act. Relying on these representations each
of the appellant had set up their industries. This Court was
of the	view that since the appellants on the representation
of the State had set up their industries, they were entitled
to the	benefit of  tax exemption  for the  entire period of
five years  as promised	 by the Government. <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_9">Section 5</a> of the
General Sales Tax Act as set out in the judgment was:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "5.   Exemption   from   tax-   The
     Government	 may,  subject	to  such
     restrictions and  conditions as may
     be prescribed, including conditions
     as to  licence and	 licence fee, by
     order exempt  in whole  or in  part
     from payment  of tax  any class  of
     dealers or	 any goods  in class  or
     description of goods."</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">     It will  be seen  that unlike  Section 6  of the Orissa
Sales Tax  it does  not specifically  say that any exemption
from  tax   could  be	granted	 by   the  Government  by  a
notification and  such exemption  could be  withdrawn at any
point of  time by  the Government. Moreover, in that case no
argument was  advanced nor  was the  Court  called  upon  to
consider the  necessity of  overriding	public	interest  in
situations like	 this. If  the Government after granting tax
exemption to various industries finds itself in a tremendous
financial crunch  and seeks  to raise  finance by doing away
with the  exemptions, it  cannot be  argued that because the
Government had	promised to  give tax	exemption, which was
revocable under	 the statute,  the Government  cannot resile
from its  stand however disastrous it may turn out to be for
the State's economy.
</p><p id="p_14">     The crux  of the  matter in  this case  is whether	 the
Government had made any promise to the respondent and if so,
can it	depart from  the promise  made by  it in  the I.P.R.
which was stated to be effective from 1977-1983.
</p><p id="p_15">     There are	several reasons	 why we are unable to uphold
the contention based on the principle of promissory estoppel
raised by  the respondents in this case. No particulars have
been given  by the  respondents as  to when the decision was
taken to  set up  the industry,	 the date  when the loan was
obtained from  the bank, and exactly when land was purchased
or the plant and machinery were acquired for setting
up of  the small  scale industrial unit. the I.P.R. on which
reliance has  been placed  by the  respondent was  issued on
18.7.1979. A provisional registration certificate in respect
of the	respondent's industry  was issued on 28.11.1979. The
respondent has	not given  factual details  of	how  in	 the
short; span  of about four months, it set up its industry on
the basis of the I.P.R.
</p><p id="p_16">     Moreover, the  Government	may  change  its  industrial
policy if  the situation  so warrants.	merely because,	 the
I.P.R. as  announced for  the period  1979-1983, it does not
mean that  the Government  cannot amend or change the policy
under any  circumstance. As  a matter  of fact, in this case
the Government	had published  another I.P.R.  on  31.7.1980
modifying the  earlier I.P.R. The vires of the Second I.P.R.
has not	 been challenged.  The two  I.P.Rs.  have  not	been
issued under  any particular statute. A general announcement
was made  by the  Government that  certain  economic  policy
would be  pursued for  the acceleration of the growth of the
industrial sector  in the State of Orissa. For that purpose,
a  package   of	 measures  for	stimulating  the  growth  of
industries were announced. It was specifically made clear in
the I.P.R. dated 18.7.1979 that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     "	Government   orders  will  issue
     laying    down    the    mode    of
     administering the	concessions  and
     incentives	      by       concerned
     departments."</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">     In other  words, the I.P.R. dated 18.7.79 by itself did
not grant any exemption to the persons who set up industries
pursuant to  that I.P.R.  The I.P.R.  merely  promised	that
orders will  be issued laying down the mode of administering
the concessions	 and incentives	 by  concerned	departments.
Exemption of  sales tax	 can only  he granted  in the manner
laid down  by the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_10">Sales  Tax  Act</a>.  The  Government  by  an
executive order	 cannot	 override  the	requirement  of	 the
statute. The  method and  manner of  granting exemption	 has
been laid  down in  Section 6  of the  Orissa Sales Tax Act.
This Section  specifically says	 that exemption	 have to  be
granted by  a notification  issued under  <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_11">Section 6</a>  can  be
modified or  withdrawn by  the State Government at any point
of time. The State Government in the instant case, initially
issued the  exemption notifications  under  <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_12">Section  6</a>.	 The
State  Government   subsequently  decided  to  withdraw	 the
exemption notification	in respect  of some  the  industries
which had  commenced production	 after 1.4.1977.  The  state
Government was fully competent to do so under the Provisions
of <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_13">Section 6</a> of the Act. The respondent must have been aware
of this when its industry was set up. Every body is presumed
to know the law. section 6 of the Orissa Sales Tax Act which
empowers  the  State  Government  to  issue  a	notification
granting exemption  from sales	tax, also empowers the State
Government  to	 withdraw,  amend   or	 modify	  any	such
notification as	 and when  it thinks  necessary	 to  do	 so.
Section 6 of the Orissa Sales Tax Act is as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "6. Tax-free Goods-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     The  State	  Government   may,   by
     notification,   subject   to   such
     conditions and  exceptions, if any,
     exempt  from   tax	 the   sale   or
     purchase of  any goods, or class of
     goods  and	 likewise  withdraw  any
     such exemption."</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">     When the respondent set up its oil mill and was granted
exemption from	sales tax,  it should  have known  that	 the
notification granting exemption of tax under <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_14">Section 6</a> could
be withdrawn  at any  point of	time. Therefore, the case of
promissory estoppel  is without	 any basis.  There cannot be
any estoppel against statute.
</p><p id="p_19">     Moreover, it  is well  settled that  any I.P.R.  can be
changed if  there is an overriding public interest involved.
it has	been stated on affidavit by the State of Orissa that
after a	 package of  incentives was given to the industries,
the Government	was faced  with severe resource crunch. On a
review of  its financial  position, it was felt that for the
sake of	 the economy of the State, it was necessary to limit
the  scope  of	exemption  granted  to	various	 industries.
Accordingly, further notifications were issued under Section
6 of  the Orissa Sales Tax Act from time to time. Because of
this new  perception of	 the economic scenario, the scope of
the  earlier  notifications  was  restricted  by  subsequent
notifications issued  under <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_15">Section  6</a>.	 This  also  led  to
issuance of the second I.P.R. dated 31.7.1980.
</p><p id="p_20">     The  question  of	applicability  of  the	doctrine  of
promissory  estoppel   against	the   Government  has	been
considered in a number of cases by this Court.
</p><p id="p_21">     In the  case of <a href="/doc/98342524/" id="a_16">Kasinka Trading and Another v. Union of
India and  Another</a>, (1995)  1 SCC  274, a  notification	 was
issued by  the Customs Department under <a href="/doc/753761/" id="a_17">Section 25(1)</a> of the
Customs Act  in public interest exempting certain goods from
basic import  duty and specified the date upto which it will
remain in  force. prior	 to  expiry  of	 that  date  another
notification  was   issued  withdrawing	 the  exception	 and
imposing customs  duty on  import of such goods. A challenge
was made to withdrawal of the notification by some importers
who claimed  that they	had entered  into agreements  on the
basis of  the earlier  notifications. It  was held  by	this
Court that  the Government had issued the first notification
in public  interest for	 a certain  period. But	 it was felt
later that  in public  interest.  exemption  should  not  be
continued even though that period had not expired. Therefore
the Government	withdrew it. it was held that when exemption
was granted  under statutory  power, it was implicit that it
could also  be rescinded or modified in exercise of the same
power.
</p><p id="p_22">     In the  instant case, Section 6 of the Orissa Sales Tax
Act specifically  lays down  that the exemption notification
issued under  that Section  can be withdrawn at any point of
time.
</p><p id="p_23">     Moreover withdrawal  of notification was done in public
interest. The Court will not interfere with any action taken
by the	Government in  public interest. Public interest must
override any consideration of private loss or gain.
</p><p id="p_24">     The view  taken by	 its Court  in	Kasinka's  case	 was
reiterated by a Bench of three-judges in the case of Shrijee
Sales Corporation  &amp; Anr.  Vs. Union  of India	(1997) 3 SCC
</p><p id="p_25">398. It was laid down in that case that the determination of
applicability of  promissory estoppel against the Government
hinges upon  balance of	 equity or  public interest. In case
there is  a supervening	 public equity, the Government would
be allowed  to change  its stand;  it would  then be able to
withdraw  from	representation	made  by  it  which  induced
persons to take certain steps which may have gone adverse to
the interest  of such persons on account of such withdrawal.
Once public  interest was  accepted as	the superior  equity
which  can   override  individual   equity,  the   aforesaid
principle should  be applicable even in cases where a period
had been  indicated for	 operation of  the promise.  In that
case, a	 notification was  issued exempting  customs duty on
PVC. By	 a second  notification the exemption was withdrawn.
The Court  held that  the facts	 of the	 case revealed	that
there was  a supervening  public interest and the Government
was competent  to withdraw  the first  notification  without
giving any prior notice to the respondent.
</p><p id="p_26">     In the  instant case,  it has  been stated on behalf of
the State  that Various	 notifications	granting  sales	 tax
exemptions  to	the  dealers  resulted	in  severe  resource
crunch. On reconsideration of the financial position, it was
decided	 to   limit  the  scope	 of  the  earlier  exemption
notifications issued under Section 6 of the Orissa Sales Tax
Act. because of this new perception of the economic scenario
of the	State, the scope of the earlier notifications had to
be restricted.	They  were  first  abrogated  altogether  on
20.5.1977. Thereafter, it was decide to grant exemption at a
limited scale.
</p><p id="p_27">     In our  opinion, the  plea of change of policy trade on
the basis of resource crunch should have been sufficient for
dismissing the	respondent's case  based on  the doctrine of
promissory estoppel.  Public interest  demanded modification
of the earlier I.P.R.
</p><p id="p_28">     Moreover, as  it has been noted earlier that the I.P.R.
itself had  not granted any exemption but had indicated that
orders will  be issued	by various  departments for granting
the exemptions.	 The exemption	order under  sales tax could
only be	 issued under  <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_18">Section 6</a>  which could  be amended or
withdrawn altogether.  This is expressly provided by Section
</p><p id="p_29">6. If  the respondent  acted on	 the basis of a notification
issued under  <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_19">Section 6</a>	 it  should  have  known  that	such
notification was  liable to  be amended	 or rescinded at any
point of  time, if the Government felt that it was necessary
to do  so in  public interest.	That  is  exactly  what	 has
happened in this case.
</p><p id="p_30">     In view  of the  above, we are of the opinion that this
appeal must  succeed and  is  allowed.	The  judgment  under
appeal is set aside. There will be no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_31">     C.A. Nos. 3785-86 of 1988
     In view  of the  above decision  in C.A.  No.  3784/88,
these appeals are also allowed.
