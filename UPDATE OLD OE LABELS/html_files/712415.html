Court, being FAO No.131 and 132 of 2008, against

two orders, both dated 28th March, 2008, passed by

the    Controller   of   Patents   and   Designs,   Kolkata,

cancelling two registered designs for "Insecticide

Coil" in Class 12 belonging to the Respondent No.1

herein.          The question for determination before the

High Court in the two appeals was whether the Delhi

High Court had jurisdiction to entertain the same

against         the    order   passed          by    the   Controller    of

Patents and Designs, Kolkata. Inasmuch as, in the

said two appeals, it was held by the Delhi High

Court that it had jurisdiction to entertain the

appeals, these two appeals have been preferred by

M/s.        Godrej      Sara      Lee     Ltd.       against    the    said

decision.

filed       a     suit,    being        C.S.(O.S.)No.121        of    2005,

against         the    appellant,        in    the     Delhi   High   Court

alleging          infringement      of        its    Registered      Designs

bearing Nos.184136 and 184137.                         The said suit is

appellant herein filed his written statement in the

suit,      inter    alia,     contending       that      the    aforesaid

Designs of the Respondent No.1 were liable to be

cancelled under <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_2">Section 22(3)</a> of the Designs Act,

2000, on the ground that registration of the same

had   been        obtained    by    concealment          of    facts      and

infringement         of     the    Designs         Registration           Nos.

197811 and 197426, before the Controller of Designs

at Kolkata.          Similarly, the appellant herein also

filed       a      Designs        Cancellation           Petition         for

cancellation of the Registered Design Nos.184135,

184136      and    184137     standing        in   the    name       of    the

Respondent No.1 on the same ground as alleged by

the respondent in its petition for cancellation of

the      appellant's          Designs.               After           certain

interlocutory        proceedings        relating         to    the    prayer

made for transfer of the cancellation proceedings

from the Controller of Designs to the Delhi High

on    5th    March,     2008    and      reserved        his    order.

Meanwhile, the respondents filed FAO (OS) No.101/08

against     the    orders    dated    13.2.2008       and      5.3.2008

passed by the Controller of Designs, Kolkata and

the   same     was     converted      into   a   Petition         under

<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a> of the Constitution.                    Initially the

learned      Single     Judge      was    doubtful        about     the

maintainability of the appeals.              Thereafter, on 28th

March,      2008,      by    three       separate        orders     the

Controller        of   Designs,      Kolkata,       cancelled       the

Registered        Design    Nos.184135,      184136      and     184137

belonging         to   Respondent        No.1.      As      indicated

hereinabove,        three    First    Appeals    were       preferred

before the Delhi High Court, where a question arose

with regard to          the High Court's jurisdiction to

entertain the appeals and by the orders impugned in

these appeals the Delhi High Court held that the

appeals were maintainable and it had jurisdiction

to entertain the same.

</p><p id="p_9">4.    Appearing    in     support    of    the       appeals,      Mr.

Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Advocate, questioned

the decision of the Delhi High Court based on the

interpretation of <a href="/doc/945860/" id="a_4">Section 19(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1286112/" id="a_5">Section

2(e)</a> of the Designs Act, 2000.                 He submitted that

the   expression       "High   Court"     as    used   in    <a href="/doc/945860/" id="a_6">Section

19(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1286112/" id="a_7">Section 2(e)</a>, would have to be read in

relation to the cause of action and not otherwise.

In the instant case, since the cause of action for

the    appeal     has     arisen     on        account       of    the

cancellation      of    Designs     by    the     Controller         of

Designs at Kolkata, it is only the Calcutta High

Court, which would have jurisdiction to entertain

the    appeals     under       <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_8">Section         19</a>.     Any        other

interpretation would be contrary to the principles

relating to the filing of suits where the cause of

action arises as contemplated under Section 20 of

the Code of Civil Procedure.

</p><p id="p_11">5.   Mr. Dave urged that the High Court appears to

have gone wrong in making a comparison between the

provisions      relating       to    cancellation        of     designs

under   <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_9">Section    51A</a>    of    the       Designs     Act,    1911    and

<a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_10">Section 19</a> of the Designs Act, 2000.                          Mr. Dave

urged   that    while     <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_11">Section         51A</a>   of     the    1911    Act

allowed a person to move for cancellation directly

before the High Court in its original jurisdiction,

under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_12">Section 19</a> of the 2000 Act an application for

cancellation could only be made to the Controller

of   Designs,    Kolkata.           Mr.    Dave      urged    that    the

conclusions     arrived    at       by    the   High    Court    on   an

analysis of the two provisions were erroneous as

was the reliance placed by the High Court on the

decision in the case of Girdharilal Gupta vs. M/s.

K. Gian Chand Jain &amp; Co. [(1978) 14 D.L.T. 132].


</p><p id="p_12">6.   Mr. Dave submitted that the decision in the

said case was clearly distinguishable on facts, as

also the finding that the cancellation of a design
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                        7</span>


under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_13">Section 51A</a> of the 1911 Act could be filed

either in the High Court having jurisdiction over

the place at which the design is registered or in

the High Court, the local jurisdiction of which has

a nexus with the subject matter of the cause of

action of the application.       Mr. Dave urged that in

the said case, the High Court made it clear that an

application for cancellation cannot be made in any

High Court merely because the applicant chose to do

so.     In fact, the applicant would have to establish

the jurisdiction of the High Court to which the

application is made by establishing a live link

between the territory in which the cause of action

and the subject matter of the application.             Mr.

Dave submitted that the sum total of the decision

in Girdharilal Gupta's case is that in the normal

course both the Calcutta High Court and the High

Court     within     whose    territorial     jurisdiction

the   cause     of   action   arises,       would    have

jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under <a href="/doc/1528332/" id="a_14">Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                    8</span></a>


<a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_15">19</a> of the Designs Act, 2000, but in some cases such

jurisdiction would also extend to any other High

Court within the local limits of which a part of

the cause of action and/or subject matter of the

application    may      arise    or   be    situate.       Mr.   Dave

urged that the latter part of the findings was not

in consonance with <a href="/doc/945860/" id="a_16">Section 19(2)</a> of the 2000 Act.


</p><p id="p_13">7.   Mr. Dave submitted that a different view had

been expressed by a learned Single Judge of the

Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/1839852/" id="a_17">M/s. Scooters India Ltd. vs.

M/s. Jaya Hind Industries Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>. [AIR 1988

Delhi 82], wherein it was held that rejection of an

application       for      grant      of    patent      under      the

provisions    of     the    <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_18">Patents        Act</a>,    1970,   and     the

Patents Rules, 1972, by the Deputy Controller of

Patents and Designs, Bombay, gave rise to a cause

of   action   whereby      appeal     against      such    order    of

refusal   could    be    filed     only     in    the   Bombay   High

Court and not in any other High Court.

</p><p id="p_14">8.   Reference was then made by Mr. Dave to the

decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1979794/" id="a_19">Ambika Industries vs.

Commissioner of Central Excise</a> [(2007) 6 SCC 769],

wherein the question as to which High Court would

have the jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from

an   order   of   the   Appellate   Tribunal    exercising

jurisdiction over several States, was in question

and this Court held that it had to be determined on

the basis of the statutory provisions and nothing

else such as dominus litus or the situs of the

Appellate    Tribunal    or   the   cause      of   action.

Accordingly, where the first forum was located in

the State other than the State where the Appellate

Tribunal was located, the appropriate High Court to

entertain the appeal was the High Court situated in

the former State and not the High Court situated in

the latter State.

<p id="p_15">

Court in <a href="/doc/1322270/" id="a_20">Canon Steels (P) Ltd. vs. Commissioner of

Mumbai whereas the appellate order was passed by

the     Customs    Excise   and    Service     Tax   Appellate

Tribunal       (CESTAT) at Delhi.       Appeal under <a href="/doc/201656/" id="a_22">Section

130</a> of the Customs Act, 1962, filed in the High

Court at Delhi was withdrawn with liberty to file

the appeal in the appropriate place. An appeal was

subsequently filed in the Punjab and Haryana High

Court at Chandigarh on the ground that a part of

the cause of action had arisen at Chandigarh. The

Punjab and Haryana High Court, however, held that

it had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.

Affirming the said view, this Court held that since

neither the original nor the appellate orders were

passed within the territorial jurisdiction of the

Punjab and Haryana High Court, it was the Delhi

High Court which had jurisdiction to entertain the

appeal.

</p><p id="p_18">10.     Mr. Dave submitted that similarly since the

entertain the statutory appeal under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_23">Section 19</a> of

<p id="p_19">

Dave on similar lines which need not detain us at

present.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">12. Mr. Dave submitted that the Delhi High Court

was     apparently   persuaded        to     make    a   comparison

between    the   provisions      of        <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_24">Section   51A</a>   of   the

Designs Act, 1911 and <a href="/doc/945860/" id="a_25">Section 19(2)</a> of the Designs

Act, 2000, which led to erroneous reliance being

placed on the decision of the Delhi High Court in

Girdharilal Gupta's case (supra) the facts whereof

were completely different and distinguishable from

the facts of this case. Mr. Dave submitted that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                 12</span>


having regard to the above, the impugned judgment

of the High Court was liable to be set aside.


</p><p id="p_23">13. Mr. Chander Lall, learned advocate, appearing

for the Respondent No.1, referred to <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_26">Sections 19</a>

and    <a href="/doc/1190122/" id="a_27">22(2)</a>   (b)   read    with    <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_28">Section    22(3)</a>    of     the

Designs     Act,   2000,    and    contended   that     the   said

provisions contemplated cancellation of a Design by

the    Controller     of    Designs,    and    punishment       for

piracy of a Design in any suit in any Court not

below that of a District Judge. Mr. Lall submitted

that when such a suit was pending before the High

Court and a defence as provided for under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_29">Section

19</a> of the Act was taken, the matter had to be

decided by the High Court and the Controller ought

not to be left to decide the said issue, as an

appeal from the Controller's order would also lie

to    the   High   Court   under    <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_30">Section    19</a>   which     could

result in conflict of decisions. In this regard

for decision was whether an injunction could be

granted in favour of a registered owner of a design

when    an     application        under        <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_32">Section       51-A</a>     of    the

Designs Act, 1911, was pending. After examining the

provisions of Section 51 A, the Full Bench on a

reference to <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_33">Sections 53</a> and <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_34">54</a> relating to piracy

<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_36">Designs Act</a>, held that the powers conferred under

<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_37">Section      53</a>         were     not     absolute           and     did     not

contemplate        an        absolute    right        in    the     owner    to

prevent      all     other      persons        from       infringing       that

design under all circumstances. It was held further

that <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_38">Section 53</a> creates a right in a registered

owner    and    in      the    absence        of   an      application      for

cancellation such a right can be enforced and no

defence      can        be     taken    based        on      a    ground     of

cancellation.            But     once        an     application          for

cancellation        is    filed,       the     Court     trying     a   suit

the same.

innumerable instances of appeals having to be filed

at the place where the cause of action had arisen

or the effect thereof was felt. By way of example,

Mr.   Lall     submitted         that    appeals         against     orders

<p id="p_39">21. In     contrast     to       the   provisions       of     <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_55">Section

51A(1)(a)</a> of the 1911 Act, <a href="/doc/691857/" id="a_56">Section 19(1)</a> of the

2000 Act, which also deals with cancellation of

registration,         provides         for    a       petition        for

cancellation     of    registration          of   a   design     to    be

filed before the Controller and not to the High

Court.     On a comparison of the two provisions of

the two enactments, it will be obvious that under

the 2000 Act the intention of the Legislature was

that an application for cancellation of a design

would lie to the Controller exclusively without the

High     Court   having      a     parallel       jurisdiction         to

entertain such matters.            It is also very clear that

all the appeals from any order of the Controller

under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_57">Section 19</a> of the 2000 Act shall lie to the

High Court.      The basic difference, therefore, as

was pointed out to the High Court and noticed by

it, is that while under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_58">Section 19</a> of the 2000 Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                           20</span>


an application for cancellation would have to be

made to the Controller of Designs, under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_59">Section

51A</a>    of    the        1911    Act     an     application      could      be

preferred either to the High Court or within one

year     from       the        date    of      registration         to   the

Controller         on    the     grounds       specified      under      Sub-

clauses      (i)    and        (ii)    of    Clause    (a)    of    <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_60">Section

51A(1)</a>.      Under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_61">Section 19</a> of the 2000 Act the power

of    cancellation         of    the    registration         lies    wholly

with     the    Controller.            On      the    other    hand,      an

application for cancellation of a design could be

made directly to the High Court under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_62">Section 51A</a>

of the 1911 Act.                 Under the 2000 Act, the High

Court would be entitled to assume jurisdiction only

at the appellate stage, whereas under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_63">Section 51A</a>

of     the   1911        Act    the     High     Court   could       itself

directly       cancel      the        registration.           Whereas      in

Girdharilal Gupta's case (supra), the question of

jurisdiction of the High Court was in relation to

an application made to the High Court directly, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                               21</span>


the instant case, we are concerned with an order of

the Controller against which an appeal is required

to   be    filed   before    the    High    Court.     While   in

Girdharilal Gupta's case the Court was considering

the expression "High Court" in the context of a

fall-out in respect of the ground of registration

and the cause of action arising on account of such

fall-out, in the present case, there is no question

of any consequential impact since the application

for cancellation of registration was on the basis

of fake documents created in order to perpetrate a

fraud.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">22. The reliance placed by the High Court on the

judgment     in    Girdharilal      Gupta's     case     (supra)

appears to be misplaced, inasmuch as, while under

the 1911 Act the High Court acts as an Original

forum, under the 2000 Act the High Court acts as an

Appellate      forum,       which     are      two      separate

jurisdictions      operating   in   two     different    fields.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                   22</span>


In   the    instant       case,    the    doctrine   of    cause   of

action, as understood under Section 20 C.P.C., has

been imported on the basis of the provisions of

<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_64">Section 51A</a> of the Designs Act, 1911, whereas the

case of the appellant would fall under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_65">Section 19</a>

of   the    Designs    Act,       2000,   where    the   High   Court

functions as the Appellate forum.                    The cause of

action      for    the      instant       proceedings      is    most

certainly the cancellation of the registered design

of the appellant which happened in the State of

West Bengal which gave the Calcutta High Court the

jurisdiction to deal with the matter.                     The Delhi

High Court, in our view, erred in holding that the

cause      of    action     had     arisen      within    its   local

jurisdiction, whereas the jurisdiction of the High

Court      was    on   account       of   the     cancellation     of

registration of the design and not on account of

the impact thereof in any particular State.                      This

is what distinguishes the decision in Girdharilal

Gupta's case from the facts of this case.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                        23</span>


</p><p id="p_42">23. Apart from the fact that the parties to the

suit were in Kolkata, it is clear that the cause of

action for the suit arose in Kolkata by virtue of

the order passed by the Controller in relation to

the appellant's design.              As the facts indicate, the

cause   of     action      for    the    suit    arose    in    Kolkata,

which, in any event, had jurisdiction to entertain

the suit.        Having erroneously applied the decision

in Girdharilal Gupta's case (supra) to the facts of

the case, the High Court was led into error in

holding that the consequence of the cancellation

gave    jurisdiction         to    the    Delhi        High    Court   to

entertain      the    suit,       without       considering      in    its

proper perspective the provisions of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_66">Section 51A</a> of

the    1911    Act    in     contrast     to     the    provisions      of

<a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_67">Section 19</a> of the 2000 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">24. The       various      decisions      cited    by    Mr.    Dave   to

support his submissions that the question as to

which     High       Court       would    have     jurisdiction         to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                         24</span>

determined on the basis of the statutory provisions

and not on the basis of dominus litus or the situs

of the Appellate Tribunal or the cause of action.

We are inclined to accept Mr. Dave's submission

that the Delhi High Court had erred in making a

comparison between the provisions of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_69">Section 51A</a> of

the 1911 Act and <a href="/doc/945860/" id="a_70">Section 19(2)</a> of the 2000 Act,

which operate on different planes.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">25. Having regard to the above, we are of the view

that the impugned order of the Delhi High Court

cannot be sustained and we, accordingly, set aside

the same and hold that in the instant case it is

the     Calcutta   High       Court   which    will    have

jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_71">Section

19</a> of the 2000 Act.           The proceedings before the

Delhi   High   Court   are,    therefore,   quashed.   The

High Court against the order of cancellation of its
