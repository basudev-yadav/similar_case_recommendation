HEADNOTE:
These petitions on behalf of the assessees raised the common
question  as  to the constitutionality of<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_5"> s. 5</a>(7-<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_6">A)  of	 the
Indian	Income-tax Act</a>, which was raised but not decided  by
this Court in <a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_7">Bidi Supply Co.  V. The Union of India</a>, (1956)
S.  C. R. 267.	Reliance was placed on the  observations  of
Bose,  J. in his Minority judgment in that case and  it	 was
contended  that	 the  section  read  with  the	explanation,
subsequently   added   to   it	 as   a	  result   of	that
decision,conferred  arbitrary  and  uncontrolled  powers  of
transfer  on  the Income-tax Commissioner  and	the  Central
Board  of Revenue, was discriminatory and violative  of	 the
provisions   of	  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Art.	14</a>  and	 imposed   an	unreasonable
restriction  on the right to carry on trade or	business  in
contravention of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_9">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.  It	 was
further	 contended  that  the omnibus  wholesale  orders  of
transfer  made without any reference to any particular	case
or  without any limitation as to time were inconvenient	 and
discriminatory	and ran counter to the majority judgment  in
that case.  The contention of the Central Board of  Revenue,
supported  by affidavits filed on its behalf, was  that	 the
section	   was	 intended   to	  minimize    administrative
inconvenience,	there was no discrimination  after  transfer
because	 the same relevant provisions of the Act as  applied
to  others  similarly  situated,  were	applied	 after	 the
transfer and any resulting inconvenience to the assessee was
sought	to be minimised by transferring his case  either  to
the  nearest  area  or,	 where that  was  not  feasible,  by
examining his accounts or evidence, if required by him, at a
place  suited  to  his convenience and	that  the  wholesale
omnibus orders of transfer were covered by the explanation:
Held,  that <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_10"> s.	 5(7A)</a> of the Indian Income-tax	 Act  was  a
measure of administrative convenience, was  constitutionally
valid  and  did not infringe any of the	 fundamental  rights
conferred  by Arts. 14 and (19)(g) of the  Constitution	 and
the  orders  of	 transfer  in question	were  saved  by	 the
explanation:  to  that section	and.  were  constitutionally
valid.
30
234
The  right conferred on the assessee by<a href="/doc/952865/" id="a_11"> s. 64(1)</a> and (2)  of
the Act was not an absolute right and must be subject to the
primary object of the Act itself, namely, the assessment and
collection  of income-tax, and where the exigencies  of	 tax
collection  so required, the Commissioner of  Income-tax  or
the Central Board of Revenue had the power under<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_12"> s. 5(7A)</a> of
the  Act to transfer his case to some other officer  outside
the  area  where he resided or carried on business  and	 any
difference  in his position created thereby as	compared  to
that  of others similarly situated would be no more  than  a
minor  deviation  from the general standard  and  would	 not
amount to a denial of equality before the law.
This  discretionary power vested in the Authorities  by	 the
section to override the statutory right of the assessee must
be  distinguished  from	 the  discretion  that	has  to	  be
exercised  in respect of a fundamental right  guaranteed  by
the  Constitution and the two tests to judge whether it	 was
discriminatory	would  be, (I) whether it  admitted  of	 the
possibility  of any real and substantial discrimination	 and
(2) whether it impinged on a fundamental right guaranteed by
the  Constitution and, so judged, the discretion  vested  in
the  Authorities  by <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_13"> s. 5</a>(7-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_14">A) of the Act</a> was	not  at	 all
discriminatory	nor did the section impose any	unreasonable
restriction on the fundamental -right to carry on trade	  or
business.

The  explanation  added to the section by the  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_21">Amending	 Act</a>
XXVI Of 1956, was intended to expand the connotation of the'
term  'case' used in the section and included  both  pending
proceedings  as also other proceedings under the  Act  which
might be commenced in respect of any year after the date  of
transfer  and  as  such	 the orders  in	 question  were	 not
unconstitutional or void.
The  Income-Tax Authorities, however, must be held bound  by
the  statements	 made  in  their  affidavits  and  where  an
assessee could make out a prima facie case of a mala fide or
discriminatory	exercise of the discretion' vested in  them,
the Court will scrutinise the circumstances in the light  of
those  statements and where necessary quash an abuse of	 the
power under Arts. 226 and 32 Of the Constitution.

intended  transfer to  the assessee concerned in order	that
he  may	 re_ resent his view of the matter  and	 record	 the

1955,  the Central Board of Revenue transferred his case  to

the assessment years 1946-47 and 1947-48.  Demands were made
upon the petitioner for payment of the amount of  income-tax

challenging the said orders of transfer by the	Commissioner
of Income-tax and the proceedings entertained by the Income-
tax Office r, Special Circle, Amritsar, against them -on the
score of the unconstitutionality of<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_39"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_40">A) of the Act</a>.

inter  alia,  of  import  and  export  of  piece-goods'	  as
commission  agents,  and  dealers  in  raw  wool  and  other
materials.  The principal place of business is at Kalimpong,
in the district of Darjeeling, though there is also a branch
at Calcutta.  These petitions concern the assessment of	 the
petitioner  to income-tax for the respective years  1944-45,
1945-46, 1946-47, 1947-48 and 1948-49.	Prior to the  orders
of the Commissioner of Income-tax under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_42"> s. 5(7A)</a> of the	 Act
complained against, the petitioner was being assessed by the
Income-tax  Officer,  Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling.  On  March  5,
1946, the cases of the petitioner were transferred from	 the
Income-tax  Officer, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, to the  Income-
tax  Officer,  Central Circle 1, Calcutta, and a  couple  of
months thereafter they were again transferred to the Income-
tax Officer, Central Circle IV, Calcutta.  On June 8,  1946,
there  was  a further transfer assigning the  cases  to	 the
Income-tax Officer, Central Circle 1, Calcutta, and on	July

unconstitutionality  of	<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_44"> s.  5(7A)</a> of the Act.	 It  may  be
noted,	however	 that  these orders were all  prior  to	 the

proceedings  under<a href="/doc/1996719/" id="a_45"> S. 46(2)</a> of the Act.	 There were  further

from  him  to  the  Income-tax	Officer,  Central  Circle,IV

petitioner  in	each  of them is the  same  individual,	 one
Kalloor	 Siddannal  who resides and carries on	business  in
Raichur	 in the State of Hyderabad as commission  agent	 and
distributor of agricultural products.  Income-tax was  first
imposed	 in the Hyderabad State in 1946 by a special Act  of
the  Legislature and the petitioner was assessed  under	 the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_47">Hyderabad  Income-tax  Act</a>  by	the  Additional	  Income-tax
Officer, Raichur, for the assessment years 1948-49 and 1949-

Raichur,  continued to assess the petitioner.  The cases  in

53  were  pending before that officer and  proceedings	were
taken  in connection with the -assessment for  those  years.

that  the case of the petitioner should be transferred	from

(5)(b)	of  the	 Act  transferring  all	 the  cases  of	 the
petitioner   to	 the  main  Income-tax	 Officer,   Raichur.
Curiously enough, the petitioner challenged both the  orders
one dated December 21, 1953, and the other made sometime  in
May,  1955, under<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_55"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_56">A) of the Act</a> and  the	 proceedings
continued   and	 instituted  by	 the   respective   officers
thereunder  as unconstitutional and void on the ground	that
s.  5  (7A)  was ultra vires the  Constitution	even  though
ultimately  he	was being assessed by  the  main  Income-tax
Officer, Raichur, under the latter order.
This  is  the common question in regard to the	ultra  vires
character  of <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_57"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_58">A) of the Act</a> which is raised  in	 all
these  petitions, though in regard to each group  there	 are
several questions of fact involving the consideration of the
discriminatory	character  of  the  specific  orders  passed
therein	 which	we  shall  deal	 with  hereafter  in   their
appropriate places.

</p><p id="p_21">The  argument  on behalf of the petitioners is that  a.	 64,
sub-ss.	 (1) and (2) of the Act confer upon the	 assessee  a
valuable  right	 and  he  is entitled  to  tell	 the  taxing
authorities  that he shall not be called upon to  attend  at
different places and thus upset his business.  <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_67">Section 5(7A)</a>
invests the Commissioner of Income-tax and the Central Board
of  Revenue with naked and arbitrary power to  transfer	 any
case from any one Income-tax Officer to another without	 any
limitation  in point of time, a power which is unguided	 and
uncontrolled  and is discriminatory in its nature and it  is
open to the Commissioner of Income-tax or the Central  Board
of  Revenue to pick out the case of one assessee from  those
of others in a like situation and transfer the same from one
State  to  another  or from one end of India  to  the  other
without	 'specifying  any  object  and	without	 giving	 any
reason,	  thus	 subjecting  the  particular   assessee	  to
discriminatory	 treatment  whereas  the   other   assessees
similarly situated with him would continue to be assessed at
the  places where they reside or carry on business under <a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_68"> s.

involved  in <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_76"> s.  5(7A)</a> is  substantial	 in  character	and,
therefore, infringes the fundamental right enshrined,in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_77">Art.
14</a>  of the Constitution.  It also infringes <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_78">Art. 19 (1)	 (g)</a>

fundamental  right  to	carry on  trade	 or  business  (<a href="/doc/1385734/" id="a_79">Vide
Himmatlal Harilal Mehta v. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a>(1)).
The very same question as regards the unconstitutionality of
s.  5(7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_80">A)  of the Act</a> had come up for decision	before	this
Court in <a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_81">Bidi Supply Co. v. The Union of India</a> (supra).	 The
case  of  the  assessee there had been	transferred  by	 the
Central Board of Revenue under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_82"> s. 5(7A)</a> of the get from	 the
Income-tax  Officer, District 111, Calcutta, to the  Income-
tax  Officer,  Special Circle, Ranchi.	The  -order  was  an
omnibus	 wholesale  order of transfer expressed	 in  general
terms without any reference to any particular case and with-
out any limitation as to time and was challenged as void  on
the ground that<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_83"> s. 5(7A)</a> under which it had been passed	 was
unconstitutional.  This Court, by a majority judgment, after
discussing  the general principles underlying <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_84">Art.  14</a>,	 did
not adjudicate upon that question, observing at p. 276:
"We  do not consider it necessary, for the purpose  of	this
case, to pause to consider whether the constitutionality  of
Sub-section.(7A)  of  <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_85">section  5</a> can  be  Supported  on	 the
</p><p id="p_23">-principle  of	any reasonable classification laid  down  by
this  Court or whether the Act lays down any  principle	 for
guiding	 or  regulating the exercise of	 discretion  by	 the
Commissioner or Board of Revenue or whether the	 sub-section
confers an unguided and arbitrary power on those authorities
to  pick  and  choose individual  assessee  and	 place	that
assessee   at  a  disadvantage	in  comparison	with   other
assessees. it is enough for the purpose of this case to	 say
that   the   omnibus  order  made  in  this   case,   is-not
contemplated
(I)  [1954] S.C.R. 1122.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">244</span>
<p id="p_24">or  sanctioned by sub-section (7A) and that, therefore,	 the
petitioner   is	 still	entitled  to  the  benefit  of	 the
provisions  of sub-sections (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_86">section 64</a>.	 All
assessees are entitled to the benefit of those pro.  visions
except	where  a particular case or cases  of  a  particular
assessee   for	a  particular  year  or	 years	is  or	 are
transferred  under sub-section (7A) of <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_87">section	5</a>,  assuming
that  section to be valid and if a particular case or  cases
is  or	are  transferred his right under  <a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_88">section  64</a>  still
remains as regards his other case or cases."
The majority judgment then proceeded to consider the  effect
of  such an omnibus order unlimited in point of time on	 the
rights of the assessee and further observed in that  context
at p. 277:
</p><p id="p_25">"   This  order	 is  calculated	 to   inflict	considerable
inconvenience  and harassment on the petitioner.  Its  books
of  account will have to be produced before  the  Income-tax
Officer,  Special Circle, Ranchi-a place hundreds  of  miles
from Calcutta, which is its place of business.	Its partners
or  principal  officers will have to be away from  the	head
office	for  a	considerable  period  neglecting  the	main
business of the firm.  There may be no suitable place  where
they can put up during that period.  There will certainly be
extra  expenditure  to be incurred by it by way	 of  railway
fare, freight and hotel expenses.  Therefore the reality  of
the discrimination cannot be gainsaid.	In the circumstances
this  substantial discrimination has been inflicted  on	 the
petitioner by an executive fiat which is not founded on	 any
law  and  no  question	of  reasonable	classification	 for
purposes  of legislation can arise.  Here "the State"  which
includes  its Income-tax department has by an illegal  order
denied	to the petitioner, as compared with other Bidi	mer-
chants who are similarly situate, equality before the law or
the  equal  protection of the laws and	the  petitioner	 can
legitimately  complain of an infraction of  his	 fundamental
right under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_89">Article 14</a> of the Constitution."
The question as to the constitutionality of<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_90"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_91">A) of the
Act</a> was thus left open and the decision turned merely on the
construction of the impugned order.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">			    245</span>
<p id="p_26">Learned	  counsel   for	 the  petitioners,   however,	lays
particular  stress on the observations of Bose, J.,  in	 the
minority judgment which he delivered in that case whereby he
held  that <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_92"> ss.	 5</a>  (7A) and 64 (5)  (b)  of  the  Act	were
themselves  ultra vires <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_93">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution and	 not
merely	the  order  of the Central Board  of  Revenue.	 The
learned	 Judge	referred to a passage from the	judgment  of
Fazl  Ali,  J.,	 in <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_94">The State of West Bengal  v.  Anwar	 Ali
Sarkar</a>(1) and also pointed out the decision of this Court in
<a href="/doc/1466885/" id="a_95">M/S.  Dwarka  Prasad  Laxmi Narain v.  The  State  of  Uttar
Pradesh and Two Others</a>(2) and observed:
</p><p id="p_27">"  What	 is  the position here?	 There	is  no	hearing,  no
reasons	 are recorded: just peremptory	orders	transferring
the case from one place to another without any warning;	 and
the  power given by the Act is to transfer from one  end  of
India  to  the	other; nor is that power  unused.   We	have
before	us in this Court a case pending in which a  transfer
has  been ordered from Calcutta in West Bengal to Ambala  in
the Punjab." (p. 283)
"  If the Legislature itself had done here what the  Central
Board of Revenue has done and had passed an Act in the	bald
terms  of the order made here transferring the case of	this
petitioner, picked out from others in a like situation, from
one State to another, or from one end of India to the other,
without specifying any object and without giving any reason,
it would, in my judgment, have been bad.  I am unable to see
how  the position is bettered because the Central  Board  of
Revenue has done this and not Parliament." (p. 284-5)
" In my opinion, the power of transfer can only be conferred
if  it	is hedged round with  reasonable  restrictions,	 the
absence	 or existence of which can in the last	instance  be
determined by the courts; and the exercise of the power must
be in conformity with the rules of natural justice, that  is
to  say,  the parties affected must be heard  when  that  is
reasonably  possible, and the reasons for the order must  be
reduced,  however briefly, to writing so that men  may	know
that

</p><p id="p_28">(2) [1954] S. C. R. 803.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">246</span>
<p id="p_29">the  powers  conferred on these	 quasi-judicial	 bodies	 are
being justly and properly exercised." (p. 287)
The answer furnished on behalf of the State to this argument
is fourfold:
</p><p id="p_30">(i)that the provision contained in<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_96"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_97">A) of the Act</a> is a
measure	 of administrative convenience enacted with a  view-
to more conveniently and effectively deal with the cases  of
the assessees where the Commissioner of Income-tax considers
it  necessary  or desirable to transfer any  case  from	 one
Income-tax  Officer  subordinate to him to  another  or	 the
Central Board of Revenue similarly considers it necessary or
desirable  to  transfer	 any case from	any  one  Income-tax
Officer	 to another.  The real object with which<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_98"> s.  5</a>	(7A)
was  inserted by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_99">Indian Income-tax Amendment  Act</a>,	1940
(XL of 1940), has been thus set out in the affidavit of Shri
V. Gouri Shankar, Under Secretary, Central Board of Revenue,
dated  November	 19, 1956, which is the pattern of  all	 the
affidavits filed on behalf of the State in these petitions:
"  4......  I  say that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_100"> s.  5</a>  (7A)	were
inserted  by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_101">Income-tax Amendment Act</a>, XL of 1940,	with
the  object of minimising certain  procedural  difficulties.
Before	this  amendment	 was passed there  was	no  specific
provision  in  the  Act for transferring  a  case  from	 one
Income-tax  Officer  to	 -another  except  by  a  long	 and
circuitous course even at the request of the assessees.	  In
order therefore to be able to transfer the case from one  1.
T.  0.	to  another either because of  the  request  of	 the
assessee  or  for  dealing  with  cases	 involving   special
features  such	as cases of assessees  involving  widespread
activities   and   large  ramifications	  or   inter-related
transactions, power to transfer cases was conferred upon the
Central Board of Revenue and the Commissioner of  Income-tax
as the case may be.  I say that the provisions of<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_102"> s. 5</a>	(7A)
ate  thus  administrative in  character........
</p><p id="p_31">(ii)that  the  assessee whose case is  thus  transferred  is
not subjected to any discriminatory procedure in the  matter
of his assessment.  The Income-tax Officer to whom his	case
is transferred deals with it under the same procedure  which
is laid down in the relevant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">			    247</span>
provisions  of	the  Act.  The decision	 of  the  Income-tax
Officer is subject to appeal before the Appellate  Assistant
Commissioner  and  the	assessee has the  further  right  to
appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and to  approach
the High Court and ultimately the Supreme Court, as provided
in the Act.  All assessees, whether they are assessed by the
Income-tax Officer of the area where they reside or carry on
business or their cases are transferred from one  Income-tax
Officer	 to another, are subject to the same  procedure	 and
are entitled to the same rights and privileges in the matter
of redress of their grievances, if any, and there is no dis-
crimination whatever between assessees and assessees;
</p><p id="p_32">(iii)that  the	right, if any, conferred upon  the  assessee
under<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_103"> s. 64</a> (1) and (2) of the Act is not an absolute  right
but is circumscribed by the exigencies of tax collection and
can  be	 negatived  as	it  has	 been  in  cases  where	 the
Commissioner of Income-tax or the Central Board of  Revenue,
as  the	 case  may be, think it necessary  or  desirable  to
transfer  his  case from one Income-tax Officer	 to  another
under <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_104"> s.  5</a>  (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_105">A)  of the Act</a>	having	regard	to  all	 the
circumstances of the case.  The argument of inconvenience is
thus sought to be met in the same affidavit:
" 5. 1 further say that as a result of any transfer that may
be  made  under	 the provisions of<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_106"> s. 5</a>	 (7A)  there  is  no
discriminatory	treatment with regard to the  procedure	 and
that  no  privileges  and  rights which	 are  given  to	 the
assessees  by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_107">Income-tax Act</a> are taken away nor  is	 the
assessee  exposed  to  any  increased  prejudice,   punitary
consequences or differential treatment.	 I say that in cases
where  transfers under this section are made otherwise	than
on request from assessees, the convenience of the  assessees
is taken into consideration by placing the case in the hands
of an Income-tax Officer who is nearest to the area where it
will  be  convenient  for the assessee	to  attend.   If  on
account	 of administrative exigencies this is  not  possible
and  the assessee requests that the examination of  accounts
or  evidence to be taken should be in a place convenient  to
him, the I.T.O. complies with the request
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">248</span>
of  the	 assessee  and	holds  the  hearing  at	 the   place
requested."
</p><p id="p_33">Even  if there be a difference between assessees who  reside
or carry on business in a particular area by reason of	such
transfers  the	difference is not material. -It	 is  only  a
minor deviation from a general standard and does not  amount
to a denial of equal rights;
</p><p id="p_34">(iv)that  the power which is thus vested is a  discretionary
power  and is not necessarily discriminatory in	 its  nature
and  that abuse of power is not to be easily  assumed  where
discretion  is vested in such high officials of	 the  State.
Even if abuse of power may sometimes occur, the validity  of
the   provision	  cannot  be  contested	 because   of	such
apprehension.  What may be struck down in such cases is	 not
the  provision	itself but  the	 discriminatory	 application
thereof.
</p><p id="p_35">The petitioners rejoin by relying upon the following passage
from  the  judgment of Fazl Ali, J., in <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_108">The  State  Of	West
Bengal	v. Anwar Ali Sarkar, (Supra</a>), which was referred  to
by Bose, J., in his minority judgment in Bidi Supply Co.  v.
The Union of India, (Supra), at page 281:
</p><p id="p_36">" It was suggested that the reply to this query is that	 the
Act  itself being general and applicable to all persons	 and
to all offenses, cannot be Said to discriminate in favour of
or  against  any particular case or classes  of	 persons  or
cases, and if any charge of discrimination can be leveled at
all,  it  can  be  levelled only  against  the	act  of	 the
executive  authority  if the Act is misused.  This  kind  of
argument  however  does	 not  appear  to  me  to  solve	 the
difficulty.   The result of accepting it would be that	even
where discrimination is quite evident  one cannot  challenge
the  Act simply because it Is couched in general terms;	 and
one cannot also challenge the act of the executive authority
whose  duty  it	 is  to administer  the	 Act,  because	that
authority  will say:-I am not to blame as I am acting  under
the  Act.   It	is clear that if the  argument	were  to  be
,accepted, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_109">article 14</a> could be easily defeated.	 I think the
fallacy	 of the argument lies in overlooking the  fact	that
the I insidious discrimination complained of is incorporated
in the Act itself', it being so drafted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">			    249</span>
that whenever any discrimination is made such discrimination
would be ultimately traceable to it.
</p><p id="p_37">The  pivot of the whole argument of the petitioners  is	 the
provisions  contained in<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_110"> s. 64(1)</a> and (2) of the  Act  which
prescribe the place of assessment.  They are:-
"  64.	(1)  Where  an	assessee  carries  on  a   business,
profession or vocation at any place, he shall be assessed by
the  Income-tax Officer- of the area in which that place  is
situate	 or, where the business, profession or	vocation  is
carried	 on  in	 more places than  one,	 by  the  Income-tax
Officer	 of  the area in which the principal  place  of	 his
business, profession or vocation is situate.
(2)In all other cases, an assessee shall be assessed by	 the
Income-tax Officer of the area in which he resides."
These provisions were construed by the Bombay High Court  in
<a href="/doc/565123/" id="a_111">Dayaldas  Kushiram  v. Commissioner  Income-tax,  (Central</a>),
(supra), and Beaumont, C.J., observed at p. 657:
"  In my opinion <a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_112">section 64</a> was intended to ensure  that  as
far  as practicable an assessee should be assessed  locally,
and  the  area to which an Income-tax Officer  is  appointed
must,  so  far as the 'exigencies of tax  collection  allow,
bear  some  reasonable	relation  to  the  place  where	 the
assessee carries on business or resides."
Kania, J., as he then was, went a step further and stated at
p. 660:
</p><p id="p_38">"A  plain  reading  of the section shows that  the  same  is
imperative  in	terms.	 It also gives	to  the	 assessee  a
valuable   right.   He	is  entitled  to  tell	the   taxing
authorities  that he shall not be called upon to  attend  at
different places and thus upset his business."
The  learned  Judges  there  appear  to	 have  treated	 the
provisions  of<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_113"> s. 64(1)</a> and (2) more as a question of  right
than as a matter of convenience only.  If there were thus  a
right  conferred upon the assessee by the provisions  of <a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_114"> s.
64(1)</a>  and  (2) of the Act and that right  continues  to  be
enjoyed. by all the assessees except the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">32</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">250</span>
assessee whose case is transferred under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_115"> s. 5(7A)</a> of the Act
to  another  Income-tax Officer outside the  area  where  he
resides or carries on business, the assessee can urge  that,
as compared with those other assessees, he is  discriminated
against	 and is subjected to inconvenience  and	 harassment.
It  is,	 therefore, necessary to consider whether  any	such
right is conferred upon the assessee by<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_116"> s. 64(1)</a> and (2)  of
the Act.
</p><p id="p_39">Prima  facie  it would appear that an assessee	is  entitled
under  those  provisions to be assessed	 by  the  Income-tax
Officer of the particular area where he ,resides or  carries
on  business.  Even where a question arises as to the  place
of  assessment	such  question	is  under <a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_117"> s.  64(3)</a>  to  be
determined   by	 the  Commissioner  or	 the   Commissioners
concerned  if the question is between places in more  States
than  one or by the Central Board of Revenue if	 the  latter
are,  not  in  agreement  and  the  assessee  is  given	  an
opportunity  of	 representing  his  views  before  any	such
question  is determined.  This provision also goes  to	show
that   the   convenience  of  the  assessee  is	  the	main
consideration in determining the place of assessment.	Even
so  the	 exigencies  of	 tax  collection  have	got  to	  be
considered  and	 the primary object of the  Act,  viz.,	 the
assessment  of	income-tax,  has got to	 be  achieved.	 The
hierarchy  of income-tax authorities which is set  up  under
Chapter	 11  of the Act has been so set up with	 a  view  to
assess	the  proper income-tax payable by the  assessee	 and
whether the one or the other of the authorities will proceed
to assess a particular assessee has got to be determined not
only  having regard to the convenience of the  assessee	 but
also  the exigencies of tax collection.	 In order to  assess
the-tax	 payable  by  an  assessee  more  conveniently	 and
efficiently  it may be necessary to have him assessed by  an
Income-tax  Officer of an area other than the one in  which,
he  resides  or	 carries on business.  It may  be  that	 the
nature	and  volume of his business operations are  such  as
require investigation into his affairs in a place other than
the  one where he resides or carries on business or that  he
is so, connected with various other individuals or organiza-
tions in the way of his earning his income as to render
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">			    251</span>
such  extra-tertitorial investigation necessary:  before  he
may  be properly assessed.  These are but instances  of	 the
various situations which may arise wherein it may be thought
necessary by the Income-tax authorities to transfer his case
from the Income-tax, Officer of the area in which he resides
or  carries  on	 business  to,	another	 Income-tax  Officer
whether	 functioning in the same State or beyond  it.	This
aspect of the question wag emphasized by Beaumont, C.J.,  in
<a href="/doc/565123/" id="a_118">Dayaldas Kushiram v. Commissioner of Income-tax,  (Central</a>),
(supra),  at page 146, when he used the expression " as	 far
as practicable " in connection with the assessee's right  to
be  assessed  locally  and  the	 expression  "	so  far	  as
exigencies of tax collection allow " in connection with	 the
appointment  of	 the Income-tax Officer to  assess  the	 tax
payable	 by the particular assessee.  In the later  case  of
<a href="/doc/565123/" id="a_119">Dayaldas    Kushiram   v.   Commissioner   of	 Income-tax,
(Central</a>)(1), Beaumont, C.J., expressed himself as follows:
"  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_120">The	Income-tax  Act</a>	 does not  determine  the  place  of
assessment.  What it does is to determine the Officer who is
to  have  power to assess and in some cases it	does  so  by
reference  to locality but I apprehend that an appeal  would
be not against an order of the Commissioner as to the  place
of  assessment, but against the order of assessment  of	 the
Income-tax, Officer,"
</p><p id="p_40">thus  stating  in effect that this section does not  give  a
right  to the assessee to have his assessment, at  a  parti-
cular place but determines the Income-tax Officer who is  to
have power to assess him.
</p><p id="p_41">This  aspect was further emphasized by the Federal Court  in
<a href="/doc/114104/" id="a_121">Wallace	 Brothers  &amp;  Co. v.  Commissioner  of,	 Income-tax,
Bombay, Sind &amp; Baluchistan</a> (2), where Spens, C.J., observed:
Clause	(3)  of<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_122"> s. 64</a> provides that any question as  to	 the

not satisfied, with the

<p id="p_43">correctness of the claim, refer the matter for determination
under  this  sub-section before assessment is  made.   These
provisions  clearly indicate that the matter is more one  of
administrative convenience than of jurisdiction and that  in
any event it is not one for adjudication by the Court."
It may be noted, however, that in the passage at page 276 of
the  majority  judgment in <a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_123">Bidi Supply Co. v. The  Union  of
India</a> (supra), this court regarded the benefit conferred  on
the assessee by these provisions of a. 64(1) and (2) of	 the
Act as a right and it is, too late in the day for us to	 say
that no such right to be assessed by the Income-tax  Officer
of  the particular area, where he resides or carries on	 his
business is conferred on the assessee.	This right, however,
according to the authorities above referred to, is hedged in
with  the limitation that it has to yield to the  exigencies
of tax collection.
</p><p id="p_44">The  position, therefore, is that the determination of	the,
question  whether  a particular	 Income-tax  Officer  should
assess	the  case  of  the  assessee  depends  on  (1)	 the
convenience of the assessee as posited in<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_124"> s. 64</a> (1) and	 (2)
of the Act, and (2) the exigencies of tax collection and  it
would  be  open to -the Commissioner of Income-tax  and	 the
Central	 Board	of Revenue who are the highest	amongst	 the
Income-tax.  Authorities under the Act to transfer the	case
of a particular assessee from the Income-tax Officer of	 the
area  within which he resides or carries on business to	 any
other Income-tax Officer if the exigencies of tax collection
warrant the same.
</p><p id="p_45">It  is further to be noted that the infringement of  such  a
right  by the order of transfer, under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_125"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_126">A) of the	 Act</a>
is not a material infringement.	 It is only a deviation of a
minor  character  from	the general standard  and  does	 not
necessarily involve a denial of equal rights for the  simple
reason that even after such transfer the case is dealt	with
under the normal procedure which is prescribed in the  -Act.
The  production and investigation of the books	of  account,
the  enquiries to be made by the Income-tax Officer and	 the
whole  of  the	procedure as  to  assessment  including	 the
further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">			    253</span>
appeals	 after	the  assessment is  made  by  the  Incometax
Officer	 are  the same in a transferred case  as  in  others
which  remain  with the Income-tax Officer of  the  area  in
which the other assesees reside or carry on business.  There
is  thus  no  differential treatment and no  scope  for	 the
argument  that	the  particular	 assessee  is  discriminated
against with reference to others similarly situated.  It was
observed by this Court in,
<a href="/doc/1787773/" id="a_127">M.   K. Gopalan v. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a>(1):
" In support of the objection raised under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_128">article 14</a> of the
Constitution,  reliance	 is placed on the decision  of	this
Court  in Anwar Ali Sarkar's case.  That decision,  however,
applies	 only  to  a  case where  on  the  allotment  of  an
individual case to a special Court authorised to conduct the
trial  -by  a  procedure substantially	different  from	 the
normal	procedure, discrimination arises as between  persons
who  have committed similar offences, by one or more out  of
them  being  subjected to a procedure, which  is  materially
different  from	 the normal procedure and  prejudicing	them
thereby.   In  the pre-' sent case, the	 Special  Magistrate
under <a href="/doc/862285/" id="a_129"> s. 14</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code has to try-	 the
case   entirely	  under	 the  normal  procedure,   and	 'no
discrimination	of the kind contemplated by the decision  in
Anwar  Ali  Sarkar'd case and the other cases  following  it
arises here.  A law vesting discretion in an authority under
such  circumstances cannot be said to be  discriminatory  as
such,  and  is	therefore  not hit  by	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_130">article	 14</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	There  is, therefore, no substance  in	this
contention."
</p><p id="p_46">To a similar effect were the observations of Mukherjea,	 J.,
as  he	then was, in <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_131">The State of West Bengal v.  Anwar	 Ali

</p><p id="p_48">It  is pointed out that as<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_132"> s. 64</a> (5) stands at present,	 the

have  the  benefit  of<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_139"> s. 64</a> (1) and  (2).   This  argument,

of the enactment of the relevant provision in<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_141"> s. 64</a> (5)	 and

the basis of which such transfers can be made and the  whole
matter is left to the unrestrained will of the	Commissioner
of Income-tax or the Central Board of Revenue without  there
being anything which could ensure a proper execution of	 the

<p id="p_53">In  other  words,  "  it is not	 a  question  of  an  uncon-
stitutional  administration of a statute otherwise valid  on
its  face but here the unconstitutionality is writ large  on
the  face of the statute itself " (Per Das, J., as  he	then
was,  in  <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_146">The  State of West Bengal v.	Anwar  Ali,  Sarkar</a>,
(supra) at p. 346).
</p><p id="p_54">It  has to be remembered that the purpose of the Act  is  to
levy income-tax, assess and collect the same.  The  preamble
of  the	 Act  does not say so in terms it being	 an  Act  to
consolidate  and  amend the law relating to  income-tax	 and
super-tax but that is the purpose of the Act as disclosed in
the preamble of the First Indian Income-tax Act of 1886 (Act
II of 1886).  It follows, therefore, that all the provisions
contained  in the Act have been designed with the object  of
achieving that purpose.	 There is in the first instance, the
charge	of  income-tax.	  Then we find set  up	the  various
authorities  in	 the hierarchy who are	entrusted  with	 the
function  of assessing the income-tax, the Central Board  of
Revenue	 being	at  the apex.  There is	 also  an  Appellate
Tribunal  which is established for hearing  appeals  against
the  decisions	of the	Appellate  Assistant  Commissioners.
Then follow the provisions in regard to taxable income, mode
of  assessment	and  cognate  provisions.   The	  Income-tax
Officers  are  invested	 with the  duty'  of  assessing	 the
income-tax  of	the assessees in the  first  instance.	 The
Assistant  Commissioners  of Income-tax, are  the  appellate
authorities  over the decisions of the	Income-tax  Officers
and the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal is the final appellate
authority barring of course references under<a href="/doc/1068066/" id="a_147"> s. 66(1)</a> of the
Act   to   the	High  Court  on	 questions  of	 law.	 The
Commissioners of Income-tax and the Central Board of Revenue
are  mainly administrative authorities over  the  Income-tax
Officers  and the Assistant Commissioners of Income-tax	 and
they  are to distribute and control the work to be  done  by
these authorities.  All officers and persons employed in the
execution  of the Act are to observe and follow	 the  orders
instructions  and  directions  of  the.	  Central  Board  of
Revenue which is the highest authority in the hierarchy and,
even though normally in accordance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">256</span>
with  the  provisions  of <a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_148"> s. 64</a> (1) and  (2)  the  work  of
assessment  is to be done by the Income-tax Officers of	 the
area within which the assessees reside or carry on business,
power is given by<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_149"> s. 5(7A)</a> to the Commissioner of Income-tax
to transfer any case from one Income-tax Officer subordinate
to  him	 to another and to the Central Board of	 Revenue  to
transfer  any  case  from  any	one  Income-tax	 Officer  to
another.  This is the administrative machinery which is	 set
up  for	 assessing the incomes of the  assessees  which	 are
chargeable to income-tax.  There is, therefore, considerable
force  in the contention which has been urged on  behalf  of
the  State that<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_150"> s. 5(7A)</a> is a provision	 for  administrative
convenience.
</p><p id="p_55">Nevertheless  this power which is given to the	Commissioner
of  Income-tax	and the Central Board of Revenue has  to  be
exercised in a manner which is not discriminatory.  No rules
or  directions	having	been  laid down	 in  regard  to	 the
exercise of that power in particular cases, the	 appropriate
authority  has	to determine what are the  proper  cases  in
which  such power should be exercised having regard  to	 the
object of the Act and the ends to be achieved.	The cases of
the  assessees which come for assessment before the  income-
tax  authorities  are of various types and no  one  case  is
similar	 to another. there are complications  introduced  by
the  very nature of the business which is carried on by	 the
assessees  and	there  may be,	in  particular	cases,	such
widespread  activities	and large  ramifications  or  inter-
related transactions as might require for the convenient and
efficient  assessment  of income-tax the  transfer  of	such
cases from one Income-tax Officer to another.  In such cases
the  Commissioner  of  Income-tax or the  Central  Board  of
Revenue, as the case may be, has to exercise its  discretion
with  due regard to the exigencies of tax collection.	Even
though there may be a common attribute between the  assesses
whose  case  is	 thus transferred  and	the  assessees;	 who
continue  to  be assessed by the Income-tax Officer  of	 the
area  within  which they reside or carry  on  business,	 the
other attributes would not be common.  One assessee may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">			    257</span>
have  such widespread activities and ramifications as  would
require	 his  case  to be transferred  from  the  Income-tax
Officer	 of the particular area to an Income-tax Officer  of
another	 area in the same State or in another  State,  which
may be called " X ". Another assessee, though belonging to a
similar	 category may be more conveniently  and	 efficiently
assessed  in another area whether situated within the  State
or  without it, called " Y ". The considerations which	will
weigh  with  the Commissioner of Income-tax or	the  Central
Board of Revenue in transferring the cases of such  assessee
either to the area " X " or the area " Y " will depend	upon
the  particular circumstances of each case and no  hard	 and
fast  rule  can	 be laid down for  determining	whether	 the
particular  case  should , be transferred at 'all or  to  an
Income-tax  Officer of a particular area.   Such  discretion
would  necessarily  have  to  be  vested  in  the  authority
concerned  and	merely	because the  case  of  a  particular
assessee  is transferred from the Income-tax Officer  of  an
area  within  which  he resides or carries  on	business  to
another	 Income-tax  Officer whether wit in or	without	 the
State  will not by itself be sufficient to characterize	 the
exercise of the discretion as discriminatory.  Even if there
is  a  possibility of discriminatory  treatment	 of  persons
falling within the same group or category, such	 possibility
cannot necessarily invalidate the piece of legislation.
It  may also be remembered that this power is vested not  in
minor  officials  but in top-ranking  authorities  like	 the
Commissioner of Income-tax and the Central Board of  Revenue
who  act on the information supplied to them by the  Income-
tax Officers concerned.	 This power is discretionary and not
necessarily  discriminatory  and abuse of  power  cannot  be
easily	assumed where the discretion is vested in such	high
officials. (<a href="/doc/701977/" id="a_151">Vide Matajog Dobey v. H. S. Bhari</a>(1)).  There is
moreover a presumption that public officials will  discharge
their  duties honestly and in accordance with the  rules  of
law. (Vide People of the State of
(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 925, 932.

<p id="p_56">New.  York v. John E. Van De Carr, etc.(1) It has also	been
observed  by this Court in <a href="/doc/407809/" id="a_152">A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar  v.  M.
Venkitachalam Potti</a>(2) with reference to the possibility  of
discrimination	between	 assessees  in	the  matter  of	 the
reference  of  their cases to the  Income-tax  Investigation
Commission that " It is to be presumed, unless the, contrary
were  shown,  that the 'administration of a  particular	 law
would  be done I not with an evil eye and unequal hand'	 and
the selection made by the Government of the cases of persons
to be referred for investigation by the Commission would not
be discriminatory."
</p><p id="p_57">This  presumption, however, cannot be stretched too far	 and
cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there
must  be some undisclosed and unknown reason for  subjecting
certain	  individuals	or  corporations  to   hostile	 and
discriminatory treatment (Vide Gulf, Colorado, etc. v. W. H.
Ellis (3)).  There may be cases where improper execution  of
power will result in injustice to the parties.	As has	been
observed,  however, the possibility of	such  discriminatory
treatment cannot necessarily invalidate the legislation' and
where there is an abuse of such power, the parties aggrieved
are not without ample remedies under the law (<a href="/doc/1002719/" id="a_153">Vide Dinabandu
Sahu v. Jadumony Mangaraj</a> (4)).	 What will be struck down in
such  cases  will  not be the provision	 which	invests	 the
authorities  with  such	 power but the abuse  of  the  power
itself.
</p><p id="p_58">It  is	pointed that it will be next to impossible  for	 the
assessee  to  challenge	 a  particular	order  made  by	 the
Commissioner of Income-tax or the Central Board of  Revenue,
as  the case may be, as discriminatory because the  reasons.
which  actuated	 the authority in making the order  will  be
known to itself not being recorded in the body of the  order
itself or communicated to the assesse.	The burden  moreover
will  be  on the assessee to demonstrate that the  order  of
transfer  is  an  abuse of power  vested  in  the  authority
concerned.   This  apprehension	 is,  however,	ill-founded.

<p id="p_62">burden	of proving that there is an abuse of  power,lies  on
the  assessee  who challenges the order	 as  discriminatory,
such  burden is not by way of proof to the hilt.  There	 are
instances where in the case of an accused person rebutting a
presumption  or proving an. exception which  will  exonerate
him  from  the liability for the offence with which  he	 has
been  charged,	the  burden  is held  to  be  discharged  by
evidence  satisfying  the jury of the  probability  of	that
which  the accused is called upon to establish (Vide Rex  v.
Carr-Briant  (1)),  or in the case of a	 detenue  under	 the
Preventive Detention Act seeking to make out a case of	want
of  bona  fides in the detaining authority,  the  burden  of
proof is held not to be one which requires proof to the hilt
but such as will render the absence of bona fides reasonably
probable  (<a href="/doc/979788/" id="a_154">Vide Ratanlal Gupta v. The District Magistrat  of
Ganjam</a> also <a href="/doc/1740146/" id="a_155">Brundaban Chandra Dhir Narendra v. The State  of
Orissa	(Revenue  Department</a>)  (3)).  If,  in  a  particular
,case,	the assessee seeks to impeach the order of  transfer
is an abuse of power pointing out circumstances which  prima
facie and without anything more would make out the  exercise
of the power discriminatory qua him, it will be incumbent on
the  authority to explain the circumstances under which	 the
order  has  been  made.	  The court  will,  in	that  event,

<a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_159">Bidi Supply Co. v. The Union of India</a>, (supra), which in the
context	  of  the  omnibus  wholesale  order   in   question
emphasized  the	 substantial  discrimination  to  which	 the
assessee  there	 had been subjected as compared	 with  other
bidi   merchants   who	 were	similarly   situated.	 The
inconvenience and harassiment to which the assessee was thus
put  were  considered  to be violative of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_160">Art.	 14</a>  of	 the
Constitution   and   it	 is  urged  that <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_161"> s.   5</a>   (7A)	  is
unconstitutional  in Boar as it is open to the	Commissioner
of  Income-tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the	case
may be, to make an order of transfer subjecting the assessee
to such inconvenience and harassment at their sweet will and
pleasure.   This argument of inconvenience, however, is	 not
conclusive.  There is no fundamental right in an assessee to
be  assessed  in  a  particular	 area  or  locality.	Even
considered  in the context of<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_162"> s. 64</a> (1) and (2) of  the	 Act
this  right  which  is conferred upon  the  assessee  to  be
assessed in a particular area or locality is not an absolute
right  but is subject to the exigencies of  tax	 collection.
The  difference,  if  any, created in the  position  of	 the
assessee  qua  others who- continue to be  assessed  by	 the
Income-tax Officer of the area in which they reside or carry
on  business  is  not  a material  difference  but  a  minor
deviation  from the general standard and  would,  therefore,
not amount to the denial of equal rights (Per Mukherjea, J.,
as  he	then was, in <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_163">The State of West Bengal v.  Anwar	 Ali
Sarkar</a>., (supra), at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">261</span>
p.   325)).  There is also the further fact to be borne mind
that  this  inconvenience  to the assessee is  sough  to  be
minimised  by the authority concerned transferring the	case
of such assessee to the Income-tax Officer who is nearest to
the  area where it would be convenient for the	assessee  to
attend and if, on account of administrative exigencies, this
is   not  possible  an	the  assessee  requests	  that	 the
examination of account or evidence to be taken should be  in
a  place  convenient  to  him,	by  the	 Income-tax  Officer
complying  with the request of the assessee and holding	 the
hearing	 at the place requested.  We are bound to  take	 the
statement contained in para 5 of the affidavit of Shri.	  V.
Gouri  Shankar at its face value and if this is done  as  it
should be, the assessee will not be put to any inconvenience
or  harassment and the proper balance between the rights  of
the subject and public interest will be preserved.
It is, therefore, clear that the power which is veste in the
Commissioner of Income-tax or the Central Board of  Revenue,
as  the	 case may be, under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_164"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_165">A) of the Act</a>  is  not  a
naked	and   arbitrary	 power,	 unfettered,   unguided	  or
uncontrolled  so  as  to enable the authority  to  pick	 and
choose	one  assessee out of those  similarly  circumstanced
thus subjecting him to discriminatory treatment as  compared
with others who fall within the same category.	The power is
guided and controlled by the purpose which is to be achieved
by  the	 Act  itself, viz., the charge	of  income-tax,	 the
assessment  and collection thereof, and is to  be  exercised
for the more convenient and efficient collection of the	 tax
A wide discretion is given to the authorities concerned	 for
the  achievement  of  that purpose, in	the  matter  of	 the
transfer  of the cases of the assessees from one  Income-tax
Officer	 to another and it cannot be urged that	 such  power
which is vested in the authorities is discriminatory in	 its
nature.
</p><p id="p_66">There is a broad distinction between discretion which has to
be  exercised with regard to a fundamental right  guaranteed
by  the Constitution and some other right which is given  by
the statute.  If the statute deals with a right which is not
fundamental in character
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">262</span>
the  statute  can take it away but a fundamental  right	 the
statute cannot take away.  Where, for example, a  discretion
is  given in the matter of issuing licences for carrying  on
trade,	profession  or business or  where  restrictions	 are
imposed	 on  freedom  of speech, etc., by  a  imposition  of
censorship, the discretion must be controlled by clear rules
so   as	  to  come  within  the	  category   of	  reasonable
restrictions.	 Discretion   of   that	  nature   must	  be
differentiated	from  discretion in respect of	matters	 not
involving fundamental rights such as transfers of cases.  An
inconvenience  resulting  from a change of  place  or  venue
occurs	when  any  case is transferred	from  one  place  to
another	 but  it  is  not open to a  party  to	say  that  a
fundamental right has been infringed by such transfer.	 Ili
other words, the discretion vested has to be looked at	from
two  points  of	 view,	ViZ.,  (1)  does  it  admit  of	 the
possibility of any real and substantial discrimination,	 and
(2) does it impinge on a fundamental right guaranteed by the
Constitution?	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_166">Article	 14</a> can be invoked  only  when	both
these  conditions are satisfied.  Applying this test, it  is
clear  that  the  discretion which is  vested  in  the	Com-
missioner of Income-tax or the Central Board of Reevenue, as
the   case  may	 be,  under <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_167"> s.	 5</a>  (7A)  is  not   at	 all
discriminatory.
</p><p id="p_67">It  follows,  therefore, that<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_168"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_169">A) of the	Act</a>  is	 not
violative  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_170">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution and also does	 not
impose any unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right
to  carry on trade or business enshrined in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_171">Art. 19 (1)	 (g)</a>
of the Constitution.  If there is any abuse of power it	 can
be remedied by appropriate action -either under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_172">Art. 226</a>  or
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_173">Art.  32</a> of the constitution and what can  be  struck
down is not the provision contained in<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_174"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_175">A) of the	 Act</a>
but  the order passed thereunder which may be mala  fide  or
violative,of  these fundamental rights.	 This  challenge  of
the vires of<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_176"> s. 5</a> (7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_177">A) of the Act</a>, therefore, fails.
We may, however, before we leave this topic observe that  it
would  be prudent if the principles of natural justice	are,
followed,  where circumstances permit, before any  order  of
transfer  under	<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_178"> s.  5</a>	(7<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_179">A)  of the  Act</a>  is  made  by	 the
Commissioner of Income-tax or the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">			    263</span>
Central Board of Revenue, as the case may be, and notice  is
given to the party affected and he is afforded a  reasonable
opportunity  of representing his views on the  question	 and
the  reasons  of the order are reduced	however	 briefly  to
writing.   It is significant that when any  question  arises
under<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_180"> s. 64</a> as to the place of assessment and is  determined
by the Commissioner or Commissioners or by the Central Board
of  Revenue,  as the case may be, the assessee is  given  an
opportunity under<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_181"> s. 64(3)</a> of representing his views  before
any such question is determined.  If an opportunity is given
to the assessee in such case, it is all the more ,surprising
to  find that, when an order of transfer under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_182"> s.  5(7A)</a>  is
made transferring the case of the assessee from one  Income-
tax 'Officer to another irrespective of the area or locality
where  he resides or carries on business, he should  not  be
given such an opportunity.  There is no presumption  against
the  bona fides or the honesty of an assessee  and  normally
the  Income-tax	 authorities  would  not  be  justified	  in
refusing   to  an  assessee  a	reasonable  opportunity	  of
representing  his views when any order to the  prejudice  of
the  normal procedure laid down in<a href="/doc/1506611/" id="a_183"> s. 64</a> (1) and (2) of	 the
Act is sought to be made against him, be it a transfer	from
one  Income-tax Officer to another within the State or	from
an  Income-tax	Officer within the State  to  an  Income-tax
Officer	 without it, except of course where the very  object
of  the transfer would be frustrated if notice was given  to
the party affected.  If the reasons for making the order are
reduced	 however  briefly to writing it will also  help	 the
assessee  in  appreciating the circumstances which  make  it
necessary or desirable for the Commissioner of Income-tax or
the  Central  Board  of	 Revenue, as the  case	may  be,  to
transfer his case under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_184"> s. 5(7A)</a> of the Act and it will also
help the court in determining the bona fides of the order as
passed	if and when the same is challenged in court as	mala
fide or discriminatory.	 It is to be hoped that the  Income-
tax  authorities will observe the above	 procedure  wherever
feasible.
</p><p id="p_68">The next point of attack is that the orders which Were	made
by the Commissioner of Income-tax or the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">264</span>
Central	 Board	of  Revenue, as the case may  be,  in  these
petitions  are omnibus wholesale orders of  transfer  coming
within	the  mischief  of <a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_185">Bidi Supply Co. v.  The  Union  of
India</a>,	(supra),  and are, therefore, hit  by  the  majority
judgment in that case.	The answer of the State is that	 the
orders	are valid by virtue of the explanation to <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_186"> s.  5(7A)</a>
which was added by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_187">Indian Income-tax Amendment Act</a>, 1956
(26 of 1956).
</p><p id="p_69">It  will be remembered that the explanation was added to <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_188"> s.
5(7A)</a>  in order to get over the situation which was  created
by   the  majority  judgment  in  that	case  and  all	 the
proceedings against a particular assessee whether they	were
in respect of the same year or the previous years which were
pending	 before	 the Income--tax Officer were sought  to  be
comprised  in the order of transfer as also all	 proceedings
under  the  Act	 which may be commenced after  the  date  of
transfer  in respect of any year whether it be the  year  of
transfer  or any year previous or subsequent  thereto.	 The
main structure of<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_189"> s. 5(7A)</a> was, however, maintained and	 the
explanation  was  added	 thereto  in  order  to	 expand	 the
connotation of the word " case " which was used in<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_190"> s. 5(7A)</a>.
The manner in which this result was brought about is subject
to  criticism that the word ,case" was thus  really  equated
with  the  word	 " file " and when a case  of  a  particular
assessee  was transferred under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_191"> s. 5(7A)</a> it was	 meant	that
his  whole  file would be transferred  from  one  Income-tax
Officer	 to another.  This inartistic mode appears,  however
to  be adopted by the supposed necessity of  maintaining <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_192"> s.
5(7A)</a> in the form in which it stood but what we have got  to
see  is	 whether  the desired result has  been	achieved  by
adding	the explanation in the manner in which it was  done.
Reading	<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_193"> s. 5(7A)</a> and the explanation thereto, it  is  clear
that when any case of a particular asssssee which is pending
before	an  Income-tax	Officer	 is  transferred  from	that
officer	 to  another Income-tax Officer whether	 within	 the
State  or  without  it, all proceedings	 which	are  pending
against	 him under -the Act in respect of the same  year  as
also   previous	  years	  are  meant   to   be	 transferred
simultaneously and all proceedings under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">			    265</span>
Act  which may be commenced after the date of such  transfer
in respect of any year whatever are also included therei  in
so  that  the  Income-tax  Officer  to	whom  such  case  is
transferred  would be in a position to continue the  pending
proceedings  and also institute further proceedings  against
the  assessee  in  respect of  any  year.   The	 proceedings
pending	 -at the date of transfer can be thus continued	 but
in  the case of such proceedings the provision in regard  to
the issue of notices contained in the main body of<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_194"> s.  5(7A)</a>
would  apply  and it would not be necessary to	reissue	 any
notice	already issued by the Income-tax Officer  from	whom
the case is transferred.  This provision applies to  pending
proceedings  which have been transferred leaving  unaffected
the  further proceedings which may be commenced against	 the
assessee after the date of the transfer where fresh  notices
would have to be issued.
</p><p id="p_70">It  is,	 however, contended that the cases of  the  assessee
which have been already closed in the previous years  cannot
be  reopened by the Income-tax Officer to whom the  case  of
the  assessee is thus transferred and the words " after	 the
date  of transfer in respect of any year " occurring at	 the
end of the explanation are sought to be construed to mean  "
after  the  date of the transfer in respect of the  year  of
transfer  " thus rendering it incompetent to the  Income-tax
Officer to whom the case is transferred to institute further
proceedings  in respect of cases of the assessee which	have
been  already  closed  before the date	of  transfer.	This
contention is, in our opinion, unsound.	 The words used	 are
"  in respect of any year" and not " in respect of the	year
".  Moreover  they are to be read with the  preceding  words
"may  be commenced " and not with the words "after the	date
of  transfer".	A proper reading of the explanation will  be
that  the inclusive part thereof refers to  all	 proceedings
under the Act which may be commenced in respect of any	year
after  the date of the transfer.  The date of  the  transfer
has  relation only to the particular year in which the	case
of the assessee is thus transferred and to attach the  words
" in respect of any year " to the words " after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">34</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">266</span>
the date of transfer" do not make any sense.  The words " in
respect	 of  any year " appropriately go with  the  words  "
which  may commenced" and read in this juxtaposition  render
the  inclusive	part  of the explanation  susceptible  of  a
proper meaning.	 The language of the explanation read in the
manner	suggested  above is thus sufficient to	dispel	this
contention of the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_71">it follows, therefore, that the omnibus wholesale orders  of
transfer made against the petitioners by the Commissioner of
Income-tax or the Central Board of Revenue, as the case	 may
be,  are  saved by the explanation to<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_195"> s. 5(7A)</a> and  are	 not
unconstitutional and void:
</p><p id="p_72">It  remains  now to consider whether the  individual  orders
against	 the petitioners are discriminatory in fact  or	 are
mala  fide  and	 in  abuse  of	the  power  vested  in	 the
Commissioner of Income-tax or the Central Board of  Revenue,
as the case may be, under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_196"> s. 5(7A)</a> of the Act.
Petitions  Nos.	 211  to  215  of  1956,  i.e.,	 the  Shiram
Jhabarmull group, may be dealt with in the first instance as
they  have  a  peculiar characteristic of  their  own.	 The
orders	complained against in these petitions were all	made
by the Commissioner of Income-tax Central, Calcutta, on July
27,  1946, and further proceedings were entertained  against
the  petitioners by the Income-tax Officer,  Central  Circle
IV,   Calcutta,	  immeasurable	 thereafter.	All    these
proceedings culminated in assessment orders and	 certificate
proceedings
under<a href="/doc/1996719/" id="a_197"> s. 46(2)</a> of the Act were also taken by the authorities
against the petitioners for recovery of the tax so  assessed
before	the  advent  of	 the  Constitution.   The  question,
therefore,  arises whether these orders of transfer  can  be
challenged by the petitioners as unconstitutional and void.
It  is	settled	 that <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_198">Art. 13</a> of  the  Constitution  has  no
retrospective effect and if, therefore, any action was taken
before the commencement of the Constitution in pursuance  of
the provisions of any law which was a valid law at the	time
when such action was taken, such action cannot be challenged
and the law under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">			    267</span>
which  such  action  was  taken	 cannot	 be  questioned	  as
unconstitutional and void on the score of its infringing the
fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution
(<a href="/doc/656658/" id="a_199">See Keshavan Madhava Menon v. The State of Bombay</a>(1)).	 The
following observations of Das, J., as he then was, at p. 235
of  that  case,	 may be appropriately referred	to  in	this
context:
</p><p id="p_73">"As already explained, <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_200">article 13(1)</a> only has the effect  of
nullifying  or	rendering  all	inconsistent  existing	laws
ineffectual  or	 nugatory and devoid of any legal  force  or
binding	 effect	 only  with  respect  to  the  exercise	  of
fundamental rights on and after the date of the commencement
of the Constitution.  It has no retrospective effect and if,
therefore,  an act was done before the commencement  of	 the
Constitution  in contravention of any law which,  after	 the
Constitution,  becomes void with respect to the exercise  of
any  of the fundamental rights, the inconsistent law is	 not
wiped  out so far as the past act is concerned, for, to	 say
that   it  is,	will  be  to  give  the	 law   retrospective
effect.........	 So far as the past acts are  concerned	 the
law  exists,  notwithstanding that it does  not	 exist	with
respect to the future exercise of fundamental rights."	(See
also  <a href="/doc/1063853/" id="a_201">Syed  Qasim  Razvi v. The State  of  Hyderabad</a>(2)	 and
<a href="/doc/108021/" id="a_202">Laxmanappa  Hanumanthappa Jamkhandi v. Union  of  India</a>(1)).
It  is	clear,	therefore,  that  the  petitioners  are	 not
entitled  to  complain against the said orders	of  transfer
dated July 27, 1946.
</p><p id="p_74">Petitions Nos. 225 to 229 of 1956, i.e., the Raichur  group,
and  Petitions	Nos. 86, 87, 88, 111, 112 and 158  of  1956,
i.e.,  the Amritsar group, all belong to the same  category.
In  the	 first	group, there was an  order  of	transfer  on
December 21, 1953, passed by the Commissioner of Income-tax,
Hyderabad, transferring the cases of the petitioner from the
Additional  Income-tax Officer, Raichur, to the	 Income-tax,
Officer, Special Circle, Hyderabad.  There was, however,  an
order  passed  by the Commissioner shortly  before  May	 19,
1955,  transferring  the cases of the  petitioner  from	 the
Income-tax
(1)  [1951] S.C.R. 228, 235.
</p><p id="p_75">(2)  [1953] S.C.R. 589.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">268</span>
<p id="p_77">Officer,  Special Circle, Hyderabad, to the main  Income-tax
Officer,  Raichur.  The	 petitioner  thus  reverted  to	 the
Income-tax Officer, Raichur, and it passes one's imagination
what  possible	argument  he  can  urge	 on  the  score	  of
inconvenience  and  harassment.	 The whole attitude  of	 the
petitioner is motivated by an intention to delay the payment
of income-tax legitimately due by him to the Revenue  trying
to  take  advantage of a mere technicality.  In	 the  second
group,	there  were  orders passed by  the  Commissioner  of
Income-tax  transferring the cases of the  petitioners	from
the Income-tax Officer, "AWard, Amritsar, or the  Income-tax
Officer,'F'Ward,   Amritsar,  to  the  Income-tax   Officer,
Special Circle, Amritsar.  Both these officers were situated
in the same building and under the same roof.  The  argument
of   inconvenience   and   harassment	can,   under   these
circumstances, be hardly advanced by them.
There  is moreover another feature which is common  to	both
these  groups and it is that none of the petitioners  raised
any objection to their cases being transferred in the manner
stated	above and in fact submitted to the  jurisdiction  of
the  Income-tax	 Officers  to  whom  their  cases  had	been
transferred.  It was only after our decision in <a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_203">Bidi  Supply
Co. v. The Union of India</a>, (supra), was pronounced on  March
20, 1956, that these petitioners woke up and asserted  their
alleged	 rights, the Amritsar group on April 20,  1956,	 and
the  Raichur group on November 5, 1956.	 If they  acquiesced
in the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers to whom their
cases were transferred, they were certainly not entitled  to
invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_204">Art. 32.</a>  It  is
well  settled  that such conduct of  the  petitioners  would
disentitle  them  to any relief at the hands of	 this  Court

This  leaves  two sets of petitioners,	the  petitioners  in
Petitions  Nos.	 97 &amp; 97-A of 1956 and	the  petitioners  in
Petitions Nos. 44/56 and 85/56.
</p><p id="p_80">Petitions  Nos.	 97  &amp; 97-A of 1956  :-The  petitioners	 are
oilmill owners, merchants and commission agents, carrying on
business  at Sahibganj in the district of  Santhal  Parganas
and  have  a  branch at 97, Lower  Chitpur  Road,  Calcutta.
Their  cases were referred to the  Income-tax  Investigation
Commission  as they were believed to have evaded payment  of
tax  on	 a substantial amount.	They were alleged  -to	have
concealed  income  exceeding  Rs. 8 lakhs  and	indulged  in
business  activities  spread over a wide area  resulting  in
large  profits not disclosed in the books of account  or  in
the  various returns filed by them.  After the	judgment  of
this  Court  in <a href="/doc/1623923/" id="a_206">Surajmull Mohta &amp; Co. v.  A.  V.  Viswanatha

affected  and  had to be reopened under s. 34  (IA)  of	 the
Income-tax  Act.   To dispose of these	cases,	"since	they
involved  many	back  years' cases"  quickly  and  promptly,
special	 circles without reference to area were	 created  at
Bombay	and  Calcutta, because the existing  circles,  whose
hands  were full, could not take up this extra work.   These
320  cases  were distributed between these  circles  on	 the
basis  of  the geographical area to  which  these  assessees
belonged.   The	 petitioners belonged to Bihar	and  had  a-
branch at Calcutta and their cases were, therefore, allotted
to one of the Central Circles at Calcutta.

<p id="p_83">Income-tax  Investigation Commission on July 17,1954,  could
not  be	 preceded with under the provisions of that  Act.  -
These cases numbering about 470 had to be reopened under <a href="/doc/1379589/" id="a_212"> s.
34</a> (1<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_213">A) of the Income-tax Act</a>.	The Government thought	that
as  in	the  earlier lot of cases, it  would  help  speedier
disposal  of the cases, if they were allotted to  Income-tax
Officers  appointed without reference to area to  deal	with
the  same.   In addition to the circles already	 created  in
Bombay	and  Calcutta, five more circles at Calcutta  and  4
more  circles  at  Bombay and 9 more  circles  at  important
centers such as Kanpur, Ahmedabad, Madras and Delhi were set
up to deal with all these cases.  As a result of the  influx
of these cases, it was found that the 9 circles at  Calcutta
had  about  280	 cases of assessees  belonging	to  Calcutta
itself	to dispose of and therefore cases not  belonging  to
that  area  had to be taken out and assigned to one  of	 the
newly created circles, Where the work load was low.  It	 was
found  then  that Central Circle VI had a  lower  work	load
compared  to other circles and, therefore, the cases of	 the
petitioners  were  transferred to  the	Income-tax  Officer,
Central Circle VI, Delhi.
</p><p id="p_84">Having regard to these circumstances which are disclosed  in
the  affidavits of Shri V. Gouri Shankar,  Under  Secretary,
Central	 Board	of  Revenue, dated November  19,  1956,	 and
December 3, 1956, it is clear that the transfer of the cases
of  the petitioners, firstly, from the	Income-tax  Officer,
Special	 Circle, Patna, to the Income-tax  Officer,  Central
Circle	XI, Calcutta, and next, from the latter	 officer  to
the Income-tax Officer, Central Circle VI, Delhi, were	made
as a matter of administrative convenience only.
It  further  appear;  from  the	 said  affidavits  that	 the
examination  of	 accounts and the evidence was done  at	 the
places	desired	 by  the assessees in order  to	 suit  their
convenience  and  the Income-tax  Officers  were  instructed
accordingly.   As a matter of fact the	Income-tax  Officer,
Central Circle VI, Delhi, went to Sahibganj and examined the
accounts there in the case of the petitioner No. 1 and	when
the assessee voluntarily requested the Income-tax Officer to
have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">			    271</span>
the examination done at Delhi (the assessee had then come to
Delhi  for  some other work of his) the	 Income-tax  Officer
promptly posted the case and examined the accounts.
If these were the circumstances under which the cases of the
petitioners were transferred from Patna to Calcutta and from
Calcutta  to  Delhi and the petitioners	 were  afforded	 all
conveniences  in  the  matter of the  examination  of  their
accounts and evidence, there is no basis for the charge that
the  orders of transfer made against these petitioners	were
in any manner whatever discriminatory.
</p><p id="p_85">Petitions Nos. 44 and 85 of 1956
The  petitioner in Petition No. 44/56 is Shri A. L. Sud	 who
originally  belonged  to Hoshiarpur district in	 Punjab	 and
since  1948 resides and has his office in Calcutta.   He  is
the  son of one Shri Bhagwan Das Sud and is a member of	 the
Hindu  undivided family styled M/S.  Bhagwan Das Sud &amp;	Sons
with  Shri.   Bhagwan Das Sud as the  karta  thereof.	This
Hindu  undivided  family has been carrying  on	business  at
Hoshiarpur  and	 at  various  other  places  like  Bareilly,
Calcutta  and Bombay.  The petitioner has been	carrying  on
business  both as the member of the Hindu  undivided  family
and  also in his individual capacity since 1946.   The	said
joint  family of Bhagwan Das Sud &amp; Sons was alleged to	have
evaded	income-tax to a large extent and  had  inter-related
transactions  in respect of their dealings,  the  petitioner
being  a  copartner  of	 the said  joint  family.   It	was,
therefore,  considered necessary in order to have  a  proper
assessment  of	the petitioner's income that his  case	also
should be dealt with by the Income-tax Officer assessing the
joint  family and the petitioner was informed that,  in	 the
matter	of hearing, he would be put to least  inconvenience.
These  were  the  circumstances under  which  his  case	 was
transferred  from  the Income-tax  Officer,  Survey  Circle,
Calcutta, to the Income-tax Officer, Special Circle, Ambala,
by  an order of the Central Board of Revenue dated June	 29,
1955.
</p><p id="p_86">The  case  of M/S.  Bhagwan Das Sud &amp; Sons,  petitioners  in
Petition No. 85/56; had already been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">272</span>
transferred  by	 the  Commissioner of  Income-tax  from	 the
Income-tax  Officer, Hoshiarpur, to the Income-tax  Officer,
Special	 Circle, Ambala, by an order under<a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_214"> s. 5(7A)</a>  of	 the
Act  dated  October  20, 1953.	The  petitioners  had  their
office	at  Hoshiarpur in Punjab but their  activities	were
scattered  in various parts of India some of them  being  in
Assam,	Bombay, Bareilly, Calcutta and Kanpur in respect  of
the  contracts they undertook with the Government and  other
parties.   They	 were  alleged	to  have  concealed   income
assessable  to income-tax exceeding Rs. 30 lakhs and it	 was
thought	 necessary  to make proper  investigation  of  their
widespread  activities	resulting' in extensive	 evasion  of
income-tax.  These were the circumstances under which  their
case  was  transferred	to the	Incometax  Officer,  Special
Circle, Ambala, as above.  That officer, however, agreed  to
examine	 the accounts and evidence at Hoshiarpur  itself  to
suit the convenience of the petitioners but the	 petitioners
did not agree on the ground that their Advocate was to	come
from Delhi and therefore Ambala would suit them as well.
The   cases  of	 both  the  petitioners	 thus  came  to	  be
transferred from the respective Income-tax Officers who used
to  assess them at Calcutta and Hoshiarpur  respectively  to
the  Income-tax	 Officer, Special Circle,  Ambala,  and	 all
conveniences  were  afforded to them in the  matter  of	 the
examination of their accounts and evidence.  The argument of
discrimination	and inconvenience and harassment thus  loses
all  its force and the orders of transfer made against	them
cannot be challenged as in any way discriminatory.
It  may be noted that in the last mentioned four  petitions,
viz.,  Petitions Nos. 97 &amp; 97-A of 1956 and  Petitions	Nos.
44/56  and  85/56,  the	 Central Board	of  Revenue  or	 the
Commissioner  of Income-tax, as the case may be,  instructed
the   Income-tax   Officers  concerned	 to   minimise	 the
inconvenience  caused to the assessees and even	 proceed  to
their  respective residences or places of business in  order
to  examine  the  accounts and	evidence.   Inspite  of	 the
denials of the assessees in the affidavits which they  filed
in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">			    273</span>
rejoinder, we presume that such facilities will continue  to
be afforded to them in the future and the inconvenience	 and
harassment  which would otherwise be caused to them will  be
avoided.   A  humane and considerate administration  of	 the
relevant  provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_215">Income-tax Act</a> would go  a	long
way  in allaying the apprehensions of the assessees  and  if
that  is done in the true spirit, no assessee will be  in  a
position  to  charge  the  Revenue  with  administering	 the
provisions of the Act with " an evil eye and unequal hand ".
We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that there is  no
substance  in these petitions and they should  be  dismissed
with  costs.   There  will, be, however, one  set  of  costs
between respondents in each of the petitions and one set  of
costs in each group of these petitions, viz., (1)  Petitions
Nos. 97 &amp; 97-A of 1956, (2) Petitions Nos. 44/56 and  85/56,
(3)  Petitions Nos. 86/56, 87/56, 88/56, 111/56, 112/56	 and
158/56,	 (4)  Petitions	 Nos. 211 to 215 of  1956,  and	 (5)
Petitions Nos. 225 to 229 of 1956.
