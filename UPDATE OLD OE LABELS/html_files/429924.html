B.P. JEEVAN REDDY.J.
</p><p id="p_2">     <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_1">Section 10(2)(v)</a>  of the  Income Tax  Act, 1922  allows
deduction of  the  amount  spent  on  "current	repairs"  to
buildings,  machinery,	plant,	furniture  employed  in	 the
business. The  assessee-appellant carries on the business of
exhibiting films  in a	theatre called	"Naval	Talkies"  at
Panipat. He  had purchased the said building in 1937. It was
a ginning factory then. He ran the factory till 1940. In the
year 1945,  he converted  it into  a cinema  theatre and was
exhibiting films  therein. During  the period  1960 to March
1961, the  assessee  extensively  repaired  the	 theatre  by
expending substantial amounts. The amounts spent by him are:
on machinery Rs.16,002/-, new furniture Rs.27,889/- sanitary
fittings Rs.5,225/-  and replacement  of  electrical  wiring
Rs.13,604/-.  In   addition  thereto,	a  total  amount  of
Rs.62,977/- was	 spent on extensive repairs to walls, to the
hall, to  the flooring and roofing, to doors and windows and
to the	stage sides  etc. Actually  the theatre	 had  to  be
closed	during	 the  aforesaid	 period	 for  effecting	 the
repairs.
</p><p id="p_3">     In the  assessment proceedings relating to the relevant
assessment year,  the  assessee	 claimed  deduction  of	 the
aforesaid amount  of  Rs.62,977/-.  The	 Income	 Tax  Office
disallowed  the	 same.	According  to  him  it	was  capital
expenditure. On	 Appeal,  Appellate  Assistant	Commissioner
affirmed the  view taken  by  the  Income  tax	Officer.  On
further appeal,	 however, the Tribunal upheld the assessee's
case whereupon	the following  question was  referred to the
Bombay High  Court under  <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_2">Section 66(1)</a> of the Indian Income
Tax Act,  1922, at  the instance of the Revenue: "Whether on
the facts  and circumstances  of the  case, in computing the
Income of  the assessee	 for the  material  year  a  sum  of
Rs.62977/- or  any portion  thereof is deductible?" The High
Court answered	the question  in favour	 of the	 Revenue and
against the  assessee following	 the earlier decision of the
said  court  in	 <a href="/doc/734835/" id="a_3">New  Shorrock	Spinning  and  Manufacturing
Company Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income Tax</a> [30 I.T.R.338].
</p><p id="p_4">     The expression  used in  <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_4">Section 10(2)(v)</a>	is  "current
repairs" and  not mere "repairs". The same expression occurs
in <a href="/doc/1821273/" id="a_5">Section  30(a)(ii)</a> and in <a href="/doc/1985493/" id="a_6">Section 31(i)</a> of the Income Tax
Act, 1961.  The question  is what  is  the  meaning  of	 the
expression in  the context of <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_7">Section 10(2)</a>. In New Shorrock
Spinning  and	Manufacturing  Company	 Ltd.,	Chagla,C.J.,
speaking  for	the  Division	Bench,	observed   that	 the
expression "current repairs" means expenditure on buildings,
machinery, plant  or furniture	which is not for the purpose
of renewal  or restoration but which is only for the purpose
of preserving  or maintaining  an already existing asset and
which does  not bring a new asset into existence or does not
give to	 the assessee  a new  or  different  advantage.	 The
learned Chief Justice observed that they are such repairs as
are attended  to as  and  when	need  arises  and  that	 the
question when  a building,  machinery etc.  requires repairs
and when the need arises must be decided not by any academic
or  theoretical	  test	but   by  the	test  of  commercial
expediency. The Learned Chief Justice observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "The  simple   test  that	must  be
     constantly borne in mind is that as
     a result  of the  expenditure which
     is claimed	 as  an	 expenditure  or
     repairs what  is really  being done
     is	 to  preserve  and  maintain  an
     already existing  asset. The object
     of the  expenditure is not to bring
     a new  asset into existence, nor is
     its object	 the obtaining	of a new
     or fresh advantage. This can be the
     only   definition	  of   `repairs'
     because it	 is only  by  reason  of
     this definition of repairs that the
     expenditure    is	   a	 revenue
     expenditure.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     If the  amount spent  was	for  the
     purpose of	 bringing into existence
     a new  asset  or  obtaining  a  new
     advantage, then  obviously such  an
     expenditure   would   not	 be   an
     expenditure of a revenue nature but
     it would  be a capital expenditure,
     and it  is clear that the deduction
     which,    the    Legislature    has
     permitted under <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_8">Section 10(2)(v)</a> is
     a deduction  where the  expenditure
     is a  revenue expenditure and not a
     capital expenditure."</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">     In	 taking	 the  above  view,  the	 Bombay	 High  Court
dissented from the view taken by the Allahabad High Court in
<a href="/doc/1787790/" id="a_9">Ramkrishan Sunderlal  vs. Commissioner	of Income  Tax, U.P</a>.
[(1951) 19 I.T.R..324] where it was held that the expression
"current repairs"  in <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_10">Section  10(2)(v)</a>	 was  restricted  to
petty repairs  only which  are carried out periodically. The
Learned Judge  agreed with  the view taken by the Patna High
Court in  <a href="/doc/460127/" id="a_11">Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Darbhanga Sugar Co.
Ltd</a>. [(1956)  29 I.T.T.21]  and by  the Madras High Court in
<a href="/doc/1456442/" id="a_12">Commissioner of	 Income Tax  vs. Sri  Rama Sugar  Mills Ltd</a>.
[(1951) 21 I.T.R.191]
     <a href="/doc/1984497/" id="a_13">In	 Liberty  Cinema  vs.  Commissioner  of	 Income-Tax,
Calcutta</a> [52  I.T.R.153], P.B.	Mukharji, J., speaking for a
Division Bench	of the	Calcutta High  Court, held  that  an
expenditure incurred  with a  view to bring into existence a
new asset  or an advantage of enduring nature cannot qualify
for deduction under <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_14">Section 10(2)(v)</a>.
</p><p id="p_6">     In our  opinion the test involved by Chagla C.J. in New
shorrock Spinning  &amp; Manufacturing  Company Limited  is	 the
most appropriate  one having  regard to the context in which
the said  expression occurs.  It has also been followed by a
majority of the High Courts in India. We respectfully accept
and adopt the test.
</p><p id="p_7">     Applying he  aforesaid test, if we look at the facts of
this case, it will be evident that what the assessee did was
not mere  repairs but a total renovation of the theatre. New
machinery, new	furniture, new	sanitary  fittings  and	 new
electrical  wiring   were  installed   besides	 extensively
repairing the  structure of  the building.  By no stretch of
imagination, can it be said that the said repairs qualify as
"current repairs" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_15">Section 10(2)(v)</a>. It
was a  case of total renovation and has rightly been held by
the High  Court to be capital in nature. Indeed, the finding
of the	high Court is that as against the sum of Rs.17,000/-
for which  the assessee	 had purchased	the factory in 1937,
the expenditure incurred in the relevant accounting year was
in the region of Rs.1,20,000/-.
