  validity of common Judgment dated September 26,

  which the prayer made by them to direct the Medical

  acquired    medical    qualifications   granted    by    the

  Manipal College of Medical Science, Pokhara, Nepal

  which are recognized by Medical Council of India,

  without    insisting   that    they   should   qualify   the

  screening test, is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">3. In order to appreciate the controversy raised before

  this Court, it would be advantageous to notice certain

  facts, which are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">            Earlier the medical education in India was

governed by the provisions of <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_1">Indian Medical Council

Act</a>, 1933. Thereunder also the Medical Council of India

(`MCI' for short) was constituted on which certain
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                   3</span>
     powers were conferred and duties were imposed.

     However, with the passage of time, it was noticed that

     there was no representation to licentiate members of the

     medical profession nor there was provision:-


</p><p id="p_10">a)         to provide for registration of the names of citizens

      of   India    who      had   obtained        foreign   medical

      qualifications which were not recognized by the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_2">Indian

      Medical Council Act</a>, 1933;
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">b)         to provide for temporary recognition of medical

      qualifications   granted     by    medical    institutions   in

      countries    outside    India     with   which     scheme    of

      reciprocity exists;
</p>
<p id="p_13">

<p id="p_15">d)         to provide for the      maintenance of an All-India

      register by the MCI.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                         4</span><p id="p_16">
Thus it became necessary to bring a legislation to

provide   for   the   reconstitution   of   MCI   and   the

maintenance of a medical register for India and for

matters connected therewith. That is how, the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_3">Indian

Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 (`the Act' for short) came to

be enacted by Parliament repealing the Act of 1933.


</p><p id="p_17">4.   <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_4">Section 12</a> of the Act deals with recognition of

medical qualifications granted by medical institutions in

countries with which there is a scheme of reciprocity.

The MCI is empowered to enter into negotiations with

the authority in any country outside India which by law

of such country is entrusted with the maintenance of a

register of medical practitioners, for settling a scheme of

reciprocity for the recognition of medical qualifications.

Once such a scheme is settled, the Central Government

is authorized to amend the second schedule so as to

include therein the medical qualification which the

council has decided should be recognised. The medical

qualifications granted by medical institutions outside

India which are included in the second schedule are

recognized medical qualifications.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                            5</span><p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">5.   The Nepal authority had forwarded a scheme for

grant of recognition of MBBS qualifications conferred by

Kathmandu     University,   in   respect   of   students    of

Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal.

The MCI entered into negotiation with the Nepal

Authority for settling a scheme of reciprocity for

recognition of medical qualifications.          One of the

conditions of recognition was that the college would not

admit more than 100 students annually.              On the

request of Ministry of health, Government of India, the

MCI inspected the said college in the year 2000.           The

college was assessed and evaluated in the light of

minimum standards prescribed by the MCI relating to

infrastructure, teaching facilities, etc. After inspection,

a report was submitted to Government of India. On the

basis of the said report, scheme of reciprocity was

settled after which the Government of India, Ministry of

Health and Family Welfare (Department of health)

issued notification dated September 26, 2001, amending

Second Schedule to the Act by inserting an entry to the

effect that the qualification of MBBS granted by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                       6</span>
Kathmandu University shall be recognized as medical

qualification when granted in or after July, 1999, in

respect of students of Manipal College of Medical

Sciences, Pokhara.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">6.   Over a period of time, it was noticed that a large

number of private agencies sponsored Indian students

for medical studies in institutions outside India for

commercial    considerations.     Such   students   also

included the students who failed to fulfill the minimum

eligibility requirements for admission to medical courses

in India.    Serious aberrations were noticed in the

standards of medical education available in some of the

foreign countries which were not at par with the

standards of medical education available in India. Due

to lack of uniformity in the standards of medical

education in various foreign countries, it was decided to

make a provision in the Act to enable the MCI to

conduct a screening test in order to satisfy itself with

regard to the adequacy of knowledge and skills acquired

by citizens of India who obtain medical qualifications
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                            7</span>
from universities or medical institutions outside India

before they are granted registration to practice medicine

in India.   Accordingly the Act was amended by the

<a href="/doc/1109820/" id="a_5">Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Act</a>, 2001 and new

<a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_6">Section 13(4A)</a> was inserted, which requires that a

person who is citizen of India and obtains medical

qualification granted by any medical institution in any

country outside India recognized for enrolment as

medical practitioner in that country after such date as

may be specified by the Central Government under sub-

Section (3) shall not be entitled to enrolled on any

medical register maintained by a State Medical Council

or to have his name entered in the Indian Medical

Register, unless he qualifies the screening test in India

prescribed for such purpose and such foreign medical

qualification   after   such   person   qualifies   the   said

screening test shall be deemed to be the recognized

medical qualification for the purpose of this Act for that

person.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">7.   The Ministry of Health, Government of India, by

letter dated January 11-16, 2007, asked the MCI to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                          8</span>
conduct an inspection of Universal College of Medical

Sciences, Bhairahwa, Nepal and other institutions in

Nepal recognised for granting MBBS degree under the

Act to re-assess the facilities available there as doctors

coming out of those colleges were eligible to practice

medicine in India.     Accordingly the inspection team of

MCI went to Pokhara to inspect the college on January

19-20, 2007 to re-assess the infrastructural, teaching

and other facilities available at the said college for grant

of qualifications recognized and included in the Second

Schedule to the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">           The Dean of the college did not permit the

inspection of the college despite repeated requests.

However, he permitted the members of the Inspection

Team to visit the college and the hospital on January

19, 2007, asserting that the colleges recognized by the

MCI and included in the Second Schedule to the Act

were not subject to re-assessment by the MCI. Though

the inspection team was not permitted to re-inspect the

college, the said team visited the college on January 19,

2007 and prepared a report indicating the deficiencies
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                         9</span>
noticed during the visit.     The report prepared was

considered by the Executive Committee of the MCI in its

meeting held on February 5, 2007, wherein the

members of the ad-hoc committee appointed by the

Supreme Court were also present. Having regard to the

deficiencies pointed out in the report, it was resolved by

the Executive Committee, to carry out an inspection to

re-assess the under graduate teaching and training

facilities available at the said college. Accordingly a fax

message dated February 19, 2007 was dispatched to the

Principal of the college that an inspection would be

carried out by the Council Inspectors on 21st and 22nd

February, 2007. The Principal was also instructed to fill

a set of standard inspection forms A and B and

declaration contained in Forms C and D and handover

the same to the Council Inspectors. The acting Dean of

the college faxed a letter dated February 19, 2007 to the

Secretary, MCI protesting attempt by the MCI to re-

inspect the college and stated that the Dean was abroad

on a study visit and, therefore, the visit by the team

should be deferred till his return.    In continuation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                       10</span>
faxed letter dated February 19, 2007, the acting

Principal of the College addressed another letter dated

February 21, 2007 mentioning that the inspection was

not feasible in view of the earlier stand that the College

was not subject to re-assessment.        Thereupon, the

Executive Committee of the MCI wrote a letter dated

February 23, 2007 to the Secretary to the Government

of India, Ministry of Health and forwarded the report

dated January 19, 2007, wherein certain deficiencies

noticed were mentioned.        By the said letter the

Executive Committee informed the Government of India

that a decision was taken to re-inspect the College and

not to grant provisional/final registration under <a href="/doc/35484042/" id="a_7">Section

12(2)</a> of the Act, till the matter was finally decided.

However, the record shows that in spite of protest

lodged by the acting Principal of the said College, the

Inspectors of Council went to Pokhara and carried out

inspection on February 21 &amp; 22, 2007. The Inspectors

submitted their inspection report which was considered

by the Executive Committee of the MCI in its meeting

held on March 3, 2007.        The Committee took into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                       11</span>
consideration the stand of the College that it was not

subject to another inspection as well as reports

indicating several deficiencies which were noticed by the

Inspecting Team of MCI during the visit of the College.

The Executive Committee of the MCI took a decision to

recommend to the general body of the MCI to withdraw

the recognition granted to Manipal College of Medical

Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal, for the award of MBBS degree

granted by Kathmandu University under <a href="/doc/184675658/" id="a_8">Section 12(3)</a>

of the Act and not to grant provisional/final registration

under <a href="/doc/35484042/" id="a_9">Section 12(2)</a> of the Act, to any student passing

from the said Institute who has not passed the

screening test. The meeting of the General Body of MCI

was convened on March 10, 2007, to consider the

recommendation made by the Executive Committee.

The General Body approved the recommendation made

by the Executive Committee. The decision taken by the

General Body of MCI        was communicated       to the

Government of India vide letter dated May 29, 2007.

The case of Manipal College of Medical Sciences,

Pokhara, is that the recognition granted to the College
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                               12</span>
under <a href="/doc/35484042/" id="a_10">Section 12(2)</a> of the Act is on reciprocal basis

between the concerned authorities in India and Nepal

and,    therefore,    it   is   its   understanding     that   the

College/University is not subject to re-assessment and

in any event without informing or obtaining approval of

Nepal Government/Nepal Medical Council/Kathmandu

University, such re-assessment of College by MCI is not

proper.

Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara and had

obtained     MBBS          qualification    from    Kathmandu

University     were        issued     provisional     registration

certificates by MCI and had started their internship

from the Medical Colleges recognized by the MCI.

However, on completion of internship, they were denied

permanent registration on the ground that they had not

cleared the prescribed screening test.


</p><p id="p_28">9. In Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition

     (C) No. 28228 of 2008 the appellants were students,

     who had graduated from the Manipal College of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                     13</span>
Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal.      They applied to

the Medical Council of India to grant provisional

registration to enable them to start internship.

Sometime in April, 2007 some of the appellants, who

were already granted temporary registration by the

Medical Council of India, approached the Medical

Council of India for permanent registration.        The

appellants from both the categories were denied

registration by the Medical Council of India.       The

denial was communicated through a letter in which

the students were informed that Council Inspectors,

who had visited the Manipal College of Medical

Sciences on 19th and 20th January, 2007, had found

certain infrastructural deficiencies in the College and,

therefore, it was decided to deny registration on the

ground that the recommendation was made to the

Central Government that Manipal College of Medical

Sciences be derecognized.     Therefore, the students

invoked extra ordinary jurisdiction of Delhi High

Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_11">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India

by filing Writ Petition (C) No. 8056 of 2007 and

  prayed to direct the Medical Council of India to grant

  registration of the MBBS degrees awarded to them

  without   insistence       to     clear     the    screening    test

  prescribed.    The Division Bench of the High Court

  heard the said petition along with batch of other

  petitions and dismissed the same by judgment dated

  September 26, 2008 giving rise to the Special Leave

  Petition (C) No. 28228 of 2008.

</p><p id="p_30">10. In appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) No.

  28487 of 2008 the appellants were the students of

  Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal.

  Some of the students had applied for provisional

  registration   as   well        as   permanent        registration.

  However, the registration claimed by the students

  was denied to them.         Therefore, they had filed writ

  petitions before the Delhi High Court praying the

  Court to direct the Medical Council of India to grant

  provisional     registration              and/or       permanent

  registration   without          insisting    for    clearance     of

  screening test. In those petitions interim orders were

  passed and Medical Council of India was directed to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                     15</span>
  grant provisional registration to those petitioners.

  The interim orders passed by the learned single

  Judge of Delhi High Court were challenged in Letters

  Patent Appeal No. 327 of 2008 on the ground that the

  interim orders passed virtually granted the main

  relief claimed in the petitions.    The Letters Patent

  Appeal was disposed of by order dated July 7, 2008

  by giving direction to dispose of the writ petitions

  expeditiously. The Division Bench of the High Court

  dismissed the petitions by judgment dated September

  26, 2008 by directing that the students should

  undergo a screening test as prescribed by law. The

  appellants herein were not parties to the writ

  petitions, but they were aggrieved by judgment dated

  September 26, 2008 and, therefore, they filed the

  Special Leave Petition No. 28487 of 2008 seeking

  permission to file the special leave petition.


</p><p id="p_31">11. In Writ Petition (C) No. 154 of 2009 the petitioners

  were students of Institute of Medicine Tribhuvan

  University. They completed the MBBS degree course

  successfully.   Therefore, the Tribhuvan University

had    given   some       of     the     petitioners     provisional

certificates dated April 15, 2008.                      The Medical

Council of India released a press note dated October

8, 2008 withdrawing the recognition granted to

Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara and

Universal College of Medical Sciences, Bhaiarahwa,

Nepal, as there were certain complaints against both

the institutions.    While dealing with the complaints

against the aforesaid two institutions the Medical

Council of India also mentioned in the last paragraph

of the press note that earlier a press note on the

website   of   MCI    stating          that   the   provisions     of

Eligibility Certificate Regulations, 2002 and the

Screening Test Regulations, 2002 would not be

applicable     to   the        foreign     medical       institutions

recognised under <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_12">Section 12</a> of the Indian Medical

Council Act, 1956, was withdrawn with immediate

effect. The effect of withdrawal of earlier press note is

that    the    provisions         of      Eligibility     Certificate

Regulations 2002 and the Screening Test Regulation

2002 would be applicable to the students of foreign
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                           17</span>
medical institutions recognised under <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_13">Section 12</a> of

the Act and all students, who have obtained medical

qualifications from foreign medical institutions, will

have to qualify the screening test. Thus the grievance

of the petitioners was that they have been informed

that the MBBS degrees would not be recognized

without screening test nor permanent registration

certificates would be given to such students, who

have     already          taken     provisional   registration

certificates.        Therefore, the petitioners have invoked

jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_14">Article 32</a> of the

Constitution by filing above numbered writ petition

and prayed to quash the last paragraph of press note

dated October 8, 2008, which, according to them,

affects them/students, who have been trained at the

Institute       of      Medicine,    Tribhuvan    University,

Kathmandu, Nepal.            It may be mentioned that the

writ petition was placed for admission hearing on

April 20, 2009 and after hearing the learned counsel

for the petitioners notice was ordered to be issued to

the respondents and the petition was directed to be

  also considered the documents brought on record of

  the appeals and the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">13. What is argued by the learned counsel for the

  appellants is that the Second Schedule and Part II of

  the Third Schedule exhaust the medical qualifications

  granted by medical institutions outside India, which

  are recognized as medical qualifications for the

  purpose of the Act, whereas sub-Sections (4A), (4B)

  and (4C) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_15">Section 13</a> deal with the residual subject

  of individual recognition of medical qualifications

  obtained by Indian citizens from the institutions

  outside India, which are not specified in any of the

  three Schedules and, therefore, the appellants cannot

  be subjected to a screening test postulated by sub-

  Section (4A) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_16">Section 13</a> of the Act as the appellants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                       19</span>
possess the medical qualification mentioned in the

Second Schedule. According to the learned counsel,

the provisions of sub-Section (4A) requiring a person

who obtains medical qualification granted by any

medical institution in any country outside India, to

qualify the screening test and the provisions of sub-

Section (4B) requiring a citizen of India to obtain an

eligibility certificate to be eligible to get admission in

any medical institution in any foreign country and

debarring him from appearing in the screening test if

he   obtains   such    medical    qualification   without

obtaining eligibility certificate, are residual provisions

as well as exceptions to <a href="/doc/53918462/" id="a_17">Section 14</a> of the Act

providing a special provision in certain cases for

recognition of medical qualifications granted by

medical institutions in countries with which there is

no   scheme    of   reciprocity   and,   therefore,   the

appellants would not be liable to qualify the screening

test when they have obtained medical qualifications

included in the Second Schedule of the Act, which are

medical qualifications for the purposes of the Act. It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                        20</span>
was asserted that <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_18">Sections 13(4A)</a> and (4B) cannot be

read together with <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_19">Section 12</a> of the Act because

<a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_20">Section 12</a> is a self contained code whereas Part II of

the Third Schedule includes those institutions which

are not subject to reciprocity scheme on which

Second Schedule is based and, therefore, the MCI

cannot insist that the appellants must qualify

screening test mentioned in <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_21">Section 13(4A)</a> of the Act.

What was asserted was that the intention of the

Parliament in providing screening test under <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_22">Section

13(4A)</a> and requiring to obtain eligibility certificate for

admission and, thereafter passing screening test

contemplated under <a href="/doc/32722112/" id="a_23">Section 13(4B)</a> is that they

should    be   regarded    as   additional   requirements

restricted to the institutions mentioned in Part II of

the Third Schedule and, therefore, the impugned

judgment should be reversed.             According to the

learned counsel for the appellants, the words in

<a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_24">Section   13(4A)</a>,   to    the   effect   "obtains   medical

qualification granted by any medical institution in

any country outside India" cannot be given an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                  21</span>
expanded meaning because <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_25">Section 13</a> itself excludes

Scheduled One and Schedule Two and as <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_26">Section 13</a>

is ambiguous, the language of the heading should be

referred to for adopting interpretation that <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_27">Section

13(4A)</a> would not apply to those Indian citizens who

have obtained medical qualifications included in

Second Schedule.     The learned counsel for the

appellants emphasized that if the provisions of the

Screening Test Regulations 2002 are made applicable

to the Indian citizens who have obtained medical

qualifications included in the Second Schedule to the

Act, a serious anomaly would arise in as much as all

those students who are similarly placed as the

appellants but who are not Indian citizens would be

entitled to be enrolled on any Medical Register

maintained by a State Medical Council or to have

their names entered in the Indian Medical Register

without undergoing the screening test whereas the

appellants and other students who are Indian citizens

would not be entitled to such a privilege without

qualifying   screening   test   which    would    be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                     22</span>
discriminatory and as such classification cannot be

sustained in view of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_28">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

The stand of the MCI that the appellants and other

similarly placed students, who have obtained medical

qualifications included in the Second Schedule, must

qualify the screening test, should not be upheld by

the Court. According to the learned counsel for the

appellants the MCI itself had held out and clarified

for the information of the general public that the

eligibility requirements for taking admission in an

undergraduate medical course in Foreign Medical

Institution,   the   Regulations   of   2002   and   the

Screening Test Regulations, 2002, would not apply to

the students who join an undergraduate medical

course in foreign countries recognized and included

in the Second Schedule under <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_29">Section 12</a> of the Act

and, therefore, also it should be held that the MCI is

not justified in asking the appellants to qualify the

screening test. In the alternative, it was argued that

the provisions of sub-<a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_30">Sections 13</a> (4A) and (4B) are

prospective in nature and, therefore, the appellants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                          23</span>
  cannot be asked to clear the screening test before

  getting their names enrolled on the Medical Register

  maintained by a State Medical Council or to have

  their names entered in the Indian Medical Register.

  It was contended that the screening test stipulation is

  not being applied to the students who obtain medical

  qualifications    granted     by    medical    institutions

  mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Act and,

  therefore, reliefs prayed for should be granted by the

  Court. It may be mentioned that the Union of India

  has supported the claim of the appellants.


</p><p id="p_36">14. The learned counsel for the MCI contended that even

  de hors the provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_31">Amendment Act</a> of 2001, the

  Council   is     empowered    and    obliged   under   the

  statutory scheme of the Act in going behind the

  degree for scrutinizing and evaluating the foreign

  medical qualification secured by a candidate seeking

  registration from the Council under the Act and,

  therefore, the appellants are not entitled to seek

  direction from this Court that the MCI should grant

  provisional/      permanent    registration    to    them.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                     24</span>
According to the learned counsel, screening test is

required to be undergone in several countries like

U.K., U.S.A., etc. where doctors from abroad with a

foreign degree intend to start medical practice and,

therefore, adoption of a similar system in India

cannot be regarded as unreasonable. It was pointed

out that closer and careful reading of the provisions

of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_32">Amending Act</a> of 2001 read with the Eligibility

Requirement     Regulations    and    Screening    Test

Regulations of 2002 makes it sufficiently clear that

the Council is under a statutory obligation to

prescribe the screening test for all those candidates

who obtained/obtain medical qualifications from

institutions outside India falling within the purview of

<a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_33">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_34">13</a> of the Act and, therefore, the

appellants are rightly non-suited by Delhi High

Court.   Placing reliance on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1550454/" id="a_35">Ms.

Anuradha Saini vs. Union of India</a> decided on 11-

07-2002 by the Delhi High Court and Sanjeev Gupta

Vs. Union of India (2005) 1 SCC 45 it was pleaded

that it is permissible to the MCI to adopt any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                            25</span>
reasonable methodology for scrutiny and evaluation

of   the   teaching    and     training    imparted    to   the

candidates holding qualifications mentioned in the

Second Schedule to the Act and since the procedure

and methodology of the conduct of screening test is

approved by this Court, the MCI is justified in asking

the appellants and other similarly placed candidates

to qualify the screening test.             According to the

learned counsel for the MCI, all colleges seeking

recognition or continuation of recognition under

<a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_36">Section 12</a> of the Act have to fulfill the minimum

requirements laid down by the MCI for medical

institution in India because under the provisions of

<a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_37">Section 12</a> the citizens of foreign countries are also

entitled to practice medicine in India and therefore

the provisions of <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_38">Section 10</a> B(3) laying down that if

any medical college increases its admission capacity

without    obtaining     the    prior     permission   of   the

Government     of     India,   the      medical   qualification

obtained from such college becomes unrecognized,

have been enacted. What is stressed is that the true
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                           26</span>
intent and scope of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_39">Section 13(4A)</a> is quite clear and

as   the    said     sub-section    covers      all   medical

qualifications mentioned in <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_40">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_41">13</a> of the

Act, the plea that <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_42">Section 13(4A)</a> should be treated as

a proviso should not be accepted. It was argued that

by a resolution, the General Body of MCI has

corrected   its    understanding     of   the     matter   by

declaring that the screening test would be necessary

for candidates holding medical qualifications falling

within the purview of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_43">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_44">13</a> of the Act

and the registration of the candidates for research,

training, charity etc. mentioned in <a href="/doc/53918462/" id="a_45">Section 14</a> of the

Act is not subject to qualifying the screening test by

virtue of <a href="/doc/101082716/" id="a_46">Section 13(4C)</a> but not because <a href="/doc/53918462/" id="a_47">Section 14</a> is

an exception to <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_48">Sections 13(4A)</a> and <a href="/doc/32722112/" id="a_49">13(4B)</a>, as has

been contended by the appellants. It was pointed out

that the so called clarification made by MCI was with

reference to the provisions of <a href="/doc/32722112/" id="a_50">Section 13(4B)</a> and even

otherwise, the MCI on a reconsideration of the

proposition of law can comprehend a different

construction       and   as   the   construction      and/or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                      27</span>
interpretation of statutory provisions cannot rest

entirely on the stand adopted by any party in the lis,

the attempt to bind down the MCI to the clarification

made is of little assistance to the appellants.

Answering the contention raised on behalf of the

appellants that the screening test is not being applied

to all the foreign medical institutions mentioned in

<a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_51">Section 12</a> of the Act, it was pointed out that the

General Body of the Council in its Meeting held on

March 1, 2009 resolved that each of the Indian

citizens who secures a medical qualification from a

foreign medical institution falling within the purview

of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_52">Section 12</a> or <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_53">Section 13</a>, shall be obliged to qualify

the screening test and therefore it is not correct to

say that only students of Manipal College of Medical

Sciences, Pokhara are subjected to the screening test.

It was pleaded that specification of the cut off date of

March    15,   2002   by   the   Ministry   of   Health,

Government of India for the applicability of the

regulations relating to the screening test, does not

affect any vested right of the appellants as it is always
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                             28</span>
open   to    the    authority    to     create   and    impose

stipulations which are applicable from a particular

cut off date and as such there is no question of

vested rights being taken away with retrospective

operation.     What was emphasized was that over a

period of time it had come to the notice of the

legislature that a large number of private agencies

had sponsored students for medical studies in the

institutions       outside      India      for    commercial

consideration      who   had     even     not    fulfilled   the

minimum eligibility requirements and therefore the

Act was amended pursuant to which regulations have

been framed and the appellants who have acquired

M.B.B.S. qualification from Kathmandu University

mentioned in second schedule to the Act are asked to

qualify the prescribed screening test in larger interest

of public but are not debarred from starting any

medical practice in India in accordance with law and,

therefore, the appeals and the petitions filed under

<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_54">Article 32</a> should be dismissed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                        29</span><p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">15. As far as the issue of inspection of Manipal College of

  Medical Sciences, Pokhara by team of the MCI is

  concerned, this Court finds that by a communication

  dated January 11, 2007 the Central Government had

  requested the MCI to inspect Universal College of

  Medical Sciences, Bhairahwa, Nepal to reassess the

  facilities etc. made available to the students as the

  said college was last inspected by the MCI in April,

  2000. It was also mentioned in the said letter that

  medical institutions in Nepal, recognized for granting

  MBBS degree under the Act also be inspected by MCI

  to assess the present quality of medical education

  being imparted there, as the doctors coming out of

  these colleges are eligible to practice medicine in

  India.   By the said letter, the MCI was asked to

  intimate Government of India, Ministry of Health and

  Family Welfare about the action taken by it.         The

  Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara is

  situated in Nepal. The medical qualification of MBBS

  granted by Kathmandu University in respect of the

  students of the said college is recognized under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                           30</span>
Act. Therefore, there is no manner of doubt that the

MCI was authorized by the Central Government to

inspect the said college to assess the facilities offered

by the said college. The MCI has asserted that the

said college was inspected by its inspectors on

January 19-20, 2007 and it was found that the

college is/was admitting 150 students annually

though its intake capacity recognized by Government

of India as well as by the MCI is only 100 students

per year.   According to the MCI it had addressed a

communication dated February 23, 2007 to the

Government of India and recommended re-inspection

of the college to ascertain whether deficiencies found

were   removed      by    the     College.     It   had   also

recommended Central Government not to grant

provisional/permanent         registration    under   <a href="/doc/35484042/" id="a_55">Section

12(2)</a> of the Act.    The record does not indicate that

the    Government        of     India   had    opposed    the

recommendation made by the MCI and probably

could not have opposed the recommendation of MCI

to re-inspect the college in view of its letter dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                                 31</span>
January 11, 2007. The case of MCI is that the re-

inspection of the college was attempted to be carried

out on February 22, 2007 but the acting Principal of

the college had not allowed the inspection to be

carried out and appropriate report was submitted.</p><pre id="pre_2">

According    to   the    MCI,    its    General        Body     vide

communication          dated     May        29,    2007         had

recommended       to     the    Government        of    India     to

</pre><p id="p_39">withdraw the recognition granted to the college. The

appellants have asserted that since the college is

recognized   under       <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_56">Section       12</a>   of    the    Act     no

reassessment can be done by the MCI without the

consent of the Nepal Government and the Nepal

Medical Council.        It may be mentioned that in the

present proceedings, the question to be decided is

whether the MCI is justified in asking the appellants

and others who have obtained MBBS qualification

from Kathmandu University to qualify the screening

test prescribed by the Regulations. Though the MCI

has   recommended         the    Central      Government          to

withdraw the recognition granted to the college, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                   32</span>
Central Government has not initiated any action

against the college.   The Central Government has

made it clear in its affidavit that Manipal College of

Medical Sciences continues to be recognized under

the Act.   The determination of question posed for

consideration of the Court as to whether those

candidates who have obtained MBBS qualification

from Kathmandu University can be subjected to the

screening test or not does not depend upon the fact

as to whether the said college was properly inspected

by the MCI nor the said question can be decided with

reference to the effect of recommendation made by

the General Body of MCI to the Central Government

to de-recognise the college but solely depends on the

interpretation of different provisions of the Act.

Therefore, this Court refrains from expressing any

view on the question whether the college was properly

inspected by the MCI or what is the effect of the

recommendation made by the MCI to the Central

Government to de-recognise the college.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                       33</span>

  constituted under the Act.     Medical institution is

  defined to mean any institution, within or without

included in the First Schedule shall be recognized

medical qualifications for the purposes of the Act.

Sub-Section (2) empowers the Central Government to

amend the First Schedule, when an application is

made either by the University or medical institution

in India so as to include the medical qualification not

included in the First Schedule but is granted either

by the University or the medical institution. Thus the

First Schedule is not exhaustive and can be amended

by the Central Government subject to the conditions

mentioned in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/187216512/" id="a_71">Section 11</a> of the Act.

Even if the amendment is made in the First Schedule,

the Act regarding recognition of medical qualifications

granted by several medical institutions which are not

by medical institutions in the territories now forming

part of Pakistan and before April 1, 1937, by medical

institutions in the territories now forming part of

Burma.     Therefore, the Legislature has enacted

<a href="/doc/132184213/" id="a_74">Section 13(1)</a> and provided in the said sub-Section

that the medical qualifications granted by medical

institutions in India which are not included in the

First Schedule and which are included in Part I of the

Third Schedule shall also be recognized qualifications

for the purposes of the Act.      Sub-Section (2) of

<a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_75">Section 13</a> lays down that the medical qualifications

granted to a citizen of India (a) before August 15,

1947 by the medical institutions in the territories

now forming part of Pakistan and (b) before April 1,

1937 by medical institutions in the territories now

  institutions in India is such that <a href="/doc/187216512/" id="a_76">Section 11</a> of the Act

  cannot be read in isolation, because the said Section

  does    not   offer   a   complete    scheme    relating    to

  recognition of medical qualifications granted in India.

  In order to make the scheme complete, one has got to

  read the provisions of <a href="/doc/187216512/" id="a_77">Section 11</a> with the provisions

  of sub-Sections (1), (2) and (5) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_78">Section 13</a> of the

  Act. <a href="/doc/187216512/" id="a_79">Section 11</a>, First Schedule, sub-Sections (1), (2)

  and (5) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_80">Section 13</a> and Part I of the Third Schedule

  constitute a complete code relating to the scheme of

  recognition of medical qualifications granted by

  Universities or medical institutions in India.


</p><p id="p_49">21.   Similarly, recognition of medical qualifications

granted by medical institutions in countries with which

there is a scheme of reciprocity is dealt with by <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_81">Section

12</a> of the Act. Sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_82">Section 12</a> of the Act

provides that the medical qualifications granted by

medical   institutions      outside   India   which   are    not

included in the Second Schedule will be recognized

medical qualifications for the purposes of the Act. Sub-

Section (2) of the said Section inter alia lays down that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                            40</span>
the Council may enter into negotiation with the

Competent Authority in any country outside India to

settle a scheme of reciprocity and on the basis of such a

scheme, the Central Government may amend the

Second Schedule so as to include therein the medical

qualifications which the Council has decided, should be

recognized and it may also direct that an entry shall be

made in the last column of the Second Schedule against

such medical qualification, declaring that it shall be a

recognized medical qualification only when granted after

a specified date.        Sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_83">Section 12</a> deals

with the powers of the Central Government to amend

the Second Schedule and give direction that an entry be

made therein in respect of any medical qualification

declaring   that    it    shall   be   a   recognized   medical

qualification only when granted before a specified date.

Sub-Section (4) deals with a situation where the Council

has refused to recommend any medical qualification

which has been proposed for recognition by any

Authority referred to in sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_84">Section 12</a> of

the Act and provides that in such a situation the

Authority would be entitled to apply to the Central

Government and the Central Government may, after

considering   the     application    of   the    Authority    and

obtaining a report, if any, from the Council as to the

reasons for any such refusal, by notification, amend the

Second Schedule so as to include such qualification

therein and the provisions of sub-Section (2), shall apply

to such notification. As noticed earlier, <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_85">Section 13</a> also

makes      provisions     for    recognition         of    medical

qualifications granted by certain medical institutions

outside India whose qualifications are not included in

the Second Schedule.          While examining the scope of

<a href="/doc/187216512/" id="a_86">Section 11</a> of the Act, the Court has already taken into

account the sweep and ambit of sub-Sections (1) and (2)

of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_87">Section 13</a> of the Act. Therefore, it would be relevant

to examine the scope of sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_88">Section 13</a> of

the Act.    The said sub-Section lays down that the

medical qualifications granted by medical institutions

outside    India    (before   such   date       as   the   Central

Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette

specify) which are included in Part II of the Third
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                      42</span>
Schedule shall also be recognized medical qualifications

for the purposes of the Act.    However, the said sub-

Section itself carves out an exception that no person

possessing any such qualification shall be entitled to

enrolment on any State Medical Register unless he is a

citizen of India and has undergone such practical

training after obtaining that qualification as may be

required by the rules or regulations in force in the

country granting the qualification or if he has not

undergone any practical training in that country, he has

undergone such practical training as may be prescribed.

It is an admitted position that the date specified by the

Central Government under <a href="/doc/56490913/" id="a_89">Section 13(3)</a> in the Official

Gazette is March 15, 2002. It means that the medical

qualifications granted by medical institutions outside

India before March 15, 2002, which are included in Part

II of the Third Schedule, shall be recognized medical

qualifications but no person possessing any such

qualification shall be entitled to enrolment on any State

Medical Register if he is not a citizen of India and has

not undergone practical training after obtaining that

qualification as may be required by the rules or

regulations in force in that country or if has not

undergone practical training prescribed under the Act or

rules or regulations.   Sub-Section (4) inter alia states

that the Central Government may amend Part II of the

Third Schedule so as to include therein any qualification

granted by a medical institution outside India which is

not included in the Second Schedule subject to the

limitations and exceptions made in the two provisos to

the said sub-section. The first proviso which is brought

into force with effect from September 3, 2001, stipulates

that after September 3, 2001 no such amendment shall

be made in Part II of the Third Schedule to include any

primary medical qualification granted by any medical

institution outside India.   The second proviso further

lays down that nothing contained in the first proviso

shall apply to inclusion in Part II of the Third Schedule

any "primary medical qualification" which expression is

explained to be any minimum qualification sufficient for

enrolment on any State Medical Register or for entering

the name in the Indian Medical Register, granted by any

medical institution outside India, to any person whose

name is entered in the Indian medical Register.


</p><p id="p_50">22. A fair reading of the provisions of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_90">Section 12</a> with

   those of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_91">Section 13</a>, makes it evident that the

   scheme of recognition of medical qualifications

   granted by medical institutions outside India as

   envisaged by <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_92">Section 12</a> is not complete. In order to

   make      the     scheme     complete,     exhaustive     and

   provisions of sub-Sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_93">Section 13</a> of

   the Act.        The scheme relating to recognition of

   institutions outside India becomes workable only if

   the provisions of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_94">Section 12</a> of the Act and the

Central Government, be eligible to get admission to

obtain medical qualification granted by any medical

Statute book by Act 34 of 2001, with effect from

September 3, 2001. On analysis of sub-Section (4A)

it becomes sufficiently clear that it would apply when

three conditions are satisfied, namely, (i) when a

citizen of India obtains medical qualification granted

by any medical institution in any country outside

India, (ii) the medical qualification obtained must

have been recognized for enrolment as medical

practitioner in that country and (iii) the medical

qualification must have been obtained after the date

to be specified by the Central Government.          The

phrase "medical qualification granted by any medical

institution in any country outside India" employed in

sub-Section (4A) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_117">Section 13</a> of the Act is not

restrictive in its application at all and takes within

its sweep the medical qualifications granted by any

which a scheme of reciprocity for the purpose of

recognition of medical qualification is in force as well

as the cases covered by sub-Sections (3) and (4) of

that <a href="/doc/187216512/" id="a_119">Section 11</a> of the Act refers to the First Schedule

(4A) and (4B) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_125">Section 13</a> do not refer to any

Schedule at all because by those sub-Sections

general provisions are enacted which apply to all the

cases where a citizen of India has obtained or is

desirous of obtaining medical qualification granted

by any medical institution in any country outside

India. The provisions of sub-Sections (4A) and (4B)

would have applied to the cases covered by <a href="/doc/53918462/" id="a_126">Section

referred to in <a href="/doc/53918462/" id="a_128">Section 14</a> for the purposes of that

  not apply to the cases covered by <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_131">Section 12</a> of the

  Act.     Such a course is neither permissible nor

  warranted by the facts of the case.

</p><p id="p_67">29. Even if the material words of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_132">Section 13(4A)</a> are

  capable of bearing two constructions, the most firmly

  established rule for construction of such words is the

  rule of "purposive construction or mischief rule".

  This rule enables consideration of four matters in

  construing an Act - (1) what was the law before the

  making of the Act, (2) what was the mischief or

  defect for which the law did not provide, (3) what is

  remedy that the Act has provided and (4) what is the

  reason of the remedy. The rule then directs that the

  courts    must   adopt   that   construction    which

  suppresses the mischief and advances the remedy.

  Applying this principle of construction to sub-<a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_133">Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                         55</span></a>
(4A) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_134">Section 13</a> of the Act, this Court finds that the

law before the enactment of the said sub-Section was

that     medical   qualifications   granted    by    medical

institutions in countries with which there was a

scheme      of   reciprocity   included   in   the   Second

Schedule, were recognized qualifications for the

purposes of the Act.       This law continues to be in

force even after the enactment of sub-Section (4A).

However, over a period of time, it had come to the

notice of the Legislature that a large number of

private agencies sponsored students for medical

studies in institutions outside India for commercial

consideration.      It was noticed that such students

also included those students, who did not fulfill the

minimum eligibility requirements for admission to

medical courses in India. Serious aberrations were

noticed in the standard of medical education in some

of the foreign countries, which were not on par with

the standards of medical education available in

India.     These were the defects and/or mischiefs

noticed for which no provision was made either in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                  56</span>
<a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_135">Section 12</a> or sub-Sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_136">Section 13</a>

of the Act.   In the year 1956, when the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_137">Indian

Medical Council Act</a> was enacted, it must not have

been contemplated by any one that a large number

of private agencies would sponsor students for

medical studies in institutions outside India for

commercial considerations including those students

who were not fulfilling the minimum eligibility

requirements for admission to medical courses in

India, etc.   It was, therefore, felt necessary by

Parliament to make a provision to enable the Council

to conduct a screening test. This is the remedy that

sub-Section (4A) has provided.      This remedy is

prescribed to satisfy the MCI with regard to the

adequacy of knowledge and skills acquired by

citizens of India, who obtain medical qualifications

from Universities or medical institutions outside

India and to ensure that those students have

secured the standards of medical education in the

foreign countries, which are at par with standards of

medical education in India. The remedies mentioned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                            57</span>
  in <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_138">Sections 13(4A)</a> and <a href="/doc/32722112/" id="a_139">13(4B)</a> are prescribed because

  citizens   of    India,    who   have    obtained    medical

  qualifications      from     Universities      or    medical

  institutions outside India, would be entitled to

  practice medicine in India and they cannot be

  permitted to treat other citizens of India with their

  half-baked knowledge and jeopardize their precious

  lives.     Thus     by     adopting     rule   of   purposive

  construction or mischief rule, it will have to be held

  that the provisions of sub-Section (4A) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_140">Section 13</a>

  of the Act would also apply to the cases covered by

  <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_141">Section 12</a> of the Act.

  and applied the provisions of the Act by releasing

  press note to mean that the screening test would not

  be necessary for students who have obtained degree

  from foreign medical institutions recognised under

  <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_142">Section 12</a> of the Act and, therefore, MCI is

  precluded in insisting that the students, who have

  obtained degrees from foreign medical institutions, is

  devoid of merit. It is true that at one stage the MCI

had   released        a     press   note    clarifying    for   the

information      of       general    public     that     eligibility

requirements          for     taking       admission      in    an

undergraduate medical course mentioned in Foreign

Medical Institutions Regulations, 2002 and the

Screening Test Regulation, 2002 would not be

applicable to the students joining an undergraduate

medical course in foreign countries, recognised and

included in the Second Schedule under <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_143">Section 12</a> of

the Act.   However, this was the understanding of

MCI, which is one of the parties before the Court.

The scope of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_144">Section 13(4A)</a> is quite clear and covers

all foreign medical institutions falling within the

ambit of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_145">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_146">13</a> of the Act. On a close

and careful reading, provisions of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_147">Amending Act</a>

of 2001 with the Eligibility Requirement Regulations

and Screening Test Regulation, both of 2002, it

becomes at once clear that the MCI is obliged to

stipulate the screening test in the case of all those

candidates, who obtained medical qualification from

medical institutions outside India filling within the

   purview of <a href="/doc/86767145/" id="a_148">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_149">13</a> of the Act in view of

   the statutory provisions of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_150">Section 13(4A)</a> of the Act.

   The   press     release    cannot      be   interpreted   as

   precluding MCI from canvassing correct import of the

   provisions of the Act. In any view of the matter, the

   Court is of the firm opinion that press release by MCI

   cannot preclude the court from placing correct

   interpretation of the Act.      Therefore, the said plea

   has no substance and is hereby rejected.


</p><p id="p_70">31. The contention that if the provisions of the Screening

   Test Regulations, 2002 are made applicable to the

   citizens   of   India,    who   have    obtained    medical

   qualifications granted by Universities or medical

   institutions outside India, a serious anomaly would

   arise as all those students who are similarly placed

   as the appellants, but who are not Indian citizens,

   would be entitled to be enrolled on Medical Register

   maintained by the State Medical Council or to have

   their names entered in the Indian Medical Register

   without undergoing the screening test whereas the

   appellants and other students, who are citizens of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                   60</span>
India, would not be so entitled without qualifying the

screening test, which would be discriminatory, is

merely stated to be rejected. It must be remembered

that the appellants are students, who have obtained

MBBS degree granted by Kathmandu University in

respect of Manipal College of Medical Sciences,

Pokhara, Nepal. They have not laid any factual data

to indicate that in Nepal education system of 10+2 is

prevalent and that a student becomes entitled to get

admission to medical course only after he clears

Central Admission Test in order of merits.        The

Indian Parliament never found that either large

number of students of Nepal or other students

belonging to other countries but studying in Manipal

College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, who are

desirous of practicing medicine in India, were

sponsored by private agencies of those countries for

medical studies in the said institute for commercial

consideration.   It is not the case of the appellants

that students of Nepal or students of other countries

prosecuting medical studies in Manipal College of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                                            61</span>
  Medical     Sciences      were/are   not    fulfilling    the

  minimum eligibility requirements for admission to

  medical     courses    prescribed    in   their   respective

  countries. The appellants failed to bring on record

  the facts, which would prima facie show that the

  standards of medical education prescribed either by

  the Government of Nepal or by Nepal Medical

  Council are at par with the standards of medical

  education     available     in   India.      Under       such

  circumstances, there was no scope for Parliament of

  India to prescribe that students of Nepal or students

  of other countries prosecuting medical studies in

  Manipal College of Medical Sciences should also

  qualify the screening test prescribed before they are

  enrolled on Medical Register maintained by the State

  Medical Council or get their names entered in Indian

  Medical Register.       The plea based on so called

  discrimination has no substance and is, therefore,

  rejected.

<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">32. The alternative plea that the provisions of sub-

  Sections (4A) and (4B) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_151">Section 13</a> of the Act are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                                             62</span>
prospective in nature and as the appellants have not

incurred any disqualification after obtaining medical

qualification of MBBS degree from Kathmandu

University, which is included in the Second Schedule

and, therefore, they cannot be asked to qualify the

screening test, is devoid of merits. It is an admitted

fact    that    the   date    specified   by   the    Central

Government under sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_152">Section 13</a> is

March     15,    2002.       Therefore,   in   view    of   the

stipulations contained in sub-Section (4A) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_153">Section

13</a> of the Act, the provisions of said sub-Sections

would be applicable with effect from March 15, 2002.

The effect of specification of the date of March 15,

2002 is that a person who is citizen of India and

obtains medical qualification granted by any medical

institution in any country outside India, recognized

for    enrolment      as   medical   practitioner     in    that

country, shall not be entitled to be enrolled on

Medical Register maintained by a State Medical

Council or to have his name entered in the Indian

Medical Register after March 15, 2002, unless he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                           63</span>
qualifies the screening test prescribed.             As made

clear by the MCI, the provisions of sub-Section (4A)

of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_154">Section 13</a> of the Act are applicable to all the

medical      qualifications   included    in   the    Second

Schedule.       It is an admitted position that the

appellants and others have applied for provisional

registration/ permanent registration after March 15,

2002.     Therefore, the appellants have to appear in

the screening test conducted by the National Board

of Examination in terms of the Screening Test

Regulations made by the MCI.             <a href="/doc/1921552/" id="a_155">In Sanjeev Gupta

and others vs. Union of India</a> [(2005) 1 SCC 45],

challenge was made to the stipulations for conduct of

the screening test, by the students who had been

admitted in undergraduate medical courses in the

institutions outside India between 1994 and 2000.

Most    of    the   students    had      qualified    in   the

undergraduate course but some of them, who had

joined such courses during 1999-2000, were still

pursuing      the   course.      After    considering      the

provisions of the Act a Three Judge Bench of this

  Court uniformly applied the screening test provisions

  to all the candidates from the cut-off date of March

  15, 2002.    Therefore, there is no doubt that the

  provisions of sub-Section (4A) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_156">Section 13</a> of the

  Act are not being applied retrospectively but from the

  date specified by the Central Government. Under the

  circumstances    the   plea     based      on     retrospective

  application of sub-Section (4A) of <a href="/doc/92458001/" id="a_157">Section 13</a> of the

  Act cannot be accepted and is hereby rejected.
