S.B. Sinha, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	Appellants were charged with and convicted for commission of 
offences under Sections 376(2)(g), 302 and 201 read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the 
Indian Penal Code, 1860 for rape and murder of one Barnali Deb @ Poppy 
(the deceased), a 7-8 year old girl.  She was travelling with her parents  
Bishnu Deb (father-P.W.23), Anima Deb (mother- P.W.22) and younger 
brother in a private transport service known as Net Work Travels from 
Dharmanagar (Tripura).  They were on their way to Dimapur in the State of 
Nagaland.  They reached Net Work Travels' Complex at Paltan Bazar, 
Guwahati at around 10.30 p.m. on 12.7.2002.  There was no connecting bus 
to Dimapur at that time.  They were advised to stay over for the night at 
Guwahati.  Appellant No.1 was a night chawkidar of the waiting room of the 
said Net Work Travels.  He represented that they could stay there for the 
night and therefore should not have any apprehension in regard to their 
safety.  Their luggage was carried by the appellant No.1 to the waiting room.  
The waiting room had two openings.  It was covered by grills.  Only the 
front gate was open, which was kept under lock and key, the key whereof 
was with the appellant No.1.	
</p>
<p id="p_3">	The family of P.W.23 went out for dinner and came back to the said 
waiting room.  He and both his children slept.  Anima Deb (P.W.22), mother 
of the deceased, however, kept on sitting.  Appellant No.1 insisted on her 
repeatedly that she should go to sleep stating that as the waiting room would 
be locked, there was nothing for her to worry about.  As she had not been 
sleeping, the appellant No.1, allegedly, scolded her to do so.  At that time, a 
bus bearing No.AS-25-C-1476 arrived at the said bus stop.  Putul Bora - 
Appellant No.2 was the 'handiman' of the said bus.  While the Manager, 
Driver and the Conductor slept in the said bus, he did not.  He was seen 
talking with the appellant No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	Anima Deb-P.W.22 slept for a while.  As her son had cried out, she 
woke up at about 3 p.m.  She did not find Barnali.  A hue and cry was raised 
by her.  Being attracted by her alarm, Bishnu Deb-P.W.23 also woke up.  
They requested the appellant No.1 to open the gates of the waiting room.  He 
showed his reluctance at the first instance.  He was thereafter told about the 
missing of the girl.  On being so informed, he opined that she might be 
somewhere else within the room.  A search was carried out in the three 
buses, which were at the bus stop belonging to the travel agency.  Near-
about places as also the railway station were searched.  The bathroom 
situated in the said premises was also searched.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">	Shri Kapil Kumar Paul-P.W.2, the Cashier of the Net Work Travels 
was informed about the missing of Barnali Deb.  As the girl could not be 
found despite vigorous search, Bishnu Deb, the father of the girl was advised 
to inform the police.  A missing entry was lodged before the Officer-in-
Charge of Paltan Bazar Police Station.  At about 8.30 a.m. on 14.7.2002, a 
complaint was made that the flush in the toilet was not working.  P.W.7-
Amar Deep Basfore (sweeper) was asked by P.W.2-Shri Kapil Kumar Paul 
to find out the reason therefor.  He later on opened the septic tank and saw 
the head of a small child.  He immediately reported the matter to P.W.1-Shri 
Bidhu Kinkar Goswami as well as P.W.2-Shri Kapil Kumar Paul.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">	A First Information Report was lodged thereafter by Shri Bidhu 
Kinkar Goswami, the Manager of Net Work Travels. In the said First 
Information Report, apart from the appellant No.1, suspicion was raised 
about the involvement of driver-Krishna Hazarika (P.W.26), conductor-
Rama Hazarika (P.W.25) and the handiman-Putul Bora (Appellant No.2 
herein) of the bus bearing No.AS-25-C-1476.  The said bus had already left 
for its destination at about 6.30 in the morning.  Even prior thereto, P.W.2 
was persuaded that the said bus be permitted to leave early for Jorhat, which 
was declined.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">	Pursuant to the said First Information Report, a case under <a href="/doc/1284610/" id="a_2">Sections 
376(2)(g)</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">302</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 was 
registered.  A Magistrate was called.  An inquest of the dead body was 
made.  The said bus was intercepted and the driver-P.W.26, conductor-
P.W.25 and Appellant No.2-Putul Bora were arrested.  They were brought to 
the police station.
</p><p id="p_8">	During the course of investigation, the appellant No.1 made a 
confessional statement before the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_5">Section 164</a> of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ('the Code' for short).  He gave a vivid 
description as to how the offence was committed by him and the appellant 
No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	On completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against the 
appellants.  They were convicted by the learned Sessions Judge, Kamrup and 
sentenced to death.  An appeal preferred by them, by reason of the impugned 
judgment, has been dismissed by the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	The appellants are, thus before us.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	At our request, Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned counsel assisted us 
as Amicus Curiae in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	Evidently, there was no eye-witness to the occurrence in this case.  
Nobody had seen the appellants lifting the girl, committing rape and 
murdering her.  The entire prosecution case is based on circumstantial 
evidences.  The circumstances, which found favour with the learned 
Sessions Judge as also the High Court, are :-
</p>
<p id="p_13">As against Appellant No.1 :
</p>

<p id="p_14">	i)	The confession of the appellant No.1 recorded by Smt. 
Nirupama Rajkumari, Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class at Guwahati (P.W.8).
</p>
<p id="p_15">	ii)	Appellant No.1 was the night chawkidar of the Net Work 
Travel Agency and the parents of the deceased girl along with their children 
were persuaded to stay at the waiting room in the night.
</p>
<p id="p_16">	iii)	P.Ws. 22 and 23 (mother and father of the deceased) were 
prevailed upon by the appellant No.1 to spend the night in the waiting room.  
He had also carried their luggage assuring them full security and safety.  
</p>	
<p id="p_17">	iv)	The key of the waiting room was with him.  Appellant No.1 
alone, thus, had the access to the waiting room.  He only had access to the 
entire premises.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	v)	P.W.22-Anima Deb saw both the appellants held discussion in 
suspicious circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	vi)	Despite the information that Barnali was missing, the appellant 
No.1 showed his reluctance to open the door.  On the contrary, P.Ws.22 and 
23 were told that she might be somewhere else in the room.
</p><p id="p_20">	vii)	The evidences brought on records go to show that the appellant 
No.1 had a nefarious plan.  
</p>
<p id="p_21">	viii)	A black coloured half pant belonging to the appellant No.1 was 
seized by the police (Exhibit 3).  
</p>
<p id="p_22">	ix)	No explanation was offered by him as to how the said half pant 
could be found there.  It was admitted it belonged to him.
</p>
<p id="p_23">As against Appellant No.2 :
</p>
<p id="p_24">	i)	He was the handiman of the bus bearing No.AS-25-C-1476.
</p>
<p id="p_25">	ii)	The evidences of P.Ws. 22, 23 and 26 clearly point out that he 
held some discussions with the appellant No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_26">	iii)	Although, he had made preparations to sleep in the bus, in 
which he was travelling, but, in fact, slept in different bus bearing No.AS-1-
G-5990.  No satisfactory explanation was offered by him to a question put in 
that behalf by P.W.4-Shri Jams Brown, conductor of said bus. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">	iv)	P.W.3-Shri Kamal Goswami, Manager of the Travel Agency, at 
about 2/2.30 p.m. had suddenly felt some touch on his leg.  He found the 
appellant No.2 climbing the upper bunker of the vehicle.  He was wearing a 
long pant, although during his journey he was wearing only a jangia.
</p>
<p id="p_28">	v)	While the missing girl was searched, the appellant No.2 was 
found to have sustained some injuries on his face, although, no such 
injury/stain was noticed by P.W.3 while they were coming from Nagaon to 
Guwahati, which showed that the girl offered resistance before being raped.
</p>
<p id="p_29">	vi)	A brown coloured jangia belonging to him was recovered, 
which was having some white stains.  
</p>
<p id="p_30">	vii)	He made constant pressure on P.W.2-Shri Kapil Kumar Paul to 
allow him to leave Paltan Bazar bus stand with his vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_31">	Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned Amicus Curiae, in support of the 
appellants would submit :
</p>
<p id="p_32">	a)	There are many missing links in the chain which have not been 
appreciated by the courts below in their proper perspective.  
</p>
<p id="p_33">	b) 	Seizure of the under garments of the appellants is not free from 
doubt as the seizure witnesses clearly stated that they had visited police 
station at different points of time and thus, they could not be witnesses to 
seizure; 
</p>
<p id="p_34">	c)	The under garments, which were purported to have seized, had 
not been sent for chemical examination and thus, inference drawn by the  
courts below that white stains were semen stains, had not been established. 
</p>
<p id="p_35">	d)	Although, urine and blood samples of the appellants were 
taken, the same having not been sent for chemical analysis, an adverse 
inference in this behalf should be drawn against the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_36">	e)	In the vaginal swap obtained by the doctor, no semen was 
found.  The Forensic Science Laboratory Report was not brought on record 
and thus, deliberate withholding of material must be held to have weakened 
the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_37">	f)	Although, the appellant No.1 had the key of the lock, the 
possibility of some co-passengers committing the said offence cannot be 
ruled out.
</p>	
<p id="p_38">	g)	The testimony of mother of the deceased is not reliable as she 
had omitted to make statements as regards the purport conduct of the 
appellants before the police.
</p>
<p id="p_39">	h)	No reliance can be placed on the confession of the appellant 
No.1 as he had remained in police custody for a long time.
</p>
<p id="p_40">	i)	Evidence of Smt. Nirupama Rajkumari, the Judicial Magistrate 
(P.W.8) does not show that all statutory requirements in recording the said 
confession had been carried out.	  
</p>
<p id="p_41">	Mr. Ng. Junior Luwang, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
respondent, on the other hand, would submit : 
</p>
<p id="p_42">	(i) 	Confession of the appellant No.1 itself was sufficient to uphold 
the judgment of conviction and sentence of both the appellants; 
</p>
<p id="p_43">	(ii) 	The depositions of the prosecution witnesses clearly suggest 
that offence had been committed between 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.;   
</p>
<p id="p_44">	(iii) 	The conduct of Appellant No.1 clearly goes to show that he had 
committed the offence; 
</p>
<p id="p_45">	(iv) 	Appellant No.2's admitted presence at the spot, his absence 
from the bus for some time, coupled with the injuries on his face, clearly 
point out that he had also taken part in commission of the said offence.
</p>
<p id="p_46">	We may, at the outset, place on record that this is one of the rare cases 
where the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution, inter alia, were 
the employees of the company where the appellants had also been working.  
</p>
<p id="p_47">	The presence of the appellants at the place of occurrence on the said 
night is not in dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_48">	Appellant No.1 was the chawkidar of the waiting room of Net Work 
Travels and he was the only person who had the key, and without his 
knowledge nobody could have entered into the waiting room.
</p>
<p id="p_49">	The waiting room was otherwise secure, having grills and collapsible 
gates.  The second collapsible gate was also closed.
</p>
<p id="p_50">	The bathroom as also the latrine were situated within the said 
premises.
</p>
<p id="p_51">	The family came back to the waiting room after 10.30 p.m.  The girl 
was found missing at about 3 O'clock.  A search of the deceased was 
commenced.  She was not found not only within the premises of the waiting 
room but also other nearby places.
</p>
<p id="p_52">	The buses belonging to other travel agencies were also searched.  A 
search was carried out even at the railway station.  
</p>	
<p id="p_53">	The bus bearing No.AS-25-C-1476, in which the appellant No.2 was 
working as a handiman, left at about 6.30 a.m. for Jorhat.  
</p>
<p id="p_54">	The dead body was detected at about 9 a.m.  

	The Manager of the Net Work Travels himself lodged the First 
Information Report suspecting the appellant No.1 as also the driver, 
conductor and the handiman of the bus bearing No.AS-25-C-1476, as having 
committed the offence.  
</p>
<p id="p_55">	The said bus was intercepted at about 10 a.m. and they were brought 
to the police station.
</p>
<p id="p_56">	P.W.22-the mother of the victim saw the appellants herein talking to 
each other.  According to her she was goaded to go to sleep; she was even 
threatened.  
</p>
<p id="p_57">	Appellant No.2 did not have any injury on his face earlier.  Shri 
Kamal Goswami, the Manager of the Net Work Travels, who had travelled 
with the appellant No.2 in the same bus, in no uncertain terms stated that 
while he went to sleep, at about 2/2.30 p.m. he suddenly felt a touch on his 
leg and found the appellant No.2 moving to the upper bunker of the said 
vehicle.  He had been wearing a long pant, although he had been wearing 
only a jangia while traveling from Nagaon to Guwahati.  He had heard that 
the couple and the children were staying in the waiting room having missed 
their bus to Dimapur as also in regard to the searches carried out for tracing 
the missing girl.
</p>
<p id="p_58">	He also deposed to the effect that although the appellant No.2 had 
some injuries on his face, he had not offered any explanation therefor.  He is 
also a witness to the seizure of the under pants.  Apparently, there is no 
reason to disbelieve his statement, particularly when both the appellants in 
their examination under <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_6">Section 313</a> of the Code have accepted their 
presence.  Appellant No.2 at no point of time, even during his examination 
under <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> of the Code, could offer any suitable explanation in 
regard to the stains/injuries on his face.  
</p>
<p id="p_59">	Shri Krishna Hazarika, the driver of the bus, examined himself as 
P.W.26.  He proved that the appellant No.2 was seen to be gossiping with 
the appellant No.1 inside the complex of Net Work Travels.  He proved the 
fact that a search was carried out in regard to the missing of Barnali.  He also 
spoke about the seizure of the under pants containing some stains.  This 
witness categorically stated that when they had gone to sleep, the appellant 
No.2 was not seen.  On the aforementioned aspects he was not even cross-
examined.  
</p>
<p id="p_60">	P.W.4-Shri Jams Brown was the conductor of bus bearing No.AS-1-
G-5990.  Apart from corroborating the prosecution case in regard to the 
commotion emanating from the missing of the deceased, he had stated that 
after the missing girl was searched, the appellant No.2 came into his bus.  
On being questioned, he had reported that he came from bus bearing No.AS-
25-C-1476 for sleeping.  
</p>
<p id="p_61">	We have noticed hereinbefore that the parents of the deceased girl 
(P.Ws.22 and 23) stated in details as to under what circumstances they had 
to stay in the waiting room.  The Cashier of the Net Work Travels  Shri 
Kapil Kumar Paul, who examined himself as P.W.2, apart from his 
statements which have been noticed hereinbefore, categorically stated that 
the appellant No.2, together with the driver and conductor of the bus bearing 
No.AS-25-C-1476 persuaded pressed him to allow the bus to leave for 
Jorhat earlier than the scheduled time, and he refused to accede to their 
request.  It is only because of their conduct he suspected their involvement 
in the crime.  This witness also categorically stated that lock and key of the 
waiting room would always be with the chawkidar.
</p>
<p id="p_62">	We may now consider the manner in which the confessional statement 
made by the appellant No.1 was recorded.  He was admittedly brought to the 
Court of Smt. Nirupama Rajkumari, the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class at 
Guwahati (P.W.8), for getting his statement recorded on 24.7.2002.  The 
voluntariness and truthfulness of the confession is not in dispute.  Appellant 
No.1 was produced before P.W.8 in her official Chamber at about 4.45 p.m.  
He was warned that the confession made by him might be used in evidence 
against him.  She recorded the confessional statement of the appellant No.1 
being satisfied as regards the voluntariness thereof.  The said confessional 
statement reads as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_63">	"I am the night watchman of the Paltan Bazar 
counter of Network travels.  On 13/7/02 I was on duty at 
the counter.  Around 10.30 that night a bus arrived from 
Dharmanagar.  Some passengers : from that bus came 
and requested me to allow them to stay at the counter for 
the night.  The group comprised a man, two women  a 
girl of about 8 or 9 and a child of about 3 or 4.  I allowed 
them to sleep at the counter.  Around 1.30 am one 'NR 
Super' bus (No.1476) arrived from Jorhat and its staff 
slept in the bus itself.  Around 2 a.m. Putul Bora, 
handyman of the N.R. Super bus got down from the bus 
and came to me.  Then I proposed to Putul Bora rape of 
the said 8 or 9 year old girl sleeping at the counter.  
According to my plan I and Putul Bora lifted the said 8 or 
9 year girl in her sleep and in the bathroom at the 
counter, we raped her, first me and then Putul Bora.  As 
the girl was asleep, she did not shout.  After having raped 
her, we found the girl still.  Then I and Putul Bora 
opened the lid of the septic tank of the lavatory at the 
counter, put the girl inside the septic tank and closed the 
lid.  Then I left for my duty and Putul Bora went back to 
the bus and slept there."        
</p>
<p id="p_64">	A bare perusal of the aforementioned statement clearly shows that a 
detailed statement had been made by him in regard to commission of the 
offence.
</p>
<p id="p_65">	A confessional statement, as is well known, is admissible in evidence.  
It is a relevant fact.  The Court may rely thereupon if it is voluntarily given.  
It may also form the basis of the conviction, wherefor the Court may only 
have to satisfy itself in regard to voluntariness and truthfulness thereof and 
in given cases, some corroboration thereof.  A confession which is not 
retracted even at a later stage of the trial and even accepted by the accused in 
his examination under <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_8">Section 313</a> of the Code, in our considered opinion, 
can be fully relied upon.
</p>
<p id="p_66">	In this case, not only the confession had not been retracted, the 
appellant No.1 in his examination under <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_9">Section 313</a> of the Code accepted 
the same, as would be evident from the following questions and answers :
</p>
<p id="p_67">"Q.No.41 : It is also in her evidence that on your 
production, the Magistrate asked you whether you were 
willing to give a confessional statement of guilt.  What is 
your say?
</p><p id="p_68">Ans  :	 The Magistrate asked me whether I was willing to 
make confessional statement.  I wanted to give my 
confessional statement as I committed the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_69">Q.No.42  :  It is also in her evidence that she made you 
understand that you are not bound to make confessional 
statement, the confession so to be made would go against 
you, that she was not a police man but a magistrate.  
What is your say?
</p><p id="p_70">Ans  :  The Magistrate did explain me the above fact to 
me and consulted the same carefully about the result of 
such confession.
</p>
<p id="p_71">Q.No.43  :  It is also in her evidence that you were put in 
the charge in the office peon in her chamber (office) at 
1.30 PM you were produced and then again at 4.45 PM 
for recording your statement.
</p><p id="p_72">Ans  :  Yes, I was produced before her.
</p>
<p id="p_73">Q.No.44  :  It is also in her evidence that at your 
production again she again explained to you the import of 
confession and you expressed your willingness to give 
confessional statement.  What is your say?
</p><p id="p_74">Ans  :  Yes I, expressed my willingness to give 
confessional statement.  I understand her all questions 
(sic) put to me.
</p>
<p id="p_75">Q.No.45  :  It is also in her evidence that inspite of 
repeated caution you were sanguine to give a 
confessional statement about your guilt.  What is your 
say?
</p><p id="p_76">Ans  :  I was sanguine to given confessional statement 
because I was repenting to my misdeed that I did.
</p>
<p id="p_77">Q.No.46  :  It is also in her evidence that you voluntarily 
gave confessional statement, what is your say?
Ans.  :  Yes, I voluntarily gave my confessional 
statement because I committed the offence.  I am guilty 
of the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_78">Q.No.47  :  It is also in her evidence that she recorded 
your confessional statement and the statement was 
readover to you and put your signatures having found the 
same as correct.  What is your say?
</p><p id="p_79">Ans  :  Yes, my confessional statement was recorded by 
the Magistrate.  The confessional statement so recorded 
was not read over to me.  I put my signature in the 
confessional statement.
</p>
<p id="p_80">Q.No.48  :  It is also in her evidence that Ext.10 is the 
confessional statement recorded by her wherein Ext.10(7) 
to 10(8) and 10(9) are my signatures and Ext.10(1) to 
10(6) are her signatures.  What is your say?
</p><p id="p_81">Ans  :  Yes. Ext.10(7) to 10(9) are my signatures."       
</p>
					
<p id="p_82">	We are not oblivious of the general proposition of law that confession 
would not ordinarily be considered the basis for a conviction.  We must, 
however, at this stage, notice that this is one of those rare cases where an 
appellant had stuck to his own confessional statements.  He did not make 
any attempt to retract.  He even did not state that it was not truthful or 
involuntary.  
</p>
<p id="p_83">	It is well settled that statements under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, cannot form the sole basis of conviction; but the effect 
thereof may be considered in the light of other evidences brought on record.  
{<a href="/doc/469763/" id="a_11">See Mohan Singh vs. Prem Singh</a> [(2002) 10 SCC 236], <a href="/doc/1051425/" id="a_12">State of U.P. vs. 
Lakhmi</a> [(1998) 4 SCC 336], and <a href="/doc/767636/" id="a_13">Rattan Singh vs. State of HP</a>. [(1997) 4 
SCC 161].}

	<a href="/doc/1522913/" id="a_14">In Aloke Nath Dutta &amp; Ors. vs. State of West Bengal</a> [2006 (13) 
SCALE 467], this Court noticed the law in  regard to the effect of a 
confessional statement of the accused in the following terms :
</p>
<p id="p_84">	"<a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_15">Sections 24</a> to <a href="/doc/603767/" id="a_16">30</a> deal with confession.  <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_17">Section 
24</a> speaks of the effect of a confession made by an 
accused through inducement, threat or promise 
proceeding from a 'person in authority'. Whereas <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_18">section 
25</a> and <a href="/doc/521753/" id="a_19">section 26</a> deal with situations where such 'person 
in authority' is police. It is an institutionalized 
presumption against confession extracted by police or in 
police custody. In that frame of reference, <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_20">Section 24</a> is 
the genus and <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_21">sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/521753/" id="a_22">26</a> are its species. In other 
words,  <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_23">section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/521753/" id="a_24">section 26</a> are simple corollaries 
flowing out of the axiomatic and generalized proposition 
(confession caused by inducement where inducement 
proceeds from a person in authority,  is bad in law) 
contained in <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_25">section 24</a>. They are directed towards 
assessing the value of a confession made to a police 
officer or in police custody. 
</p><p id="p_85">	The policy underlying behind <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_26">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/521753/" id="a_27">26</a> 
is to make it a substantive rule of law that confessions 
whenever and wherever made to the police, or while in 
the custody of the police unless made in the immediate 
presence of a magistrate, shall be presumed to have been 
obtained under the circumstances mentioned in <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_28">Section 
24</a> and, therefore, inadmissible, except so far as is 
provided by Section 27 of the Act.
</p><p id="p_86">	<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_29">Section 164</a>, however, makes the confession before 
a Magistrate admissible in evidence.  The manner in 
which such confession is to be recorded by the 
Magistrate is provided under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_30">Section 164</a> of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure.  The said provision, inter alia, seeks 
to protect an accused from making a confession, which 
may include a confession before a Magistrate, still as 
may be under influence, threat or promise from a person 
in authority.  It takes into its embrace the right of an 
accused flowing from <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_31">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of 
India as also <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_32">Article 21</a> thereof.   Although, <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_33">Section 164</a> 
provides for safeguards, the same cannot be said to be 
exhaustive in nature.  The Magistrate putting the 
questions to an accused brought before him from police 
custody, should some time, in our opinion, be more 
intrusive than what is required in law.  [<a href="/doc/1681234/" id="a_34">See Babubhai 
Udesinh Parmar v. State of Gujarat</a>  2006 (12) SCALE

</p><p id="p_87">	In a case, where confession is made in the presence 
of a Magistrate conforming the requirements of <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_35">Section 
164</a>, if it is retracted at a later stage, the court in our 
opinion, should probe deeper into the matter.  Despite 
procedural safeguards contained in the said provision, in 
our opinion, the learned Magistrate should satisfy himself 
that whether the confession was of voluntary nature.  It 
has to be appreciated that there can be times where 
despite such procedural safeguards, confessions are made 
for unknown reasons and in fact made out of fear of 
police. 
</p><p id="p_88">	Judicial confession must be recorded in strict 
compliance of the provisions of <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_36">Section 164</a> of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure.  While doing so, the court shall 
not go by the black letter of law as contained in the 
aforementioned provision; but must make further probe 
so as to satisfy itself that the confession is truly voluntary 
and had not been by reason of any inducement, threat or 
torture."
</p>
<p id="p_89">	It was further opined :
</p>
<p id="p_90">	"In a case of retracted confession, the courts while 
arriving at a finding of guilt would not ordinarily rely 
solely thereupon and would look forward for 
corroboration of material particulars.  Such corroboration 
must not be referable in nature.  Such corroboration must 
be independent and conclusive in nature."	
</p>
<p id="p_91">	<a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_37">In State (N.C.T. of Delhi) vs. Navjot Sandhu @ Afsan Guru</a> 
[(2005) 11 SS 600], this Court stated :
</p>
<p id="p_92">	"As to what should be the legal approach of the 
court called upon to convict a person primarily in the 
light of the confession or a retracted confession has been 
succinctly summarised in Bharat v. State of U.P. 
Hidayatullah, C.J., speaking for a three-Judge Bench 
observed thus: (SCC p. 	953, para 7)
"Confessions can be acted upon if the court is 
satisfied that they are voluntary and that they are 
true. The voluntary nature of the confession depends 
upon whether there was any threat, inducement or 
promise and its truth is judged in the context of the 
entire prosecution case. The confession must fit into 
the proved facts and not run counter to them. When 
the voluntary character of the confession and its 
truth are accepted, it is safe to rely on it. Indeed a 
confession, if it is voluntary and true and not made 
under any inducement or threat or promise, is the 
most patent piece of evidence against the maker. 
Retracted confession, however, stands on a slightly 
different footing. As the Privy Council once stated, 
in India it is the rule to find a confession and to find 
it retracted later. A court may take into account the 
retracted confession, but it must look for the reasons 
for the making of the confession as well as for its 
retraction, and must weigh the two to determine 
whether the retraction affects the voluntary nature of 
the confession or not. If the court is satisfied that it 
was retracted because of an afterthought or advice, 
the retraction may not weigh with the court if the 
general facts proved in the case and the tenor of the 
confession as made and the circumstances of its 
making and withdrawal warrant its user. All the 
same, the courts do not act upon the retracted 
confession without finding assurance from some 
other sources as to the guilt of the accused. 
Therefore, it can be stated that a true confession 
made voluntarily may be acted upon with slight 
evidence to corroborate it, but a retracted confession 
requires the general assurance that the retraction was 
an afterthought and that the earlier statement was 
true"
</p>

<p id="p_93">	We may also notice that in <a href="/doc/180067/" id="a_38">Sidharth &amp; Ors. vs. State of Bihar</a> 
[(2005) 12 SCC 545], this Court opined :
</p>
<p id="p_94">"The confession made by the appellant Arnit Das is 
voluntary and is fully corroborated by the above items 
of evidence. The Sessions Judge was perfectly justified 
in relying on the confession made by the appellant 
Arnit Das."
</p>

<p id="p_95">	In a case where sufficient materials are brought on records to lend 
assurance to the Court in regard to the truthfulness of the confession made, 
which is corroborated by several independent circumstances lending 
assurance thereto, even a retracted confession may be acted upon.  {<a href="/doc/207803/" id="a_39">See 
State of Tamil Nadu vs. Kutty @ Lakshmi Narsimhan</a> [(2001) 6 SCC 
550]; <a href="/doc/1462333/" id="a_40">Bhagwan Singh vs. State of M.P</a>. [(2003) 3 SCC 21]; and <a href="/doc/153998550/" id="a_41">Sarwan 
Singh Rattan Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> [1957 SCR 953].}

	We have analysed at some length the corroborative nature of 
evidences brought on records by the prosecution.  The fact that the 
appellants were seen talking to each other, absence of the appellant No.2 
from the bus in question, his effort to sleep in another bus leaving his own 
bus, his absence for about 1 to 1= hour, injury/stains on his face and change 
of his garments during that period, all stand well proved.  They, in our 
considered view, lend corroboration to prosecution case as also the judicial 
confession made by the appellant No.1.  Indeed corroboration to the said 
confession and the circumstantial evidences as noticed hereinbefore can also 
be judged from the statements made by the appellant No.2 in his 
examination under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_42">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  
</p>
<p id="p_96">	The relevant questions and answers thereunder are as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_97">"Q.14  :  Was the other accused, the watchman, present 
that night?
</p><p id="p_98">Ans  :  It is true the other accused, the watchman, was 
there.

from Jorhat in the morning?
</p><p id="p_100">Ans  :  That is true.
</p>
<p id="p_101">Q.25  :  Where you there in the Network travels 
compound that night with the vehicle?
</p><p id="p_102">Ans  :  That is true.
</p>
<p id="p_103">Q.32  :  The witness say stains on your face and when he 
asked you about, you could not say anything.  You had 
no stains in your face when you had come from Nagaon?
Ans  : That is true.
</p>
<p id="p_104">Q.33  :  By ext.6 the police seized the underpants you 
were wearing which had white stains on it.  Ext 6(1) is 
the signature of the witness.  What is your statement?
Ans  :  That is true.    
</p>
<p id="p_105">Q.34  :  Witness No.4 has stated that on the night of 
occurrence he was the Conductor of bus No.AS-106-
5996 and that you were on the campus.  Is that true?
Ans  :  That is true.    
</p>
<p id="p_106">Q.36  :  Witness No.5 has stated that he is the owner of 
bus No.AS-25-C-1476; that the manager informed him 
over telephone that a girl had gone missing from the 
waiting room of Network travels; that he then came and 
went to Paltan Bazar police station; and that the police 
seized your undergarments.  Is that true?
</p><p id="p_107">Ans  :  That is true.

Paltan Bazar Police seized, by ext.6, your undergarments 
containing white stains.  What is your statement?
Ans  :  That is true.    
</p>
<p id="p_109">Q.84  :  The following morning you and the driver and 
the conductor started from Jorhat by that bus, and the 
police seized the bus at Kahara with you all.  Is that true?

</p><p id="p_111">Ans  :  That is true."       	
</p>
<p id="p_112">	Indisputably, <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_43">Section 30</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, in a 
situation of the present nature, can be taken aid of.  The courts below did 
take into consideration the confessional effect of the statements made by the 
appellant No.1 as against the appellant No.2 for arriving at an opinion that 
by reason thereof involvement of both of them amply stand proved.
</p>
<p id="p_113">	The expression 'the court may take into consideration such 
confession' is significant.  It signifies that such confession by the maker as 
against the co-accused himself should be treated as a piece of corroborative 
evidence. In absence of any substantive evidence, no judgment of conviction 
can be recorded only on the basis of confession of a co-accused, be it extra 
judicial confession or a judicial confession and least of all on the basis of 
retracted confession. 	
</p>
<p id="p_114">The question has been considered in State of M.P. through CBI &amp; 
Ors. vs. Paltan Mallah &amp; Ors. [(2005) 3 SCC 169], stating : 
</p>
<p id="p_115">".....Under <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_44">Section 30</a> of the Evidence Act, the extra-
judicial confession made by a co-accused could be 
admitted in evidence only as a corroborative piece of 
evidence.  In the absence of any substantive evidence 
against these accused persons, the extra-judicial 
confession allegedly made by the ninth accused loses its 
significance and there cannot be any conviction based on 
such extra-judicial confession.."   
</p>

<p id="p_116">In Sidhartha (supra), this Court held :
</p>
<p id="p_117">"It is true that the confession made by a co-accused 
shall not be the sole basis for a conviction. This Court in 
<a href="/doc/1924452/" id="a_45">Kashmira Singh v. State of M.P</a>. held that the confession 
of an accused person is not evidence in the ordinary 
sense of the term as defined in <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_46">Section 3</a>. It cannot be 
made the foundation of a conviction and can only be used 
in support of other evidence. The proper way is, first, to 
marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the 
confession altogether from consideration and see 
whether, if it is believed, a conviction could safely be 
based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the 
confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the 
confession in aid. But cases may arise where the judge is 
not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands, 
even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain 
a conviction. In such an event the judge may call in aid 
the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other 
evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what 
without the aid of the confession he would not be 
prepared to accept."
</p>
<p id="p_118"><a href="/doc/152453/" id="a_47">In Ram Parkash vs. The State of Punjab</a>  [1959 SCR 1219],  it was 
held :
</p>
<p id="p_119">"That a voluntary and true confession made by an 
accused though it was subsequently retracted by him, can 
be taken into consideration against a co-accused by virtue 
of<a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_48"> s. 30</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, but as a matter of 
prudence and practice the court should not act upon it to 
sustain a conviction of the co-accused without full and 
strong corroboration in material particulars both as to the 
crime and as to his connection with that crime.
The amount of credibility to be attached to a 
retracted confession would depend upon the 
circumstances of each particular case." 	
</p>
<p id="p_120">It was further opined :
</p>	
<p id="p_121">"On the evidence in the case the confession of P 
was voluntary and true and was strongly corroborated in 
material particulars both concerning the general story 
told in the confession concerning the crime and the 
appellant's connection with crime."
</p>

<p id="p_122">	{See also Navjot Sandhu (supra) and Jaswant Gir vs. State of 
Punjab (2005) 12 SCC 438].}

	Both the appellants had accepted their presence at the place of 
occurrence.  Appellant No.2 had accepted that there were injuries on his 
face.  He also accepted that there were stains in his seized undergarment.
</p>
<p id="p_123">	Ms. Makhija may be correct in saying that all the witnesses to the 
seizure are not truthful, but, apart from the Investigating Officer, seizure has 
been proved by P.W.4 and P.W.26.  They were themselves suspects; they 
were brought to the police station.  They must have been interrogated and if 
they were witnesses to the seizure, we do not find any reason as to why we 
should completely ignore the seizure of the said undergarments, particularly 
in regard to its relevance, vis-`-vis, the statement of the manager of the bus 
that he had changed his dress within the probable time of commission of the 
offence.  
</p>
<p id="p_124">	Indisputably, the investigation was done in a slipshod manner.  The 
undergarments should have been sent for chemical analysis.  Even the urine 
and blood samples, which were taken, allegedly, have been sent for their 
analysis in the Forensic Laboratory.  According to the Investigating Officer, 
the report was placed on records.  It, however, was not marked as exhibit.  
Apart from the Investigating Officer, indeed the Public Prosecutor was 
remiss in performing his duties.  
</p>
<p id="p_125">	Submission of Ms. Makhija, that the possibility of the other passenger 
committing the crime cannot be ruled out, in our opinion, is wholly 
misplaced.  Some more passengers may be there in the waiting room, but, 
they were found present at the time of search of the deceased girl.  
Evidently, they must have been found sleeping.  If they had committed the 
offence, some suspicious circumstances could have been found.  They were 
not suspected even by the parents of the deceased girl.  Evidently, they could 
not have gone out as the lock and key was with the appellant No.1.  Even no 
outsider would come in to commit the offence.  The bathroom, where the 
offence had been committed, measures 5 ft. x 5 ft.  It was within the locked 
premises.  Only the septic tank was outside the premises, wherefrom the 
dead body of Barnali was recovered.
</p>
<p id="p_126">	There were two other small rooms.  One was urinal for the passengers.  
Another was the place of drinking water.  Both were on the two sides of the 
said bathroom.  Even the office room and the store room of the Net Work 
Travels were within the enclosed premises.  There was an office room of Air 
India.
</p>
<p id="p_127">	There were three buses, which were parked outside.  Only because six 
other persons were there in the bus, suspicion cannot be pointed out to them.  
</p>
<p id="p_128">	It is settled that the conviction can be based solely on circumstantial 
evidence, but it should be tested by the touchstone of law relating thereto as 
laid down by this Court in Hanumant Govind Nargundkar vs. State of 
M.P. [AIR 1952 SC 343].  {<a href="/doc/1505859/" id="a_49">See Sharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of 
Maharashtra</a> [(1984) 4 SCC 116].}

	In Hodge's case [168 ER 1136 at 1137], it was held :
</p>
<p id="p_129">	"Alderson, B., told the jury, that the case was 
made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they 
could find the prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, "not 
only that those circumstances were consistent with his 
having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied 
that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any 
other rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the 
guilty person."
</p><p id="p_130">	He then pointed out to them the proneness of the 
human mind to look for  and often slightly to distort the 
facts in order to establish such a proposition  forgetting 
that a single circumstance which is inconsistent with such 
a conclusion, is of more importance than all the rest, 
inasmuch as it destroys the hypothesis of guilt."
</p>
<p id="p_131">	Appellant No.1's involvement in the offence stands proved beyond all 
reasonable doubt.  Apart from his conduct, his confessional statement, which 
is admissible in evidence under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_50">Section 164</a> of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, is clear pointer to his guilt.  Appellant No.2's involvement is also 
proved.  Their conduct, in particular the conduct of the appellant No.1, as 
has been disclosed by the prosecution witnesses is admissible under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_51">Section 
8</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.  We are, therefore, satisfied that the appellants 
had rightly been found guilty of committing the offence. 
</p>
<p id="p_132">	The question which remains is as to what punishment should be 
awarded.  Ordinarily, this Court, having regard to the nature of the offence, 
would not have differed with the opinion of the learned Sessions Judge as 
also the High Court in this behalf, but it must be borne in mind that the 
appellants are convicted only on the basis of the circumstantial evidence.  
There are authorities for the proposition that if the evidence is proved by 
circumstantial evidence, ordinarily, death penalty would not be awarded.  
Moreover, the appellant No.1 showed his remorse and repentance even in his 
statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_52">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  He 
accepted his guilt.	 
</p>      
<p id="p_133">	<a href="/doc/1388203/" id="a_53">In State of Rajasthan vs. Kheraj Ram</a> [(2003) 8 SCC 224], this 
Court has stated the law thus : 
</p>
<p id="p_134">	"<a href="/doc/545301/" id="a_54">In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab</a> [(1983) 3 
SCC 470] it was observed: 
</p><p id="p_135">	The following questions may be asked and 
answered as a test to determine the 'rarest of the rare' case 
in which death sentence can be inflicted:
</p><p id="p_136">	(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime 
which renders sentence of imprisonment for life 
inadequate and calls for a death sentence?
</p><p id="p_137">	(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that 
there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even 
after according maximum weightage to the mitigating 
circumstances which speak in favour of the offender?  
(SCC p.489, para 39)
	The following guidelines which emerge from 
Bachan Singh case (supra) will have to be applied to the 
facts of each individual case where the question of 
imposition of death sentence arises:
</p><p id="p_138">	(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be 
inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability.
</p><p id="p_139">	(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the 
circumstances of the "offender" also require to be taken 
into consideration along with the circumstances of the 
"crime".
</p><p id="p_140">	(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death 
sentence is an exception. Death sentence must be 
imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an 
altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the 
relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and 
only provided, the option to impose sentence of 
imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously 
exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances 
of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.
</p><p id="p_141">	(iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the 
mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full 
weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the 
aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the 
option is exercised.  (SCC p.489, para 38)
	In rarest of rare cases when collective conscience 
of the community is so shocked that it will expect the 
holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death 
penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards 
desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty, death 
sentence can be awarded. The community may entertain 
such sentiment in the following circumstances:
	(1) When the murder is committed in an extremely 
brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly 
manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation 
of the community. (SCC pp. 487-88, paras 32-33)
	(2) When the murder is committed for a motive 
which evinces total depravity and meanness; e.g. murder 
by hired assassin for money or reward or a cold-blooded 
murder for gains of a person vis-`-vis whom the 
murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of 
trust, or murder is committed in the course for betrayal of 
the motherland. (SCC p.488, para 34)
	(3) When murder of a member of a Scheduled 
Caste or minority community etc., is committed not for 
personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse 
social wrath, or in cases of 'bride burning' or 'dowry 
deaths' or when murder is committed in order to remarry 
for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry 
another woman on account of infatuation. (SCC p.488, 
para 35)
	(4) When the crime is enormous in proportion. For 
instance when multiple murders, say of all or almost all 
the members of a family or a large number of persons of 
a particular caste, community, or locality, are committed. 
(SCC p.488, para 36)
	(5) When the victim of murder is an innocent 
child, or a helpless woman or an old or infirm person or a 
person vis-`-vis whom the murderer is in a dominating 
position or a public figure generally loved and respected 
by the community. (SCC pp.488-89, para 37)
	If upon taking an overall global view of all the 
circumstances in the light of the aforesaid propositions 
and taking into account the answers to the questions 
posed by way of the test for the rarest of rare cases, the 
circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is 
warranted, the court would proceed to do so. (SCC p.489, 
para 40)"

opined :
</p><p id="p_146">	"As regards the sentence of death imposed on five 
accused persons by the sessions court, which was 
confirmed by the appellate court, the counsel for the 
appellants, Shri Sushil Kumar submitted that in the 
absence of clear and convincing evidence regarding the 
complicity of the accused, these appellants could not be 
visited with the death penalty, while the counsel for the 
State submitted that this is a ghastly incident in which 
eight persons were done to death and the death penalty 
alone is the most appropriate punishment to be imposed. 
Though it is proved that there was an unlawful assembly 
and the common object of that unlawful assembly was to 
kill the deceased persons, there is another aspect of the 
matter inasmuch as there is no clear evidence by the use 
of whose fire-arm all the six deceased persons died as a 
result of firing in the bus. It is also pertinent to note that 
the investigating agency failed to produce clear and 
distinct evidence to prove the actual overt acts of each of 
the accused. The failure to examine the driver and 
conductor of the bus, the failure to seize the bus and the 
absence of a proper 'mahzar', are all lapses on the part of 
investigating agency. Moreover, the doctor who gave 
evidence before the court was not properly cross-
examined regarding the nature of the injuries. Some more 
details could have been collected as to how the incident 
might have happened inside the bus. These facts are 
pointed out to show that the firing may have been caused 
by the assailants even while they were still standing on 
the footboard of the bus and some of the appellants may 
not, in fact, have had an occasion to use the fire-arm, 
though they fully shared the common object of the 
unlawful assembly. Imposition of the death penalty on 
each of the five appellants may not be justified under 
such circumstances. We take this view in view of the 
peculiar circumstances of the case and it should not be 
understood to mean that the accused persons are not to be 
convicted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_57">Section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/1060179/" id="a_58">Section 149</a> and 
the death penalty cannot be imposed in the absence of 
various overt acts by individual accused persons. In view 
of the nature and circumstances of the case, we commute 
the death sentence imposed on A-1 Sahdeo, A-4 
Subhash, A-5 Chandraveer, A-7 Satyapal and A-10 
Parvinder to imprisonment for life."

<p id="p_147">	<a href="/doc/1542022/" id="a_59">In Raju vs. State of Haryana</a> [(2001) 9 SCC 50], it has been opined 
by this Court :
</p><p id="p_148">	"However, the next question is whether this would 
be a rarest of rare cases where extreme punishment of 
death is required to be imposed. In the present case, from 
the confessional statement made by the accused, it would 
appear that there was no intention on the part of the 
accused to commit the murder of the deceased child. He 
caused injury to the deceased by giving two brick blows 
as she stated that she would disclose the incident at her 
house. It is true that learned Sessions Judge committed 
error in recording the evidence of SI Shakuntala, PW 15 
with regard to the confessional statement made to her, 
but in any set of circumstances, the evidence on record 
discloses that the accused was not having an intention to 
commit the murder of the girl who accompanied him. On 
the spur of the moment without there being any 
premeditation, he gave two brick blows which caused her 
death. There is nothing on record to indicate that the 
appellant was having any criminal record nor can he be 
said to be a grave danger to the society at large. In these 
circumstances, it would be difficult to hold that the case 
of the appellant would be rarest of rare case justifying 
imposition of death penalty."

<p id="p_149">	Yet, recently in <a href="/doc/1834230/" id="a_60">Amrit Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> [2006 AIR SCW 
5712], this Court, in a case where the death was not found to have been 
intended to be caused, was of the opinion that no case under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_61">Section 302</a> of 
the Indian Penal Code was made out stating :
</p>
<p id="p_150">	"Imposition of death penalty in a case of this 
nature, in our opinion, was, thus, improper.  Even 
otherwise, it cannot be said to be a rarest of rare cases.  
The manner in which the deceased was raped may be 
brutal but it could have been a momentary lapse on the 
part of Appellant, seeing a lonely girl at a secluded place.  
He had no pre-meditation for commission of the offence.  
The offence may look a heinous, but under no 
circumstances, it can be said to be a rarest of rare cases."

392],  Rony vs. State of Maharashtra [(1998) 3 SCC 625], <a href="/doc/307021/" id="a_63">Bachan Singh 
vs. State of Punjab</a> [(1980) 2 SCC 684] and Machhi Singh (supra).}

	This aspect of the matter has recently been considered at some length 
by this Court in Aloke Nath Dutta (supra).
</p>


<p id="p_152">	There is another aspect of this matter which cannot be overlooked.  
Appellant No.1 made a confession.  He felt repentant not only while making 
the confessional statement before the Judicial Magistrate, but also before the 
learned Sessions Judge in his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_64">Section 313</a> of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure.  
</p>

<p id="p_153">	It is, therefore, in our opinion, not a case where extreme death penalty 
should be imposed.  We, therefore, are of the opinion that imposition of 
punishment of rigorous imprisonment for life shall meet the ends of justice.  
It is directed accordingly.  Both the appellants, therefore, are, instead of 
being awarded death penalty, are sentenced to undergo rigorous 
imprisonment for life, but other part of sentence imposed by the learned 
Sessions Judge are maintained. 
</p>

<p id="p_154">	Subject to the modification in the sentence mentioned hereinbefore, 
this appeal is dismissed.  
</p>


<p id="p_155">	We must, before parting, however, express our appreciation for Ms. 
Makhija who had rendered valuable assistance to us.
