HEADNOTE:
    The appellant/petitioner company--Good Year India Limit-
ed--a registered dealer both under the Haryana General Sales
Tax Act, 1973 and <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_9">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, 1956, was  manufac-
turing automobile tyres and tubes at Ballabgarh in the State
of  Haryana.  For  the said manufacturing  activity  it	 was
purchasing  various kinds of raw materials both	 within	 the
State and from outside the State of Haryana. The Company was
despatching these manufactured goods viz. tyres and tubes to
its  own  branches  and sales depots outside  the  State  of
Haryana.
    The	 assessing  authority  imposed	upon  the  appellant
company	 the  purchase tax under section 9  of	the  Haryana
General	 Sales Tax Act, 1973 in view of the despatches	made
by  it of the manufactured goods to its various depots	out-
side-the-State.
    The petitioner company filed writ petition in the Punjab
and  Haryana  High  Court challenging the  validity  of	 the
Notification  levying the tax. A Division Bench of the	High
Court  allowed the petition holding that disposal  of  goods
being  separate and 'distinct from despatch thereof, a	mere
despatch  of goods out Of the State by a dealer to  his	 own
branch while retaining both 'the title-and possession there-
of does not come within the ambit of the phrase "disposes of
the  manufactured goods in any manner otherwise than by	 way
of  sale",  as employed in <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_10">Section 9(i)(a)(ii)</a> of  the	Act.
Accordingly  the High Court set aside the assessment  orders
and  quashed  the impugned Notification as  ultra  vires  of
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_11">section 9</a> on the ground that whereas <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_12">Section 9</a> provided only
for the levy of purchase tax On the disposal of the manufac-
tured  goods, the impugned Notification makes mere  despatch
of  goods to the dealer themselves taxable. To override	 the
effect of the said judgment the Haryana Legislature  enacted
Haryana	 General  Sales Tax (Amendment and  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_13">Validation)	 Act</a>
1983  where by <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_14">Section 9</a> of the Act was amended with  retro-
spective effect to include within its sweep the despatch  of
manufactured  goods  to	 a place outside the  State  in	 any
manner otherwise than by way of sale. The impugned Notifica-
tion and the con-
513
sequential action taken thereunder were also validated.
    The petitioner company filed writ petitions	 challenging
the assessments. The High Court allowed the petitions  hold-
ing  section  9(1)(b) of the Haryana General Sales  Tax	 Act
1973 as amended by the Haryana General Sales Tax  (Amendment
and <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_15">Validation) Act</a>, 1983 in so far as it levied a  purchase
tax  on	 the consignment of goods outside the State  in	 the
course	of  inter-State	 trade or commerce  was	 beyond	 the
legislative competence of the State of Haryana and was	void
and  inoperative because it intruded and trespassed into  an
arena  exclusively meant for taxation by the Union of  India
under Entry 92-B of List I of the Seventh Schedule.  Accord-
ingly  the  High Court set aside the amended  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_16">section 9</a> as also the retrospective validation of the  Noti-
fication  and  the consequential validation of	all  actions
taken  thereunder. Against this decision of the High  Court,
State  of Haryana preferred Special Leave Petitions in	this
Court.
    During  the pendency of these Special  Leave  Petitions,
the assessing authority issued Show-cause notices asking the
petitioner  company  to show-cause why in  addition  to	 the
purchase  tax, it should not be liable to penalty  as  well.
The  Petitioner	 company again filed writ petitions  in	 the
Punjab	&amp;  Haryana High Court challenging  the	validity  of
these  notices.	 In the meantime a Full Bench  of  the	High
Court decided the question again and overruling the decision
of the earlier Division Bench held that the taxing event was
the  act  of  purchase and not the act of  despatch  of	 the
consignment.  The  Full Bench of the High  Court  held	that
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_17">section	 9(1)(b)</a>  as amended was neither invalid  nor  ultra
vires. Against the aforesaid judgment of the Full Bench	 the
Petitioner  Company filed appeals in this Court.  All  these
questions are the subject matters of these appeals.
    In the connected appeals, the Food Corporation of  India
was  procuring food-grains from the farmers through  commis-
sion  agents in tile mandis of Haryana and despatching	them
to its own branches in the deficit State of the country. The
Corporation branches in the recipient States were  supplying
these stocks to the State agencies/Fair Price Shops and were
also  paying tax as per the provisions of the Sales Tax	 law
of the respective States. Some of the stocks were distribut-
ed  within the State of Haryana for the public	distribution
system	for which sales tax was charged. and deposited	with
the  sales-tax depots as per the Haryana General  Sales	 Tax
Act,  1973. In respect of the inter-State despatch of  wheat
and  other food-grains by the Food Corporation of  India  to
its own branches tax was attracted at the time of despatch
514
under section 9(1)(c) of the Haryana Act. The Food  Corpora-
tion of India impugned the levy of tax.
    In	 the   other   connected   appeals   the   appellant
companies--Hindustan  Lever  Ltd. and  Wipro  Products--were
manufacturing  vanaspati, soaps, chemicals and	agro  chemi-
cals.  For  the	 said manufacturing  activities,  they	were
purchasing  non-essential vegetable oil (VNE oil) and  other
raw materials and were paying purchase tax @4% under section
3 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959. The VNE oil was  subse-
quently	 used by the appellant companies in the	 manufacture
of  vanaspati and soaps. The finished products	manufactured
by the appellant companies viz. vanaspati and soaps used  to
be  despatched	outside the State of  Maharashtra  to  their
clearing  and  forwarding agents.  The	assessing  authority
levied	additional purchase tax @ 2% under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_18">section 13-AA</a>  of
the Act on the purchase of said goods---VNE oil.
     The  appellant  companies filed writ petitions  in	 the
High Court challenging the orders of the assessing authority
levying	 the  additional  tax of 2% and also  the  vires  of
section 13-AA of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 under  which
the additional tax was levied, contending that the addition-
al  tax	 of 2% levied on raw materials, where  the  finished
goods  manufactured  therefrom were despatched	outside	 the
State  was  in the nature of consignment tax which  was	 not
within the legislative competence of the State Legislature.
    The	 High Court dismissed the petitions holding (i)	 the
additional  purchase tax levied under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_19">section 13-AA</a>  of	 the
Act  was on the purchase value of VNE oil used in the  manu-
facturing of goods transferred outside the State and not  on
the value of the manufactured goods so transferred; (ii) the
State Legislature was competent to levy the tax under  Entry
54 of the State List in the Seventh Schedule to the  Consti-
tution, and (iii) <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_20">Section 13-AA</a> was not violative of  either
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article 14</a> or <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_22">Article 301</a> of the Constitution of India.
    Against the decision of the High Court appellant  compa-
nies filed appeal in this Court.
Disposing of the matters, this Court,
HELD: (Per Mukharji, J.)
1. Analysing section 9 of the Haryana General Sales Tax Act,
515
1973  it is clear that the two conditions specified,  before
the  event  of despatch outside the State  as  mentioned  in
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_23">section 9(1)(b)</a>, namely, (i) purchase of goods in the  State
and  (ii) using them for the manufacture of any other  goods
in  the State, are only descriptive of the goods  liable  to
tax  under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_24">Section 9(1)(b)</a> in the event of despatch  outside
the State. If the goods do not answer both the	descriptions
cumulatively,  even though these are despatched outside	 the
State  of Haryana, the purchase of those goods would not  be
put  to tax under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_25">Section 9(1)(b)</a>. The liability to pay	 tax
under  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_26">section	9(1)(b)</a> does not accrue	 on  purchasing	 the
goods  simpliciter,  but only when these are  despatched  or
consigned  out of the State of Haryana. The  section  itself
does  not provide for imposition of the purchase tax on	 the
transaction  of purchase of the taxable goods but when	fur-
ther  the  said taxable goods are used up  and	turned	into
independent taxable goods, losing its original identity, and
thereafter  when the manufactured goods are despatched	out-
side  the State' of Haryana and only then tax is levied	 and
liability to pay tax is created. It is the cumulative effect
of  that event which occasions or causes the tax to  be	 im-
posed. [539F-H; 540A-B]
   1.1	A taxable event is that which is closely related  to
imposition.  In	 the instant section  viz.  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_27">section  9(1)(b)</a>
there  is  such close relationship only with  despatch.	 The
goods  purchased are used in manufacture of new	 independent
commodity  and	thereafter the said manufactured  goods	 are
despatched  outside the State of Haryana. In this series  of
transactions the original transaction is completely eclipsed
or  cease  to exist when the levy is imposed  at  the  third
stage  of  despatch of manufacture. The levy has  no  direct
connection  with the transaction of purchase of	 raw-materi-
als,  it has only a remote connection of lineage.  The	mere
consignment  of goods by a manufacturer to his own  branches
outside	 the State does not in any way amount to a  sale  or
disposal  of the goods as such. The consignment or  despatch
of  goods is neither a sale nor a purchase. The tax  imposed
under  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_28">Section	9(1)(b)</a>	 is a tax on despatch.	The  tax  on
despatch  of goods outside the territory of the	 State	cer-
tainly is in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and
amounts	 to  imposition of consignment tax,  and  hence	 the
latter	part  of <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_29">section 9(1)(b)</a> is ultra  vires  and  void.

    1.2	 The effect of the Constitution (Forty-sixth  Amend-
ment)  Act, 1982 is that the field of taxation on  the	con-
signment/despatch  of  goods in the  course  of	 inter-State
trade or commerce expressly comes within the purview of	 the
legislative competence of the Parliament. [543H]
    2.	If <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_39">section 9(1)(b)</a> is ultra vires, the penalty	pro-

consequent proceedings flowing therefrom. [545B]
    3.	Section 24(3) of the Haryana General Sales Tax	Act,
1973 without making any change in the substantive  provision
purports  to  give a direction to ignore  the  judgments  in
Goodyear and Bata India Ltd. cases. This provision is  void.

(Law)  Board of Revenue (Taxes) v. M/s Thomas Stephen &amp;	 Co.
Ltd. Quilon</a>, [1988] 2 SCC 264, followed.
    4. In respect of inter-State despatch of wheat and other
food grains by Food Corporation of India to its own  branch-
es,  tax is attracted at the time of despatch under  Section
9(1)(c)	 of the Haryana Act. <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_43">Section 9</a> is the charging	sec-
tion for taxation in case where the goods are purchased	 for
export. There is no other provision for levy of purchase  or
sales tax in such cases of export. [547B]
    4.1 No tax is payable under the Haryana Act when exports
outside the State take place either in the course of  inter-
State sale or export out of the territory of India. But	 the
tax is payable for sale in the course
517
of  inter-State	 trade and commerce i.e. under	the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_44">Central
Sales	Tax   Act</a>.   It	 is  only   when   the	 goods	 are
despatched/consigned  to  the  depots of the  FCI  in  other
States	that  tax is levied under section 9 of	the  Haryana
Act. This is in addition to the sales tax paid by the FCI on
the  sale  of  grains in the recipient States.	In  view  of
<a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_45">sections  14</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_46">15</a> of the Central Sales Tax Act,	 it  becomes
clear  that  wheat is one of the  commodities  specified  as
'declared  goods' and in respect of which the  intention  is
clear  that  the tax is payable only once  on  the  declared
goods.	In the case of inter-State sale if any tax has	been
paid earlier on declared goods inside the State the same  is
to  be	refunded  to the dealer who is paying  tax  on	such
inter-State Sales. On these transactions no tax is liable in
the recipient State, while in case of inter-State  despatch-
es, the tax is leviable twice. <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_47">Section 9(1)(c)</a>, which  inso-
far  as it purports to tax, exports, is beyond the  legisla-
tive competence of the State of Haryana. [547E-G]
    5.	The incidence of the levy of additional tax  of	 two
paise  in the rupee under Section 13-AA of the Bombay  Sales
Tax  Act, 1959 is not on the purchase of goods, but  such  a
levy  is  attracted only when--(a) the goods which  so	pur-
chased	on payment of purchase tax are used in the  manufac-
ture of taxable goods; and (b) the goods so manufactured are
despatched  to his own place of business or to	his  agent's
place  of business outside the State. Therefore,  the  inci-
dence  of  tax is attracted not merely on the  purchase	 but
only when the goods so purchased are used in the manufacture
of  taxable goods and are despatched outside the State.	 The
incidence  of additional tax has no nexus with the  purchase
of the raw-materials. [553A-B; D]
    5.1 Purchase tax under <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_48">section 3</a> of the Act is attracted
when the taxable event i.e. the purchase of goods occurs but
the  taxable event for the imposition of additional  tax  of
two  paise in the rupee occurs only when the goods  so	pur-
chased are used in the manufacture of taxable goods and such
taxable	 goods are despatched outside the State by a  dealer
manufacturer.  The goods which are despatched are  different
products  from the goods on the purchase of  which  purchase
tax  was  paid. It is therefore not possible to	 accept	 the
argument that the chargeable event was lying dormant and  is
activated  only on the occurrence of the event of  despatch.
[553E; 556F; 557C]
    5.2	 The charging event is the event the  occurrence  of
which immediately attracts the charge. Taxable event  cannot
be postponed to the occurrence of the subsequent  condition.
In  that  event, it would be the  subsequent  condition	 the
occurrence  of which would attract the Charge which will  be
taxable event. Therefore the charge under
518
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_49">section 13-AA</a> is a duty on despatch. Accordingly this charge
can not be sustained.[557D]

tantamount per se to any infringement of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_58">Article 301</a> of	 the
Constitution.  Only such restrictions or  impediments  which

ately restrict or hamper the flow of trade. but every  impo-
sition	of tax does not do so. Every case must be judged  on
its own facts and its own setting of time and circumstances.

material  whether  or not there is an  infringement  of	 the
guarantee  under  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_60">Article  301</a> the further  question  as  to
whether	 the Statute is saved under <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_61">Article 304(b)</a> does	 not

    6.	The provisions of constitutional changes have to  be
construed  not in a narrow isolationism but on a much  wider
spectrum  and the principles laid down in Heydon's case	 are
instructive. [529H; 530A]

    7. In construing the expressions of the Constitution  to
judge  whether	the provisions of a statute are	 within	 the
competence  of the State Legislature, one must bear in	mind
that the Constitution is to be construed not in a narrow  or
pedantic  sense. The Constitution is not to be construed  as
mere law but as the machinery by which laws are to be  made.

    8. The nomenclature of the Act is not conclusive and for
determining  the true character and nature of  a  particular
tax,  with  reference  to the legislative  competence  of  a
particular  Legislature, the Court will look into  its	pith
and substance. [543H; 544A]

    9.	The doctrine of pith and substance means that if  an
enactment  substantially  falls within the  power  expressly
conferred  by  the Constitution upon the  Legislature  which
enacted	 it, it cannot be held to be invalid merely  because
it incidentally encroaches upon matters assigned to  another
legislature. [555H; 556A]

9.1 The true test to find out what is pith and substance  of
the
520
legislation is to ascertain the true intent of the Act which
will determine the validity of the Act. [577B]
    10.	 There	are three stages in the imposition  of	tax.
There  is the declaration of liability, that is the part  of
the Statute which determines what persons in respect of what
property are liable. Next, there is the assessment- Liabili-
ty  does  not  depend on assessment,  that  exhypothesi	 has
already been fixed. But assessment particularises the  exact
sum which a person is liable to pay. Lastly comes the method
of  recovery if the person taxed does not  voluntarily	pay.

ard  or	 the  measure on which the tax is levied  may  be  a
relevant consideration, it is not the conclusive  considera-
tion. [556C]

     12.  The  liability  to tax would	be  determined	with
reference to the interpretation of the Statute which creates
it. It cannot be determined by referring to another Statute.
[555G]
     13. In fiscal legislations normally a charge is  creat-
ed. The. mischief of taxation occurs on the happening of the
taxable	 event.	 Different  taxes  have	 different   taxable
events. A taxing event is that event the occurrence of which
immediately attracts the levy or the charge of tax. What  is
the taxable event or what necessitates taxation in an appro-
priate	Statute must be found by construing the	 provisions.
The  main test for determining the taxable event is that  on
the  happening of which the charge is affixed. [552H;  553A:
552G: 533E; 539B]
     14.  Fiscal laws must be strictly construed. n  is	 not
permissible to make assumptions and presumptions in a fiscal
provision. [536H; 538G]

ly  decides and not for what may remotely or even  logically

(Per Ranganathan, J.) (Concurring)
    1. Section 9 of the Haryana General Sales Tax Act,	1973
as  well as section 13-AA of the Bombay Sales Tax Act,	1959
purport	 only  to  levy a purchase tax.	 The  tax,  however,
becomes	 exigible not on the occasion or event	of  purchase
but  only later. It materialises only if the  purchaser	 (a)
utilises  the goods purchased in the manufacture of  taxable
goods, and (b) despatches the goods so manufactured  (other-
wise  then by way of sale) to a place of  business  situated
outside	 the State. The legislation, however, is careful  to
impose the tax only on the price at which the raw  materials
are purchased and not on the value of the manufactured goods
consigned outside the State. [559G-H; 560A]
     2.	 It  is one thing to levy a purchase tax  where	 the
character and class of goods in respect of which the tax  is
levied	is described in a particular manner and a case	like
the present where the tax, though described as purchase tax,
actually becomes effective with reference to
522
a  totally different class of goods and, that too,  only  on
the  happening of an event which is unrelated to the act  of
purchase. [560D-E]
    2.1 The "taxable event", if one might use the expression
often used in this context, is the consignment of the  manu-
factured goods and not the purchase. [560E]
    2.2	 The background of the	Constitutional	(Forty-sixth
Amendment)  indicates that there were efforts at  sales	 tax
avoidance  by sending goods manufactured in a State  out  of
raw  materials	purchased inside to other States by  way  of
consignments  rather  than by way of sales  attracting	tax.
This  situation	 lends	force to the view  that	 the  State,
unable to tax the exodus directly, attempted to do so  indi-
rectly by linking the levy ostensibly to the "purchases"  in
the State. [560G-H]

</p><p id="p_5">    The	  appellant/petitioner--Goodyear  India	 Ltd.,	 was
engaged	 at all relevant times, inter alia, in the  manufac-
ture and sale of automobile tyres and tubes. It manufactured
the  said tyres and tubes at its factory at  Ballabhgarh  in
the  district of Faridabad in the State of Haryana. For	 the
said manufacturing activity the appellant had, from time  to
time, to purchase various kinds of raw-materials both within
the  State and outside the State. It is stated that about  7
to  10% of the total needs of raw-materials on an all  India
basis  were locally procured by the appellant  from  Haryana
itself.	 The  raw-materials purchased in Haryana  were:	 (i)
pigments  (partly),  (ii) chemicals  (partly),	(iii)  wires
(partly),  (iv) carbon black (partly), (v) rubber  (partly),
and (vi) fabric (partly). The rest of the requirements	were
imported from other States. The appellant had its depots  at
different places in the State of Haryana as well as in other
States. After manufacturing the said tyres and tubes,  about
10 to 12% of the total manufactured products used to be sold
in  the State of Haryana either locally or in the course  of
inter-State  trade  &amp; commerce or in the  course  of  export
outside	 the country and also sold locally against  Declara-
tion Form No. ST-15. It was stated that at the relevant time
the local sales including sales in the course of inter-State
trade &amp; commerce and in the course of export from the  State
of  Haryana was about 30 to 35%. The appellant was a  regis-
tered  dealer  both under the Haryana Act  and	the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_84">Central
Sales Tax Act</a>, and had been submitting its quarterly returns
and  paying the sales-tax in accordance with law,  according
to the appellant. In 1979, the assessing authority,  Farida-
bad, imposed upon the appellant the purchase tax under	Sec-
tion 9 of the Act for the assessment year 1973-74 and subse-
quently	 for  the years 1974-75 and 1975-76 as well  on	 the
despatches  made by the appellant on the manufactured  goods
to  its various depots outside the State. Subsequently,	 the
relevant  revenue authorities sought to impose purchase	 tax
under  <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_85">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act and imposed purchase  tax  on
despatches  of manufactured goods, namely, tyres and  tubes,
to  its	 various  depots in other States. This	led  to	 the
filing	of  various writ petitions in the Punjab  &amp;  Haryana
High Court by the appellant/petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">    In	respect of the assessment years 1976-77 to  1979-80.
these  questions were considered by the Punjab	and  Haryana
High  Court, and the writ. petitions were decided in  favour
of the appellant on December
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">524</span>
4,  1982. The said decision being the decision	in  <a href="/doc/1108536/" id="a_86">Goodyear
India Ltd. v. The State of Haryana &amp; Anr</a>. is reported in  53
STC  163. The Division Bench of the High Court in  the	said
decision  held that both on principle and precedent, a	mere
despatch  of goods out of the State by a dealer to  his	 own
branch	while retaining both title and	possession  thereof,
does  not come within the ambit of the phrase  "disposes  of
the  manufactured goods in any manner otherwise than by	 way
of sale", as employed in <a href="/doc/160776494/" id="a_87">section 9(1)(a)(ii)</a> of the Act. The
High  Court further held that the decision of this Court  in
<a href="/doc/1863875/" id="a_88">The  State of Tamil Nadu v. M.K. Kandaswami</a>, [1975]  36	 STC
191 was no warrant for the proposition that a mere  despatch
of goods was within the ambit of disposing them of. The High
Court  also  distinguished  the decision of  this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/620315/" id="a_89">Ganesh	Prasad	Dixit v. Commissioner of  Sales	 Tax,  M.P</a>.,
[1969]	24  STC	 343, and held that  Notification  No.	S.O.
119/H.A.  20/73/Ss.  9 &amp; 15/74 dated July  19,	1974  issued
under  <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_90">Section	9</a> (prior to its amendment by Act No.  11  of
1979)  was ultra vires of <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_91">Section 9</a> of the Act. It was	held
that  whereas  the  section provided only for  the  levy  of
purchase  tax  on the disposal of  manufactured	 goods,	 the
impugned notification by making a mere despatch of goods  to
the  dealers themselves taxable, in essence, legislates	 and
imposes	 a substantive tax which it obviously could not.  It
was held that this was contrary to and in conflict with	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_92">section 9</a>. The High Court  referred  to	 the
relevant  portion  of unamended <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_93">Section 9</a> of  the  Act	with
which  it was confronted and the notification. In  order  to
appreciate  the said decision and the position, it  will  be
appropriate  to	 set out the said  provisions,	namely,	 the

<p id="p_7">    The High Court, as stated before, referred to <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_100">section  9</a>
and held that the expression 'disposes of' was not basically
a term of legal art and, therefore, it was proper and neces-
sary to first turn to its ordinary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">526</span>
meaning	 in  order to determine whether a mere	despatch  of
goods  by  a dealer to himself would connote  'disposal	 of'
such goods by him. The High Court referred to the dictionary
meaning of 'disposes of' in Webster's Third New Internation-
al  Dictionary. Reference was also made to 27  Corpus  Juris
Secundum,  P. 345, and ultimately it came to the  conclusion
that the phrase 'disposes of' or 'disposal' cannot be possi-
bly  equated with the mere despatch of goods by a dealer  to
himself.  After	 referring to the relevant  provisions	with
which this Court was concerned in Kandaswami's case (supra),
the  High Court held that that case was no warrant for	con-
struing the expression 'despatch' as synonymous to  'dispos-
al'. On the other hand, the court held that the decision  of
this  Court  emphasises that the  expression  'disposal'  of
goods  is separate and distinct from despatch  thereof.	 Ac-
cording to the High Court, the same position was  applicable
to Ganesh Prasad Dixit's case (supra), and in those  circum-
stances	 held that the term 'disposes of' cannot be  synony-
mous with 'disposal', and once that is held then the notifi-
cation mentioned above travelled far beyond what is provided
in  <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_101">Section 9</a> of the Act, while the said provision  provided
only  for levy of purchase tax on disposal  of	manufactured
goods.
</p><p id="p_8">	      The High Court observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_9">			"Once  it  is  held  as	 above,	 the
	      impugned	 Notification  No.   S.O.   119/H.A.
</p><p id="p_10">	      20/73/Ss.	 9 and 15/74 dated 19th	 July,	1974
	      (annexure P-2), plainly travels far beyond the
	      parent <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_102">section 9</a> of the Act. Whereas the	said
	      provision	 provided  only for the	 levy  of  a
	      purchase	tax on the disposal of	manufactured
	      goods,  the  notification	 by  making  a	mere
	      despatch	of goods to the	 dealers  themselves
	      taxable  in essence, legislates and imposes  a
	      substantive  tax	which it  obviously  cannot.

</p><p id="p_11">    The	 High  Court also noted that though  the  challenged
assessment orders were appealable, however, as the challenge
was  to	 the  very validity of the  notification  which	 was
obviously  beyond the scope of the appellate authority,	 the
writ  petitions	 were entertainable as	the  assessment	 was
based on the notification which was frontally challenged. As
a  result, the High Court quashed the notification  and	 set
aside  the  assessment orders. The said	 decision  is  under
challenge in appeal to this Court.

<p id="p_13">    After  the aforesaid amendment the writ  petitions	were
filed in the High Court by Bata India Ltd. In the  meantime,
the  petitioner	 Company also filed writ petitions  for	 the
assessment years 1973-74 to 1975-76 and 1980-81 in the	High
Court  challenging  the assessment. The High  Court  decided
these  matters	on August 2, 1983. The	said  decision	<a href="/doc/1583174/" id="a_112">Bata
India Ltd. v. The State of Haryana &amp; Anr</a>. has been  reported
in  1983  Vol. 54 STC 226. The High Court  held	 that  "mere
despatch of goods to a place outside the State in any manner
otherwise  than by way of sale in the course of	 inter-State
trade  or  commerce" is synonymous with or is  in  any	case
included within the ambit of the consignment of goods either
to the person making it or to any other person in the course
of  inter-State	 trade or commerce as specified	 in  <a href="/doc/732111/" id="a_113">Article
269(1)(h)</a>  and Entry No. 92-B of List 1 of the 7th  Schedule
to  the Constitution. Hence, the levy of sales	or  purchase
tax  on such a despatch or consignment of goods and  matters
ancillary  or subsidiary thereto, will be within the  exclu-
sive  legislative  competence  of Parliament  to  the  total
exclusion  of  the  State  Legislature.	 Therefore,  section
9(1)(b)	 of  the  Haryana General Sales Tax  Act,  1973,  as
amended by the Haryana General Sales Tax (Amendment &amp;  Vali-
dation)	 Act, 1983, insofar as it levies a purchase  tax  on
the consignment of goods outside the State in the course  of
inter-State  trade  or commerce is  beyond  the	 legislative
competence of the State of Haryana and is void and  inopera-
tive.  It was held that the retrospective validation of	 the
notification  of 19th July, 1974 referred  to  hereinbefore,
and the consequential validation of all actions taken there-
under were liable to be quashed. The High Court further held
that  mere manufacture and consignment of goods outside	 the
State  to himself by a manufacturer is not sale or  disposal
thereof with the result that it will not be within the ambit
of  Entry No. 54 of List II of the 7th Schedule to the	Con-
stitution.  Consequently, it was held that  irrespective  of
the  46th Amendment, an attempt to tax the mere	 consignment
or  despatch of manufactured goods outside the State in	 the
course of inter-State trade
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">529</span>
or  commerce will not come within the ambit of Entry No.  54
of  List  II of the 7th Schedule, and  consequently  of	 the
competence of the respective State Legislatures. Even before
the  46th  Amendment, the mere consignment of goods  in	 the
course of inter-State trade or commerce was beyond the scope
of the said Entry and thus not within the legislative compe-
tence  of the States and was entirely within the  parliamen-
tary field of. legislation by .virtue of <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_114">Article 248</a> and the
residuary Entry No. 97 of List I.
</p><p id="p_14">    The High Court was of the view that neither the original
purchase of goods nor the manufacture thereof into the	end-
product by itself attracts purchase tax and consequently are
not  even  remotely the taxable events.	 What  directly	 and
pristinely attracts the tax and can be truly labelled as the
taxing event under <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_115">section 9(1)(b)</a> of the Act is the  three-
fold exigency of; (i) disposal of the manufactured goods  in
any  manner otherwise than by way of sale in the  State;  or
</p><p id="p_15">(ii)  despatch of the manufactured goods to a place  outside
the State in any manner otherwise than by way of sale in the
course of inter--State trade or commerce, or (iii)  disposal
or  despatch  of  the manufactured goods in  the  course  of
export	outside the territory of India. It was	these  three
exigencies only which were the taxable events in the amended
<a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_116">section 9(1)(b)</a> of the Act. Consequently, in a Statute where
the  taxable event is the despatch or consignment  of  goods
outside	 the State, the same would come squarely within	 the
wide  sweep of Entry No. 92B of List I of the  Constitution,
and thus excludes taxation by the States.
</p><p id="p_16">    The High Court was of the view that <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_117">section 9</a> of the Act
must be strictly construed as it was a charging section.  If
the  charging section travels beyond the  legislative  Entry
and  thereby  transgresses the legislative field,  then	 the
same  cannot  possibly	be  sustained.	The   constitutional
changes	 brought  by the 46th Amendment in <a href="/doc/1135479/" id="a_118">Art. 269</a>  of	 the
Constitution read with the insertion of Entry No. 92B in the
Union List, leave no doubt that the legislative arena of tax
on the consignment of goods (whether to one's ownself or  to
any  other  person) in the course of  inter-State  trade  or
commerce and all ancillary or complementary or consequential
matters,  are  now declared to be exclusively  reserved	 for
parliamentary legislation and any intrusion into this  field
by the State Legislatures would be barred.
</p><p id="p_17">    In	my  opinion, the High Court correctly noted  in	 the
said  decision that the provisions of constitutional  change
have to be construed, and such problems should not be viewed
in narrow isolationism but on a much wider. spectrum and the
principles laid down in Heydon's case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">530</span>
1584 3 Co. Rep 7a are instructive. Hence, in a situation  of
this  nature,  it was just and proper to see  what  was	 the
position before the 46th Amendment of the Constitution,	 and
find  out what was the mischief that was sought to be  reme-
died and then discover the true rationale for such a remedy.
In Black-Clawson International Ltd. v. Papierwerke  Waldhof-
Aschaffenburg  Ag., [1975] 1 All ER 810, Lord Reid  observed
as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	      "One must first read the words in the  context
	      of the Act as a whole, but one is entitled  to
	      go beyond that. The general rule in construing
	      any  document is that one should	put  oneself
	      'in the shoes' of the maker or makers and take
	      into account relevant facts known to them when
	      the document was made. The same must apply  to
	      Acts  of Parliament subject to one  qualifica-
	      tion.  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_119">An Act</a> is addressed to all	 the  lieges
	      and  it would seem wrong to take into  account
	      anything that was not public knowledge at	 the
	      time. That may be common knowledge at the time
	      or it may be some published information  which
	      Parliament  can  be presumed to  have  had  in
	      mind.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">			It has always been said to be impor-
	      tant  to consider the mischief which  the	 Act
	      was  apparently intended to remedy.  The	word
	      'mischief'  is traditional. I would expand  it
	      in  this way. In addition to reading  the	 Act
	      you look at the facts presumed to be known  to
	      Parliament when the Bill which became the	 Act
	      in  question was before it, and  you  consider
	      whether there is disclosed some unsatisfactory
	      state of affairs which Parliament can properly
	      be supposed to have intended to remedy by	 the
	      Act  ...."</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">    The	 state of affairs that the Parliament has sought  to
remedy	by the 46th Amendment of the Constitution, was	that
prior  to the promulgation each State attempted	 to  subject
the same transaction to tax on the nexus doctrine under	 its
sales  tax  laws. Consequently, on the basis of one  or	 the
other element of the territorial nexus, the same transaction
had  to suffer tax in different States with  the  inevitable
hardship  to  trade and consumers in the same  or  different
States. The framers of the Constitution being fully aware of
the problems sought to check the same by a somewhat  complex
constitutional	scheme and by imposing restrictions  on	 the
States'	 power with regard to levy tax on the sale  or	pur-
chase  of goods under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_120">Art. 286.</a> The High Court in the  judg-
ment  referred to hereinbefore, mentioned these factors.  It
is in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">531</span>
this background that <a href="/doc/1135479/" id="a_121">Art. 269</a> was amended and clause (3) was
added  to it. The effect, inter alia, is that the  power  to
levy  tax on the sale or purchase of goods is now  referable
to  the legislative power vested in the States by virtue  of
Entry  No. 54 in List II of the 7th Schedule. However,	this
legislative  authority of the States is restricted by  three
limitations  contained	in Articles 286(1)(a),	286(1)(b)  &amp;
286(3) of the Constitution. It may be mentioned that Parlia-
ment  by the 6th Amendment to the Constitution, enacted	 the
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_122">Central	 Sales Tax Act</a>, 1956, with the object  to  formulate
principles for determining when a sale or purchase of  goods
takes  place in the course of inter-State trade or  commerce
or outside a State or in the course of import into or export
from India, to provide for the levy, collection and  distri-
bution	of taxes on sales of goods in the course  of  inter-
State  trade or commerce and to declare certain goods to  be
of  special  importance	 and specify  the  restrictions	 and
conditions to which State laws imposing taxes on the sale or
purchase of such goods shall be subject. In this connection,
the  High  Court  referred to the  various  propositions  as
mentioned by the Law Commission in its 61st Report  rendered
in  May,  1974. It is not necessary to set out the  same  in
detail.	 It was in the aforesaid historical background	that
the High Court construed the provisions in question and came
to the conclusion that a plain reading of these would  leave
little	manner	of doubt that the legislative power  to	 tax
consignment transfers of goods from one branch of an  insti-
tution	to another branch thereof outside the State and	 all
matters incidental, ancillary or complementary thereto	were
then  declared	to be vested in the Union of  India  to	 the
total  exclusion of the States. The High Court	referred  to
the observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/668225/" id="a_123">Khyerbari Tea Co. Ltd.  v.
State  of Assam</a>, AIR 1964 SC 925; <a href="/doc/1126318/" id="a_124">Navinchandra	Mafatlal  v.
The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City</a>, [1955] SCR	 829
and  <a href="/doc/228570/" id="a_125">Waverly  Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. Raymon &amp; Co</a>.  (1)	Pvt.
Ltd., [1963] 3 SCR 209, and concluded that Entry 92B enabled
the Union of India not only to tax the consignment of  goods
in  the	 strict sense but also embraced	 all  ancillary	 and
complementary  areas as well to the exclusion of  the  State
Legislature therefrom. In the aforesaid light the High Court
construed  section 9(1)(b) of the Haryana Act, 1983.  Analy-
sing the provisions in detail it observed that <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_126">Section 9</a>  of
the Act was a charging section for the levy of purchase tax.
It imposed liability for payment of purchase tax, therefore,
it  should be distinguished from the machinery section.	 The
High Court examined the real nature of the business  outside
the  State and found that there was merely a change  in	 the
physical situs of the goods without any change in the  basic
incidents  of ownership and control. Therefore, in its	true
nature a mere despatch of goods outside the State to another
branch of the original institution is not and never
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">532</span>
can  be the equivalent of a sale either as a term of art  in
the  existing sales tax legislation and not remotely  so  in
common parlance, and construing <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_127">section 9(1)(b)</a> of the	Act,
the High Court was of the view that the real taxing event is
the  despatch of the manufactured goods to a  place  outside
the,  State in any manner otherwise than by way of  sale  in
the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
    The	 High  Court  found that there	was  no	 distinction
between the despatch as defined in the said amended  section
and the consignment of goods by the manufacturer to  himself
or  any other person in the course of inter-State  trade  or
commerce,  and referred to the meanings of  the	 expressions
'despatch'  and	 'consign',  which are	similar	 and  almost
interchangeable when used in specific commercial sense.	 The
High Court referred to Webster's New International  Diction-
ary,  Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and also  to  Random
House  dictionary for their meanings. On  construction,	 the
High  Court came to the conclusion that the  amended  provi-
sions  of  <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_128">section  9(1)(b)</a> of the Act attempt	to  levy  an
identical  tax	in  the garb of a levy on  the	despatch  of
manufactured  goods to places outside the State of  Haryana,
and  therefore intruded and trespassed into an arena  exclu-
sively	meant for taxation by the Union of India.  The	High
Court  also viewed from another point of view,	namely,	 who
was liable as it was the consignment of goods which attract-
ed the liability of purchase tax and in pristine essence was
the  "taxable event" under <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_129">section 9(1)(b)</a> of the  Act.	 The
High  Court  also analysed it from the point  of  view	that
under  <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_130">section 9(1)(b)</a>, where a dealer purchases  goods	 for
the express purpose of manufacturing other goods within	 the
State, then in strict sense such purchase by itself did	 not
attract any tax under the provisions. Hence, the High  Court
set aside the amended provision so far as it sought to	levy
purchase  tax on the consignment of goods outside the  State
in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, consequently
it also set aside the retrospective validation of the  noti-
fication  and  the consequential validation of	all  actions
taken thereunder. Special leave petitions were filed in this
Court against the said decision of the High Court. These are
special	 leave petitions Nos. 8397 to 8402 of  1983.  During
the  pendency  of the special leave  petitions,	 show  cause
notices were issued by the assessing authority in respect of
the assessment years 1973-74 to 1980-81 (except for  1978-79
&amp;  1979-80)  and also for 1982-83 asking the  petitioner  to
show cause why in addition to purchase-tax, it should not be
liable	to  penalty as well.  The  petitioner-Company  again
filed  writ petitions in Punjab &amp; Haryana High	Court  chal-
lenging	 the validity of those notices. It appears  that  in
the  meantime,	a Full Bench of the High Court	decided	 the
question again in the case of <a href="/doc/241840/" id="a_131">Des Raj Pushap
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">533</span>

was rendered on January 24, 1985, and is reported in 58	 STC
</p><p id="p_19">393. The assessment years involved in all appeals are  1973-
74 to 1982-83. According to the Full Bench, the taxing event
is  the act of purchase and not the Act of despatch or	con-
signment  as held in Bata India Ltd., (supra). In the  prem-
ises,  it  was	held that <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_132">section 9(1)(b)</a>  as  amended,	 was
neither	 invalid nor ultra vires and overruled the  decision
of  Bata India Ltd. The writ petitions filed were also	dis-
missed.
</p><p id="p_20">    The	 petitioner-Company  filed special  leave  petitions
against the aforesaid judgment of the Punjab &amp; Haryana	High
Court which were admitted in Civil Appeals Nos.	 1166-72/85.
Goodyear India also filed writ petition No. 3834 of 1985  in
respect	 of the assessment year 1981-82, as the notices	 for
assessment  and penalty were received after the decision  of
Punjab	&amp; Haryana High Court in Des Raj Pushap Kumar's	case
(supra). The said decision was passed in appeal against	 the
decision of the said court in Goodyear India reported in  53
STC 163, number being 1514 (NT) of 1984. All these questions
are the subjectmatters of these appeals.
</p><p id="p_21">    It	is  well-settled that what is the taxable  event  or
what  necessitates taxation in an appropriate Statute,	must
be  found  out by construing the provisions.  The  essential
task  is to find out what is the taxable event. In  what  is
considered to be indirect tax, there is a marked distinction
between	 the consequence of manufacture and the	 consequence
of sale.
</p><p id="p_22">    It	is well to remember that in construing	the  expres-
sions  of the Constitution to judge whether  the  provisions
like  <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_133">Section 9(1)(b)</a> of the Act, are within the  competence
of  the	 State Legislature, one must bear in mind  that	 the
Constitution is to be construed not in a narrow or  pedantic
sense.	Constitution is not to be construed as mere law	 but
as  the machinery by which laws are to be made. It  was	 ob-
served by Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth of Australia,
[1936]	AC  578 at 614, that the rules which  apply  to	 the
interpretation of other Statutes, however, apply equally  to
the  interpretation of a constitutional enactment.  In	this
context,  Lord	Wright referred to the observations  of	 the
Australian High Court in The Attorney-General for the  State
of  New	 South Wales v. The Brewery  Employees	Union  etc.,
[1908] 6 CLR 469 where it was observed that the words of the
Constitution  must be interpreted on the same principles  as
any ordinary law, and these principles compel us to consider
the  nature and scope of the Act, and to remember  that	 the
Constitution is a mechanism under which laws
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">534</span>
are  to be made, and not a mere Act which declares what	 the
law  is to be. Hence, such mechanism should  be	 interpreted
broadly,  bearing  in mind in appropriate  cases,  that	 the
Supreme Court like ours is a nice balance of  jurisdictions.
A  Constitutional  Court, one must bear in  mind,  will	 not
strengthen, but only derogate from its position if it  seeks
to  do	anything  but declare the law; but  it	may  rightly
reflect	 that a Constitution is a living and organic  thing,
which  of all instruments has the greatest claim to be	con-
strued broadly and liberally. See the observations of Gwyer,
C.J. in Re: Central Provinces &amp; Berar Sales of Motor  Spirit
and Lubricants Taxation Act, 1938, AIR 1939 PC 1 at 4).	 Mr.
Justice	 Sulaiman  in his judgment at p. 22  of	 the  report
observed  that the power to tax the sale of goods  is  quite
distinct  from any right to impose taxes on use or  consump-
tion. It cannot be exercised at the earlier stage of produc-
tion nor at the later stage of use or consumption, but	only
at the stage of sale, (emphasis supplied). The essence of  a
tax  on goods manufactured or produced is that the right  to
levy it accrues by virtue of their manufacture. On the other
hand,  a duty on the sale of goods cannot be  levied  merely
because goods have been manufactured or produced. Nor can it
be  levied  merely because the goods have been	consumed  or
used or even destroyed. The right to levy the duty would not
at  all come into existence before the time of the sale.  In
this  connection, reference may be made to the	observations
of  Chief  Justice Gwyer in <a href="/doc/882976/" id="a_134">The Province of Madras  v.	M/s.
Boddu Paidanna &amp; Sons</a>, AIR 1942 FC 33.
</p><p id="p_23">    Mr	 Raja	Ram  Agarwala,	learned	 counsel   for	 the
appellant/assessees,  contended before us that it is  neces-
sary to find out or identify the taxable event. If on a true
and proper construction of the amended provisions of <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_135">section
9(1)(b)</a> it is the despatch or consignment of the goods	that
is  the	 taxable event as contended by the  petitioners	 and
appellants, then the power is beyond the State's competence.
If, on the other hand, it is the purchase of the goods	that
is  the taxable event as held by the Full Bench of the	High
Court, then it will be within its competence. The Full Bench
in  Des	 Raj Pushap Kumar's case (supra) has relied  on	 the
background of the facts and the circumstances which necessi-
tated the introduction of the amendment.
</p><p id="p_24">    Mr.	 Tewatia,  learned counsel appearing for  the  State
canvassed  before us the historical perspective	 and  stated
that Haryana State came into being as a result of the <a href="/doc/933499/" id="a_136">Punjab
State  Reorganisation  Act</a>,  1966, therefore,  part  of	 the
legislative  history  of the taxing Statute like  any  other
Statute	 is  shared  by the Haryana State  with	 the  Punjab
State,	and  as such it is proper to notice the	 concept  of
purchase tax as it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">535</span>
evolved in the State of Punjab. Purchase-tax was  introduced
in the State of Punjab for the first time by the East Punjab
General	 Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1958. <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_137">Section 2(ff)</a>	 was
introduced  for	 the  first time to  define  the  expression
'purchase'. The definition of the term 'dealer' was  changed
to include therein a purchaser of goods also. The definition
of the term 'taxable turnover' was also altered. Some  deal-
ers who crushed oil-seeds, were called upon to pay  purchase
tax on the raw-material purchased by them on the ground that
the  raw material had not been subjected to a  manufacturing
process as the process of crushing oil-seeds did not involve
a  process  of manufacturing. He referred to the  fact	that
Punjab had originally exempted purchase tax on the  purchase
of  raw-material by the dealers if such raw-material was  to
be used for the manufacture of goods for sale in Punjab	 and
thus  generate more revenue to the State as a result of	 the
sales  tax on such manufactured goods. But when the  dealers
started	 avoiding this condition for sale in Punjab by	var-
ious  ingenious devices after having escaped the payment  of
purchase  tax  on the raw-material purchased  by  them,	 the
Legislature  amended the Act and <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_138">Punjab Act</a> No. 18  of	1960
was  brought on the statute-book w.e.f. April 1, 1960.	Sec-
tion  2(ff) of the Act was amended and it provided that	 all
the  goods mentioned in Schedule C when purchased  shall  be
exigible  to purchase tax and thus the concession  given  to
the manufacturers was withdrawn. Explaining this background,
Mr. Tewatia contended that <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_139">section 9</a>, sub-section (i) of the
Act envisages payment of tax at such rate as may be notified
under  <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_140">Section 15</a> on the purchase of goods from	 any  source
within the State by a dealer liable to pay tax under the Act
when such goods, not being Schedule 'B' goods, were consumed
either in producing Schedule 'B' goods or when the  manufac-
tured goods were other than Schedule 'B' goods, the same not
being sold within the State or in the course of	 inter-State
trade  or commerce, or in the course of export	outside	 the
territory  of  India, or the purchased goods  were  exported
outside the State.
</p><p id="p_25">    After  referring  to  the relevant	provisions  and	 the
provisions  of <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_141">section 9(1)(b)</a>, Mr Tewatia  emphasised	that
the contingency contemplated by "or despatches the  manufac-
tured  goods  to  a place outside the State  in	 any  manner
otherwise  than by way of sale in the course of	 inter-State
trade  or  commerce or in the course of export	outside	 the
territory of India within the meaning of <a href="/doc/568051/" id="a_142">section 5(1)</a> of the
Central	 Sales Tax Act, 1956; or" as well as clause  (c)  of
<a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_143">section 9(1)</a> which encompasses "purchases goods, other	than
those specified in Schedule B, from any source in the  State
and  exports them, in the circumstances in which no  tax  is
payable under any other provision of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">536</span>
this  Act, there shall be levied, subject to the  provisions
of  <a href="/doc/1395855/" id="a_144">Section 17</a>, a tax on the purchase of such goods at	such
rate  as  may  be notified under <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_145">Section 15</a>.",	have  to  be
judged for determining their validity in the true historical
perspective  as well as bearing in mind the remedial  aspect
of the provisions for the purpose of which these were enact-
ed.  Therefore, the main question is whether the tax  envis-
aged  by  <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_146">section 9(1)</a> is a tax on  purchase/sale  of  given
goods or is a tax on the despatch/ consignment of such goods
and  that depends on, as to whether the taxable event  is  a
purchase/sale  of  goods  or  despatch/consignment  of	such
goods.	As  mentioned hereinbefore, Mr. Tewatia	 laid  great
deal  of  emphasis on the background of	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_147">section	 9(1)</a>.	He  urged that the said section	 is  both  a
taxing as well as a remedial provision, as would be  evident
from  the scheme of the Act. The legislative policy  was  to
see  that all goods except non-taxable goods  i.e.  Schedule
'B' goods, must yield tax/revenue to the State in the  hands
of  a  dealer, at one stage or the other, according  to	 Mr.
Tewatia. He analysed the scheme and referred us to <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_148">section 6</a>
along  with <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_149">section 27</a> of the Act, and then  submitted	that
the  provision of <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_150">section 9(1)</a> along with subsection (3)  of
<a href="/doc/175106824/" id="a_151">section	 24</a> of the Act are both composite  provisions,	i.e.
they  are both charging provisions as also  remedial  provi-
sions.	According  to him, such composite  provisions  of  a
fiscal	Statute	 deserve to be interpreted properly  and  in
such  a manner as to further remedy and thus effectuate	 the
legislative intent and suppress the mischief intended to  be
curbed.
</p><p id="p_26">    Reliance  was  placed by the High Court as well  as	 Mr.
Tewatia	 before us on the observations of this Court in	 <a href="/doc/1863875/" id="a_152">The
State of Tamil Nadu v. Kandaswami</a>, (supra), where at p.	 198
of  the Sales Tax Cases, this Court while dealing with	sec-
tion 7A of the Tamil Nadu (Amendment) Act, observed that  it
was at once a charging as well as a remedial provision.	 Its
main object was to plug leakage and prevent evasion of	tax.
In interpreting such a provision, a construction which would
defeat	its purpose and, in effect, obliterate it  from	 the
statute book, should be eschewed. If more than one construc-
tion  is possible, that which preserves its workability	 and
efficacy is to be preferred to the one which would render it
otiose	or sterile, observed this Court in that case.  While
bearing the aforesaid principle in mind, it has to be  exam-
ined as to how far the application of this provision can  be
construed with the well-settled principle of fiscal legisla-
tion  and the terms and conditions of the  present  legisla-
tion.  It has been said and said on numerous occasions	that
fiscal laws must be strictly construed, words must say	what
these  mean,  nothing should be presumed or  implied,  these
must say so. The true test must always be the language used.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">537</span>
<p id="p_27">    On behalf of the assessee, Mr. Rajaram Agarwala,  howev-
er,  further contended that the ratio of  Kandaswami's	case
(supra) to which Mr. Tewatia referred, must be understood in
the  light of the question involved in that case.  The	said
decision of this Court was concerned with the limited  point
as  to whether the Madras High Court was right in  observing
"whether  one could say that the sale which is	exempted  is
liable to tax and then assume that because of exemption, the
tax  is not payable". This Court held that the	language  of
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_153">section	 7A</a>  of the said Act was far from clear	 as  to	 its
intention and did not concern with the identification of the
taxing	event. Furthermore, it has to be borne in  mind,  as
emphasised by Mr. Agarwala, that if at all the taxing  event
was  spelt out, it was on the assumption that the  goods  in
question were generally taxable and these were to be put  to
tax under <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_154">section 7A</a> of the Tamil Nadu Act, if these came to
be  purchased without payment of tax and then sought  to  be
dealt  with  in	 any manner as to escape  payment  of  State
sales/purchase tax within the State.
</p><p id="p_28">    Mr.	 Tewatia drew our attention to the  observations  of
this  Court in Kandaswami's case (supra) to prove  that	 the
observations in <a href="/doc/233186/" id="a_155">Malabar Fruit Products Co. v. The Sales	 Tax
Officer,  Palai</a>,  30  STC 537, where  these  questions	were
decided by Justice Poti of the Kerala High Court, who  spelt
out that the taxing event was not the event of despatch	 but
the event of purchase/sale of goods. It has, however, to  be
borne  in mind that the questions involved in Malabar  Fruit
Products'  case and Kandaswami's case (supra) were not	con-
cerned with the actual argument with which we are  concerned
in  the instant matter. It is well-settled that a  precedent
is  an authority only for what it actually decides  and	 not
for what may remotely or even logically follows from it. See
Quinn  v. Leathem, [1901] AC 495 and <a href="/doc/1656601/" id="a_156">The State of Orissa  v.
Sudhansu  Sekhar Misra &amp; Ors</a>., [1968] 2 SCR 154.  Therefore,
the ratio of the said decision cannot be properly applied in
construing the provisions of <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_157">section 9(1)(b)</a> in this case to
determine what is the taxable event.
</p><p id="p_29">    It was contended by Mr. Rajaram Agarwala that clause (b)
of  <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_158">Section 9(1)</a> dealt with non-exempted goods purchased  in
the  State,  used in the manufacture of	 any  goods  whether
exempted  or not, but when despatched outside the  State  of
Haryana	 i.e.  by  way of stock	 transfer  consignment	will
attract	 the  tax liability under this section,	 hence,	 the
event  of  despatch or consignment is  the  immediate  cause
which attracts the tax liability under <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_159">section 9</a>. The quali-
ty  or the character of goods which should be liable to	 tax
under  <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_160">section 9</a> in clause (1)(a) is the non-exempted  goods
purchased in the State; while
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">538</span>
under  the  first part of clause (b) the  quality  of  goods
liable	to  tax is the non-exempted goods purchased  in	 the
State  and under the second part of clause (b), the  quality
of  goods must be non-exempted goods purchased and  manufac-
tured  in  the State, whether exempted or not in  the  State
which  is  liable to tax on despatch  outside  Haryana;	 and
under  clause  (c) the goods purchased	in  Haryana  without
undergoing any further change or use is the quality of goods
liable to tax when exported.
</p><p id="p_30">    The submission of the State is that the taxable event is
the purchase of goods in Haryana while the obligation to pay
is  postponed on the fulfilment of certain  conditions.	 The
further	 argument  is that there is a general  liability  to
purchase tax which the dealer avoids on furnishing a  Decla-
ration in S.T. Form 15 as provided by <a href="/doc/175106824/" id="a_161">section 24</a> at the time
of  purchase, wherein certain conditions are  mentioned	 and
when  those conditions are not fulfilled, those	 revive.  It
was  further argued that the conditions are incorporated  in
<a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_162">section	 9</a> of the Act. For testing which of the	 contentions
are  nearer  to find out the exact  taxable  event,  certain
indicias and illustrations may be seen. Their analysis	will
indicate  that there is no liability to pay sales tax  under
the  Haryana  Act on the purchaser. It is admitted  that  on
such sales the selling dealer is liable to pay sales-tax. On
such purchases, the sale and purchase being the two sides of
the  same  coin, no purchase tax is imposed under  the	Act.
This  has been the accepted position by the State also	for,
while  replying to the question of double  taxation  counsel
for the State admitted that sales as well as purchase tax is
to  be imposeable under the scheme of the Act which  are  of
two sides. Hence, it was rightly urged by Mr. Rajaram  Agar-
wala  that the first contention for attracting the  applica-
bility	of <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_163">section 9(i)</a>, "whether a dealer is liable to	 pay
tax  under  this Act purchases goods", is missing  when	 the
section	 (1) talks of a dealer liable to pay tax  under	 the
Act, obviously it is with reference to his purchasing activ-
ity  and  if on that activity no purchase  tax	is  payable,
<a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_164">section 9(1)</a> would not be applicable.
</p><p id="p_31">     To	 accept	 the submissions advanced  by  Mr.  Tewatia,
assumptions  and  presumptions	are to be made.	 It  is	 not
permissible  to	 do so in a fiscal provision.  See  in	this
connection  the observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/850597/" id="a_165">C.S.T.U.P.  v.
The  Modi Sugar Mills Ltd</a>., [1961] 2 SCR 189 and  <a href="/doc/497014/" id="a_166">Baidyanath
Ayurved Bhawan (P) Ltd., Jhansi v. Excise Commissioner, U.P.
&amp; Ors</a>., [1971] 2 SCR 590 at 592. In that background it	must
be noted that <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_167">section 9</a> of the Act nowhere makes a reference
to <a href="/doc/175106824/" id="a_168">section 24</a> or any declaration furnished by the purchasing
dealer on the basis of which he was granted temporary exemp-
tion and thereby revival of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">539</span>
the  original purchase tax on the breach of  declaration  as
such. <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_169">Section 9</a> of the Act opens with the expression  "where
a dealer liable to pay tax under this Act" and not  "whether
a  dealer  has	paid tax or has not paid  tax".	 The  phrase
'liable	 to pay tax' under the Act must relate to  liability
to pay sales tax on such purchases.
</p><p id="p_32">    It	is well-settled that the main test  for	 determining
the  taxable  event is that on the happening  of  which	 the
charge	is  affixed. The realisation often is  postponed  to
further date. The quantification of the levy and the  recov-
ery  of	 tax  is also postponed in some cases.	It  is	well
settled	 that  there are three stages in the  imposition  of
tax. There is the declaration of liability, that is the part
of the Statute which 'determines what persons in respect  of
what  property	are liable. Next, there is  the	 assessment.
Liability  does not depend on assessment,  that	 exhypothesi
has  already been fixed. But assessment	 particularises	 the
exact sum which a person is liable to pay. Lastly comes	 the
method of recovery if the person taxed does not	 voluntarily
pay.  Reference	 may  be made to the  observations  of	Lord
Dunedin in Whitney v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue, [1926]
AC 37 at p. 52 and of the Federal Court in <a href="/doc/1290730/" id="a_170">Chatturam &amp;	Ors.
v. C.I.T., Bihar</a>, 15 ITR FC 302 at 308.
</p><p id="p_33">    Taxable event is that which on its occurrence creates or
attracts the liability to tax. Such liability does not exist
or accrue at any earlier or later point of time. The identi-
fication  of the subject-matter of a tax is to be  found  in
the charging section. In this connection, one has to analyse
the provisions of <a href="/doc/152600984/" id="a_171">section 9(2)(b)</a> as well as <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_172">section 9(1)(b)</a>
and  <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_173">9(1)(c)</a>. Analysing the section, it appears to  us	that
the  two conditions specified, before the event of  despatch
outside	 the State as mentioned in <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_174">section 9(1)(b)</a>,  namely,
</p><p id="p_34">(i)  purchase of goods in the State and (ii) using them	 for
the  manufacture of any other goods in the State,  are	only
descriptive of the goods liable to tax under <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_175">Section 9(1)(b)</a>
in the event of despatch outside the State. If the goods  do
not  answer both the descriptions cumulatively, even  though
these  are  despatched	outside the State  of  Haryana,	 the
purchase  of those goods would not be put to tax under	sec-
tion 9(1)(b). The focal point in the expression "goods,	 the
sale  or purchase of which is liable to tax under the  Act",
is the character and class of goods in relation to exigibil-
ity. In this connection, reference may be made to the obser-
vations	 of  this Court in <a href="/doc/1432872/" id="a_176">Andhra Sugars Ltd.  v.  State  of
Andhra Pradesh</a>, [1968] 1 SCR 705. On a clear analysis of the
said  section,	it appears that <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_177">section 9(1)(b)</a>	 has  to  be
judged as and when liability accrues under that section. The
liability  to pay tax under this section does not accrue  on
purchasing  the goods simpliciter, but only when  these	 are
despatched or consigned out of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">540</span>
the State of Haryana. In all these cases, it is necessary to
find out the true nature of the tax. Analysing the  section,
if  one looks to the alleged purchase tax under	 <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_178">section  9</a>,
one  gets  the conclusion that the section itself  does	 not
provide	 for imposition of the purchase tax on the  transac-
tion  of purchase of the taxable goods but when further	 the
said  taxable goods are used up and turned into	 independent
taxable goods, losing its original identity, and  thereafter
when the manufactured goods are despatched outside the State
of Haryana and only then tax is levied and liability to	 pay
tax  is created. It is the cumulative effect of	 that  event
which  occasions or causes the tax to be imposed, to draw  a
familiar analogy it is the last straw on the camel's back.
    In this connection, reference may be made to the  obser-
vations of Justice Vivian Bose in <a href="/doc/1629177/" id="a_179">The Tata Iron &amp; Steel	 Co.
Ltd.  v. The State of Bihar</a>, [1958] SCR 1355 at 1381,  where
he observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	      "I would therefore reject the nexus theory  in
	      so far as it means that any one sale can	have
	      existence	 and entity simultaneously  in	many
	      different places. The States may tax the	sale
	      but  may not disintegrate it, and,  under	 the
	      guise of taxing the sale in truth and in fact,
	      tax its various elements, one its head and one
	      its  tail, one its entrails and one its  limbs
	      by  a legislative fiction that deems that	 the
	      whole  is	 within its  claws  simply  because,
	      after  tearing it apart, it finds a hand or  a
	      foot or a heart or a liver still quivering  in
	      its grasp. Nexus, of course, there must be but
	      nexus  of the entire entity that is  called  a
	      sale,  wherever  it is deemed to	be  situate.
	      Fiction  again. Of course, it is fiction,	 but
	      it  is  a fiction as to situs imposed  by	 the
	      <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_180">Constitution Act</a> and by the Supreme Court that
	      speaks  for it in these matters and  only	 one
	      fiction, not a dozen little ones."</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">    It	is,  therefore, necessary in all cases to  find	 out
what is the essence of the duty which is attracted. A  taxa-
ble event is that which is closely related to imposition. In
the  instant section, there is such close relationship	only
with  despatch. Therefore, the goods purchased are  used  in
manufacture of new independent commodity and thereafter	 the
said manufactured goods are despatched outside the State  of
Haryana. In this series of transactions the original  trans-
action	is completely eclipsed or ceases to exist  when	 the
levy  is imposed at the third stage of despatch of  manufac-
ture. In the instant case the levy has no direct  connection
with  the transaction of purchase of raw-materials,  it	 has
only  a remote connection of lineage. It may  be  indirectly
and very
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">541</span>
remotely  connected with the transaction of the purchase  of
raw-material wherein the present levy would lose its charac-
ter of purchase tax on the said transaction.
    Mr.	 Rajaram Agarwala submitted that the measure of	 tax
is  with  reference to the value of purchased goods  in	 the
State  of Haryana. As mentioned before, reference  has	been
made  to  the decision of Kandaswami's case  (supra),  where
this  Court  dealt with <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_181">section 7A</a> of the  Tamil  Nadu	Act,
which was not identical but similar to <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_182">section 9</a> of the Act.
There  at p. 196 of the report, this Court observed as	fol-
lows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	      "...  Difficulty	in interpretation  has	been
	      experienced  only with regard to that part  of
	      the  sub-section which relates to	 ingredients

	      that  the expression "goods, the sale or	pur-
	      chase  of	 which is liable to tax	 under	this
	      Act", and the phrase "purchases ... in circum-
	      stances  in  which  no tax  is  payable  under

</blockquote><p id="p_36">This  ingredient was neither argued nor was  considered,  so
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">542</span>
passing reference based on the phraseology of the section is
not the dictum of Kandaswami's case. Secondly, in <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_187">section 9</a>,
in the instant case, the raw-materials purchased or used  in
the manufacture of new goods and thereafter those new  goods
were  despatched outside the State of Haryana whereupon	 the
tax  was levied. This important factor is wholly missing  in
<a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_188">Section	 7A</a> of the Tamil Nadu Act, which was  considered  in
Kandaswami's case. In that decision, this Court approved the
Kerala	High  Court's decision in  Malabar  Fruit  Products,
(supra),  which	 was confined to the interpretation  of	 the
words  'goods', the sale or purchase under the Act. A  deci-
sion  on  a  question which has not been  argued  cannot  be
treated	 as a precedent. See the observations of this  Court
in <a href="/doc/883856/" id="a_189">Rajput Ruda Maha &amp; Ors. v. State of Gujarat</a>, [1980] 2 SCR

Ors</a>.,  32  STC	359 is clearly	distinguishable.  In  Ganesh
Prasad	Dixit's case (supra) the question of  constitutional
validity was not argued. A reference was made by Mr. Tewatia
to  the	 decision of the High Court in <a href="/doc/705721/" id="a_191">The Coffee  Board  v.
Commissioner of Commercial Taxes &amp; Ors</a>., 60 STC 142 and	 the
decision of this Court in Coffee Board, Karnataka v. Commis-
sioner of Commercial Taxes, Karnataka, 70 STC 162. In  these
cases the question involved was the acquisition of coffee by
the Coffee Board under compulsory acquisition or purchase or
sale of goods. That question is entirely different from	 the
question with which we are concerned in these appeals.
    Prior  to 46 the Amendment, Entry 54 of List II  of	 the
7th  Schedule of the Constitution of India which  demarcated
the exclusive field of State Legislation, read with  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_192">Article
246(3)</a>	of  the Constitution conferred power  on  the  State
Legislature  to	 impose tax on the transactions of  sale  or
purchase of goods. The said Entry read as follows:--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	      "Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods  other
	      than Newspapers, subject to the provisions  of
	      Entry 92-A of List I".</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">    Entry 92A of List I, which is in the exclusive domain of
the Union, was to the following extent:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	      "Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods  other
	      than  Newspapers, where such sale or  purchase
	      takes place in the course of inter-State trade
	      or commerce."</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">    The	 mere consignment of goods by a manufacturer to	 his
own branches outside the State does not in any way amount to
a sale or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">543</span>
disposal  of the goods as such. The consignment or  despatch
of  goods is neither a sale nor a purchase. The first  judg-
ment in case of Goodyear India was on December 4, 1982	when
it was held that the Notification was beyond the Act, as the
word 'disposal' did not include the word 'mere despatch'  as
mentioned in the notification. The Constitution (46th Amend-
ment) Act, 1982 came into force on February 2, 1983, whereby
<a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_193">section 9</a> was amended. This amendment was after 46th Consti-
tutional  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_194">Amendment Act</a>, 1982. The 46th Constitution  Amend-
ment Act in the Statement of Objects &amp; Reasons, inter  alia,
stated as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	      "There  were reports from State Government  to
	      whom  revenues  from sales-tax have  been	 as-
	      signed,  as  to the large scale  avoidance  of
	      Central  Sales  Tax  leviable  on	 inter-State
	      sales of goods through the device of  consign-
	      ment of goods from one State to another and as
	      to  the  leakage of local Sales Tax  in  works
	      contracts,  hire purchase transactions,  lease
	      of films etc. Though, Parliament could levy  a
	      tax on these transactions, as tax on sales has
	      all  along been treated as an item of  revenue
	      to  be  assigned to the States, in  regard  to
	      these  transactions  which  are  semble  sales
	      also,  it is considered that the	same  policy
	      should be adopted."</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">    The Law Commission of India in its 61st Report made,  as
indicated before, certain recommendations, and noticed	that
the provisions of existing <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_195">Central Sales Tax Act</a> were insuf-
ficient	 to  tax the consignment transfers  from  branch  to
another,  as  it  was beyond the concept of  sale,  and	 its
recommendations	 are contained in paragraph 2.23 of  Chapter
II (at page 66), it recommended that the definition of	sale
in the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_196">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, after carrying out the  requi-
site Constitution Amendment be amended somewhat on the lines
indicated  by them in their report. The Union of  India,  in
part,  accepted the recommendations but instead of  amending
the definition of sales in <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_197">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, inserted a
new  Entry in the Union List in the shape of Entry  92B	 and
also  inserted a new sub-clause (4) after subclause  (g)  in
<a href="/doc/465515/" id="a_198">Art. 269 (1)</a> of the Constitution. The Parliament also amend-
ed clause (3) of <a href="/doc/1135479/" id="a_199">Article 269.</a>
</p><p id="p_40">    It appears to us that the effect of the aforesaid amend-
ment  is that the field of taxation on the  consignment/des-
patch  of goods in the course of inter-State trade  or	com-
merce  expressly come within the purview of the	 legislative
competence  of	the Parliament. It is wellsettled  that	 the
nomenclature of the Act is not conclusive and for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">544</span>
determining  the true character and nature of  a  particular
tax,  with  reference  to the legislative  competence  of  a
particular  Legislature, the Court will look into  its	pith
and  substance. See the observations of Governor General  in
Council v. Province of Madras, [1945] 72 IA 91. There,	Lord
Simonds observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	      "	  .....	 For in a Federal  Constitution,  in
	      which  there  is	a  division  of	 legislative
	      powers between Central and provincial legisla-
	      tures it appears to be inevitable that contro-
	      versy  should  arise;  Whether  one  or  other
	      legislature  is  not exceeding  its  own,	 and
	      encroaching   on	the  others   Constitutional
	      Legislative  Power, and in such a	 controversy
	      it  is a principle, which their  Lordships  do
	      not  hesitate  to apply in the  present  case,
	      that  it is not the name of the tax,  but	 its
	      real nature, "it is pith and substance", as it
	      has some times been said which must  determine
	      into what category it fails."</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">    We	must,  therefore, look not to the form	but  to	 the
substance  of the levy. See the observations of the  Federal
Court in <a href="/doc/1546265/" id="a_200">Ralla Ram v. The Province of East Punjab</a>, AIR	1949
FC 81.
</p><p id="p_42">    Therefore, the nomenclature given by the Haryana  Legis-
lature is not decisive. One has to find out whether in	pith
and substance, a consignment tax is sought to be imposed,  a
tax  on despatch in the course of inter-State trade or	com-
merce.	I have no hesitation in holding that it is a tax  on
despatch. Inter-state trade or commerce, it has been  empha-
sised,	is of great national importance and is vital to	 the
federal	 structure  of	our country. As	 the  imposition  of
consignment tax requires very deep consideration of all	 its
aspects	 and  certain amount of consensus among	 the  States
concerned,  especially	with regard to the rates,  grant  of
exemption,  and ratio relating to distribution	of  proceeds
amongst the States inter se, the actual imposition of tax is
bound to take some time till an agreeable solution is found,
but  that would not make the consignment tax to be  in	sus-
pended	animation in the State, and make us hold that a	 tax
which is in essence a tax on consignment should be taxed  by
the States by the plea either that otherwise there is  ample
scope  of  evasion and further States are without  much	 re-
sources in these days when there is such a tremendous demand
on the revenue of the States.
</p><p id="p_43">    It is well settled that the Entries in the	Constitution
only  demarcate	 the legislative fields	 of  the  respective
legislatures and do
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">545</span>
not  confer legislative powers as such. The tax on  despatch
of goods outside the territory of the State certainly is  in
the  course of inter-State trade or commerce, and  in  other
words,	amounts to imposition of consignment tax, and  hence
the latter part of <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_201">section 9(1)(b)</a> is ultra vires and void.
    In	these cases, we are concerned with the	validity  of
the latter part of section 9(1)(b) of the Haryana Act  which
imposes a tax on despatch of manufactured goods outside	 the
territories  of	 Haryana.  If it is  accepted  that  <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_202">section
9(1)(b)</a> is ultra vires, the penalty proceedings would  auto-
matically  go as they are in substance, based on the  viola-
tion  of <a href="/doc/71290273/" id="a_203">section 9(1)(b)</a> of the Act and the consequent	pro-
ceedings  flowing therefrom. It is in that context  that  in
writ petition No. 3834 of 1985, Mr. Soli Sorabjee urged that
the  attempt  and action of the State in  imposing  tax	 and
attempt to penalise are bad.
</p><p id="p_44">    In this connection, it may be mentioned that before	 the
Full  Bench of the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court on behalf  of
the State, a statement was made, which has been recorded  in
58 STC 393 at p. 408, as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	      "Counsel	appearing for the State	 of  Haryana
	      made  a statement that if the Full Bench	held
	      that  Bata India Limited's, case (1983)54	 STC
	      226  did not lay down the correct law and	 the
	      amendment	 effected by Act No. 11 of  1984  to
	      <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_204">Section 9</a> was intra vires, then the  provision
	      of sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/175106824/" id="a_205">section 24</a> regarding the
	      rate of tax shall not be enforced and only the
	      old rate will be leviable."</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">    In	view  of  the aforesaid statement,  no	higher	rate
except	the old rate admissible factually would be  applica-
ble.
</p><p id="p_46">    <a href="/doc/175106824/" id="a_206">Section  24(3)</a>  was introduced by the Haryana  Act	with
retrospective effect from May 27, 1971, which is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	      "Notwithstanding any other provisions of	this
	      Act  or any Judgment, decree or order  of	 any
	      Court or other authority to the contrary if  a
	      dealer who purchases goods, without payment of
	      tax under Sub-section (1) and fails to use the
	      goods  so purchased for the purpose  specified
	      therein  he shall be liable to pay tax on	 the
	      purchase	value  of such goods, at  the  rates
	      notified under <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_207">Section 15</a> without prejudice to

	      Act."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">    This provision without making any change in the substan-
</blockquote><p id="p_47">tive  provision purports to give a direction to	 ignore	 the
judgment,  in  other words, purports to overrule  the  judg-
ments, namely, Goodyear and Bata India, which is beyond	 the
legislative  competence	 of the State Legislature  and	this
provision is void in view of the decision of this Court. <a href="/doc/1018531/" id="a_209">See
Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Broach Borough Municipali</a>-
ty,  [1969] 2 SCC 283 at 286. For the same reason,  applying

also  fail  as amended. Civil appeal No. 15  15/84  is	also

transfer  of  title in the goods to any other  person",	 and
therefore it would not include mere despatch to own self  or
to  its	 agents or to its branch offices or depots.  In	 the
premises, the decision of the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in
Goodyear  India	 Ltd., 53 STC 163 is correct  on  merits  as
well.
</p><p id="p_48">    In	the aforesaid view of the matter, it cannot be	held
that  <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_213">section  9(1)</a> and sub-section (3) of  <a href="/doc/175106824/" id="a_214">section  24</a>	 are
constitutionally valid.
</p><p id="p_49">    In	civil  appeals Nos. 1633 (NT) of  1985	and  3033/86
which are the appeals by the Food Corporation of India,	 Mr.
Sen submitted that the FCI is a service agency of the  Govt.
of  India  and	is discharging the  statutory  functions  of
distribution of foodgrains by procuring/purchasing from	 the
surplus	 States	 and  despatching the same  to	the  deficit
States in accordance with the policy of the Govt. of  India.
He  further  submitted that the Corporation  procures  food-
grains	from  the farmers through commission agents  in	 the
Mandis	of Haryana and despatch them to its own branches  in
the deficit States of the country. The Corporation  branches
in  the	 recipient States supply these stocks to  the  State
agencies/fair price shops and also pay tax as per the provi-
sions of the Sales Tax law of the respective States. Some of
the  stocks  are distributed within Haryana for	 the  Public
Distribution System (PDS) for which sales tax is charged and
deposited with the Sales Tax depot as per the provisions  of
the  Haryana General Sales Tax Act. In case the	 stocks	 are
also  sold in the course of inter-State trade  or  commerce,
central	 sales tax is levied and deposited with the  Haryana
Sales Tax authorities. Some of the grains are also  exported
out  of India on which there is exemption on payment of	 any
tax.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">547</span>
<p id="p_50">    In	fact,  the points at which the tax is to  be  levied
have been indicated in Schedule 'D' to the Act. It is  clear
from the perusal of the Schedule that in case of Paddy,	 the
taxable	 event is the last purchase. Similarly, in  case  of
rice the taxable event is the first sale point in the State.
In case of wheat and other cereals the point of taxation  is
the last sale to the consumer by a dealer liable to pay	 tax
under the Act.
</p><p id="p_51">    In	respect of inter-State despatch of wheat  and  other
foodgrains  by FCI to its own branches, tax is attracted  at
the  time of despatch under section 9(1)(c) of	the  Haryana
Act.  <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_215">Section  9</a>  is, therefore, the  charging	section	 for
taxation  in case where the goods are purchased for  export.
There  is no other provision for levy of purchase  or  sales
tax in such cases of export. Incidentally, "export" has been
defined in <a href="/doc/960739/" id="a_216">section 2(e)</a> of the Act which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">	      "2(e)  "export" means the taking out of  goods
	      from the State to any place outside it  other-
	      wise  than  by way of sale in  the  course  of
	      inter-State trade or commerce or in the course
	      of export out of the territory of India;"</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">    No	tax  is payable under the Haryana Act  when  exports
outside the State take place either in the course of  inter-
State  sale or export out of the territory of India. No	 tax
is  therefore payable in regard to export outside India	 but
the  tax  is payable for sale in the course  of	 inter-State
trade and commerce i.e. under the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_217">Central Sales Tax Act</a>.  It
is  only  when	the goods are  despatched/consigned  to	 the
depots	of the FCI in other States that tax is levied  under
section	 9  of the Haryana Act. This is in addition  to	 the
sales  tax  paid  by the FCI on the sale of  grains  in	 the
recipient  States.  On perusal of <a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_218">sections 14</a> &amp;	 <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_219">15</a>  of	 the
Central Sales Tax Act, it becomes clear that wheat is one of
the commodities specified as 'declared goods' and in respect
of which the intention is clear that the tax is payable only
once on the declared goods. In the case of inter-State	sale
if  any tax has been paid earlier on declared  goods  inside
the  State the same is to be refunded to the dealer  who  is
paying tax on such inter-State sales. On these	transactions
no  tax is liable in the recipient State, while in  case  of
inter-State  despatches,  the  tax is  leviable	 twice.	 The
appeals	 of. the FCI are confined to <a href="/doc/105515890/" id="a_220">section 9(1)(c)</a>,  which
insofar as it purports to tax export, is beyond the legisla-
tive competence of the State of Haryana.
</p><p id="p_53">    On	behalf	of the State in <a href="/doc/1583174/" id="a_221">Bata Co. Ltd.  v.  State  of
Haryana</a>	 (supra),  the submission of the State	was  on	 the
basis that it had power to tax consignment or despatches  of
goods. But after the 46th Amend-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">548</span>
<p id="p_54">ment,  the  State Legislature is  incompetent  to  legislate
about consignments/despatches otherwise than by way of	sale
under  which  no purchase/sales tax is	leviable  under	 the
Haryana	 Act. It is the Parliament alone which	is  legisla-
tively competent to enact a legislation on consignment.
</p><p id="p_55">     Now, it is necessary to deal with civil appeals Nos.  4
162-63/85  which deal with the validity of section 13-AA  of
the Bombay Sales Tax Act.
</p><p id="p_56">     These  appeals  are by Hindustan Lever Ltd.  and  Wipro
Products  the  appellants  herein. The	appellants,  at	 all
material  times,  manufacture, make and deal  in  vanaspati,
soaps, etc., chemicals and agro-chemicals, and they used  to
purchase various types of VNE oils for their manufacture  of
vanaspati,  soaps and other products. Since  the  appellants
had  a wide net of distribution of their products  all	over
India,	they appointed 40 and more clearing  and  forwarding
agents	in the country. The appellant used to  despatch	 the
goods so manufactured from their factory to the clearing and
forwarding  agents. They also used to purchase VNE oils	 and
other  raw-materials and paid 4% tax by way of purchase	 tax
under section 3 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 (hereinaf-
ter called 'the Bombay Act'). The raw-materials are used  in
the  manufacture of said goods and as the said	manufactured
goods  are despatched outside the State to the several	dis-
tributing agencies, the appellant companies were held to  be
liable to pay, under <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_222">section 13-AA</a> of the Act, an additional
tax @ 2% on purchase of the said goods.
</p><p id="p_57">    The	 question, therefore, that arises, is:	whether	 the
levy of additional tax at 2% under <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_223">Section 13-AA</a> of the	 Act
is  a tax on purchases failing under Entry 54 of List II  of
the 7th Schedule or it is a tax on the despatch of  consign-
ment of the manufactured goods outside the State. In case of
latter,	 the State Legislature will have no power to  impose
any tax on such consignment or despatch of goods outside the
State.	If  it	is the former, then it will  be	 valid.	 The
question  is  that under the true constructions	 of  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_224">section
13-AA</a> of the Act, on which the imposition of tax is made, or
in  other words, what is the incidence of that	taxation  or
taxable event? In both these appeals, namely, civil  appeals
No. 4162/ 88 and 4163/88, the appellants M/s Wipro  Products
Ltd.  and Hindustan Lever Ltd. are contending that the	levy
is  bad. The issue involved in both the appeals is the	con-
stitutional  validity  and  legality of	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_225">section 13-AA</a> of the Act, which was introduced into the	 Act
by the Maharashtra Act XXVIII of 1982. The appellant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">549</span>
had a factory at Amalnar in Jalgaon district in the State of
Maharashtra  wherein it uses non-essential oil purchased  by
it for the manufacture and transport. The finished products,
namely,	 vanaspati manufactured by the appellant used to  be
despatched to their various marketing depots in the State of
Maharashtra,  Madhya  Pradesh,	Karnataka,  Andhra  Pradesh,
U.P., Tamil Nadu and Kerala etc. On July 1, 1981 the rate of
purchase tax payable on VNE oils (falling under Schedule  C,
part I at Entry 35) purchased within the State of  Maharash-
tra from non-registered dealers increased from 3% to 4%,  by
the Maharashtra Act 32 of 1981.
</p><p id="p_58">    <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_226">Section 13-AA</a> was introduced into the Act providing	 for
levy of 2% additional purchase tax on the purchase of goods,
input  goods,  specified in part I of the  Schedule  from  a
non-registered	dealer if such goods were used in the  manu-
facture	 of taxable goods within Maharashtra and  thereafter
the manufactured goods were transferred outside	 Maharashtra
in the manner indicated in the said section.
    The appellants filed writ petitions. An order was passed
by  the	 Bombay High Court on July 19, 1988  in	 respect  of
these  two writ petitions by the Wipro Products as  well  as
Hindustan  Lever  Ltd.	The decision of the  High  Court  is
reported in [1989] 72 STC 69.
</p><p id="p_59">    Dismissing	the  petitions of the  appellants  the	High
Court held that (i) three different phases are	contemplated
in <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_227">section 13-AA</a> of the Act, namely, the initial purchase of
the raw material, the consumption thereof in the manufacture
of taxable goods, and the despatch of the manufactured goods
outside the State. If the goods purchased remain in the same
form  within the State, the question of	 levying  additional
tax  would not arise. The High Court came to the  conclusion
that there was no ground to hold that the additional tax was
levied on the despatch of goods and was unconnected with the
initial	 transaction of purchase, as it was required  to  be
paid  in addition to the sales or purchase tax paid or	pay-
able  in  respect of the same goods which had been  so	pur-
chased before the conditions specified in <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_228">section 13-AA</a>	 are
fulfilled,  (ii) in the context of the other  provisions  of
the  Act, a sort of concession is given at the time of	pur-
chase on the quantum of tax payable on the purchase of goods
which  fall under Part I of Schedule C. However, there is  a
clear  mandate of law, which is clearly	 understood  between
seller	and buyer, that though tax at the concessional	rate
is  paid,  the obligation to pay the additional tax  on	 the
happening  of certain events, namely, use of such  goods  in
manufacture  of	 finished goods, and  despatch	of  finished
goods outside the State, is undertaken
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">550</span>
by the purchaser; and (iii) implicit in the low rates of tax
prescribed  on raw material attributable to goods in Part  I
of  Schedule C is the condition precedent that to  avail  of
this  concession  the goods in question are required  to  be
sold  in  the State after being used in the  manufacture  of
other  taxable	goods. The High Court, further, was  of	 the
opinion that a manufacturer who purchases raw-material at  a
concessional rate on the strength of declaration in Form  15
cannot	transfer  the goods manufactured out  of  such	raw-
material  outside the State. The High Court held that if  he
does  so, he is liable to pay purchase tax at the full	rate
on the raw material under <a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_229">section 14</a>. According to the	High
Court, similarly, a manufacturer who purchases goods covered
in  Part III of Schedule C, uses them in the manufacture  of
other  taxable goods which he despatches outside the  State,
is  liable to pay tax at rates ranging from 6% to 15%.	Sec-
tion 13-AA, therefore, far from being discriminatory, serves
to wipe out any discrimination between the two categories of
manufacturers  mentioned above and manufacturers  purchasing
raw-material  covered by Part I of Schedule C, according  to
the  revenue.  The High Court was of the  opinion  that	 the
additional purchase tax leviable under section 13-AA of	 the
Bombay Act, is on the purchase value of VNE oil used in	 the
manufacture  of goods transferred outside the State and	 not
on  the value of the manufactured goods so  transferred.  It
further	  held	that the tax levied under section  13-AA  of
the  Bombay Act, falls squarely and exclusively under  Entry
54 of the State List in the 7th Schedule to the Constitution
of India and the State Legislature was competent to levy it.
It does not even remotely fall under Entry 92B of the  Union
List, according to the High Court.
</p><p id="p_60">    The High Court was also of the view that the goods taxed
under  section 13-AA of the Bombay Act, are consumed in	 the
State  as  raw material in the process	of  producing  other
commodities.  Hence, there was no question of any  hindrance
to a free flow of trade bringing into operation <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_230">Article	 301</a>
of the Constitution. According to the High Court, the  peti-
tioners	 had not brought forth any material to show how	 the
free flow of trade has been affected by this additional rate
of  tax;  and  held that <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_231">section 13AA</a> is  not  violative  of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_232">Article 14</a> of the Constitution; and that section 13AA of the
Bombay	Act and the orders requiring the appellants  to	 pay
additional  tax @ 2% on purchase of VNE oil used by them  as
raw-material in the manufacture of goods despatched  outside
the State, were valid.
</p><p id="p_61">    The High Court in the judgment under appeal has set	 out
the  relevant  provisions of the Act, which was	 enacted  to
consolidate and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">551</span>
amend  the law relating to levy of tax on the sale  or	pur-
chase  of  certain goods in the State of Bombay.  <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_233">Section  2</a>
contains  some	of the definitions. <a href="/doc/175106824/" id="a_234">Section  24</a>	 deals	with
authorisations	of turnover etc. Section 13AA of the  Bombay
Act  with  which the High Court and these appeals  are	con-
cerned, is in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">	      "13-AA.  Purchase	 tax  payable  on  goods  in
	      Schedule	C, Part I, when	 manufactured  goods
	      are transferred to outside branches.
			Where a dealer, who is liable to pay
	      tax under this Act, purchases any goods speci-
	      fied  in	Part I of Schedule  C,	directly  or
	      through Commission agent, from a person who is
	      or  is not a Registered dealer and  uses	such
	      goods in the manufacture of taxable goods	 and
	      despatches the goods, so manufactured, to	 his
	      own place of business or to his agent's  place
	      of business situated outside the State  within
	      India,  then  such dealer shall be  liable  to
	      pay,  in	addition to the sales  tax  paid  or
	      payable,	or as the case may be, the  purchase
	      tax levied or leviable under the other  provi-
	      sions  of this Act in respect of purchases  of
	      such goods, a purchase tax at the rate of	 two
	      paise  in the rupee on the purchase  price  of
	      the  goods  so used in  the  manufacture,	 and
	      accordingly the dealer shall include  purchase
	      price  of such goods in his turnover  of	pur-
	      chases  in his return under <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_235">section 32</a>,  which
	      he is to furnish next thereafter."</blockquote>
<p id="p_62">    The	 questions  involved in these appeals  are:  whether
section	 13AA  of the Bombay Act is beyond  the	 legislative
competence of the State Legislature; and it is violative  of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_236">Article	 14</a>  of the Constitution; and thirdly,	whether	 the
said provision is violative of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_237">Article 301</a> of the  Constitu-
tion. It  was  contended on behalf  of the appeallant	that
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_238">section 13AA</a> of the Act is a charging section and imposes  a
charge	of  an	additional rate of 2% in the  rupee  if	 the
following  conditions laid down therein are  satisfied:	 (i)
the charge is levied upon a dealer who is liable to pay	 tax
under the Act; (ii) such a dealer purchases any goods speci-
fied in Part I of Schedule C, directly or through commission
agent,	from a person who is or is not a registered  dealer;
</p><p id="p_63">(iii) the goods so purchased are used in the manufacture  of
taxable goods; and (iv) the goods which are so	manufactured
(and not the goods on which purchase tax had been paid)	 are
despatched  to the dealer's own place of business or to	 his
agent's place of business situated outside the State.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">552</span>
<p id="p_64">    According  to the appellant, the said section lays	down
the person who is liable to pay tax, the goods on which	 the
same  is leviable and the taxable event which would  attract
the  liability of additional tax of two paise in the  rupee,
namely	 the  despatch	or  consignment	 of  goods  by	 the
dealer/manufacturer outside the State.
</p><p id="p_65">    According  to  Dr. Pal, counsel for the  appellant,	 the
taxable event is not the purchase of goods as such which  is
the  raw-material, but it is the despatch or consignment  of
goods  manufactured  by the dealer/manufacturer to  its	 own
branch	outside the state; and that thus manufactured  goods
are different from commercial commodity, distinct and  sepa-
rate  from the raw materials on which purchase tax  has	 al-
ready  been  paid.  It is well-settled,	 it  was  reiterated
before:us, that in case of excise duty, the taxable event is
the manufacture of goods and the duty is not directly on the
goods but on the manufacture thereof. In case of sales	tax,
taxable	 event	is  the sale of goods.	Hence,	though	both
excise	duty and sales tax are levied with reference to	 the
goods, the two are different imposts, in one case the  impo-
sition	is on the act of manufacture or production while  in
case  of other the imposition is on the act of sale. But  in
neither case the impost is a tax directly on the goods.	 See
in  this connection, the observations of this Court  in	 re:
The Bill to amend s. 20 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 and <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_239"> s.
3</a>  of the Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_240">Salt Act</a>,  1944,  [1964]  3	 SCR
787  at 821 and <a href="/doc/1413381/" id="a_241">M/s. Guruswarny &amp; Co. v. State of Mysore</a>,  [
1967] 1 SCR 548 at 562.
</p><p id="p_66">    The	 power to tax the sale or purchase of goods is	dif-
ferent from the right to impose taxes on use or consumption.
According to Dr. Pal such power to levy sales tax cannot  be
exercised    at	  the	earlier	  stage	  of	import	  or
manufacture/production	nor the said power can be  exercised
at  the	 later stage of use or consumption but only  at	 the
stage  of  sale or purchase. In respect of  sales  tax,	 the
right  to levy duty would not at all come into being  before
the  time  of  sale/purchase. Sales tax	 cannot	 be  imposed
unless	the goods are actually sold and may not be  leviable
if  there  is  a transfer in some other form.  See  in	this
connection the observations of the Federal Court in  Mukunda
Murari	Chakravarti &amp; Ors. v. Pabitramoy Ghosh &amp;  Ors.,	 AIR
1945 FC 1 at 22. Therefore, in this case it is necessary  to
ascertain  what is the taxable event under <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_242">section 13-AA</a>  of
the  Act which attracts duty. A taxing event is	 that  event
the occurrence of which immediately attracts the levy or the
charge of tax.
</p><p id="p_67">    In the fiscal legislations normally a charge is created.
The  mischief  of taxation occurs on the  happening  of	 the
taxable event. Diffe-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">553</span>
<p id="p_68">rent  taxes  have different taxable events. In	the  instant
case, Dr. Pal canvassed before us that the incidence of	 the
levy  of additional tax of two paise in the rupee is not  on
the  purchase  of goods but such a levy	 is  attracted	only
when--(a)  the goods which so purchased on payment  of	pur-
chase tax are used in the manufacture of taxable goods;	 and
</p><p id="p_69">(b)  the  goods so manufactured are despatched	to  his	 own
place  of business or to his agent's place of business	out-
side the State. Therefore, the incidence of tax is attracted
not  merely on the purchase but only when the goods so	pur-
chased arc used in the manufacture of taxable goods and	 are
despatched outside the State. In our opinion, it was rightly
submitted that it is the effect of <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_243">section 13AA</a> of the	Act.
It  was further highlighted by Dr. Pal on behalf...  of	 the
assessee  that	additional tax is not levied  on  the  goods
purchased on payment of purchase tax and despatched  outside
the  State.  The  goods which are purchased  on	 payment  of
purchase  tax are used in the manufacture of taxable  goods.
What  is despatched is not the raw material which have	been
purchased  on payment of purchase tax but a completely	dif-
ferent	commodity,  namely, vanaspati and soap. If  the	 raw
materials  as such purchased on payment of purchase tax	 are
despatched  outside  the  State, the  additional  tax  under
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_244">section 13-AA</a> of the Act is not attracted. Hence, the  inci-
dence  of additional tax has no nexus with the	purchase  of
the  raw-materials, as was contended by Mr.  S.K.  Dholakia,
appearing for the State and as held by the High Court.
    Purchase  tax  under <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_245">section 3</a> of the Act  is  attracted
when  the taxable event i.e. the purchase of  goods  occurs,
but  the taxable event for the imposition of additional	 tax
of  two	 paise in the rupee occurs only when  the  goods  so
purchased  are used in the manufacture of taxable goods	 and
such  taxable  goods are despatched outside the State  by  a
dealer-manufacturer.  Dr. Pal drew our attention to some  of
the  observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/1438436/" id="a_246">Kedarnath Jute  Mfg.	 Co.
Ltd.  v. Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Calcutta</a>,  82
ITR  SC	 363 and <a href="/doc/136620/" id="a_247">State of Madhya Pradesh &amp;  Ors.  v.  Shyama
Charan Shukla</a>, 29 STC SC 215 at 218-219. On the other  hand,
Mr. Dholakia submitted that the submission of the  appellant
proceeded on the assumption that the liability to pay is the
same as the obligation to pay but this was wrong. These	 two
are  different. It was submitted that the obligation to	 pay
is  not the same thing as liability to tax; and that it	 was
wrong  to proceed on the basis that because  'obligation  to
pay' is a later event, 'the despatch of goods' is the  taxa-
ble event. This is a fallacy, according to Mr. Dholakia.  In
this connection, reliance was placed on the observations  of
this  Court in <a href="/doc/214162/" id="a_248">R.C. Jail v. Union of India</a>, [1962] Suppl.  3
SCR 436, where this Court reiterated that subject always  to
the legislative com-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">554</span>
<p id="p_70">petence of the enacting authority, the tax can be levied  at
a  convenient stage, so long as the character of the  impost
is  not lost. The method of collection does not	 affect	 the
essence	 of the machinery of collection	 for  administrative
convenience. Reliance was also placed on the observations of
<a href="/doc/27891/" id="a_249">Union  of India v. Bombay Tyre International Ltd</a>., [1984]  1
SCR 347.
</p><p id="p_71">    It	was submitted by Mr. Dholakia that the	correct	 ap-
proach is to first determine whether the State	Legislature,
having regard to Entry 54 of List II to the 7th Schedule  to
the  Constitution,  can levy tax on purchase of a  class  of
goods,	which class is to be identified by reference to	 the
condition of use of such goods into other taxable goods	 and
despatch of such taxable goods outside the State. He submit-
ted  that  if it is accepted that the State could  have	 the
power to tax purchases of goods meant for use into  manufac-
ture of other taxable goods and despatch outside thereafter,
then  next  question is whether the  State  enactment  (like
section 13AA of the Bombay Act) is so formulated as to	come
within the framework described. He admitted that even if  it
did,  it would still have to be subject to (a) the  doctrine
of  pith and substance, (b) the fundamental rights, and	 (c)
<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_250">Article 301.</a>
</p><p id="p_72">    According  to Mr. Dholakia, the Act contains a  charging
section	 which	is <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_251">section 3</a>. It levies tax on	turnover  of
sales  and purchases within <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_252">section 2(36)</a> and <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_253">2(35)</a>  respec-
tively of the said Act. <a href="/doc/1647562/" id="a_254">Section 13</a> of the Act levies tax  on
purchases in accordance with rates prescribed in Schedule  C
if  the	 goods are purchased from  an  unregistered  dealer.
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_255">Section	 13A</a> levies a concessional tax on purchases  if	 the
goods  are  purchased from a registered dealer,	 provided  a
declaration  in the prescribed form is given  under  <a href="/doc/482287/" id="a_256">section
12(b)</a>  of  the Act, if the purchaser buys directly,  or	 one
under <a href="/doc/482287/" id="a_257">section 12(d)</a> if the purchaser buys through a  commis-
sion  agent. In both the forms the relevant conditions	are:
</p><p id="p_73">(a)  that the goods fall within Part ii of Schedule  C;	 and
</p><p id="p_74">(b)  that the goods bought would be used for manufacture  of
other  taxable	goods within the State and sold	 within	 the
State.	Mr. Dholakia submitted that on giving the  aforesaid
declaration,  the purchaser would have to pay only  4%	tax.
The rates prescribed in Schedule C are as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">		   Schedule 'C'
    Part	     Minimum Rate     Maximum Rate
      I			  2%		4%
      II		  6%		15%
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">555</span>
    The effect of <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_258">section 13A</a> without <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_259">section 13-AA</a>, accord-
</blockquote><p id="p_75">ing  to Mr. Dholakia, was that only those who  bought  goods
which fell into Part II, would have benefitted by the decla-
ration,	 since	the rate mentioned in <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_260">section  13A</a>  was	 4%.
Hence, those buying goods falling within Part I of  Schedule
C  had	not to give any declaration under <a href="/doc/482287/" id="a_261">section  12(b)</a>  or
12(d), as the case may be, and still manufacture the taxable
goods and despatch them outside the State. According to him,
as a result of this situation, two results emerged, i.e. (i)
the  State lost revenue because the goods manufactured	with
the help of the infrastructure provided by the State escaped
further	 tax, by goods being resold outside the	 State;	 and
</p><p id="p_76">(ii) the purchasers of raw-materials used by the manufactur-
ers for producing new taxable goods, were not being  treated
equitably because those whose purchases of goods which	fell
into Part II had to give a declaration to get the benefit of
reduced	 rate. On the other hand, those whose  purchases  of
goods  fell  in Part I, need not give  such  a	declaration.
According  to  him,  from the standpoint of  the  object  of
encouraging  resale within the State, the classification  in
form of Part I and II had no rational nexus. Therefore, that
construction should be made which may make <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_262">section 13-AA</a>  of
the Act, to avoid this mischief.
</p><p id="p_77">    According  to Mr. Dholakia, <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_263">section 13AA</a> speaks  of	 the
requirement  of additional purchase tax from those who	have
paid purchase tax, if the object of the purchases is to	 use
the goods falling in Part I of Schedule C for manufacture of
taxable	 goods	and the despatch of such goods	outside	 the
State.	He alleged it to be a fair and reasonable  construc-
tion and it will subserve the purpose of the amendment.
    It	is well settled that reasonable construction  should
be followed and literal construction may be avoided if	that
defeats	 the  manifest object and purpose of  the  Act.	 <a href="/doc/1345065/" id="a_264">See
Commissioner  of Wealth-tax, Bihar &amp; Orissa v.	Kripashankar

sioners for city of London v. Gibbs, 10 ITR Suppl. 121 HL at
</p><p id="p_78">132.  Mr. Dholakia further submitted that the  Statement  of
Objects	 &amp;  Reasons  also helps this  construction.  In	 our
opinion, he rightly submitted that because the accounts	 had
to be maintained in  a particular manner, is no criterion or
evidence for determining when the liability arises. The	 law
is that the liability to tax would be determined with refer-
ence to the interpretation of the Statute which creates	 it.
It cannot be determined by referring to another Statute.  As
contended  by  both the sides, it is well-settled  that	 the
doctrine  of pith and substance means that if  an  enactment
substantially falls within the powers expressly conferred by
the Constitution upon the Legislature
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">556</span>
which  enacted	it, it cannot be held to be  invalid  merely
because	 it incidentally encroches upon matters assigned  to
another	 Legislature. <a href="/doc/130570/" id="a_265">See Kerala State Electricity Board  v.
Indian	Aluminium  Co</a>, [1976]  SCR 552	and  <a href="/doc/806261/" id="a_266">Prafulla  Kumar
Mukherjee &amp; Ors. v. Bank of Commerce Ltd</a>., AIR 1947 PC 60 at
</p><p id="p_79">65.
    Therefore, the proper question which one should  address
to  oneself  is, whether <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_267">section 13AA</a> is in  pith  and	sub-
stance,	 not levying tax on purchase but one levying tax  on
consignment. Depending upon the answer to the question,	 the
validity of the action can be judged. Mr. Dholakia submitted
that the Act is in pith and substance, an Act levying tax on
purchase  and  not one levying tax on consignment,  and	 re-
ferred to the observations of this Court in State of  Karna-
taka  v. Shri Ranganatha Reddy, [1978] 1 SCR 641.  According
to  him,  the consignment contemplated in <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_268">section  13-AA</a>  is
only  of manufactured goods and no tax is levied under	sec-
tion  13AA in respect of such manufactured goods. He  empha-
sised as aforesaid. It is well-settled that while  determin-
ing  nature of a tax, though the standard or the measure  on
which the tax is levied may be a relevant consideration,  it
is not the conclusive consideration. One must have regard to
such other matters as decided by the Privy Council in Gover-
nor General in Council v. Province of Madras, (supra) not by
the  name of tax but to its real nature, its pith  and	sub-
stance which must determine into what category it fails. See
the  observations of <a href="/doc/1448438/" id="a_269">R.R. Engineering Co. v.  Zila  Parishad
Bareilly  &amp; Anr</a>., [1980] 3 SCR 1; in re: A  reference  under

</p><p id="p_80">915.
    On	an  analysis we find that the goods which  are	des-
patched	 are different products from the goods on  the	pur-
chase of which purchase tax was paid. The Maharashtra legis-
lation has to be viewed in the context of 46th Amendment  to
the Constitution. The 46th Amendment introduced <a href="/doc/732111/" id="a_271">Article	 269
(1)(h)</a>	which  lays  down that the proceeds of	the  tax  on
consignment  of	 goods (whether the consignment	 is  to	 the
person making it or to any other person) where such consign-
ment  takes  place  in the course of  inter-State  trade  or
commerce, will be assigned to the States. The said Amendment
also introduced Entry No. 92B in List I of the 7th Schedule.
The said Amendment was made on the consideration of the 61st
Report of the Law Commission. Entry 92B in List I of the 7th
Schedule  and  <a href="/doc/732111/" id="a_272">Article 269(1)(h)</a> of the	 Constitution  bring
within its sweep the consignment of goods by a person either
to  himself or to any other person in the course  of  inter-
State trade or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">557</span>
commerce.  <a href="/doc/67893/" id="a_273">Article 269(3)</a> gives the power to  Parliament  to
formulate the principles for determining when a	 consignment
of  goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade  or
commerce.  If Entry 92B in List I is to be given the  widest
interpretation, as it should be, it would be clear that	 the
constitutional	changes introduced by the 46th Amendment  in
<a href="/doc/1135479/" id="a_274">Article	 269</a> read with the Entry, the tax on consignment  of
goods  now comes within the exclusive legislative  field  of
Parliament.  The true test to find out what is the pith	 and
substance of the legislation is to ascertain the true intent
of the Act which will determine the validity of the Act.  If
the Parliament in exercise of its plenary power under  Entry
92B of List I imposes any tax on the despatch or consignment
of  goods,  Parliament will be competent to do	so.  It	 is,
therefore,  not	 possible to accept the	 argument  that	 the
chargeable event was lying dormant and is activated only  on
the occurrence of the event of despatch. The argument on the
construction of the enactment is misconceived. The  charging
event  is  the	event the occurrence  of  which	 immediately
attracts  the charge. Taxable event cannot be  postponed  to
the  occurrence of the subsequent condition. In that  event,
it would be the subsequent condition the occurrence of which
would  attract	the charge which will be taxable  event.  If
that  is so, then it is a duty on despatch. In that view  of
the matter, this charge cannot be sustained.
    As	mentioned hereinbefore, the section has	 been  chal-
lenged as being violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_275">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
This  attack is based on the discrimination between the	 two
types of taxes but in the way we have construed the section,
in  our	 opinion,  this question does not  survive.  It	 was
further submitted by Dr. Pal that <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_276">section 13AA</a> of the Act is
violative  of  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_277">Article 301</a> of the Constitution. It  makes  a
discrimination between the dealer/manufacturer who despatch-
es the goods outside the State and the other dealer/manufac-
turer. Both the dealer/ manufacturers purchase the goods  on
payment	 of purchase tax and use them in the manufacture  of
taxable	 goods. The incidence of additional tax on the	pur-
chase  of  goods is attracted only  when  such	manufactured
goods are despatched outside the State. If a dealer/manufac-
turer has to despatch the goods outside the State, he has to
pay  a	higher rate of tax and thus he is  discriminated  as
compared to the other dealer/manufacturer who purchases	 the
raw  material on payment of 4% purchase tax, but  despatches
the  raw  material straightaway outside the State  and	uses
them  in  the manufacturer of goods outside the	 State.	 The
High  Court held that there was no violation of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_278">Article	 301</a>
of  the Constitution. Reference was made to the decision  of

imposition  of a duty or tax in every case would not  tanta-
mount  per  se	to any infringement of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_285">Article	301</a>  of	 the
Constitution.  Only such restrictions or  impediments  which
directly or immediately impede free flow of trade,  commerce
and  intercourse  fall	within the  prohibition	 imposed  by
<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_286">Article 301.</a> A tax in certain cases may directly and immedi-
ately restrict or hamper the flow of trade, but every  impo-
sition	of tax does not do so. Every case must be judged  on
its own facts and its own setting of time and circumstances.
Unless the court first comes to the finding on the available
material  whether  or not there is an  infringement  of	 the
guarantee  under  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_287">Article  301</a> the further  question  as  to
whether	 the Statute is saved under <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_288">Article 304(b)</a> does	 not
arise.	The goods taxed do not leave the State in the  shape
of raw material, which change their form in the State itself
and  there is no question of any direct, immediate  or	sub-
stantial hindrance to a free flow of trade. On the  evidence
adduced,  we are in agreement with the High Court  that	 the
challenge to the imposition in the background of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_289">Article 301</a>
cannot be sustained and, therefore, no question whether such
imposition is saved under <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_290">Article 304(b)</a> of the Constitution
arises.
</p><p id="p_83">    In the aforesaid view of the matter and for the  reasons
mentioned  hereinbefore, it must be held that so far as	 the
appeals	 in  respect of the Haryana Act are  concerned,	 the
High  Court was right in the view it took in Goodyear  India
Ltd's case, 53 STC 163 as well as the views expressed by the
High  Court  in <a href="/doc/1583174/" id="a_291">Bata India Ltd. v. The State  of  Haryana  &amp;
Anr</a>., 54 STC 226 are correct and are affirmed. The views  of
the  High Court expressed in Des Raj Pushap  Kumar  Gulati's
case (supra) are incorrect for the reasons mentioned herein-
before.	 The  last mentioned judgment and the  judgment	 and
orders	following passed by the Punjab &amp; Haryana High  Court
are,  therefore, set aside. In the premises,  Civil  Appeals
Nos.  1166--72/85 (M/s Goodyear India Ltd. v. State of	Har-
yana  &amp; Anr.), Civil Appeal No. 1173-77 (NT)/85 (Gedore	 (I)
Pvt.  Ltd.  v. State of Haryana &amp; Anr.),  civil	 appeal	 No.
2674/86	 (M/s. Kelvinator of India Ltd. &amp; Anr. v.  State  of
Haryana	 &amp;  Ors.), Civil Appeal No. 1633 (NT)/85  F.C.I.  v.
State of Haryana &amp; Anr.) and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">559</span>
Civil Appeal No. 3033 (NT)/86 F.C.I., Karnal v. The State of
Haryana	 &amp; Ors.) are allowed and the judgment and  order  of
the High Court are set aside.
</p><p id="p_84">    Civil  Appeals  Nos. 15 12 (NT)/84 [State of  Haryana  &amp;
Anr. v. Gedore Tools (P) Ltd.] and 1515/84 [State of Haryana
&amp; Anr. v. Goodyear India Ltd. ] are dismissed. Special leave
petitions  Nos. 83988402/83 are dismissed, and for the	rea-
sons mentioned hereinbefore, civil appeal Nos. 4162/88 (<a href="/doc/373796/" id="a_292">M/s.
Wipro  Products	 Ltd.  v. State of Maharashtra	&amp;  Anr</a>.	 and
4163/88 [Hindustan Lever Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. State of Maharashtra
&amp; Anr. ] are allowed and the judgment and order of the	High
Court passed therein, are hereby set aside.
    In	the facts and the, circumstances of this  case,	 the
parties	 will pay and bear the respective costs. So  far  as
the  civil appeals Nos. 1633/85 and 3033/86  are  concerned,
wherein the appellants are the Food Corpn. of India, I allow
these  appeals	and setting aside the judgment of  the	High
Court on the ground that tax on despatch or consignment	 was
not  within the competence of the State Legislature.  I	 am,
however,  not dealing with or expressing any opinion on	 the
other  contentions of the F.C.I. that in view of the  nature
of  its business it was not liable to tax in respect of	 the
sales tax. This contention will be decided in the  appropri-
ate proceedings.
</p><p id="p_85">    So	far  as the contention regarding penalty  under	 the
Haryana	 Act,  these proceedings fail because  the  charging
provisions  fail. In so far as the penalty  proceedings	 are
impugned  on  other grounds apart from the  failure  of	 the
charging  provisions,  I am expressing no opinion  on  these
aspects.
</p><p id="p_86">RANGANATHAN, J. I agree but wish to add a few words.
    The	 question raised in these appeals is a fairly  tick-
lish  one. Simply stated, Section 9 of the  Haryana  General
Sales  Tax Act, 1973 as well as section 13AA of	 the  Bombay
Sales  Tax Act, 1959, purport only to levy a  purchase	tax.
The  tax, however, becomes exigible not on the	occasion  or
event  of purchase but only later. It materialises  only  if
the purchaser (a) utilises the goods purchased in the  manu-
facture	 of  taxable goods and (b) despatches the  goods  so
manufactured  (otherwise than by way of sale) to a place  of
business situated outside the State. The legislation, howev-
er, is careful to impose the tax only on the price at  which
the raw materials are purchased and not on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">560</span>
value of the manufactured goods consigned outside the State.
The States describe the tax as one levied on the purchase of
a  class  of  goods viz. those purchased in  the  State	 and
utilised  as raw material in the manufacture of goods  which
are  consigned	outside the State otherwise than by  way  of
sale. On the other hand, according to the  respondentsasses-
sees,  this  is nothing but a tax on  consignment  of  goods
manufactured  in  the  State to places	outside	 the  State,
camouflaged  as a purchase tax, by quantifying the  levy  of
the  tax with reference to the purchase price of  the  goods
purchased  in the State and utilised in the manufacture.  To
me it appeared as plausible to describe the levy as a tax on
purchase  of goods inside the State (which  attaches  itself
only in certain eventualities) as to describe it as a tax on
goods  consigned outside the State but limited to the  value
of the raw material purchased inside the State and  utilised
therein.  1,  therefore, had considerable  doubts  not	only
during	the  arguments but even some time thereafter  as  to
whether so long as the tax purports to be a tax on purchases
and  has a nexus, though a little distant, with purchase  of
goods  in  the State, the State Government's  competence  to
impose	such  a	 tax should not be upheld.  But,  on  deeper
thought,  I am inclined to agree with the conclusion  of  my
learned	 brother.  It is one thing to levy  a  purchase	 tax
where  the character and class of goods in respect of  which
the tax is levied is described in a particular manner (vide,
<a href="/doc/1432872/" id="a_293">Andhra	Sugars Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. State</a>, [1968] 1 SCR 705 and  a
case  like  the present where the tax, though  described  as
purchase tax, actually becomes effective with reference to a
totally different class of goods and, that too, only on	 the
happening  of  an  event which is unrelated to	the  act  of
purchase. The "taxable event", if one might use the  expres-
sion  often used in this context, is the consignment of	 the
manufactured  goods and not the purchase. I also agree	with
my learned brother that the decision in <a href="/doc/1863875/" id="a_294">State of Tamil	Nadu
v. Kandaswami</a>, [1975] 36 S.T.C. 191, though rendered in	 the
context of an analogous provision, does not touch the  issue
in the present case.
</p><p id="p_87">    The	 above distinction becomes significant	particularly
in the background of the constitutional amendments  referred
to  in	the judgment of my learned brother.  These  indicate
that  there were efforts at sales tax avoidance	 by  sending
goods manufactured in a State out of raw materials purchased
inside to other States by way of consignments rather than by
way  of sales attracting tax. This situation lends force  to
the  contention of the assessees that the States, unable  to
tax  the exodus directly, attempted to do so  indirectly  by
linking the levy ostensibly to the "purchases" in the State.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">561</span>
<p id="p_88">    Viewing  the  impugned  statutory  provisions  from	 the
perspectives indicated above, I agree with my learned broth-
er that the appeals have to be allowed as held by him.
T.N.A.			 Appeals and petitions disposed of.
