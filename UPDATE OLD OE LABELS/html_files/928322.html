HEADNOTE:
The prosecution case was that the appellant, a	non-resident
Indian at Dubai, hatched a conspiracy along with four others
to  cheat  the	Bank at Chandigarh. in	furtherance  of	 the
conspiracy,  the  appellant got credit facility	 by  way  of
Foreign	 Letters of Credit and issued proforma	invoices  of
his   concern  and  addressed  to  the	Bank   through	 the
establishments	of other accused.  The Manager of the  Bank,
another accused, in confabulation with
544
the appellant and other accused, being in-charge of  foreign
exchange  department,  issued Foreign letter  of  Credit  in
violation  of  import  policy.	The  Bills  of	Lading	were
addressed  to the Bank.	 The cable confirmation of the	Bank
was sent to appellant's concern at Dubai for confirmation of
discrepancy.   The appellant confirmed correctness  thereof.
Placing reliance thereon, authority letter was issued by the
Bank  and cables were sent subsequent thereto to  remit	 the
amount-. to the Dubai Bank through one Irving Trust Company,
At  the instance of accused Anand, The Dubai  Bank  informed
the  Bankat Chandigarh that the discrepancy in the  document
adaptable to accused Anand and claimed to have inspected the
goods on board in the vessel.  On receipt of the information
from  the  appellant's concern at Dubai, full amount  is  US
Dollars 4,39,200 was credited against all the three  Letters
of Credit on discount basis.
The  investigation  established that the vessel was  a	non-
existent  one  and  three Foreign  Letters  of	Credit	were
fabricated  on	the  basis  of	false  and  forged  shipping
documents  submitted  by the appellant to  the	Dubai  Bank.
Thus the Bank at Chandigarh was cheated of an amount of	 Rs.
40,30,329.
The  accused  were charge-sheeted under	 section  read	with
<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_21">sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_22">468</a>, and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_23">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a>.
The  Trial Court discharged all the accused of the  offenses
on  the	 ground	 that  conspiracy  and	the  acts  done	  in
furtherance thereof had taken place outside India and as  no
sanction under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_25">section 188</a>, Code of Criminal Procedure	1973
was produced, the prosecution was not maintainable.
The  High  Court in revision held that the  conspiracy	took
place  at  Chandigarh  and  the	 overt	acts  committed	  In
pursuance  of that conspiracy at Dubai constituted  offences
under  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_26">sections 420</a>,<a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_27">467</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_28">471</a> IPC., and they were  triable
at Chandigarh without previous sanction of the Central Govt.
The  High Court setting aside the order of discharge of	 the
trial  Court,  directed to continue further  proceedings  in
accordance  with  law.	 That order of the  High  Court	 was
challenged  under  this	 appeal under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_29">Article	136</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
The  appellant	contended  that he was not a  privy  to	 the
conspiracy  and	 the  conspiracy  did  not  take  place	  at
Chandigarh; and that even assuming that some of the offences
were  committed in India, by operation of <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_30">section  188</a>	read
with the proviso thereto with a non-obstanti clause, absence
of sanction by the
545
Central Govt. barred the jurisdiction of the Courts in India
to take cognisance of or to enquire into or try the accused.
The  respondents submitted that the conspiracy to cheat	 the
Bank  was  hatched  at	Chandigarh;  that  all	the  accused
committed  over	 acts in furtherance of	 the  conspiracy  at
Chandigarh and therefore, the sanction of the Central  Govt.
was not necessary.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court,
HELD: Per K. Ramaswarmy, J.
1.01. Judicial power of a State extends to the punishment of
all  offences  against the municipal laws of  the  State  by
whomsoever committed within the territory.  It also has	 the
power to punish all such offences wherever committed by	 its
citizen.  The general principle of international law is that
every  person  be  it a citizen or foreigner  who  is  found
within	a foreign State is subjected to, and  is  punishable
by,  its  law.	 Otherwise the criminal	 law  could  not  be
administered   according   to  any   civilised	 system	  of
jurisprudence. (553F)
1.02.  Conspiracy  may he considered to be a march  under  a
banner	and  a	person may join or drop	 out  in  the  march
without	 the  necessity	 of the change in the  text  on	 the
banner.	 In the comity of International Law, in these  days,
commiting  offences  on	 international	scale  is  a  common
feature.  The offence of conspiracy would be a useful weapon
and  there would exist no contact in municipal laws and	 the
doctrine of autrefois convict or acquit would extend to such
offences.  The comity of nations are duty bound to apprehend
the  conspirators  as  soon as they set their  feet  on	 the
country	 territorial limits and nip the offence in the	bud.
(564-F-G)
2.01.  <a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_31">Section 120-A</a> of the I.P.C. defines  'conspiracy'  to
mean that when two or more persons agree to do, or cause  to
be  done an illegal act, or an act which is not	 illegal  by
illegal	 means such an agreement is designated	as  criminal
conspiracy".  No agreement except an agreement to commit  an
offence	 shall amount to a criminal conspiracy, unless	some
act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties  to
such agreement in furtherance thereof. (557-C)
546
2.02. <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_32">Section 120-B</a> of the I.P.C. prescribes punishment	 for
criminal   conspiracy.	 It  is	 not  necessary	 that	each
conspirator must know all the details of the scheme nor be a
participant  at	 every	state.	It is  necessary  that	they
should	agree  for  design  or	object	of  the	 conspiracy.
Conspiracy  is	conceived  as  having  three  elements:	 (1)
agreement  (2)	between	 two or more  persons  by  whom	 the
agreement is effected; and (3) a criminal object, which	 may
be  either  the	 ultimate  aim	of  the	 agreement,  or	 may
constitute the means, or one of the means by which that	 aim
is  to	be accomplished.  It is immaterial whether  this  is
found in the ultimate objects. (554-E)
2.03. Conspiracy to commit a crime itself is punishable as a
substantive  offence and every individual offence  committed
pursuant to the conspiracy is separate and distinct  offence
to  which  individual offenders are  liable  to	 punishment,
independent of the conspiracy. (556-D)
2.04.  The  agreement  does not come to	 an  end  with	it-.
making,	 but  would  endure  till  it  is  accomplished	  or
abandoned  or proved abortive.	Being a continuing  offence,
if  any	 acts or omissions which constitute an	offence	 are
done  in  India or outside its	territory  the	conspirators
continuing to be parties to the conspiracy and since part of
the acts were done in India, they would obviate the need  to
obtain	sanction of the Central Govt.  All of them need	 not
he present in India nor continue to remain in India. (556-E)
2.05.  An  agreement between two or more persons  to  do  an
illegal	 act  or  legal acts by illegal	 means	is  criminal
conspiracy.  If the agreement is not an agreement to  commit
an  offence, it does not amount to conspiracy unless  it  is
followed  up by an overt act done by one or more persons  in
furtherance  of the agreement.	The offence is	complete  as
soon  as  there	 is meeting of minds and  unity	 of  purpose
between the conspirators to de that illegal act or legal act
by  illegal  means.   Conspiracy  itself  is  a	 substantive
offence and is distinct from the offence to commit which the
conspiracy  is	entered	 into.	It  is	undoubted  that	 the
general	 conspiracy  is	 distinct from	number	of  separate
offences   committed   while  executing	  the	offence	  of
conspiracy.    Each   act   constitutes	  separate   offence
punishable, independent of the conspiracy. (563-F-G)

referred to.
2.06. A conspiracy is a continuing offence and continues  to
subsist and committed wherever one of the conspirators	does
an  act	 or series of facts.  So long  as  it-;	 performance
continues, it is a continuing offence till it is executed or
rescinded  or frustrated by choice or necessity A  crime  is
complete  as soon as the agreement is made, but it is not  a
thing  of the moment It does not end with the making of	 the
agreement.   It	 will continue so long as there are  two  or
more  parties  to  it intending to  carry  into	 effect	 the
design.	 Its continuance is a threat to the society  against
which  it  was aimed at and would be dealt with as  soon  as
that  jurisdiction  can properly claim the power to  do	 so.
The conspiracy designed or agreed abroad will have the	same
effect as in India,. when part of the acts, pursuant to	 the
agreement  are agreed to be finalised or done, attempted  or
even frustrated and vice versa. (564-H, 565-<a href="/doc/1225724/" id="a_38">A)

2.07.  Sanction	 under	<a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_40">section	 188</a>  is  not  a   condition
precedent to take cognizance of the offence.  If need be  it
could  he  obtained  before trial  begins.   Conspiracy	 was
initially  hatcher  at Chandigarh and though  its-elf  is  a
completed offence, being continuing offence, even  accepting
appellant's case that he was at Dubai and part of conspiracy
and overt acts in furtherance

thereof had taken place at Dubai and partly at Chandigar and
in  consequence	 thereof  other offences  had  been  ensued.
Since the offences have been committed during the continuing
course	of  transaction	 culminates in	cheating  P.N.B.  at
Chandigarh, the need to obtain sanction for various  officer
under proviso to<a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_41"> s. 188</a> is obviated.  Therefore, there is no
need to obtain sanction from Central Govt.  The case may  he
different if the offences were committed  out side India and
are completed in themselves without conspiracy. (566-D-E)

Per R.M. Sahai, J. (Concurring)
1.1. Language of the <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_48">section 188</a>, Code of Criminal Procedure
is  plain  and	simple.	 It operates  where  an	 offence  is
committed  by  a  citizen  of  India  outside  the  country.
Requirements are, therefore, one--commission of an  offence;
second-by  an Indian citizen; and third-that it should	have
been committed outside the country. (567-D)
1.2.  Substantive  law	of  extra-territory  in	 respect  of
criminal  offences is provided for by <a href="/doc/1127741/" id="a_49">Section 4</a> of  the	 IPC
and  the  procedure to inquire and try it  is  contained  in
<a href="/doc/1340161/" id="a_50">Section	 1</a> <a href="/doc/719844/" id="a_51">88</a> Cr.  P.C. Effect of these sections is that  an
offence	 committed by an Indian citizen outside the  country
is deemed to have been committed in India. (567-E)
1.3. Since the proviso to <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_52">Section 188</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_53">Cr.P.C</a>. begin-.	with
a non obstinate clause its observance is mandatory.  But  it
would  come  into  play	 only if  the  principal  clause  is
applicable,  namely,  it is established that an	 offence  as
defined	 in  dause 'n'of <a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_54">Section 2</a> of the Cr.P.C.  has	been
committed  and	it has been committed outside  the  country.
(567-G)
549
1.4.  What has to be examined at this stage is if the  claim
of  the appellant that the offence under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_55">Section  120B</a>	read
with  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_56">Section 420</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_57">Section 471</a> of the IPC were  committed
outside the country.  An offence is deemed in the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_58">Cr.P.C</a>. to
mean  an Act or omission made punishable by any law for	 the
time  being  in force.	None of the offences for  which	 the
appellant  has	been  charged has residence as	one  of	 its
ingredients. (567-H, 568-A)
1.5. The-jurisdiction to inquire or try vests under  <a href="/doc/974069/" id="a_59">Section
177</a> in the Court in whose local jurisdiction the offence  is
committed.  It is thus the commission of offence and not the
residence of the accused which is decisive of  jurisdiction.
When two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done  an
illegal act or an act which is illegal by illegal means such
agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy under  <a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_60">Section
120A</a>  of  the  IPC.   The  ingredients	of  the	 offence  is
agreement  and not the residence.  Meeting of minds of	more
than  two persons is the primary requirement Even if  it  is
assumed that the appellant was at Dubai and he entered	into
an agreement with his counterpart sifting in India to do  an
illegal	 act  in India the offence of conspiracy  came	into
being  when agreement was reached between the two.  The	 two
minds met when talks oral or in writing took place in India.
Therefore, the offence of conspiracy cannot be said to	have
been committed outside the country. (568-B-C)
1.6. If a foreign national is amenable to jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1693935/" id="a_61">Section	 179</a>  of  the Cr.P.C. a NRI cannot  claim  that	 the
offence	 shall be deemed to have been committed outside	 the
country merely because he was not physically present (568-<a href="/doc/84475/" id="a_62">F)
Mobarik	 Ali Ahmed v. The State of Bombay</a>, AIR 1957 SC	857,
referred to.
1.7.  An offence is committed when all the  ingredients	 are
satisfied.   The section having used the word  'offence'  it
cannot	be understood as part of the offence.	<a href="/doc/1693935/" id="a_63">Section	 179</a>
Cr.P.C. empowers a court to try an offence either at a place
where  the offence is committed or the	consequences  ensue.
On  the	 allegations in the complaint the act  or  omissions
were  committed	 in India.  In any case the  consequence  of
conspiracy,  cheating  and  forging having  taken  place  at
Chandigarh the offence was not committed outside the country
therefore  the	provisions of Sec. 188 Cr.   P.C.  were	 not
attracted. (569-B)

ground	that  conspiracy and the acts  done  in	 furtherance
thereof	 had  taken place outside India and,  therefore	 the
sanction under <a href="/doc/1127398/" id="a_66">section 188</a> Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 for
short  the 'Code' is mandatory.	 Since no such sanction	 was
produced the prosecution is not maintainable.  On  revision,
the  High Court of Punjab and Haryana in  Criminal  Revision
No.  443 of 1990 by order dated June 3, 1992 held, that	 the
conspiracy  had taken place at Chandigarh.  The	 overt	acts
committed   in	pursuance  of  that  conspiracy	  at   Dubai
constituted  offences  under  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_67">sections	420</a>,  <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_68">467</a>  and	<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_69">471</a>,
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_70">I.P.C</a>.,	 are  all  triable at  Chandigarh  without  previous
sanction  of  the  central Govt.  The  order  of  discharge,
therefore, was set aside and the appellant and other accused
were directed to be present through their counsel in  person
in  the Trial Court on July 17,1992 to enable the  court  to
take  further  proceedings  in accordance  with	 law.	This
appeal has been filed by the appellant alone under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_71">Art.	 136</a>

punishable  under<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_101"> s. 120-B</a> etc.	 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_102">I.P.C</a>. or to  proceed	with
trial.	In Chapter VA, conspiracy was brought on statute  by
the  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_103">Amendment Act</a>, 1913 (8 of 1913).  <a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_104">Section 120-A</a> of	 the
I.P.C.	defines 'conspiracy' to mean that when two  or	more
persons	 agree to do, or cause to be done an ilegal act,  or
an  act	 which	is  not illegal by  illegal  means  such  an
agreement  is  designated  as  "criminal  conspiracy".	  No
agreement  except  an agreement to commit an  offence  shall
amount to a criminal conspiracy, unless some act besides the
agreement  is done by one or more parties to such  agreement
in  furtherance	 thereof.   <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_105">Section  120-B</a>  of	the   I.P.C.
prescribes  punishment for criminal conspiracy.	 It  is	 not
necessary that each conspirator must know all the details or
the  scheme  nor  be a participant at every  stage.   It  is
necessary that they should agree for design or object of the
conspiracy.    Conspiracy  is  conceived  as  having   three
elements:  (1) agreement (2) between two or more persons  by
whom the agreement is effected-, and (3) a criminal  object,
which  may be either the ultimate aim of the  agreement,  or
may constitute the means, or one of the means by which	that
aim is to be accomplished.  It is immaterial whether this is
found in the ultimate objects.	The common law definition of
criminal conspiracy was stated first by Lord Denman in jones
case  (1832 B &amp; A D 345) that an indictment  for  conspiracy
must "charge a conspiracy to do an unlawful act by  unlawful
means"	and was elaborated by Willies, J. on behalf  of	 the
judges while referring the question to the House of Lords in
Mulcahy v. Reg [1868] L.R. 3 H.L. 306 and the House of Lords
in unanimous decision reiterated in Quinn v.  Leathem  (1901
AC 495 at 528) as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      A	 conspiracy  consists  not  merely  in	 the
	      intention	  of  two  or  more,  but   in	 the
	      agreement.  of two or more to do ,in  unlawful
	      act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful  means.
	      So  long as such a design rests  in  intention
	      only  it is not indictable, When two agree  to
	      carry it into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">555</span>

	      "The  (list of the offence is an agreement  to
	      break  the  law.	 The  parties  to  such	  an
	      agreement	  will	 be   guilty   of   criminal
	      conspiracy,  though the illegal act agreed  to
	      be  done has not been done.  So too, it is  an
	      ingredient of the offence that all the parties
	      should  agree to do a single illegal act.	  It
	      may  comprise  the commission of a  number  of
	      acts.   Under <a href="/doc/704346/" id="a_107">section 43</a> of the  Indian  Penal
	      Code,  an	 act would be illegal if fit  is  an

</p><p id="p_19">In  Yashpal v. State of Punjab [1977] SCR 2433 the rule	 was
laid as follows
	      "The very agreement, concert or league is	 the
	      ingredient   of  the  offence.   It   is	 not
	      necessary that all the conspirators must	know
	      each  and	 every detail of the  conspiracy  as
	      long as they are co-participators in the	main
	      object  of  the conspiracy.  There may  be  so
	      many devices and techniques adopted to achieve
	      the  common goal of the conspiracy  and  there
	      may  be division of performances in the  chain
	      of actions with one object to achieve the real
	      end of which every collaborator must be  aware
	      and  in  which  each  one	 of  them  must	  be
	      interested.  There must be unity of object  or
	      purpose  but there may be plurality  of  means
	      sometimes even unknown to one another, amongst
	      the  conspirators.   In  achieving  the	goal
	      several  offences may be committed by some  of
	      the  conspirators even unknown to the  others.
	      The  only	 relevant factor is that  all  means
	      adopted  and  illegal acts done  must  be	 and
	      purported	 to be in furtherance of the  object
	      of  the  conspiracy even though there  may  be
	      sometimes misfire or over-shooting by some  of
	      the conspirators".

necessarily prove that the conspirators expressly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">556</span>
agreed	to  do	or cause to be done  the  illegal  act.	 the
agreement  may be proved by necessary implication.  <a href="/doc/836678/" id="a_110">In	Noor

119,  it  was  held that<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_111"> s. 120-B</a>  IPC	makes  the  criminal
conspiracy as a substantive offence which offence postulates
an  agreement between two or more persons to do or cause  to
be  done an act by illegal means.  If the offence itself  is
to  commit  an offence, no further steps are  needed  to  be
proved to carry the agreement into effect.  <a href="/doc/434894/" id="a_112">In R. K.  Dalmia
&amp; Anr. v. The Delhi Administration It</a> 963] 1 SCR 253, it was

conspiracy must know all the details of the conspiracy.	  In
Shivanarayan Laxminarayan &amp; Ors. State of Mahrashtra &amp;	Ors.
[1980] 2 SCC 465, this court emphasized that a conspiracy is
always	hatched	 in secrecy and it is impossible  to  adduce
direct evidence of the same. The offence can be only  proved
largely	 from  the  inferences drawn from  acts	 or  illegal
omission  committed  by the conspirators in pursuance  of  a
common design.
</p><p id="p_21">The  question  then  is	 whether  conspiracy  is  continuing
offence.   Conspiracy to commit crime it self is  punishable
as  a  substantive  offence  and  every	 individual  offence
committed  pursuant  to	 the  conspiracy  is  separate	 and
distinct offence to which individual offenders are liable to
punishment,  independent  of the conspiracy.   Yet,  in	 our
considered view, the agreement does not come to an end	with
its  making,  but would endure till it	is  accomplished  or
abandoned  or proved abortive.	Being a continuing  offence,
if  any acts or omissions which constitutes-an offence,	 are
done  in  India or outside its	territory  the	conspirators
continuing to be parties to the conspiracy and since part of
the acts were done in India, they would obviate the need  to
obtain sanction of the Central Govt. all of them need not be
present	 in  India  nor continue to  remain  in	 India.	  In

facts, stated thus
	      "A. 2 was the Managing Director of the  Rayala
	      Corporation  Ltd.	  Which	 manufactures  Halda
	      Typewriters.   A. 1 was an Export	 Manager  of
	      ASSAB.  A. 1 and A.2 conspired that A.2  would
	      purchase	material  on behalf of	his  Company
	      from  ASSAB instead of M/s Atvidaberos,  which
	      provided	raw  material.	 A.2  was  to  over-
</p><p id="p_22">	      invoice the value of the goods by 40 per	cent
	      of  true value and that he should be paid	 the
	      difference  of 40 per cent on account  of	 the
	      aforesaid	 over-invoicing by crediting  it  to
	      A.2's  personal  account	at  Stockholm  in  a
	      Swedish Bank and requested A. 1 to help him in
	      opening the account in Swenska Handles Banken,
	      Sweden and to have further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">557</span>
	      deposits	to his personal account from  ASSAB.
	      A. 1 agreed to act as requested by A.2 and A.2
	      made arrangements with ASSAB to intimate to A.
	      1	 the  various  amounts	credited  to   A.2's
	      account  and asked A. 1 to keep a	 watch	over
	      the correctness of the account and' to further
	      intimate to him the account position from time
	      to   time	 through  unofficial  channels	 and
	      whenever	A. 1 come to India.  A. 1 agreed  to
	      comply with this request.	 This agreement	 was
	      entered  into between the parties in the	year
	      1963  at Stockholm and again in Madras in	 the
	      year 1965.  The question was whether Sec. 120-<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_114">
	      B	 of the Indian Penal Code</a> was  attracted  to
	      these facts".
</p><p id="p_23">Per majority, Jaganmohan Reddy, J. held that the gist of the
offence defined in<a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_115"> s. 120-A</a> IPC, which is itself  punishable
as  a substantive offence is the very agreement between	 two
or more persons to do or cause to be done an illegal act  or
legal act by illegal means, subject, however, to the proviso
that  where the agreement is not an agreement to  commit  an
offence,  the  agreement  does not amount  to  a  conspiracy
unless it is followed up by an overt act done by one or more
persons in pursuance of such an agreement.  There must be  a
meeting	 of  minds in the doing of the illegal	act  or	 the
doing  of a legal act by illegal means.	 If. in	 furtherance
of  the	 conspiracy, certain persons are induced  to  do  an
unlawful act without the knowledge of the conspiracy or	 the
plot they cannot be held to be conspirators, though they may
be guilty of an offence pertaining to the specific  unlawful
act.  The offence of conspiracy is complete when two or more
conspirators  have agreed to do or cause to be done  an	 act
which is itself an offence, in which case no overt act	need
be  established.   It  was contended  in  that	regard	that
several	 acts which constitute to make an offence  under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_116"> s.
120-B</a> may be split up in parts and the criminal liability of
A.  1 must only be judged with regard to the part played  by
him.  He merely agreed to help A.2 to open an account in the
Swedish Bank, having the amounts lying to the credit of	 A.2
with Atvidaberg to that account and to help A.2 by keeping a
watch over the account.	 Therefore, it does not amount to  a
criminal  conspiracy.	While negating	the  argument,	this
court held thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "It   appears  to	 us  that  this	 is  not   a
	      justifiable contention, because what has to be
	      seen is whether the agreement between A. 1 and
	      A.2  is a conspiracy to do or continue  to  do
	      something	 which is illegal and, if it is,  it
	      is immaterial whether the agreement to do	 any
	      of  the acts in furtherance of the  commission
	      of  the offence do not strictly amount  to  an
	      offence.	the entire agreement must be  viewed
	      as a whole and it has to be ascertained as  to
	      what  in fact the conspirators intended to  do
	      or the object they wanted to achieve".
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">558</span>
<p id="p_24">Thus,	this   court,	though	not  in	  the	context	  of
jurisdictional issue, held that the agreement not illegal at
its inception would become illegal by subsequent conduct and
an  agreement to do an illegal act or to do a legal  act  by
illegal	 means,	 must  be  viewed as  a	 whole	and  not  in
isolation.   It	 was also implied that the  agreement  shall
continuing- till the object is achieved.  The agreement does
not get terminated by merely entering into an agreement	 but
it  continues to subsist till the object is either  achieved
or terminated or abandoned.

the  offence  of  conspiracy,  it  was	contended  that	 the
conspiracy  was	 entered  into and was	completed  in  South
Africa and, therefore, the Indian Courts had no jurisdiction
to  try	 the  accused for the offence  of  conspiracy.	 The
Division  Bench held that though the conspiracy was  entered
in  a  foreign	country and was completed  as  soon  as	 the
agreement  was made, yet it was treated to be  a  continuous
offence	 and  the  persons continued to be  parties  to	 the
conspiracy when they committed acts in India.	Accordingly,
it  was held that the Indian Courts had jurisdiction to	 try
the  offence of conspiracy.  In U.S. v. Kissal 218  US	601,
Holmes, J. held that conspiracy is a continuous offence	 and
stated	"is a perversion of natural thought and	 of  natural
language to call such continuous co-operation of a cinema to
graphic series of distinct conspiracies rather than to	call
it a single one... a conspiracy is a partnership in criminal
purposes.  That as such it may have continuation in time. is
shown  by the rule that overt act by one partner may be	 the
act  of all without any new agreement specifically  directed
to  that act".	In Ford v. U. S. 273 US 593 at 620  to	622,
Tuft, C.J. held that conspiracy is a continuing offence.
In  Director  of public Prosecutions v. Door and  Ors.	1973
Appeal Cases 807 (H.L.), the five respondents hatched a plan
abroad, i.e. Belgium and Morocco and worked out the  details
to  import cannabis into the United States via	England,  In
pursuance  thereof two vans with cannabis concealed in	them
were shipped from Morocco to Southampton; the other van	 was
traced at Liverspool, from where the vans were to have	been
shipped	 to America and the cannabis in it was found.	They
were charged among other offences with conspiracy to  import
dangerous  drugs.  At the trial, the  respondents  contended
that  the Courts in England had no jurisdiction to try	them
on  the	 count of conspiracy since the conspiracy  had	been
entered	 into abroad.  While rejecting the contention,	Lord
Wilberforce held (at page 817)
	      "The   present  case  involves   international
	      elements the accused are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">559</span>
	      aliens and the conspiracy was initiated abroad
	      but  there  can  be no question  here  of	 any
	      breach  of any rules of international  law  if
	      the)  are prosecuted in this  country.   Under
	      the objective territorial principle ( use	 the
	      terminology of the Harward Research in  Inter-
	      national	Law) or the principle of  University
	      (For the prevention of the trade in  narcotics
	      falls  within  this description)or  both,	 the
	      courts of this country have a clear right,  if
	      not  a duty, to prosecute in  accordance	with
	      our  municipal  law.  The position  as  it  is
	      under  the international law it not,  however,
			    determinative  of the question  whether,  unde
r
	      our  municipal law, the acts committed  amount
	      to  a  crime.   That  has	 to  be	 decided  on
	      different principles.  If conspiracy to import
	      drugs  were a statutory offence, the  question
	      whether  foreign	conspiracies  were  included
	      would  be	 decided  upon	the  terms  of	 the
	      statute.	Since it is (if at all) a common law
	      offence,	this question must be  decided	upon
	      principle	 and authority- In my  opinion,	 the
	      key  to a decision for or against the  offence
	      charged  can  be	found in an  answer  to	 the
	      question	why  the common law  treats  certain
	      actions  as  crimes.   And  one  answer	must
	      certainly	 be because the actions in  question
	      are  a  threat to the Queen's peace or  as  we
	      would now perhaps say, to society.  Judged  by
	      this test, there is every reason for, and none
	      that I can see against, the prosecution.	Con-
	      spiracies	 are  intended to  be  carried	into
	      effect,  and  one reason why, in	addition  to
	      individual  prosecution of  each	participant,
	      conspiracy  charges  are	brought	 is  because
	      criminal	action	organised and  executed,  in
	      concert  is more dangerous than an  individual
	      breach  of  law.	 Why,  then,  restrain	from
	      prosecution  where the relevant  concert	was,
	      initially,    formed   outside   the    United
	      Kingoom?...The  truth is that, in	 the  normal
	      case  of a conspiracy carried out,  or  partly
	      carried out, in this country, the location  of
	      the formation of the agreement is	 irrelevant;
	      the  attack upon the laws of this	 country  is
	      identical	 wherever the conspirators  happened
	      to  commit;  the	"conspiracy"  is  a  complex
	      formed  indeed, but not separately  completed,
	      at the first meeting of the plotters".

	      Queen's  peace by arresting them	and  putting
	      them in trial for conspiracy whether they	 are
	      British subjects or foreigners and whether  or
	      not conspiracy is a crime under the law of the
	      country in which the conspiracy was born".
At  page  835  it was held that	 the  respondents  conspired
together in England notwithstanding the fact that they	were
abroad	when they entered into the agreement which  was	 the
essence of the conspiracy.  That agreement was and  remained
a continuing agreement and they continued to conspire  until
the  offence  they  were conspiring to commit  was  in	fact
committed.   Accordingly, it was held that  the	 conspiracy,
though entered into abroad, was committed in England and the
courts	in England and jurisdiction.  The  ratio  emphasizes
that  acts  done  in furtherance  of  continuing  conspiracy
constitute part of the cause of action and performance of it
gives jurisdiction for English Courts to try the accused.
In  Trecy  v. Director of Public  Prosecutions	1971  Appeal
Cases  537 at 563 to ,(H.  L.). the facts of the  case	were
that  the appellant therein posted in the Isle of  Wright  a
letter	written	 by  him and addressed to  Mrs.	 X  in	West
Germany	 demanding  money  with	 menaces.   The	 letter	 was
received by Mrs. X in West Germany.The appellant was charged
with  black  mail indictable s. 21 of the Theft	 Act,  1968.
While denying the offence, it was contended that the  courts
in  England were devoted of jurisdiction.   Over-ruling	 the
said objection, Lord Diplock at page 562 observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "The  State  is under a  correlative  duty  to

	      determining by threat of punishment  conducted

	      "The seems to follow owen as logical corollary

illustrated  that  a conspiracy D 2 England to	violate	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_34">Archbold in Criminal Pleadings, Evidence and Practice,	42nd
edition (1985) Chapter 23, in para 28-32 at p. 2281,  Wright
on  Conspiracies  and Agreements at pages  73-74,  Smith  on
Crimes	at page 239 and Russel on Crime, 12th edition,	page
613  stated  that  conspiracy is a  continuing	offence	 and
liable	to prosecution at the place of making the  agreement
and also in the country where the acts are committed.
Thus,  an  agreement between two or more persons  to  do  an
illegal	 act  or  legal acts by illegal	 means	is  criminal
conspiracy.  If the agreement is not an agreement to  commit
an  offence, it does not amount to conspiracy unless  it  is
followed  up by an overt act done by one or more persons  in
furtherance  of the agreement.	The offence is	complete  as
soon  as  there	 is meeting of minds and  unity	 of  purpose
between the conspirators to do that illegal act or legal act
by  illegal  means.   Conspiracy  itself  is  a	 substantive
offence and is distinct from the offence to commit which the
conspiracy  is	entered	 into.	It  is	undoubted  that	 the
general	 conspiracy  is	 distinct from	number	of  separate
offences   committed   while  executing	  the	offence	  of
conspiracy.    Each   act   constitutes	  separate   offence
punishable,  independent  of the conspiracy.   The  law	 had
developed several or different models or technics to  broach
the scope of conspiracy.  One such model is that of a chain,
where each party performs even without knowledge of other  a
role  that  aids  succeeding parties  in  accomplishing	 the
criminal objectives of the conspiracy.	An illustration,  of
a single conspiracy, its parts bound together as links in  a
chain, is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">564</span>
the  process of procuring and distributing narcotics  or  an
illegal	 foreign  drug for sale in different  parts  of	 the
(,lobe.	 In such a case, smugglers, middlemen and  retailers
are privies to a single conspiracy to smuggle and distribute
narcotics.  The smugglers knew that the middlemen must	sell
to  retailers-,	 and the retailers knew that  the  middlemen
must  buy  of  importers of someone or	another.   Thus	 the
conspirators at one end of the chain knew that the  unlawful
business  would not, and could not, stop with their  buyers,
and  those at the other end knew that it had not begun	with
their settlers.	 The accused embarked upon a venture in	 all
parts of which each was a participant and an abettor in	 the
sense  that,  the  success of the part	with  which  he	 was
immediately concerned, was dependent upon the success of the
whole.	It should also be considered as a spoke in the	hub.
There is a rim to bind all the spokes to gather in a  single
conspiracy.   It  is not material that a rim is	 found	only
when  there  is	 proof	that each spoke	 was  aware  of	 one
another's existence but that all promoted in furtherance  of
some  single illegal objective.	 The traditional concept  of
single agreement can also accommodate the situation where  a
well  defined group conspires to commit multiple  crimes  so
long  as  all  these  crimes are the  objects  of  the	same
agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship, and the
conspiracy continues to subsist though it was entered in the
first  instance.   Take	 for  instance	that  three  persons
hatched	 a conspiracy in country 'A' to kill 'D' in  country
'B'  with  explosive  substance.  As far  as  conspiracy  is
concerned,  it	is  complete  in country  'A'  one  of	them
pursuant  thereto carried the explosive substance and  hands
it  over to third one in the country 'B' who implants  at  a
place  where  'D'  frequents and got  exploded	with  remote
control.   'D' may be killed or escape or may  be  diffused.
The conspiracy continues-till it is executed in country	 'B'
or  frustrated.	 Therefore, it is a continuing act  and	 all
are  liable for conspiracy in country 'B' though  first	 two
are  liable to murder with aid of<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_120"> s. 120-B</a> and the last	 one
is  liable  under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_121"> s. 302</a> or 307 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_122">IPC</a>, as the  case  may	 be.
Conspiracy  may be considered to be a march under  a  banner
and  a person may join or drop out in the march without	 the
necessity  of the change in the text on the banner.  In	 the
comity	of  International  Law, in  these  days,  committing
offences  on international scale is a common  feature.	 The
offence	 of  conspiracy would be a useful weapon  and  there
would  exist no conflict in municipal laws and the  doctrine
of  autrefoes  convict	or  acquit  would  extend  to	such
offences.  The comity of nations are duty bound to apprehend
the  conspirators  as  soon as they set their  feet  on	 the
country territorial limits and nip the offence in the bud.
A conspiracy thus, is a continuing offence and continues  to
subsist and committed wherever one of the conspirators	does
an  act	 or  series  of	 acts.	 So  long  aits	 performance
continues, it is a continuing offence till it is executed or
rescinded or frustrated by choice or necessity.	 A crime  is
complete as soon as the agreement  is made, but it is not  a
thing of the moment.  It does not end with the making of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">565</span>
agreement.   It	 will continue so long as there are  two  or
more  parties  to  it intending to  carry  into	 effect	 the
design.	 Its continuance is a threat to the society  against
which  it  was aimed at and would be dealt with as  soon  as
that  jurisdiction  can properly claim the power to  do	 so.
The conspiracy designed or agreed abroad will have the	same
effect	as in India, when part of the acts, pursuant to	 the
agreement  are agreed to be finalised or done, attempted  or
even frustrated and vice versa.

course	of  transaction	 culminated in	cheating  P.N.B.  at
Chandigarh, the need to obtain sanction for various offences
under  proviso to<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_143"> s. 188</a> is obviated.Therefore, there is  no
need to obtain sanction from Central Govt.  The case may  be
different if the offences were committed out side India	 and
are  completed	in themselves without  conspiracy.   Perhaps
that  question	may  be different for which  we	 express  no
opinion	 on the facts of this case.  The ratio in  Fakhruila
Khan has no application to the facts in this case.   Therein
the accused were charged for offences under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_144"> s. 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_145">419</a>, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_146">467</a>
and  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_147">468</a>  and the offences were committed in  native  State,
Mysore.	 As a result the courts in British India i.e. Madras
province  had  no jurisdiction to try  the  offence  without
prior  sanction.   Equally in Verghese's case  the  offences
charged under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_148"> s. 409</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_149">IPC</a> had also, been taken place outside
British	 India.	  Therefore, it was held that  the  sanction
under  s, 188 was necessary.  The ratio in Kailash  Sharma's
case  is  not  good  at	 law.	The  appeal  is	 accordingly
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_38">R.M.  SAHAI J. While agreeing with Brother Ramaswamy, J.,  I
propose	 to add a few words.  Prosecution of  the  appellant
under  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_150">Section	120B</a> read with <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_151">Section 420</a> and	<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_152">471</a>  of	 the
Indian Penal Code (in brief '<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_153">IPC</a>') was assailed for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">567</span>
absence	 of  sanction  under <a href="/doc/1127398/" id="a_154">Section  188</a>  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code (in brief 'Cr.  P. C.'). Two submissions were
advanced,  one	that  even though  criminal  conspiracy	 was
itself	an offence but if another offence was  committed  in
pursuance  of it outside India then sanction was  necessary;
second-an offence is constituted of a number of	 ingredients
and  even if one of them was committed outside	the  country
<a href="/doc/1127398/" id="a_155">Section 188</a> of the Cr.	P.C. was attracted.
Language  of the section is plain and simple.	It  operates
where an offence is committed by a citizen of India  outside
the country.  Requirements are, therefore, one-commission of
an offence; second  by an Indian citizen; and third-that  it
should have been committed outside the country.	 Out of	 the
three  there is no dispute that the appellant is  an  Indian
citizen.   But	so  far	 the other  two	 are  concerned	 the
allegations  in	 the complaint are that	 the  conspiracy  to
forge  and cheat the bank was hatched by the  appellant	 and
others	in India.  Whether it was so or not, cannot be	gone
into at this stage.
</p><p id="p_39">What  is the claim then?  Two fold one the appellant was  in
Dubai  at the relevant time when the offence is	 alleged  to
have been committed.  Second, since the bills of lading	 and
exchange  were prepared and were submitted to  the  Emirates
National  Bank at Dubai and the Payment too was received  at
Emirates  National  Bank in Dubai, the	alleged	 offence  of
forgery and cheating were committed outside India.  Is	that
so?  Can the offence of conspiracy or cheating or forgery on
these allegations be said to have been committed outside the
country?   Substantive law of extra-territory in respect  of
criminal  offences is provided for by <a href="/doc/1127741/" id="a_156">Section 4</a> of  the	 IPC
and  the  procedure to inquire and try it is  contained	 the
<a href="/doc/1127398/" id="a_157">Section	 188</a>  Cr.P.C. Effect of these sections	is  that  an
offence committed by an Indian citizen, outside the  country
is  deemed  to	have been committed in	India.	 Proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1127398/" id="a_158">Section 188</a> Cr.	 P.C. however provides the safeguard for the
NRI   to  guard	 against  any  unwarranted   harassment	  by
directing,  "that,  notwithstanding anything in any  of	 the
preceding sections of this Chapter, no such offence shall be
inquired  into	or tried in India except with  the  previous
sanction of the Central Government."
</p><p id="p_40">Since  the  proviso begins with a non obstinate	 clause	 its
observance  is mandatory.  But is would come into play	only
if  the	 principal  clause  is	applicable,  namely,  it  is
established  that  an offence as defined in  clause  'n'  of
<a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_159">Section 2</a> of the Cr.P.C. has been committed and it has	been
committed outside the country.
</p><p id="p_41">What has to be examined at this stage is if the claim of the
appellant  that	 the offence under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_160">Section  120B</a>  read	with
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_161">Section	 420</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_162">Section 471</a> of  the	IPC  were  committed
outside the country.  An offence is defined in the Cr.	P.C.
to mean an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">568</span>
act  or	 omission made punishable by any law  for  the	time
being  in  force.   None  of  the  offences  for  which	 the
appellant  has	been  charged has residence as	one  of	 its
ingredients.  The jurisdiction to inquire or try vests under
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_163">Section	 177</a>  in the Court in whose local  jurisdiction	 the
offence is committed.  It is thus the commission of  offence
and  not the residence of the accused which is	decisive  of
jurisdiction.  When two or more persons agree to do or cause
to  be	done an illegal act or an act which  is	 illegal  by
illegal	 means	such  agreement	 is  designated	 a  criminal
conspiracy  under <a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_164">Section 120A</a> of the IPC.  The	 ingredients
of  the offence is agreement and not the residence.  meeting
of   minds  of	more  than  two	 persons  is   the   primary
requirement.   Even if it is assumed that the appellant	 was
at  Dubai  and	he  entered  into  an  agreement  with	 his
counterpart  sitting in India to do an illegal act in  India
the offence of conspiracy came into being when agreement was
reached between the two.  The two minds met when talks	oral
or  in writing took place in India.  Therefore, the  offence
of conspiracy cannot be said to have been committed  outside
the  country.  <a href="/doc/84475/" id="a_165">In Mobarik Ali Ahmed v. The State of  Bombay</a>.
AIR  1957 SC 857 this court while dealing with the  question
of jurisdiction of the Courts to try an offence of  cheating
committed  by  a foreign national held that the	 offence  of
cheating took place only when representation was made by the
accused	 sitting  in Karachi to the  complaints	 sitting  in
Bombay.	  The  argument founded on  corporeal  presence	 was
rejected and it was observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      "What  is,  therefore, to be seen	 is  whether
	      there is any reason to think that a  foreigner
	      not  corporeally	present at the time  of	 the
	      commission  of the commission of	the  offence
	      does  not	 fall within the  range	 of  persons
	      punishable   therefor  under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_166">  the	 Code</a>.	  It
	      appears  to us that the answer must be in	 the
	      negative unless there is any recognised  legal
	      principle	 on  which  such  exclusion  can  be
	      founded  or the language<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_167"> of the  Code</a>  compels
	      such a construction".
</blockquote><p id="p_42">If  a  foreign national is amenable  to	 jurisdiction  under
<a href="/doc/1693935/" id="a_168">Section	 179</a>  of the Cr.  P.C. a NRI cannot claim  that	 the
offence	 shall be deemed to have been committed outside	 the
country merely because he was not physically present.
Preparation  of bill of lading at Dubai or payment at  Dubai
were not isolated acts.	 They were part of chain  activities
between	 the  appellant	 and his  associates  with  whom  he
entered into agreement to cheat the bank at Chandigarh.	 Any
isolated act or omission committed at Dubai was insufficient
to  constitute an offence.  The illegal act  of	 dishonestly
inducing  the  bank  at	 Chandigarh  was  committed  not  by
preparation  of	 bill  at  Dubai  but  its  presentation  in
pursuance  of  agreement  to  cheat.   The  submission	thus
founded	 was  on  residence or on preparation  of  bills  of
lading or encashment at Dubai are of no consequence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">569</span>
<p id="p_43">Nor  is there any merit in the submission that even part  of
the  offence  would  attract  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_169">Section  189</a>  as	the  section
operates  when	offence	 is  committed	outside	 India.	  An
offence is committed when all the ingredients are satisfied.
The  section  having  used the word  offence  it  cannot  be
understood  as	part of the offence.   <a href="/doc/1693935/" id="a_170">Section	179</a>  Cr.P.C.
empowers  a court to try an offence either at a place  where
the offence is committed or the consequences ensue.  On	 the
allegations  in	 the  complaint the act	 or  omissions	were
committed  in  India.	In  any	 case  the  consequence	  of
conspiracy,  cheating  and  forging having  taken  place  at
Chandigarh the offence was not committed outside the country
therefore  the	provisions  of Sec. 188 Cr.  P.C.  were	 not
attracted.
