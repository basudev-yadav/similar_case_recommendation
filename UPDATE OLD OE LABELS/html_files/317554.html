<p id="p_2">INTRODUCTION


	The extent of bar of jurisdiction of Civil Court under Section 80 of the 
Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as 'the BPT Act') is 
the question involved in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order 
dated 21.03.2003 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in S.A. 
No.303 of 1986.
</p>
	
<p id="p_3">BACKGROUND FACT:
</p>
<p id="p_4"> 	The basic fact of the matter is not much in dispute.  
</p>
<p id="p_5"> 	In or about 1895, some American Missionaries established a religious 
institution (Church) at Valsad for propagation of protestant faith of Christian 
religion and to establish and manage the churches  for the people professing 
that faith.  The object of the 'Brethren Church' was to propagate the work of 
the church of the brethren in western India in order to reveal Christ by 
means of evangelistic, educational, medical, literary, industrial school, social 
and charitable activities leading to the establishment of the kingdom of God.   
A Continuation Committee is said to have been appointed in the year 1930 
by the representatives of the Brethren Church  and other churches in a 
Round Table Conference held in New Delhi with a view to consider the 
modalities and other details for amalgamation of churches.  The Committee 
is said to have worked out a broad basis for the unification of churches 
which was accepted by the participant churches whereupon a new committee 
came into being in the year 1951.  The First District Church of the Brethren 
in India  (Brethren Church) was registered as a religious society under the 
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_1">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 bearing Registration No.1202/44; the object 
whereof was to promote the work of the church of the brethren in Western 
India with the same object wherefor the church was established.  Another 
Round Table Conference is said to have been held in the year 1951 at New 
Delhi resulting in appointment of a new committee known as 'Negotiating 
Committee' in order to continue deliberations for the union of churches; five 
other associations were included in the Committee, namely, The Council of 
the Baptist Churches in North India, The Church of India, Pakistan, Burma 
and Ceylon, The Methodist Church (British and Australian Conference),  
The Methodist Church in Southern Asia and The United Church o Northern 
India.  The Brethren Church (First District Church of the Brethren) was 
registered as a public trust in Gujarat bearing No.E-643, Bharuch in terms of 
the BPT Act.  The Negotiating Committee made its final recommendations 
which came to be known as the '4th  Plan of the Union' which was published 
in a book entitled 'Plan of Church  Union in North India and Pakistan'; the 
principal recommendation of the Committee being that all the six uniting 
churches should be dissolved and united to become one church to be known 
as "The Church of Northern India" (hereinafter referred to as "the CNI) 
which should be the legal continuation and successor of the united churches 
and all the properties, assets, obligations etc. thereof  would vest in or 
devolve on CNI.  The booklet of  the 4th Plan is said to have been circulated 
to the governing bodies of the uniting churches with a view to enable them 
to deliberate thereover and to take appropriate decision in that behalf.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">	On or about 17.02.1970, a Resolution bearing No.70/08 is said  to 
have been passed by the majority of members for effecting the dissolution as 
a society under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_2">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860.  The Negotiating 
Committee thereafter on or about 29.11.1970 took a decision to formally 
inaugurate the CNI at Nagpur.  The Brethren Church allegedly placed the 
said Resolution No.70/08 at the altar wherein it was explicitly affirmed that 
the CNI shall be deemed to be the legal continuation and successor of the 
brethren church and the rights, titles, claims, estates and the interests of the 
church together with its privileges and obligations shall vest in the CNI as its 
legal heir on or from the date of inauguration.  The Church of North India 
Trust Association was registered as a company under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a>, 
1956, in the year 1976.  The original defendant Nos. 1 to 4 who were said to 
be initially part of the CNI and were parties to the resolution dated 
17.02.1970 raised a contention that the Brethren Church continued to exist.  
They started obstructing the functioning of the CNI, and in particular the 
worship in churches, and asserted that the First Brethren Church had not 
been dissolved and continued and they represented the same.   
</p>
<p id="p_7">	The original plaintiffs, namely, Ambelal Okarial Patel, Shantilal 
Lakshmichand Purani, Bishop T.L. Christachari and Samuel Nagarji Bhagat 
(since deceased) said to be the former office bearers of the Brethren Church 
filed a suit in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Bharuch, marked 
as Civil Suit No.72 of 1979. 
</p>

<p id="p_8">	The CNI was impleaded as defendant No. 5 therein, although no relief 
thereagainst was claimed contending that it was a necessary and/or a proper 
party.  The Brethren Church were not made parties in the said suit.  It is 
stated at the Bar that the said churches were impleaded at a later stage of the 
proceedings but the said applications were later on dismissed.  The original 
defendant No. 4 in his written statement filed in the said suit took a 
categorical stand that there had been no dissolution of the Brethren Church 
and their separate entity was not lost.  According to the said defendant they 
were temporarily suspended till it was revived again and, thus, they were 
entitled to work for and on behalf of the Brethren Church.  In the said 
proceedings, certain interim orders were passed wherewith we are not 
concerned.  However, with a view to complete the narration of facts, we may 
notice that the CNI filed an application for its registration before the Charity 
Commissioner in terms of the provisions of the BPT Act, which was granted 
by an order dated 12.5.1980 with effect from 19.11.1971.  The CNI 
thereafter filed a change report before the Charity Commissioner on or about 
15.1.1981.  Admittedly, the said application has not yet been disposed of.
</p>	
<p id="p_9">	While things stood thus, the Charity Commissioner was impleaded as 
a party in the suit and in its written statement a plea was raised that the 
jurisdiction of the Civil Court was barred in terms of Section 80 of the BPT 
Act contending :
</p>
<p id="p_10">"4.  In  view of  provisions of Bombay Public Trusts Act, 
1950.  The question whether or not a trust of particular 
property is the property of such trust,  is to be decided 
exclusively by the Deputy or Assistant Charity 
Commissioner appointed under the Act, the Assistant 
Charity of the Brethren "as a public trust at No. E-643 
(Bharuch) under the Bombay Public Trusts ct, 1950.  The 
decision of the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bharuch 
unless set aside as provided under the Act, is final and 
conclusive.  It is further submitted that the jurisdiction of 
the Hon'ble Court is also barred under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_4">Section 80</a> of the 
Act.  The plaintiffs are, therefore, not entitled to the 
reliefs as prayed for by them.  The suit, deserves to be 
dismissed."
</p>

<p id="p_11">PROCEEDINGS:
</p>
<p id="p_12">	The learned Civil Judge by judgment and decree dated 31.3.1984 
decreed the suit; findings in support whereof would be noticed a little later. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">	An appeal was preferred thereagainst on or about 4.5.1984 by the 
original defendants in the Court of the District Judge, Bharuch, which was 
marked as RCA No.72 of 1984.  By judgment and decree dated 11.8.1986, 
the said appeal was allowed whereagainst the CNI (Appellant herein) 
preferred  a Second Appeal before the Gujarat High Court, which was 
marked as Second Appeal No.303 of 1986.  On or about 29.3.2002, the 
Charity Commissioner is said to have filed a detailed affidavit in support of 
the Change Report No.665/81.  By reason of the impugned judgment and 
order dated  21.3.2003, the said Second Appeal was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	Hence the Appellant is before us.
</p>
<p id="p_15">CONTENTIONS:
</p>
<p id="p_16">	Mr. C.A. Sundaram, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf 
of the Appellant would submit that the Court of First Appeal as also the 
High Court committed a manifest error in passing the impugned judgments 
insofar they failed to take into consideration the scope and purport of the 
suit.  According to the learned counsel, the learned Trial Judge had rightly 
decreed the suit having taken into consideration the fact that the matter 
relating to formation of churches and their merger in the name of  the CNI 
was not a matter which could be determined by the Charity Commissioner in 
exercise of his powers under the BPT Act.  The learned counsel would 
contend that the society and the trust are two separate entities.  The Society 
being not a juristic person although cannot own any property but manage the 
affairs of the trust which would be the owner of the property.  According to 
the learned counsel the Court of First Appeal and the High Court 
misdirected themselves in passing the impugned judgments insofar as they 
proceeded on the premise that having regard to the fact that properties 
belonging to the Brethren Church were registered in the books maintained 
by the Charity Commissioner under <a href="/doc/1765565/" id="a_5">Section 17</a> of the Act, any church 
affected thereby would fall within his jurisdiction and consequently the 
dissolution of the society and managing of the churches and consequently 
their merger would also come within the purview of the provisions of the 
BPT Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_17">	Mr. Sundaram would submit that a society registered under the 
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_6">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 and a trust  registered under the BPT Act 
are two different entities.  Whereas the activities and the dealings of the 
latter may fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the authorities specified 
under the BPT Act, the activities of the society would be governed by the 
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_7">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860.  The Civil Court, therefore,  according to 
Mr. Sundaram, had the requisite jurisdiction to deal with the question as to 
whether the resolution adopted in the year 1970 resulting in dissolution and 
the merger of the churches was valid.  Such a dispute, Mr. Sundaram would 
argue, is  beyond the jurisdiction of the Charity Commissioner.  The learned 
counsel would urge that once the dissolution of the Brethren Church and 
consequent merger in the Appellant is held to be valid, in terms of the 
Section 26 of the BPT Act, the Charity Commissioner is enjoined with a  
duty to make necessary changes in the books maintained under Section 17 of 
the BPT Act. Sections 31,  50, 51, 79 and 80 of the BPT Act, according to 
Mr. Sundaram, do not clothe the Charity Commissioner or any other 
authority thereunder to determine a question as regard the validity of a 
resolution of a society and/or its merger.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">	Mr. K. Ramamoorthy, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf 
the Brethren Church supporting the Appellant would contend that 
administration of a religious property must be understood in its proper 
context.  According to the learned counsel, administration of a property 
belonging to trust may not have anything to do with the actual possession or 
dealing with the administration thereof.  
</p>	
<p id="p_19">	The learned counsel would draw our attention to the judgments in 
<a href="/doc/1279066/" id="a_8">State of Madras vs. Kunnakudi Melamatam and Another</a> [AIR 1965 SC 
1570]; Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka (deceased) Through L.Rs. vs. Jasjit Singh 
and Others [(1993) 2 SCC 507] and <a href="/doc/677949/" id="a_9">Rajasthan State Road Transport 
Corporation and Another vs. Krishna Kant and Others</a>  [(1995) 5 SCC 75] 
and contended that in various situations, the Civil Court and the Probate 
Court alone have been held to have exclusive jurisdiction and not the 
Charity Commissioner.  According to the learned counsel, the Charity 
Commissioner being a creature of statute must exercise its jurisdiction 
within the four-corners thereof and the matters which do not come within the 
purview of  the BPT Act must necessarily be left to the jurisdiction of the 
Civil Court.  According to the learned counsel the provisions of Section 50 
of the BPT Act do not show that requirements contained therein must be 
carried out even in a case where the Charity Commissioner may not have 
any jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p id="p_20">	As regard interpretation of Section 31 of the BPT Act, the learned 
counsel would contend that the provision thereof  bars hearing and decision 
in the suit and not the institution thereof.  Although in the year 1979, the  
Appellant herein was not registered but as before hearing of the suit was 
taken up, it became registered in the year 1980, the Civil Judge had the 
jurisdiction to hear and decide the said suit even it involved dealing with the 
trust property.  
</p>
<p id="p_21">	Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
contesting Respondents, on the other hand, would submit that for the 
purpose of determining the question as to whether the suit before the Civil 
Court was maintainable or not, the averments made in the plaint must be 
read as a whole and substratum  thereof must be noticed.  As adjudication 
was sought for in relation to administration and possession of the properties 
of a trust; the suit was not maintainable.  It was pointed out that the true 
identity of the Appellant had not been disclosed, i.e., as to whether it is a 
trust registered under the BPT Act, or a company registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_10">Indian 
Companies Act</a>, 1956.  
</p>
<p id="p_22"> 	The learned counsel submitted that although a distinction is sought to 
be made between the activities of a society which runs the administration of 
a trust and a trust which owns the property, no such distinction was made in 
the proceedings before the courts below.  Drawing our attention to certain 
grounds taken in the Special Leave Petition, Mr. Ahmadi would urge, that in 
fact the finding of the High Court to the effect that the society and the trust 
are two separate entities had been questioned.  Taking us through the plaint, 
the learned counsel would contend that plaintiffs as also the learned Trial 
Judge proceeded on the basis that the trust had ceased to exist and wherever 
the expression "Brethren Church" has been used in the judgment, the learned 
Trial Court referred to it as a trust and not as a society.  
</p>
<p id="p_23">Mr. Ahmadi would contend that the learned Trial Court proceeded on 
the basis that there existed inconsistencies between the provisions of the 
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_11">Societies Registration Act</a> which is a <a href="/doc/51092038/" id="a_12">Parliamentary Act</a> and the BPT Act, 
which is a <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_13">State Act</a> and relying on or on the basis of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_14">Article 
254</a> of the Constitution of India, it came to the decision that the former shall 
prevail over the latter.  It is in that context, issues were decided and not on 
the basis that the society and the trust are two separate entities.  We were 
taken through the relevant paragraphs of the BPT Act and in particular 
<a href="/doc/1694789/" id="a_15">Sections 2(10)</a>, <a href="/doc/1694789/" id="a_16">2(13)</a>, <a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_17">13(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/1765565/" id="a_18">17</a>, <a href="/doc/1657935/" id="a_19">18</a>, <a href="/doc/1099380/" id="a_20">19</a>, <a href="/doc/1853329/" id="a_21">20</a>, <a href="/doc/161462810/" id="a_22">21</a>, <a href="/doc/85254613/" id="a_23">22</a>,  <a href="/doc/86680883/" id="a_24">31</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_25">36</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_26">50</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_27">51</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_28">74</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_29">79</a> 
and <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_30">80</a> by Mr. Ahmadi to show that the said provisions clearly indicate that 
the BPT Act is a self-contained code and deals with all questions governing 
a trust and the properties held by it.  It was urged that the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/52485102/" id="a_31">Section 26</a> thereof must be read in that context.  The learned counsel would 
submit that the provisions of Section 26 of the BPT Act, in the facts and 
circumstances of the case, would have  no application where a suit was 
expressly barred which regulates management of a trust, as the BPT Act  
created a specialized machinery to determine the issues governing the same.
</p>
<p id="p_24">Drawing our attention to the prayer (b) of the plaint, Mr. Ahmadi 
would argue that the same would squarely fall within the purview of 
Sections 50 and 51 of the BPT Act and, thus, would be barred as no 
permission of the Chief Commissioner was sought for and obtained.  
</p>
<p id="p_25">The learned counsel would contend that the plea that the suit related to 
the affairs of the society is merely a ruse or a camouflage.  It was argued that 
the society itself is a religious trust and, thus, both stand on the same footing 
and in that view of the matter, the suit will not be maintainable.  
</p>
<p id="p_26">The learned counsel would further submit that a finding of fact had 
been arrived at by the Court of Appeal that the Brethren Church had not 
ceased to exist, this Court should not interfere therewith.  
</p>
<p id="p_27">Mr. M.N. Shroff, the learned  counsel appearing on behalf of the 
Charity Commissioner, adopted the submission of Mr. Ahmadi and would 
further contend that the substantial issue before the learned Civil Judge was 
as to whether the Brethren Church which was registered as trust had ceased 
to exist and/or stood dissolved or not.
</p>


<p id="p_28">SOCIETIES REGISTRATION ACT, 1860

<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_32">The Societies Registration Act</a> was enacted, as it was found expedient 
that provisions should be made for improving the legal condition of societies 
established for the promotion of literature, science, or the fine arts, or for the 
diffusion of useful knowledge, the diffusion of political education and for 
charitable purposes. 
</p>
<p id="p_29"><a href="/doc/1694789/" id="a_33">Section 2</a> of the Societies Registration Act provides for memorandum 
of association which, inter alia, must contain the name of the society and the 
objects of the society.  A society which is formed for charitable purpose may 
also carry on its activities. The words 'charitable purposes' includes 
religious purposes.  <a href="/doc/343062/" id="a_34">Section 4</a> provides for annual list of managing body to 
be filed stating names, addresses and occupations of the governors, council,

against the society is to be filed in the name of the President, Chairman or 
Principal Secretary or trustees of such society as may be determined by the 
rules and regulations thereof.  
</p>
<p id="p_31">	<a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_36">Section 13</a> of Societies Registration Act provides for dissolution of

event of any dispute arising among the said 
governing body or the members of the society, the 
adjustment of its affairs shall be referred to the

<p id="p_92">	<a href="/doc/1996908/" id="a_83">In Dhulabhai and Others vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh and 
Another</a> [(1968) 3 SCR662], Hidayatullah, CJ summarized the following 
principles relating to the exclusion of jurisdiction of civil courts :
</p>	
<p id="p_93">(a)	Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunals, 
the civil court's jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is 
adequate remedy to do what the civil courts would normally do in a 
suit.  Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases where the 
provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the 
statutory tribunals has not acted in conformity with the fundamental 
principles of judicial procedure.
</p><p id="p_94">(b)	Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the court, an 
examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy 
or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not 
decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. 
Where there is no express exclusion, the examination of the 
remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the 
intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be 
decisive.  In the latter case, it is necessary to see if the statute creates a 
special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the 
right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the said 
right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted, 
and whether remedies normally associated with actions in Civil 
Courts are prescribed by the said statute or not.
</p><p id="p_95">(c)	Challenge to the provisions of the particular Act as ultra vires cannot 
be brought before tribunals constituted under that Act.  Even the High 
Court cannot go into that question on a revision or reference from the 
decision of the tribunals.
</p><p id="p_96">(d) 	When the provision is already declared unconstitutional or the 
constitutionality of any provision is to be challenged, a suit is open.  A 
writ of certiorari may include a direction for refund if the claim is 
clearly within the time prescribed by the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_84">Limitation Act</a> but it is not a 
compulsory remedy to replace a suit.
</p><p id="p_97">(e)	Where the particular Act contains no machinery for refund of tax 
collected in excess of constitutional limits or illegally collected, a suit 
lies. 
</p><p id="p_98">(f)	Questions of the correctness of the assessment, apart from its 
constitutionality, are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit 
does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or 
there is an express prohibition in the particular Act.  In either case, the 
scheme of the particular Act must be examined because it is a relevant 
enquiry.
</p><p id="p_99">(g)	An exclusion  of the jurisdiction of the civil court is not readily to be 
inferred unless the conditions above set down apply.

has the jurisdiction to determine a part of the relief claimed, it will not 
confine itself thereto and reject the plaint in its entirety. For the purpose of 
determination of question as to whether the suit is barred, the averments 
made in the plaint are germane. [See Sopan Sukhdeo Sable and Others Vs.

ANALYSIS OF BPT ACT:
</p>

<p id="p_101"> 	The BPT Act is a special law.  It confers jurisdiction upon the Charity 
Commissioner and other authorities named therein.  The statute has been 
enacted by the Parliament in public interest to safeguard the properties 
vested in the trusts as also control and management thereof so that the trust 
property may not be squandered or the object or purport for which a public 
trust is created may not be defeated by the persons having control thereover.  
A society may be created either for charitable or religious purposes as also 
for other purposes.  A society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_89">Societies Registration Act</a> 
is not a juristic person.  It cannot own any property.  The properties 
belonging to a society admittedly vest in the trustees.  In terms of Section 
2(13) of the BPT Act, a society is also a charitable trust.  <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_90">Both the Act</a>s are 
regulatory in nature.  The object and purport of both the Acts are clear and 
the provisions thereof do not contain any obscurity.  It has not been argued 
before us, as was done before the learned Trial Judge, that there exists any 
inconsistency between the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_91">Societies Registration Act</a> which 
is a <a href="/doc/51092038/" id="a_92">Parliamentary Act</a>, on the one hand, and the BPT Act, which is a <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_93">State 
Act</a>, on the other.  The core question which had been raised before us is as to 
whether the Society managing or governing the trust having a separate 
entity; in relation to its affairs the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred.  
</p>
<p id="p_102">ANALYSIS OF THE AVERMENTS MADE IN THE PLAINT

 	With a view to determine the said question it is necessary to consider 
the averments made in the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_103"> 	The Brethren Church has its history which has been traced in 
paragraph 1 of the plaint.  Paragraph 2 speaks of registration of the church 
under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_94">Societies Registration Act</a> in the year 1944 and registered under 
BPT Act after the same came into force.  
</p>
<p id="p_104"> 	It has been averred that the resolution of the Brethren Church affirmed 
that C.N.I. would be deemed to be legal continuation and successor of the 
Brethren Church and rights, title, claims, estates and interest of this Church 
together with its privileges and obligations shall, as from the date of 
inauguration, vest in C.N.I. as its legal heir.  The Church, thus, ceased to 
exist as separate entity both as a society and as a trust.  Although it is 
contended that, as provided in the constitution of C.N.I., the Church of North 
India Trust Association came to be registered as a company under the 
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_95">Companies Act</a> in the year 1976 but if the vesting had 
already taken place in C.N.I. as far back as in the year 1970, the question of 
trust property vesting in a company would not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_105"> 	The records do not show that the said company had ever taken any 
decision as regard control and management of the Trust and/ or had dealt 
with the properties belonging to the Brethren Church.
</p>
<p id="p_106"> 	It is also not in dispute that local churches or congregations which 
desired to function on the basis of the old constitution were at liberty to do 
so till the 3rd Ordinary Synod of C.N.I. which was to be held in 1977.
</p>
<p id="p_107"> 	According to the plaintiffs, most of the churches or congregations 
under the Gujarat Diocesan Council implemented the said chapter.  The 
church or congregation at Valsad although decided to adopt the said 
constitution, but it is contended that in the intervening period the property 
Committee (Property Trust Board) of the former Brethren Church continued 
to manage the properties, estate, etc. of Valsad Church as an agent of and on 
behalf of the Gujarat Diocesan Council.  
</p>
<p id="p_108"> 	The defendant Nos. 1 to 4 who were residents of Valsad and Navsari; 
took exceptions to the decision of the Synod to terminate the interim period 
with effect from 7th October, 1977 and held a meeting on 12th November, 
1978.
</p>
<p id="p_109"> 	A resolution had been adopted by the said defendants along with 
others asserting that their independent unit would hold all the movable and 
immovable properties, deposit in a bank and cash in hand of the church in its 
properties wherefor a special committee was constituted.
</p> 
<p id="p_110"> 	The defendant Nos. 2 to 4 are said to the members of the said 
committee and defendant No. 1 claims to be the Pastor of the Brethren 
Church.  Admittedly, a decision of the executive committee of the Gujarat 
Diocesan Council taken by it at its meeting held on 11th November, 1978 
was stated to be illegal by the defendant Nos. 1 to 4.  It is averred:
</p>
<p id="p_111">"The defendants Nos. 1 and 2 also claim to be the 
Treasurer and Secretary respectively of the said 
"Valsad Brethren Church".  These dissidents are 
acting in the name of the former Brethren Church 
and have been writing letters as office bearers of 
former Brethren Church to the Valsad District 
Co-operative Bank, the Ankleshwar Branch of 
the Broach District Central Co-operative Bank 
etc., asking them not to deal with the members of 
the legally constituted Pastorate committee of 
Ankleshwar and Valsad and asserting that they 
are the only persons legally entitled to deal with 
the financial affairs of the Ankleshwar and 
Valsad Pastorates.  Besides, defendant No. 2, 
styling as a secretary of Brethren Church has 
complained to the authorities that the 20 local 
Pastorates under the Gujarat Diocesan Council 
do not function in the name of Brethren Church 
and do not collect funds in the name of the 
Brethren Church.  A similar complaint was made 
by him to the Assistant Charity Commissioner 
Broach who had the matter inquired into.  The 
defendant No. 2, again, purporting to act as a 
Secretary of the Valsad Brethren Church, wrote a 
letter on 20th June, 1979 to the legally elected 
Treasurer of the Ankleshwar church challenging 
the latter's authority to act as such Treasurer.  
The defendant No. 3 and some of his associates 
residing at Jalapore, Taluka Navsari, District 
Valsad, have issued a statement dated 8th July, 
1979 declaring their intention to sever all their 
connections with C.N.I. and to function as an 
independent unit with effect from 15th July, 1979 
in the name of Brethren Church, Jalalpore.  By 
the said statement, the members of the C.N.I. at 
Jalalpore have been directed not to use or occupy 
the church."
</p>
<p id="p_112"> 	The aforementioned action on the part of the defendant Nos. 1 to 4 
and their associates was the subject matter of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_113"> 	In the aforementioned context, the plaintiffs had questioned the 
actions and/ or activities of the defendant Nos. 1 to 4 and other dissidents 
insofar as they tend to prevent or hinder the plaintiffs and other members of 
the Pastorate from acting under and in accordance with the said decisions 
and resolutions of the Gujarat Diocesan Council and the constitution of 
Synod violate and infringe the legal rights of these persons to do so and are 
illegal.  
</p>
<p id="p_114"> 	The Appellant herein was joined as defendant No. 5 in the said suit, 
although no relief had been claimed against the original defendant No. 5 
who is the Appellant before us.  The status of the defendant No. 5 has not 
been disclosed in the plaint.  The legal status of Church of North India has 
not been disclosed in the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_115"> 	It is accepted that the defendant No. 5  Appellant has got itself 
registered as a trust only in the year 1980.  It also stands admitted that a 
change report has been filed by the Appellant before the Commissioner of 
Charity in the year 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_116"> 	We have noticed hereinbefore that as regard the correctness or 
otherwise of functioning of the congregation of Ankleshwar and Valsad had 
been the subject matter of complaints before the authorities under the BPT 
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_117"> 	One of the causes of action for instituting the suit is said to be 
constitution of a special committee by the defendant Nos. 1 to 4; resolution 
dated 12th November, 1978 was passed and the obstructions created by them 
to the plaintiffs and other members of the Pastorates through the actions of 
the Plaintiffs and other members of the Pastorates in the name of the former 
Brethren Church.
</p>
<p id="p_118"> 	The plaintiffs made their position clear when they categorically stated 
in paragraph 21 that the suit inter alia involved questions as to the rights of 
property of the former Brethren Church.
</p>
<p id="p_119"> 	In the aforementioned premise, plaintiffs had prayed for the following 
reliefs:
</p>
<p id="p_120">"(a) It may please be declared that the former First 
District Church of Brethren has ceased to exist.
</p>
<p id="p_121">(b) It may please be declared that the Church of 
North India is the legal continuation and successor 
of the said First District Church of Brethren 
together with the right, title, claim, interest in or 
over its properties and the constitution, decisions 
and resolutions of the Church of North India, its 
Synod and Gujarat Diocesan Council are binding 
on all the Pastorates on Gujarat which were 
functioning as local Churches or congregations 
under the First District Church of Brethren.
</p>
<p id="p_122">(c) The defendants No. 1 to 4 and their associates 
may be restrained by a perpetual injunction from 
acting in any manner contrary to the constitution, 
decisions and resolutions of the church of North 
India its Synod and Gujarat Diocesan Council and 
from obstructing in any manner the plaintiffs and 
other members/ office bearers of these pastorates 
under the Church of North India in acting in 
accordance with the said constitution, decisions

possession of the Churches and their properties.

</p>

<p id="p_125">DETERMINATION:
</p>
<p id="p_126"> 	The plaint nowhere suggests that the society and the trust had ever 
been treated as two different entities.  No case has been made in the plaint to 
the effect that the society as registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_96">Societies Registration Act</a> 
plays any role or discharges any function which is not done by the trustees 
of the trust.  It also does not appear from a perusal of the plaint that the 
society and the trust comprises of different persons or for different functions 
to perform.  In fact in paragraph 2 of the plaint it is accepted that the Church 
which was registered as a society under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_97">Societies Registration Act</a> was a 
public trust as defined under Section 2(13) of the BPT Act.  The ownership 
of movable and immovable properties at the places mentioned in the plaint is 
referable to the congregations under the Brethren Church.  It is not alleged 
that whereas the properties belong to the trust it was managed by the society.  
The plaint furthermore does not disclose that the decision as regard 
dissolution of the churches and congregation of Brethren Church had been 
taken by anybody other than the trustees.  The committees constituted for the 
aforementioned purpose, viz., Continuation Committee and Negotiating 
Committee, evidently were represented by the authorities of the 
congregations and not of any society.  A decision, as would appear from the 
averments made in paragraph 6 of the plaint, to dissolve six uniting 
Churches and merge the same into one, viz., the Church of Northern India 
(C.N.I.) so as to make the latter a legal continuation and successor of the 
United Churches and all the properties, assets, obligations, etc. of these 
uniting churches would vest in or dissolve on C.N.I.  The very fact that a 
decision having been taken as regard the properties, assets, obligations of the 
United Churches, the same would mean that they would vest in the trust to 
be created for the said purpose and not for the benefit of any society.
</p>
<p id="p_127"> 	We are not oblivious of the fact that the Resolution adopted in the 
meeting held on 17th February, 1968 allegedly fulfilled all the requirements 
for such resolution as provided in the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_98">Societies Registration Act</a> but it is now 
beyond any controversy that the society having not owned any property, 
their transfer in favour of a new society was impermissible in law.  In terms 
of <a href="/doc/143764/" id="a_99">Section 5</a> of the Societies Registration act, all properties would vest in the 
trustees and only in case in absence of vesting of such properties in trustees 
the same would be deemed to have been vested for the time being in the 
governing body of such property.  In this case, it is clear that the properties 
have vested in the trustees and not in the governing body of the society.
</p>

<p id="p_128"> 	There is nothing on record to show that the concerned churches were 
being managed by the societies registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_100">Societies Registration 
Act</a>.  In any event, it stands accepted that the dispute as regard dissolution of 
societies and adjustment of their affairs should have been referred to the 
principal court of original civil jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_129"> 	The suit in question also does not conform to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_101">Section 
13</a> of the Societies Registration Act.
</p>
<p id="p_130"> 	<a href="/doc/1853329/" id="a_102">Section 20</a> of the Act provides that the societies enumerated therein 
can only be registered under the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_131"> 	Unless a suit is filed in terms of <a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_103">Section 13</a> of the Act, the Society is 
not dissolved.  Even assuming that the society stands dissolved in terms of 
its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, the same would 
not ipso facto mean that the properties could be adjusted amongst the 
members of the society in terms of the provisions of the said Act.  
Concededly, the properties of the trust being properties of the religious trust 
had vested in such trust.  Such a provision, we have noticed hereinbefore, 
also exist in the BPT Act.  Thus, only because the society has been 
dissolved, ipso facto the properties belonging to the trust cannot be said to 
have been adjusted.  The Appellants, thus, we have noticed hereinbefore, 
have averred in the plaint that the suit relates to the property of the trust and 
their administration.  If the properties of the churches did not belong to the 
society, the Appellant herein cannot claim the same as their successor.  The 
plaint has to be read meaningfully.  So done, it leads to the only conclusion 
that the dispute was in relation to the management of the churches as 
religious trust and not as a society.  Even if it is contended that the 
administration of the property would mean the properties of the Brethren 
Church both as a trust and as a society, still then having regard to the legal 
position, as discussed supra, the property belonging exclusively to the trust, 
the suit will not be maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_132"> 	It is interesting to note that the Appellants themselves in grounds 1, 2, 
4, 5 and 6 have categorically stated that both the society registered under the 
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_104">Societies Registration Act</a> and the trust registered under the BPT Act is only 
one entity and that upon dissolution of a society the trust automatically 
ceases and all that remains is to carry out the registration under the BPT Act 
wherefor applications have been made before the Charity Commissioner.  
The stand taken by the Appellants herein is unequivocal in nature.  The Trial 
Court also appears to have proceeded on that basis, as would appear from 
Issue No. 4 framed by it which is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_133">"(4) Whether it is proved that the Brethren Church 
was also dissolved and ceased to exist as a separate 
entity as alleged?
</p>

<p id="p_134"> 	The learned Trial Judge observed:
</p>
<p id="p_135">"Now, whether the First district Church of 
Brethren has been legally dissolved in accordance 
with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_105">Societies Registration 
Act</a> (<a href="/doc/1509263/" id="a_106">Section 13</a>) or whether it exists till today, can 
only be decided by the Civil Court and such a 
dispute cannot be decided by the Charity 
Commissioner and as such, on this court also the 
present Civil Court is the only competent Court to 
decide the suit of the present nature.  Apart from 
this, the strange consequence would follow if it 
were to be held that the question of dissolution of 
the First District Church of Brethren as a society 
can be decided by the Civil Court but the question 
of dissolution of it as a trust cannot be decided by 
the Civil Court because the First District Church of 
Brethren is only the on institution and in its dual 
capacity viz. the society as well as the trust.  Apart 
from this, even if it is assumed for the sake of an 
argument that the jurisdiction of the dispute is to 
be divided in two parts, then in that case, there is 
every possibility of conflicting decisions by the 
Civil Court and the Charity Commissioner and this 
would lead to anomaly."
</p>

<p id="p_136"> 	The Trial Court, however, proceeded to determine the issue on the 
premise that there exists an apparent conflict between the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_107">Societies 
Registration Act</a> and the BPT Act holding that as regard question of 
jurisdiction of the civil court, the provisions of the BPT Act to the extent of 
repugnancy would be inoperative.
</p>
<p id="p_137"> 	The finding of the learned Trial Judge on that count is apparently 
wrong.  The learned counsel for the Appellants also did not raise any 
contention before us that having regard to the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_108">Article 
254</a> of the Constitution of India, the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_109">Societies Registration 
Act</a> shall prevail over the BPT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_138"> 	In fact the Appellants have categorically admitted that the 
Memorandum of Association of the Society itself became the deed of trust.  
It also stands admitted that only with a view to have one body to administer 
and manage the properties, the trust so created by the society was also 
registered.  It is not a case where the trust was created for the benefit of the 
society.  Furthermore, there is nothing on record to show the mode and 
manner of the management and control of the trust property.  [See Board of 
Trustees, Ayurvedic and Unani Tibia College, Delhi Vs. State of Delhi 
(Now Delhi Administration) and another, AIR 1962 SC 458, Dharam Dutt 
and Others Vs. Union of India and Others, (2004) 1 SCC 712, para 52 and 
Illachi Devi (Dead) By LRs. and Others Vs. Jain Society, Protection of 
Orphans India and Others, (2003) 8 SCC 413, paras 21 and 22]


 	In Athmanathaswami Devasthanam Vs. K. Gopalaswami Ayyangar 
[AIR 1965 SC 338], this Court did not permit a new question to be raised.  
In this case also, a new contention has been raised contrary to the pleadings 
that the society and the trust are different entities.
</p>
<p id="p_139"> 	We have noticed hereinbefore that the BPT Act provides for finality 
and conclusiveness of the order passed by the Charity Commissioner in 
<a href="/doc/161462810/" id="a_110">Sections 21(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/85254613/" id="a_111">22(3)</a>, <a href="/doc/52485102/" id="a_112">26</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_113">36</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_114">41(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_115">51(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_116">79(2)</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_140"> 	In view of the decision of this Court in Dhulabhai (supra) such finality 
clause would lead to a conclusion that civil court's jurisdiction is excluded if 
there is adequate remedy to do what the civil courts would normally do in a 
civil suit.  In this case, we are not concerned with a dispute as regard 
absolute title of the trust property.  We are also not concerned with the 
question as regard creation of any right by the trust in a third party which 
would be otherwise beyond the jurisdiction of the Charity Commissioner.  It 
is also not a case where the plaintiffs made a complaint that the provisions of 
the BPT Act were not complied with or the statutory tribunal had not acted 
in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.  In fact 
no order has been passed on the Appellant's application for changes in the 
entries made in the registers maintained under <a href="/doc/1765565/" id="a_117">Section 17</a> of the Act.  The 
BPT Act provides for express exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil 
Court.  It in various provisions contained in Chapter IV a power of inquiry 
and consequently a power of adjudication as regard the list of movable and 
immovable trust property, the description and particulars thereof for the 
purpose of its identification have been conferred.  In fact, the trustee of a 
public trust is enjoined with a statutory duty to make an application for 
registration wherein all necessary descriptions of movable and immovable 
property belonging to the trust including their description and particulars for 
the purpose of identification are required to be furnished.  <a href="/doc/1099380/" id="a_118">Section 19</a> 
provides for an inquiry for registration with a view to ascertaining inter alia 
the mode of succession to the office of the trustee as also whether any 
property is the property of such trust.  It is only when the statutory authority 
satisfies itself as regard the genuineness of the trust and the properties held 
by it, an entry is made in the registers and books, etc. maintained in terms of 
<a href="/doc/1765565/" id="a_119">Section 17</a> of the Act in consonance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/161462810/" id="a_120">Section 21</a> 
thereof.  Such an entry, it will bear repetition to state, is final and conclusive.  
Changes can be brought about only in terms of <a href="/doc/85254613/" id="a_121">Section 22</a> thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_141"> 	A change notice having been given, it would now be for the 
appropriate authority to consider the matter and if a change has occurred, a 
finding is required to be arrived which must contain the reasons therefor.  
The defendants are disputing that any such change in accordance with law 
was effected.  An order passed by Deputy or Assistant Charity 
Commissioner is appealable.  Yet again, when an amendment is made in the 
entry in the register, the same would be final and conclusive.  Even a power 
exists for holding a further inquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_142"> 	<a href="/doc/86680883/" id="a_122">Section 31</a> bars a suit to enforce a right on behalf of a public trust.  
C.N.I. got itself registered as a public trust in the year 1981.  A suit evidently 
was filed by the plaintiffs in the year 1980 because C.N.I. was not then 
entitled to file a suit.  It may be true that the suit was filed under Order 1, 
Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure but therein the question as to whether 
the Appellant herein, being a registered trust became entitled to the 
properties of Brethren Church could not have been gone into.  What is 
prohibited is to enforce a right on behalf of a public trust.  When the 
plaintiffs intended to enforce a right on behalf of the Appellant, the suit was 
evidently not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_143"> 	Furthermore, the purported resolutions of the churches affiliated to the 
Brethren Church and merger thereof with the Appellant, having regard to the 
provisions of the Act was required to be done in consonance with the 
provisions thereof.  It is not necessary for us to consider as to whether such 
dissolution of the churches and merger thereof in the Appellant would 
amount to alienation of immovable property but we only intend to point out 
that even such alienation is prohibited in law.  The control and management 
of the religious trusts vests in the Charity Commissioner.  The trustees of the 
Trust are statutorily enjoined with a duty to render all cooperation to the 
Charity Commissioner.  The directions issued by the Charity Commissioner 
to the trustees are binding.  Dissolution of a trust, it is not disputed, is a 
matter which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Charity 
Commissioner.  
</p>
<p id="p_144"> 	Prayer (a) in the plaint is for a declaration.  Such declaration cannot be 
granted by a civil court as regard succession of the District Church of 
Brethren as the same was a religious trust registered under the BPT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_145"> 	Prayer (b) of the plaint also could not have been granted, as the 
question as to whether the applicant is the legal continuation and successor 
of the First District Church of Brethren is a matter which would fall for 
exclusive determination of Charity Commissioner keeping in view the 
provisions of the deed of trust as regard its succession.  It would necessarily 
follow that whether the First Appellant became a legal successor of the 
properties held by the First District Church of Brethren could not also have 
been granted.  The decision and resolution purported to have been adopted 
by the Synod and Gujarat Diocesan Council are binding on all churches or 
not would again be a question which could have been gone into by the 
Charity Commissioner as the same had direct bearing not only with the 
administration and management of the Church registered with it but also 
related to the properties held by it.  Such a decision of the Charity 
Commissioner is again final and conclusive subject to the decision of the 
appellate authority, viz., Bombay Revenue Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_146"> 	Grant of prayer (c) for perpetual injunction would also give rise to 
adjudication on the question as to whether the Appellant herein had the legal 
right to own the properties of the First District Church of Brethren and 
administer or manage the same although at the relevant time it was not 
registered trust and although no amendment had been effected in the 
registers and books maintained by the Charity Commissioner in terms of 
<a href="/doc/1765565/" id="a_123">Section 17</a> read with <a href="/doc/161462810/" id="a_124">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/85254613/" id="a_125">22</a> of the Act.  The plaintiffs with a 
view to obtain an order of injunction furthermore were required to establish 
that they could file a suit for enforcement of right of the Appellant as a 
religious trust and such a legal right vests either in the plaintiff or in the 
Appellant herein indirectly.  Such a prayer, related to the possession of the 
property, comes squarely within the purview of the BPT Act.  If the question 
as regard recovery of possession of the property belonging to a public trust 
squarely falls within the purview of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_126">Section 50</a> of the Act, had such 
application been filed before the Charity Commissioner he was required to 
go into the question as to whether the plaintiffs are persons having interest in 
the trust and whether a consent should be given to them to maintain a suit.  
Only when, inter alia, such consent is granted, a suit could have been filed in 
terms of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_127">Section 51</a> of the Act.  In the event of refusal to give consent, the 
persons interested could have preferred an appeal.  
</p>
<p id="p_147"> 	Yet again the question as regard existence of a trust is a matter which 
squarely falls within the purview of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_128">Section 79</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_148"> 	We have no doubt in our mind that the Charity Commissioner was 
impleaded as a party at a later stage of the suit only with a view to fulfill the 
requirements of Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_129">Section 50</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_149"> 	In Virupakshayya Shankarayya Vs. Neelakanta Shivacharya 
Pattadadevaru [1995 Supp (2) SCC 531], this Court categorically held that 
the suit for recovery of possession of property as validly appointed 
Mathadhipati is hit by <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_130">Sections 50</a> and <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_131">51</a> of the Act.  The matter might have 
been different if the suit was not for declaration or injunction in favour or 
against the public trust or where the plaintiffs are not beneficiaries either.  
</p>
<p id="p_150"> 	Narmadabai and Another Vs. Trust Shri Panchvati Balaji Mandir and 
Others [1995 Supp (3) SCC 676] was a case where a suit for injunction was 
filed for restraining the defendants from interfering with the implementation 
of the scheme for better management and administration of the public trust 
settled by the Charity Commissioner.  In that view of the matter, it was held 
that a suit was not required to be filed in conformity with the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_132">Sections 50</a> and <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_133">51</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_151"> 	<a href="/doc/1368304/" id="a_134">In Shree Gollaleshwar Dev and Others vs. Gangawwa Kom Shantayya 
Math and Others</a> [(1985) 4 SCC 393], it was held:
</p>
<p id="p_152">"14. It is clear from these provisions that <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_135">Section 
50</a> of the Act created and regulated a right to 
institute a suit by the Charity Commissioner or by 
two or more persons interested in the trust, in the 
form of supplementary statutory provisions 
without defeasance of the right of the manager or a 
trustee or a shebait of an idol to bring a suit in the 
name of idol to recover the property of the trust in 
the usual way. There is therefore no reason why 
the two or more persons interested in the trust 
should be deprived of the right to bring a suit as 
contemplated by <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_136">Section 50(ii)(a)</a> of the Act. 
</p><p id="p_153">Although sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_137">Section 52</a> makes 
Sections 92 and 93 of the Code inapplicable to 
public trusts registered under the Act, it has made 
provision by <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_138">Section 50</a> for institution of such suits 
by the Charity Commissioner or by two or more 
persons interested in the trust and having obtained 
the consent in writing of the Charity 
Commissioner under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_139">Section 51</a> of the Act."
</p>

<p id="p_154"> 	The provisions of the Act and the Scheme thereof leave no manner of 
doubt that the Act is a complete code in itself.  It provides for a complete 
machinery for a person interested in the trust to put forward his claim before 
the Charity Commissioner who is competent to go into the question and to 
prefer appeal if he feels aggrieved by any decision.  The bar of jurisdiction 
created under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_140">Section 80</a> of the Act clearly points out that a third party 
cannot maintain a suit so as to avoid the rigours of the provisions of the Act.  
The matter, however, would be different if the property is not a trust 
property in the eye of law.  The civil court's jurisdiction may not be barred 
as it gives rise to a jurisdictional question.  If a property did not validly vest 
in a trust or if a trust itself is not valid in law, the authorities under the Act 
will have no jurisdiction to determine the said question.
</p>
<p id="p_155"> 	With a view to determine the question as regard exclusion of 
jurisdiction of civil court in terms of the provisions of the Act, the court has 
to consider what, in substance, and not merely in form, is the nature of the 
claim made in the suit and the underlying object in seeking the real relief 
therein.  If for the purpose of grant of an appeal, the court comes to the 
conclusion that the question is required to be determined or dealt with by an 
authority under the Act, the jurisdiction of the civil court must be held to 
have been ousted.  The questions which are required to be determined are 
within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the authorities whether simple 
or complicated.  <a href="/doc/52485102/" id="a_141">Section 26</a> of the Act must be read in that context as it 
specifically refers to those questions wherewith a court of competent 
jurisdiction can deal with and if the same is not expressly or impliedly 
barred.  Once a decision is arrived at, having regard to the nature of the 
claim as also the reliefs sought for, that civil court has no jurisdiction, 
<a href="/doc/52485102/" id="a_142">Section 26</a> per force will have no application whatsoever. 
</p>
<p id="p_156"> 	We may at this stage notice the decisions relied upon by the learned 
counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_157"> 	In State of Madras Vs. Kunnakudi Melamatam and another [AIR 1965 
SC 1570] a composite suit for injunction was filed claiming two different 
reliefs, viz. (1) an injunction restraining the levy of contributions and audit 
fees under Act II of 1927; and (2) an injunction restraining the levy of 
contributions and audit fees under Act XIX of 1951.  It was, in that context, 
held that although the decision under Section 84(2) of Madras Hindu 
Religious Endowments Act that an institution is outside the purview of the 
Act, the demand of contribution as being not enforceable under the 1951 Act 
was maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_158"> 	In Sri Vedagiri Lakshmi Narasimha Swami Temple Vs. Induru 
Pattabhirami Reddi [AIR 1967 SC 781], this Court was concerned with a 
question as to what constitutes an administration of religious property.  In 
that case, the provisions of the Act did not impose a total bar on the 
maintainability of a suit in a civil court and having regard to that aspect of 
the matter vis-`-vis Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure it was held 
that Section 93 of Madras Hindu Religious and <a href="/doc/495092/" id="a_143">Charitable Endowments Act</a> 
would apply in the matter for which provision has been made in the Act and 
would not bar the suit under the general law which do not fall within the 
scope of any section of the Act.  This decision instead of helping the 
Appellant runs counter to their claim.
</p>
<p id="p_159"> 	In Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka (Deceased) Through LRs. Vs. Jasjit 
Singh and Others [(1993) 2 SCC 507] it was held that in matters relating to 
will the Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction.  The said decision was 
rendered having regard to the fact that the decision of a probate court is a 
judgment in rem and conclusive and binds not only the parties but also the 
entire world.
</p>
<p id="p_160"> 	In Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation and Another Vs. 
Krishna Kant and Others [(1995) 5 SCC 75], this Court following Dhulabhai 
(supra) held that having regard to the provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_144">Industrial 
Disputes Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1376794/" id="a_145">Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act</a>, 1946, the

<p id="p_161"> 	In Sahebgouda (Dead) By LRs. and Others Vs. Ogeppa and Others 
[(2003) 6 SCC 151] the allegations made in the plaint showed that the only 
right claimed by the Appellants was that of being ancestral pujaris of the 
temple.  They did not claim to be the trustees of any trust.  No declaration 
regarding the existence or otherwise of the trust or any particular property is 
the property of such trust had been claimed and in that view of the matter, it 
was held that the reliefs so claimed do not come within the purview of 
<a href="/doc/1099380/" id="a_146">Section 19</a> or <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_147">Section 79</a> of the Act wherefor the Deputy or Assistant Charity

<p id="p_162"> 	Ramesh Chand Ardawatiwa Vs. Anil Panjwani [(2003) 7 SCC 350] 
has no application in the present case as therein the Charity Commissioner 
took a specific objection that the civil court's jurisdiction is barred 
whereupon several additional issues were framed and determined.
</p>
<p id="p_163"> 	In NDMC Vs. Satish Chand (Deceased) By LR. Ram Chand [(2003) 
10 SCC 38], this Court clearly held that Sections 84 and 86 of the Punjab

provided a complete remedy to the party at plea as also a remedy by way of 
an appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_164"> 	In K. Shamrao and Others Vs. Assistant Charity Commissioner

The Assistant Charity Commissioner has almost all 
the powers which an ordinary civil court has

<p id="p_166"> 	In Yeshwantrao Laxmanrao Ghatge and Another Vs. Baburao Bala 
Yadav (Dead) By LRs. [(1978) 1 SCC 669], this Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_167">"8. Mr Datar placed reliance upon the decision of 
the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1266502/" id="a_148">Dev Chavata v. Ganesh 
Mahadeo Deshpande</a> in order to take advantage of 
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_149">Section 52-A</a> of the Act. The ratio of the case has 
to be appreciated in the background of the facts 
found therein. The principles of law as enunciated 
cannot be fully and squarely applied. But yet the 
decision, if we may say so with respect, is correct. 
This would be on the footing that the decision 
given by the Assistant Charity Commissioner 
under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_150">Section 79</a> read with <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_151">Section 80</a> of the Act 
was conclusive and final. He had exclusive 
jurisdiction to decide the question as to whether 
the suit land belonged to the trust. He had so 
decided it on November 5, 1954. The suit was filed 
on July 21, 1955. In that view, the High Court was 
right in holding that a suit filed under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_152">Section 50</a> of 
the Act was not barred under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_153">Section 52-A</a> because 
the decision of the Assistant Charity 
Commissioner given in 1954 had declared the 
property to be a trust property and which decision 
was final."

<p id="p_168"> 	In Suresh Ramniwas Mantri and another Vs. Mohd. Iftequaroddin s/o 
Mohd. Badroddin [1999(2) Mh.L.J. 131] it was observed that a society 
although formed either for religious or charitable purposes or for both cannot 
be held to a public trust ipso facto although registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_154">Societies 
Registration Act</a> unless it is registered also under the BPT Act as the 
question whether such a trust was validly formed or not would come within 
the purview of Sections 18, 19 and 20 of the BPT Act.  In that case the 
plaintiff was not registered as a public trust and in that situation it was held 
that <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_155">Section 80</a> would operate.
</p>
<p id="p_169"> 	In Mahibubi Abdul Aziz and others Vs. Sayed Abdul Majid and 
others [2001(2) Mh.L.J. 512], a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High 
Court held that a civil suit cannot be entertained only because a complicated 
questions of title has been raised.
</p>
<p id="p_170"> 	<a href="/doc/816411/" id="a_156">In Keki Pestronji Jamadar and Another vs. Khodadad Merwan Irani 
and Others</a>  [AIR 1973 (Bom) 130] the question was as to whether the 
author of a trust was the lawful owner of the property of which he has 
created the trust.  The Full Bench of Bombay High Court held that the author 
of the trust has no title over the property and <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_157">Section 80</a> would not operate as 
a bar.
</p>
<p id="p_171"> 	<a href="/doc/762696/" id="a_158">In Nagar Wachan Mandir, Pandharpur vs. Akbaralli Abdulhusen and 
Sons and Others</a> [(1994) 1 MhLJ 280] a question arose as regard power of a 
co-trustee to delegate a matter relating to grant or determination of lease to 
another co-trustee keeping in view of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_159">Section 47</a> of the Act which deprives 
the trustee from delegating his office or any of his duties to a co-trustee or a 
stranger unless conditions mentioned therein are complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_172">	The principle enunciated in each of the decision laid down relate to 
the fact situation obtaining therein.  In each case indisputably the lis arose 
for determination of a question relating to interpretation of one or the other 
clause enumerated in different provisions of the BPT Act which come either 
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the statutory authorities or otherwise.  
The Civil Court will have no jurisdiction in relation to a matter whereover 
the statutory authorities have the requisite jurisdiction.  On the other hand, if 
a question arises, which is outside the purview of the Act or in relation to a 
matter, unconnected with the administration or possession of the trust 
property, the Civil Court may have jurisdiction.  In this case, having regard 
to the nature of the lis, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court was clearly barred. 
</p>
<p id="p_173">CONCLUSION:
</p>
<p id="p_174"> 	Having given our anxious thought in the matter, we are of the opinion 
that the suit has rightly been held to be not maintainable by the High Court 
and, thus, the impugned judgments must be affirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_175">The applications for impleadment filed by various persons, in view of 
the aforementioned findings, need not to be dealt with separately.
</p>

<p id="p_176"> 	For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in this 
appeal which is dismissed accordingly.  No costs.
