Judgment on         :    21.03.2011



</pre><p id="p_1">PINAKI CHANDRA GHOSE, J.: The instant appeal has been directed against a judgment and/or

order dated 22nd December 2009 when the Hon'ble Single Judge has refused to grant leave under

Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, 1865 in connection with an application filed by the appellant

under the provision of <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (hereinafter referred

to as the 'said Act').
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">        The only question involved in this appeal is whether in the facts and circumstances of this

case pleaded in the petition filed by the appellant before the Hon'ble First Court, the appellant

was entitled to grant of leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent?
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                      2</span>



</p><p id="p_4">          From the facts it appears that at the time of presentation of an application under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_3">Section

9</a> of the said Act the Hon'ble Single Judge was pleased to dismiss the application at the time of

presentation of the said application when the appellant was seeking leave under Clause 12 of the

Letters Patent. It is a fact which has been stated on behalf of the appellant that the averments

made by the appellant in the application have not been controverter or refuted by the

respondents by filing an affidavit on the date of the presentation of the petition under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of

the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">          It is pleaded in the said application that a part of the cause of action for institution of the

proceeding had arisen within the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and

accordingly the petitioner/appellant herein is entitled to leave under Clause 12 of the Letters

Patent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          For the sake of convenience, the pleadings contained in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 11 and 13 of

the petition on the basis of which the leave has been prayed by the appellant are reproduced

below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "3.    The respondent No. 1 through its partner approached your petitioner at its registered
          office at 24, Park Street, Kolkata - 700 016 within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court for
          the purpose of taking on hire an EXCAVATOR/VOLVO EC-210 bearing Engine No. 10598422
          and Chasis No. 23425 (hereinafter referred to as the "said equipment") for use in its
          business.   The equipment is morefully and particularly described in the Schedule and
          annexed hereto and marked with the letter "B".
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          4.     On or about 25th July, 2008 an agreement of Hire Purchase (hereinafter referred to
          as the "said agreement") was entered into by and between your petitioner (hereinafter
          referred to as the "Magma") of the First Part; the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 (hereinafter
          referred to as "the Hirer" and "Co-Hirer") respectively of the Second Part and the respondent
          No. 3 (hereinafter referred to as "the Guarantor") of the Third Part. The said agreement was
          accepted, signed and concluded at the office of your petitioner at 24, Park Street, Kolkata -
          700 016 within the jurisdiction aforesaid. A copy of the said agreement is annexed hereto
          and marked with the letter "C".
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                 3</span>



<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      5.      By and under the said agreement the respondents agreed to make payment of the
      total hire purchase price of Rs. 64,18,675/- by way of 35 (thirty five) monthly instalments @
      Rs. 1,83,391/- each except the last instalment of Rs. 1,83,381/- commencing on or about
      01-08-2008 and becoming payable on or before the 1st day of every succeeding English
      Calendar month.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      Such payment were to be made at the office of your petitioner within the said jurisdiction.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      11.     In the circumstances having no alternative by a Notice dated 16-04-2009 your
      petitioner terminated the said agreement and demanded payment of the sum of Rs
      56,21,082/- then due as well as recovery of the said equipment.         The said notice was
      issued by the petitioner from its office at 24, Park Street, Kolkata - 700 016, within the
      jurisdiction aforesaid by speed post with acknowledgement due.        The respondents have
      notice and knowledge of the said notice. Subsequently the said notice was corrected by a
      letter dated July 6, 2009.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      A copy of the said Notice dated April 16, 2009 and letter dated July 9, 2009 are correctively
      annexed hereto and marked with the letter "D".
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      13.     The aforesaid sums are payable by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and/or the
      respondents and each of them at the registered office of your petitioner at 24, Park Street,
      Kolkata - 700 016 within the jurisdiction aforesaid.".</blockquote><p id="p_8">



</p><p id="p_9">      It is further stated in paragraph 54 of the said petition which is also reproduced

hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">              "54.   The said agreement was executed and concluded at the registered office of
      your petitioner at 24, Park Street, Calcutta - 700 016 within the aforesaid jurisdiction. The
      said agreement was to be performed by the respondents at the aforesaid office of your
      petitioner within the foresaid jurisdiction. The said agreement was terminated from within
      the said jurisdiction. Pursuant thereto the respondents become bound and obliged to comply
      with the requisition contained in the Notice of Termination. The respondents have failed and
      neglected to handover the possession from outside the said jurisdiction. The Agreement of
      Hire dated 25th July, 2008 between the parties also contains a Forum Selection clause
      whereunder Courts at Calcutta have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain the matters arising
      the reform. The subject matter of reference is for in excess of Rs. 10 Lakhs and the Hon'ble
      High Court at Calcutta has and the City Civil Court at Calcutta does not have jurisdiction to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                    4</span>

       receive, try or determine this petition.    This Hon'ble Court has jurisdiction to decide the
       question forming the subject matter of arbitration had the same been the subject matter of
       the suit. However as and by way of abundant precaution inasmuch as a part of the cause
       of action as pleaded by your petitioner in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 11 and 13 arose within the
       aforesaid jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and part pleaded in paragraphs 16, 19 and 20
       outside the aforesaid jurisdiction, your petitioner prays for leave under Clause 12 of the
       Letters Patent to initiate this proceeding in this Hon'ble Court."</blockquote><p id="p_10">



</p><p id="p_11">       Mr. Pratap Chatterjee, Learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellant

contended that the grant of leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent is imperative in view of

the judgment of a Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court in "Tobu Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. - Vs. -

Camco Industries Ltd." reported in "AIR 1984 CAL 24". He also submitted that it is no longer

res integra that where the respondent does not, at the time of commencement of the reference,

dwell or carry on business or personally work for gain within the local limits of the Ordinary

Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and the application under Part I of the said Act

can be filed only after obtaining leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent.



</p><p id="p_12">       He further contended that it is well settled that 'cause of action' consists of bundle of facts

which give cause to enforce the legal injury rights for redress in a court of law. The cause of

action means every fact, which if traversed, would be necessary for the appellant to prove in order

to support his right to an award. Even an infinitesimal fraction of a cause of action will be part of

the cause of action and confer jurisdiction on the Court i.e. within the territorial jurisdiction of a

Court. At this stage, the Court is not required to make inquiry as to the correctness or otherwise

of the facts pleaded by the appellant in the petition. In support of his submission he relied upon

the following decisions :-

       SCC 163

       From the aforesaid pleadings made by the appellant it is submitted that a substantial part

of the appellant's cause of action, has arisen within the Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of

this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">       He further submitted that for the purpose of considering whether leave under Clause 12 of

the Letters patent is to be granted, the assertions in the pleadings must be assumed to be true.

The aforesaid proposition stands clearly established from the catena of judgments of the Supreme

Court. In support of his submission he relied upon the following decisions:-


</p><pre id="pre_3">               i)     <a href="/doc/442517/" id="a_8">Ramesh B Desai &amp; Ors v. Bipin Vadilal Mehta &amp;             Ors</a>. reported in

       (2006) 5 SCC 638.

               ii)    <a href="/doc/338115/" id="a_9">Indian Mineral &amp; Chemicals Company &amp; Ors. V.              Deutache Bank</a>

       reported in (2004) 12 SCC 376.



</pre><p id="p_18">       He further submitted that the respondents despite having been represented at the time of

hearing merely prayed for adjournment but did not seek to allege that the pleadings are incorrect

or that this Hon'ble Court did not have jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">       He also pointed out that in paragraph 4 of the petition it has been stated that the

agreement was accepted, signed and concluded at 24, Park Street, Kolkata- 700 016 within the

jurisdiction of this Hon'ble High Court. According to him, the execution of the agreement forms

a very significant part of the appellant's cause of action in a matter relating to the non-

performance and non-fulfillment by the respondents of their contractual obligations.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                  6</span>



</p><p id="p_21">       He further drew our attention to a decision in the case of "A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd.

(Supra) where the Supreme Court held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">              "In the matter of a contract there may arise causes of action of various kinds. In a
       suit for damages for breach of contract the cause of action consists of the making of the
       contract, and of, its breach, so that the suit may be filed either at the place where the
       contract was made or at the place where it should have been performed and the breach
       occurred. The making of the contract is part of the cause of action. A suit on a contract,
       therefore, can be filed at the place where it was made. The determination of the place
       where the contract was made is part of the law of contract. But making of an offer on a
       particular place does not form cause of action in a suit for damages for breach of contract.
       Ordinarily, acceptance of an offer and its intimation result in a contract and hence a suit can
       be filed in a court within whose jurisdiction the acceptance was communicated.             The
       performance of a contract is part of cause of action and a suit in respect of the breach can
       always be filed at the place where the contract should have been performed or its
       performance completed. If the contract is to be performed at the place where it is made, the
       suit on the contract is to be filed there and nowhere else...Part of cause of action arises
       where money is expressly or impliedly payable under a contract...The above are some of the
       connecting factors."</blockquote><p id="p_23">



</p><p id="p_24">       He also drew our attention to the judgment of the Hon'ble Single Judge and submitted

that the Trial Court is proceeded to surmise that the use of expression 'accepted' purportedly

leads to a legitimate inference that "the agreement was executed somewhere else and thereafter

that document came to Kolkata and something might have been done by the petitioner in its office at

Kolkata, which is a mere clerical job, for the records of the petitioner which according to him

amounted acceptance of the agreement".
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">       According to him, this is nothing but mere speculation. Such speculation and conjecture

are impermissible in considering whether Leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent may be

granted, particularly when the averments in Paragraphs 4 and 54 are clear.             Moreover, he

submitted that this speculation de hors and is contrary to the pleadings. He further submitted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                  7</span>

that in A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has made it clear that the

acceptance of an offer and its intimation results in a contract and an action can be instituted in a

Court within whose jurisdiction the acceptance is communicated.



</p><p id="p_27">       He further pointed out that the said agreement dated 25th July, 2008 annexed to the said

petition and has been made a part thereof.      Inasmuch     as the aforesaid document has been

annexed to the pleadings as a part thereof, the same is deemed to be incorporated in the said

pleadings as an integral part of the cause of action and such pleadings can be relied on for the

purpose of considering the terms and conditions thereof. The agreement provides that the same

has been made "at Kolkata". From the non-judicial stamps affixed to the agreement it is clear

that the stamp duty too was paid in Kolkata.
</p>
<p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">       The conclusions of the Hon'ble First Court with regard to the pleadings contained in

paragraph 4 of the application are thus not sustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">       He further contended that the pleadings contained in paragraph 5 of the application

demonstrate that a part of the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble

Court. In these circumstances, he submitted that the conclusion of the Hon'ble First Court is not

sustainable in the eye of law. No inference can be drawn from paragraph 9 of the said petition as

made by the Hon'ble Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_32">

</p><p id="p_33">       He also contended that common law principle in that regard is that 'debtor must seek his

creditor' and payments must be made at the registered office of the appellant at 24, Park Street,

Kolkata - 700 016 within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. In support of his contention he

relied upon the following decisions:-
</p>
<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">       i)      <a href="/doc/1500635/" id="a_10">Mahalakshmi Bank Ltd v. Chhotanagpur Industrial &amp;                  Commercial

</pre><p id="p_37">       He further drew our attention to <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_13">Section 4</a> of the said Act and submitted that notice of

termination was issued within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court.



</p><p id="p_38">       He also drew our attention to 'Clause 23' of the agreement i.e. 'Jurisdiction' where it has

been specifically stated that Courts in Kolkata alone shall have jurisdiction for the purpose of the

Agreement. Therefore, the document shows that the appellant has no other alternative and is

bound to institute the instant proceedings in this Hon'ble Court. In support of his submission he

relied upon on the following decisions:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       reported in (2009) 3 SC 107.</blockquote><p id="p_41">


</p><p id="p_42">       He further submitted that The Hon'ble First Court, in the impugned judgment, has

referred to the discretionary power of Court to grant or revoke leave under Clause 12 of the

Letters Patent. It is respectfully submitted that no case has been made out and no grounds have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                  9</span>

been indicated in the impugned judgment as to why the discretion should be exercised against

the appellant. The question of exercise of discretion would arise if the respondent applies for

vacating at some stage the leave granted by the Court.       Having regard to the question of the

balance of convenience, the onus lies on the defendant i.e. the respondents in the instant case to

make out a case. Reliance was placed on the judgment of <a href="/doc/1096938/" id="a_18">State of Punjab v. A.K. Raha</a> reported

in AIR 1964 Cal 418. It is also well settled that an application seeking such revocation must be

made at the earliest and if there is difficult question of law or facts are involved, then the matter

can only be decided at the time of trail and not on a summary application. Reliance was placed on

the judgment of The Secretary of State for India in Council v. Golabrai Paliram reported in

35 CWN 930 and Himmatsingka Timber Ltd. v. Narendranath reported in 50 CWN 624.




</p><p id="p_43">       Mr. Chatterjee, submitted that grant of leave is normal and it is only in the most

exceptional cases that grant of leave may be refused or leave already granted may be revoked.

The question of balance of convenience might be a relevant issue, if at all, but that too would only

to be considered if the respondents seek revocation of leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent.

However, at the threshold of the proceedings there is no reason to refuse leave under Clause 12 of

the Letters Patent. Moreover, balance of convenience is not decisive. A plaintiff has the right to

choose his forum as held in the judgment of Ratan Kumar Bhar Pilania v. Laxmi Devi reported

in 1985(1) CHN 21.
</p>
<p id="p_44">


</p><p id="p_45">       Mr. Chatterjee further submitted that in the instant case, there can be no doubt

whatsoever that it would be more efficacious for the Court proceedings to be in Kolkata rather

than in any other City, since Clause 22 of the said agreement, (arbitration clause), expressly

provides that the place of arbitration shall be at Kolkata. The parties have expressly agreed that

the venue and/or sites of the sittings in connection with the arbitration shall be in Kolkata.

Thus, the trial would be held before the agreed domestic forum in Kolkata. Therefore, there is

substantial logic in vesting jurisdiction to Courts in Kolkata. The entire arbitral process would be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                   10</span>

conducted in Kolkata itself. Therefore, the balance of convenience lies in favour of the appellant

to grant of leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent by this Hon'ble Court. The balance of

convenience is overwhelmingly in favour of this Hon'ble Court exercising its jurisdiction in

granting such leave.
</p>
<p id="p_46">


</p><p id="p_47">       The   matter    can   also   be   looked   into   from   the   appellant's   perspective.    The

plaintiff/appellant has the right to choose his forum.      The appellant is 'Dominus Litus'.       The

carriage of the proceeding is with the plaintiff i.e. the appellant. <a href="/doc/95529/" id="a_19">In Dhannalal v. Kalawatibai</a>

reported in AIR 2002 SC 2572 the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows :-




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "the plaintiff is dominus litis, that is, master of, or having dominion over, the case. He is the

       person who has carried and control of an action. In case of conflict of jurisdiction the choice

       ought lie with the plaintiff to choose the forum best suited to him unless there be a rule of

       law excluding access to a forum of plaintiff's choice or permitting recourse to a forum will be

       opposed to public policy or will be an abuse of the process of law."</blockquote><p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">       In these circumstances, he submitted that the impugned judgment and order dated 22nd

December, 2009 may be set aside and leave should be granted by this Court                 and direction

should be given that the matter may be placed before the Court for hearing.




</p><p id="p_50">       After hearing the submissions on behalf of the appellant and after scrutinizing the

pleadings made in the petition, in our considered opinion, the Court shall only decide the issue

that whether Leave under Clause 12 should be granted or not at the time of presentation of the

petition and/or a plaint. At that point of time, the Court would only proceed holding that the

statements made in the plaint or petition are true and correct. In the given facts, it appears to us

that the appellant has specifically submitted in the pleadings that part of the cause of actions

have arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the leave

has been prayed for on the basis of the pleadings made in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 11, 13 and

paragraph 54 of the petition.

</p><p id="p_52">       We have noticed that in the case of "Navinchandra N. Majithia (Supra) where the

Supreme Court held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_53">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "Cause of action' is a phenomenon well understood in legal parlance. Mohapatra, J. has

       well delineated the import of the said expression by referring to the celebrated

       lexicographies. The collocation of the words "cause of action wholly or in part arises" seems

       to have been lifted from Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which section also deals

       with the jurisdictional aspect of the Courts. As per the section the suit could be instituted in

       a Court within the legal limits of whose jurisdiction the "cause of action wholly or in part

       arises". Judicial pronouncements have accorded almost a uniform interpretation to the said

       compendious expression even prior to the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution as to

       mean "the bundle of facts which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed,

       in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court."</blockquote><p id="p_54">




</p><p id="p_55">       We have specifically scrutinized the averments made in the petition and from the

pleadings it appears that contract was concluded between the parties at 24, Park Street, Kolkata,

i.e. within the jurisdiction of this Court. Therefore, prima facie we hold that this Court should

grant leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent.
</p>
<p id="p_56">


</p><p id="p_57">       After analyzing the decisions cited before us at the bar, we have to hold that the part of

the cause of action arises within the jurisdiction of this Court.      We have duly considered the

judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in "Tobu Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. - Vs. - Camco

Industries Ltd. (Supra)" and following the said decision we must come to the conclusion that an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                   12</span>

appeal against an order under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent refusing leave under Clause 12 to

file an application is maintainable. The Court held that if the cause of action arises in part only

within Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction of the High Court then an application under the

<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_20">Arbitration Act</a> can be filed in the High Court after obtaining leave under Clause 12 of the Letters

Patent. In other words, the Court held that leave under Clause 12 is imperative.



</p><p id="p_58">        After considering the decisions and scrutinizing the same it appears to us that cause of

action consists of bundle of facts which give right to enforce the legal injury for redress in a Court

of law. The Cause of action means every fact which if traversed, it would be necessary for the

plaintiff to prove its fact in order to support his right to a judgment of the Court.



</p><p id="p_59">        In the case of A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) the Court held that in a suit for

damages a cause of action arises for breach of contract and the making of the contract is a part of

the cause of action and a suit on such contract can, therefore, be filed at the place where it was

made.
</p>
<p id="p_60">

</p><p id="p_61">        In the given facts, we are satisfied that part of the cause of action arises within the

jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and the Court has jurisdiction to entertain and try the

application. Accordingly we hold that Hon'ble Single Judge should have accepted the principle

that at the time of institution of the suit or application the Court should accept that the

statements made in the plaint/application are true, until such averment is questioned the Court

will proceed on the basis of the averments. It appears to us that the said principle has escaped

from the mind of His Lordship. It is also appeared that His Lordship also failed to consider that

the contract was concluded at 24, Park Street, Kolkata, i.e. within the jurisdiction of this Court.

The arbitration clause has specifically stated that the venue of the arbitration tribunal would be

at Kolkata. Therefore, balance of convenience at this stage lies in favour of the appellant.

substance and we accept the reasoning given by him.

accordingly.
