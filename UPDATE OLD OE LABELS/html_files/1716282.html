HEADNOTE:
     In December  1973, the Madras Legislature passed an Act
known as  the Tamil  Nadu Public  Men (Criminal	 Misconduct)
Act, 1973  after obtaining  the assent of the President. <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_7">The
State Act</a>  was amended by Act 16 of 1974 and the President's
assent was received on April 10, 1974. The provisions of the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_8">State Act</a>  were brought	 into force  with effect from May 8,
1974. <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_9">The  State Act</a> was repealed and the President's assent
to the repealing Act was given on September 6, 1977.
     <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_10">The Act</a>  provided for the investigation in respect of a
complaint of  criminal misconduct against any 'public man by
a Commissioner	or the	Additional Commissioner of Inquiries
appointed for  this purpose.  The word 'public man' had been
given a	 specific connotation  in<a href="/doc/1907756/" id="a_11"> s.  2(c)</a> of  the  Act	 and
clearly excluded a Government servant.
     The appellant  was the  former Chief  Minister  of	 the
State of  Tamilnadu. On June 15, 1976 the Chief Secretary to
the  State   Government	 requested  the	 Central  Bureau  of
Investigation to  make a detailed investigation into certain
allegations that  the appellant	 and others  were alleged to
have  abused  their  official  position	 in  the  matter  of
purchase of  wheat from	 Punjab. With  the State  Governor's
sanction a  charge sheet  was filed  after investigation for
the prosecution	 of the appellant under<a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_12"> ss. 161</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_13">468</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_14">471</a>
IPC and	<a href="/doc/1573164/" id="a_15"> s. 5(2)</a>  read with<a href="/doc/47837/" id="a_16"> S. 5(1)</a> (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_17">Prevention of
Corruption  Act</a>	  for  allegedly  having  derived  pecuniary
advantage to  the extent  of Rs.  4 to	5 lakhs	 for passing
favourable orders in respect of some firms.
     The appellant  applied for	 discharge under <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_18"> s. 239</a> Cr.
P.C. on the ground that the prosecution against him suffered
from various  legal and	 constitutional infirmities.  On the
application being  rejected, the  appellant applied  to	 the
High Court  for quashing  the proceedings  and	for  setting
aside the  order of  the Special Judge refusing to discharge
him. The High Court rejected the applications.
255
     In the  appeals to	 this Court,  it  was  contended  on
behalf of the appellant:
     (1)  Even	though	the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_19">State  Act</a>	 was  repealed,	 the
provisions  of	the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_20">Central  Act</a>s  having  themselves	been
protanto repealed  by the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_21">State Act</a> when it was passed could
not be	pressed into  service for the purpose of prosecuting
the appellant unless these provisions were re-enacted by the
appropriate legislature.
     (2) It  was contended that even assuming that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_22">State
Act</a> had	 ceased to  exist and  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_23">Central Act</a>s applied, the
appellant cannot  be prosecuted under any of the sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24"> of
the Penal  Code</a> or  the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_25">Corruption Act</a>, because by virtue of
the position  that the	appellant enjoyed as Chief Minister,
there was  no relationship of master and servant between him
and the	 Government and	 he was	 acting as  a constitutional
functionary, and  therefore could  not	be  described  as  a
'public servant'  as contemplated  by<a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_26"> s. 21(12)</a> of the Penal
Code.
     (3) The  provisions contained  in	the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_27">State  Act</a>	 run
counter to  those of  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_28">Central  Act</a>s in  respect  of	 the
following matters;  (a) The  procedure for  investigation of
the offences  by a  Central Agency  as contemplated  by	 the
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_29">Corruption Act</a>	is dispensed with and is instead invested in
a Commissioner	appointed  under  the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_30">State  Act</a>.  (b)	 The
provisions under  the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_31">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> regarding
the grant  of sanction	under<a href="/doc/1731569/" id="a_32"> s.  197</a> of  the  Code  to	 the
accused is given a complete go by and instead a Commissioner
is appointed  to hold a regular inquiry for himself and then
to submit  his report.	An accused who has to be tried under
the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_33">State Act</a> is thus deprived of the protection afforded to
every Government  servant regarding  grant of  a sanction by
the appointing	authority. Therefore  the protection if any,
given by the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_34">State Act</a> is purely illusory, and
     (4) By  virtue of	the fact  that	the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_35">State  Act</a>	 has
obtained the  assent of	 the President, it will be deemed to
be a  dominant legislation, and therefore it would over-rule
the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_36">Central Act</a>s.
     Dismissing the appeals,
^
     HELD: 1. The scheme of the Constitution is a scientific
and equitable  distribution of	legislative  powers  between
Parliament and	the State Legislatures. First, regarding the
matters contained  in List  I, i.e.  the Union	List to	 the
Seventh Schedule, Parliament alone is empowered to legislate
and the State Legislatures have no authority to make any law
in respect  of the Entries contained in List I. Secondly, so
far as the Concurrent List is concerned, both Parliament and
the State  Legislatures are  entitled to legislate in regard
to any of the Entries appearing therein, but that is subject
to the	condition laid	down by <a href="/doc/344383/" id="a_37">Art. 254(1).</a> Thirdly, so far
as  the	 matters  in  List  II,	 i.e.  the  State  List	 are
concerned, the	State Legislatures  alone are  competent  to
legislate  on	them  and   only  under	 certain  conditions
Parliament can do so. [263 D-E]
     2. In  such matters  repugnancy  may  result  from	 the
following circumstances:-
     (i) Where	the provisions	of a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_38">Central Act</a> and a <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_39">State
Act</a> in	the Concurrent	List are  fully inconsistent and are
absolutely irreconcilable,  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_40">Central Act</a> will prevail and
the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_41">State Act</a> will become void in view of the repugnancy.
256
     (ii) Where however a law passed by the State comes into
collision with a law passed by Parliament on an Entry in the
Concurrent List,  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_42">State  Act</a> shall prevail to the extent
of the	repugnancy and	the provisions	of the	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_43">Central	 Act</a>
would become  void provided the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_44">State Act</a> has been passed in
accordance with cl. (2) of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_45">Art. 254.</a>
     (iii) Where a law passed by the State legislature while
being substantially  within the	 scope of the entries in the
State List entrenches upon any of the Entries in the Central
List the  constitutionality of	the lay	 may  be  upheld  by
invoking the  doctrine	of  pith  and  substance  if  on  an
analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and
large the  law falls  within the  four corners	of the State
List an	 entrenchment, if  any, being  purely incidental  or
inconsequential.
     (iv)  Where,   however,  a	  law  made   by  the  State
Legislature on	a subject  covered by the Concurrent List is
inconsistent with  or repugnant	 to a  previous law  made by
Parliament, then  such a  law can  be protected by obtaining
the  assent  of	 the  President	 under	Art  254(2)  of	 the
Constitution. The  result of  obtaining the  assent  of	 the
President  would  be  that  so	far  as	 the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_46">State  Act</a>  is
concerned, it  will prevail  in the  State and over-rule the
provisions of  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_47">Central Act</a> in their applicability to the
State only.  Such a  state of  affairs will exist only until
Parliament may	at  any	 time  make  a	law  adding  to,  or
amending, varying  or repealing	 the law  made by  the State
Legislature under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_48">Art. 254.</a> [263 F-264 D]
     3.	 A  careful  analysis,	therefore,  of	the  various
provisions of  the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_49">State  Act</a>	leads  to  the	irresistible
inference that	the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_50">State  Act</a> was  passed with	 a  view  to
afford sufficient  protection to a public man by enjoining a
summary inquiry	 or investigation  by a high and independent
Tribunal of  the status	 of a  High Court  Judge or a Senior
District Judge	to instil  confidence in  the people  and to
prevent public men from being prosecuted on false, frivolous
and  vexatious	allegations.  Although	the  ingredients  of
criminal misconduct  as	 defined  in <a href="/doc/47837/" id="a_51"> s.  5(1)</a>	(d)  of	 the
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_52">Corruption Act</a>	are substantially  the same in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_53">State Act</a>
as in  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_54">Central Act</a>s but here also the punishment is much
severer in  the case of the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_55">State Act</a> than the one contained
in the	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_56">Central Act</a>s.  It is,  therefore, manifest  that the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_57">State Act</a>  does not contain any provision which is repugnant
to the	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_58">Central Act</a>s,  but is  a sort  of complementary	 Act
which runs pari passu the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_59">Central Act</a>. [270 G-271 A]
     4. Prima  facie,  there  does  not	 appear	 to  be	 any
inconsistency between  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_60">State  Act</a> and  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_61">Central Act</a>s.
Before any  repugnancy can  arise, the	following conditions
must be satisfied:
     (i) That  there is	 a clear  and  direct  inconsistency
between the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_62">Central Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_63">State Act</a>; (ii) that such an
inconsistency is  absolutely irreconcilable;  (iii) that the
inconsistency between  the provisions  of the two Acts is of
such a nature as to bring the two Acts into direct collision
with each  other and  a situation  is reached  where  it  is
impossible to  obey the	 one without  disobeying the  other.
[272D-E]
     5. (1)  In order  to decide the questions of repugnancy
it  must   be  shown   that  the   two	enactments   contain
inconsistent and irreconcilable provisions,
257
so that	 they cannot  stand together  or operate in the same
field; (2) that there can be no repeal by implication unless
the inconsistency  appears on  the face of the two statutes;
(3) that  where the  two statutes occupy a particular field,
but there  is room  or	possibility  of	 both  the  statutes
operating in  the same	field without  coming into collision
with each other, no repugnancy results; (4) that where there
is no  inconsistency but  a statute occupying the same field
seeks to  create distinct and separate offences, no question
of repugnancy  arises and  both	 the  statutes	continue  to
operate in the same field. [278 F-H]

     There can	be no  doubt  that  the	 <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_70">State	Act</a>  creates
distinct and  separate offences	 with different	 ingredients
and different  punishments  and	 it  does  not	in  any	 way
collide, with the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_71">Central Act</a>s. On the other hand, the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_72">State
Act</a> itself permits the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_73">Central Act</a>, namely, the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_74">Criminal Law
(Amendment) Act</a> to come to its aid after an investigation is
completed and  a report	 is submitted by the Commissioner or
the Additional Commissioner. [279 A-B]
     6. Doubtless, the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_75">State Act</a> is the dominant legislation
but there  are no  provisions in  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_76">State  Act</a>  which	 are
irreconcilably or  directly inconsistent  with	the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_77">Central
Act</a>s so as to over-rule them. [279 C]
     The original <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_78"> s. 29</a>  of  the  State  Act  underwent  an
amendment which	 was brought  about by	<a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_79">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 16 of
1974 which  substituted a  new<a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_80"> s.  29</a> for  the old one. This
amendment received  the assent	of  the	 President  on	10th
April, 1974  and was  published in the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette Extra  ordinary, dated	16 April, 1974. Although the
State Act  was passed  as far  back as	30 December, 1973 it
received the  assent of	 the President on the 10 April, 1974
that is,  on the  same date  as Act  16 of 1974. <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_81">The Act</a> was
however brought	 into force  on the 8 May, 1974 when the new
s. 29  which had  already replaced  the old  section and had
become a part of the statute. Therefore, for all intents and
purposes the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_82">State Act</a> cannot be read in isolation, but has
to be  interpreted in  conjunction with the express language
contained in <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_83"> s. 29</a> of the State Act. The legislature has in
unequivocal terms expressed the intention that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_84">State Act</a>
which was undoubtedly the dominant legislation would only be
"in addition to and not in derogation with any other law for
the time  being in  force"  which  manifestly  includes	 the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_85">Central Act</a>s,  namely,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_86"> the Indian Penal Code</a>, the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_87">Corruption
Act</a>  and   the	<a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_88">Criminal  Law  (Amendment)  Act</a>.  Thus,	 the
Legislature about  a month  before the	main Act  came	into
force clearly  declared its intention that there would be no
question of  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_89">State	Act</a> colliding  with the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_90">Central Act</a>s
referred to above. The second part
258
of<a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_91"> s.  29</a> also	provides that nothing contained in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_92">State
Act</a> shall exempt any public man from being proceeded with by
way  of	  investigation	 or  otherwise	under  a  proceeding
instituted against  him	 under	the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_93">Central  Act</a>s.  It	 is,
therefore, clear that in view of this clear intention of the
legislature there  can be  no room for any argument that the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_94">State Act</a> was in any way repugnant to the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_95">Central Act</a>s. [279
D-280 D]
     7. The  provisions of <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_96"> s. 29</a> would be presumptive proof
of the	fact that  there is  no repugnancy between the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_97">State
Act</a> and	 the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_98">Central  Act</a>s nor did either the legislature or
the President  intend to create any repugnancy between these
Acts as	 a result  of  which  the  criticism  regarding	 the
repugnancy is completely obliterated in the instant case and
we,  therefore,	  hold	that  the  State  legislature  never
intended to  occupy the same field as covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_99">Central
Act</a>s. [281 B]
     8. So  far as  the	 first	part  of  cl.  (12)  (a)  is
concerned,  namely   'in  the	service	 of  the  Government
undoubtedly signifies  a relationship  of master and servant
where the  employer employs  the employee  on the basis of a
salary or  remuneration. However,  the second  limb  of	 the
clause, 'in  the pay  of the  Government' is concerned, that
appears to  be of  a much  wider amplitude  so as to include
within its  ambit even	a public  servant who  may not	be a
regular	 employee   receiving  salary  from  his  master.  A
Minister or  a Chief Minister will be clearly covered by the
said expression. [282 E-F]
     A careful analysis of the meanings assigned to the word
'pay' in  the  various	dictionaries  and  the	texts  would
clearly reveal	that the expression 'in the pay of' connotes
that a	person is getting salary, compensation, wages or any
amount of money. This by itself however does not lead to the
inference that	a relationship	of master  and servant	must
necessarily exist  in all  cases  where	 a  person  is	paid
salary. [283 G-H]

     to.
     9. By  virtue of  the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_100">Art. 167</a>,
the Chief Minister undoubtedly performs a public duty of the
nature as  enjoined by clauses (a) to (c) of <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_101">Art. 167.</a> It is
also clearly  provided in  the Constitution  that the  Chief
Minister or  the  Ministers  are  entitled  to	salaries  or
allowances obviously  in lieu  of public  duties  that	they
perform. The  salaries given  to the  Chief Minister  or the
Ministers  are	 given	from   the  Government	funds,	and,
therefore, there  will be  no difficulty in holding that the
Ministers are  in the pay of the Government inasmuch as they
receive their  salaries, remunerations	or  wages  from	 the
Government. [285 E-F]
     Once it  is conceded  that the  Governor  appoints	 the
Chief Minister	who is	paid a salary according to a statute
made by the legislature from the Government funds, the Chief
Minister becomes a person in the pay of the Government so as
to fall squarely within cl. (12) of<a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_102"> s. 21</a> of the Penal Code.
[286 B]
259
     10. The  use  of  the  words  'other  public  servants'
following a Minister of the Union or of a State clearly show
that a	Minister would	also be	 a public  servant as  other
public servants	 contemplated by <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_103"> s. 199(2)</a>  of the Code and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_104">
the Code</a>  being a  statute complementary  and allied  to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_105"> the

used in the aforesaid section [286 <a href="/doc/698043/" id="a_106">F]

     11. Three facts that have been proved beyond doubt:-
     (i) That  a Minister  is appointed	 or dismissed by the
Governor and  therefore, subordinate  to him whatever be the
nature and status of his constitutional function.
     (ii) That	a Chief	 Minister or  a Minister gets salary
for the	 public work  done or  the public  duty performed by
him.
     (iii) That	 the  said  salary  is	paid  to  the  Chief
Minister or the Minister from the Government funds. [290A-B]
     12. It  is thus  incontrovertible, that the holder of a
public office such as the Chief Minister is a public servant
in respect  of which  the Constitution provides that he will
get his salary from the Government Treasury so long he holds
his  office  on	 account  of  the  public  service  that  he
discharges. The	 salary	 given	to  the	 Chief	Minister  is
coterminus with	 his office  and  is  not  paid	 like  other
constitutional functionaries  such as  the President and the
Speaker. These	fact, therefore,  point to  one and only one
conclusion and that is that the Chief Minister is in the pay
of the Government and is, therefore, a public servant within
the meaning of<a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_110"> s. 21(12)</a> of the Penal Code. [290 C-D]

<p id="p_6">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     FAZAL ALI,	 J. These  two appeals	by  certificate	 are
directed against  a common  order of  the Madras  High Court
dated 10th  May,  1977	dismissing  the	 applications  filed
before the  High Court	by the	appellant for  quashing	 the
order of  the Special  Judge, Madras dated 4th January, 1977
refusing to discharge the appellant under <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_111">section 239</a> of the
Code of	 Criminal Procedure  (hereinafter referred to as<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_112"> the
Code</a>).
</p><p id="p_7">     The facts	of  the	 case  have  been  detailed  in	 the
judgment of the High Court and it is not necessary for us to
repeat the  same  all  over  again.  However,  in  order  to
understand the	points in issue, it may be necessary to give
a resume  of the important stages through which the case has
passed and the constitutional points argued before us.
</p><p id="p_8">     The appellant,  M.	 Karunanidhi,  was  a  former  Chief
Minister of  Tamil Nadu	 and was  the petitioner  before the
High Court  in the applications filed by him before the High
Court. On  15-6-1976 a	D.O. letter was written by the Chief
Secretary to  the Government  of Tamil	Nadu to	 the  Deputy
Inspector General  of Police,  CBI requesting  him to make a
detailed investigation	into certain allegations against the
appellant and  others who  were alleged to have abused their
official position  in the  matter of  purchase of wheat from
Punjab. A  first information report was accordingly recorded
on 16-6-1976  and four	months later  sanction under <a href="/doc/1731569/" id="a_113">section
197</a> of	the Code  was granted  by the Governor of Tamil Nadu
for the prosecution of the appellant under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_114">sections 161</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_115">468</a>
and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_116">471</a>	 of the Indian Penal Code and <a href="/doc/1573164/" id="a_117">section 5(2)</a> read with
<a href="/doc/373615/" id="a_118">section	 5</a>  (1)(d)  of	the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_119">Prevention	 of  Corruption	 Act</a>
(hereinafter referred to as the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_120">Corruption Act</a>). Thereafter,
the police  submitted a	 charge sheet  against the appellant
for the	 offences  mentioned  above  and  alleged  that	 the
appellant had derived for himself pecuniary advantage to the
extent of  Rs. 4  to Rs.  5 lakhs  from Madenlal  Gupta	 for
passing favourable orders in respect of some firms. The case
was registered	before the  Special Judge  and the necessary
copies of  the records	were furnished to the appellant. The
appellant on  appearing before	the Special  Judge filed  an
application for	 discharging him  under <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_121">section	 239</a> of	 the
Code on the ground that the prosecution against him suffered
from  various  legal  and  constitutional  infirmities.	 The
Special	 Judge,	 however,  after  hearing  counsel  for	 the
parties rejected  the application  of  the  appellant  as  a
result of  which the appellant filed two applications in the
High Court  for quashing  the proceedings  and	for  setting
aside the  order of  the Special Judge refusing to discharge
the appellant. As indicated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">261</span>
above, the  High Court	rejected  the  applications  of	 the
appellant but  granted a  certificate for leave to appeal to
this Court and hence these appeals before us.
</p><p id="p_9">     As	 far   back  as	  30th	December,  1973	 the  Madras
Legislature had passed an Act known as The Tamil Nadu Public
Men (Criminal  Misconduct) Act, 1973 hereinafter referred to
as the	<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_122">State Act</a>.  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_123">The State Act</a> was passed after obtaining
the assent  of the  President of  India. <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_124">This State Act</a> was,
however, amended  by Act  16 of	 1974  and  the	 President's
assent was  received on	 10th April,  1974. According to the
provisions of  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_125">State  Act</a> the  statute was	brought into
force by virtue of a notification with effect from 8-5-1974.
According to the allegations made against the appellant, the
acts said  to have  been committed  by him  fell within	 the
period November	 1974 to March, 1975. On 31-1-1976 by virtue
of the	provisions  of	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_126">Article	 356</a>  President's  rule	 was
imposed in  the State  of Tamil Nadu and the Ministry headed
by the	appellant was  dismissed and  a Proclamation  to his
effect was  issued on  the same date. The High Court decided
the petitions  of the  appellant on  10-5-1977 and granted a
certificate for	 leave to appeal to this Court on 27-7-1977.
Subsequently, however,	the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_127">State  Act</a> was  repealed and the
President's assent  to the  repealing of  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_128">State  Act</a> was
given on 6-9-1977. Thus, it is manifest that by the time the
appeal has  reached this  Court and was taken up for hearing
the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_129">State  Act</a> no  longer exists.  Consequently, some of the
constitutional points  raised by the learned counsel for the
appellant before  the Court do not survive for consideration
before us.
</p><p id="p_10">     Faced with	 this situation,  Mr.  Venu  Gopal,  learned
counsel for  the appellant has raised only two points before
us. In	the first  place, he  submitted that even though the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_130">State Act</a>  was repealed	 on 6-9-1977 during the time that it
was in	force, it  was wholly repugnant to the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_131"> of
the Code</a>,  the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_132">Corruption Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_133">Criminal Law Amendment
Act</a> and	 by virtue  of <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_134">Article 254(2)</a> of the Constitution of
India the  provisions of  the aforesaid	 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_135">Central Act</a>s  stood
repealed and  could not	 revive	 after	the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_136">State  Act</a>	 was
repealed. The  constitutional position, it is submitted, was
that even  though the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_137">State Act</a> was repealed the provisions
of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_138">Central Act</a>s having themselves been protanto repealed
by the	<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_139">State Act</a>  when it  was passed	could not be pressed
into service  for the  purpose of  prosecuting the appellant
unless those  provisions were  re-enacted by the appropriate
legislature. A	number of grounds were raised by counsel for
the appellant  in support of the first plank of his argument
that the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_140">State Act</a>  was repugnant  to the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_141">Central Act</a>s  as a  result of  which the former was rendered
void.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">262</span>
<p id="p_11">     Secondly, it  was argued  that even  assuming that	 the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_142">State Act</a>  has ceased to exist and the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_143">Central Act</a>s apply to
the facts  of the  present case,  the  appellant  cannot  be
prosecuted under  any of  the sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_144">	of the Penal Code</a> or
the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_145">Corruption	Act</a>, because being the Chief Minister of the
State at  the relevant	time he	 was not a public servant as
defined in  <a href="/doc/1382517/" id="a_146">section 21</a> clause (12)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_147"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>.
The argument  was that	by virtue  of the  position that the
appellant  enjoyed   as	 Chief	 Minister   there   was	  no
relationship of	 master and  servant  between  him  and	 the
Government and he was acting as a constitutional functionary
and, therefore,	 could not  be described as a public servant
as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_148">section 21(12)</a> of the Penal Code.
</p><p id="p_12">     We propose	 to deal  with the two arguments separately.
We would  first deal  with the	question  of  repugnancy  as
raised by learned counsel for the appellant. It is true that
the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_149">State  Act</a> was  passed by  the Legislature of Tamil Nadu
and the	 assent	 of  the  President  was  obtained  on	30th
December, 1973.	 By virtue  of the provisions of <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_150">Article 254
(2)</a> of	the Constitution  since the  assent of the President
had been given the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_151">State Act</a> was to prevail over the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_152">Central
Act</a>s so	 far as	 the State  of Tamil Nadu was concerned, but
the serious  question to  be considered	 is as to whether or
not  there   was  a   real  repugnancy	 resulting  from  an
irreconcilable inconsistency  between the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_153">State Act</a> and the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_154">Central Act</a>s. <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_155">Article 254</a> of the Constitution runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "254.	  Inconsistency	  between   laws   made	  by
     Parliament and laws made by the Legislatures of States:
     (1) If  any provision  of a law made by the Legislature
     of a  State is repugnant to any provision of a law made
     by Parliament  which Parliament  is competent to enact,
     or to  any provision of an existing law with respect to
     one of  the matters  enumerated in the Concurrent List,
     then, subject  to the provisions of clause (2), the law
     made by  Parliament, whether passed before or after the
     law made  by the  Legislature of such State, or, as the
     case may  be, the	existing law,  shall prevail and the
     law made  by the Legislature of the State shall, to the
     extent of the repugnancy, be void.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  (2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State
     with respect  to one  of the  matters enumerated in the
     Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the
     provisions of  an earlier	law made by Parliament or an
     existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law
     so made  by the  Legislature of such State shall, if it
     has  been	 reserved  for	 the  consideration  of	 the
     President and  has received his assent, prevail in that
     State:
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">263</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent
     Parliament from  enacting at  any	time  any  law	with
     respect to	 the same  matter including a law adding to,
     amending, varying	or repealing  the law so made by the
     Legislature of State".</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">     It would  be seen	that so far as clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_156">Article
254</a> is	concerned it clearly lays down that where there is a
direct collision  between a  provision of  a law made by the
State and that made by Parliament with respect to one of the
matters enumerated  in the Concurrent List, then, subject to
the provisions of clause (2), the State law would be void to
the extent  of the  repugnancy. This  naturally	 means	that
where  both  the  State	 and  Parliament  occupy  the  field
contemplated by	 the Concurrent	 List then the Act passed by
Parliament being  prior in  point of  time will	 prevail and
consequently the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_157">State Act</a> will have to yield to the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_158">Central
Act</a>. In fact, the scheme of the Constitution is a scientific
and equitable  distribution of	legislative  powers  between
Parliament and	the State Legislatures. First, regarding the
matters contained  in List  I, i.e.  the Union	List to	 the
Seventh Schedule, Parliament alone is empowered to legislate
and the State Legislatures have no authority to make any law
in respect  of the Entries contained in List I. Secondly, so
far as the Concurrent List is concerned, both Parliament and
the State  Legislatures are  entitled to legislate in regard
to any of the Entries appearing therein, but that is subject
to the	condition laid	down  by  <a href="/doc/344383/" id="a_159">Article  254(1)</a>  discussed
above. Thirdly,	 so far as the matters in List II, i.e., the
State List  are concerned,  the State Legislatures alone are
competent to  legislate	 on  them  and	only  under  certain
conditions Parliament  can do  so. It is, therefore, obvious
that  in   such	 matters  repugnancy  may  result  from	 the
following circumstances :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  1. Where  the provisions  of a  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_160">Central Act</a>  and a
     <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_161">State Act</a> in the Concurrent List are fully inconsistent
     and are absolutely irreconcilable, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_162">Central Act</a> will
     prevail and  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_163">State  Act</a> will become void in view of
     the repugnancy.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	  2. Where  however a  law passed by the State comes
     into collision  with a  law passed	 by Parliament on an
     Entry in  the Concurrent  List,  the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_164">State  Act</a>  shall
     prevail  to  the  extent  of  the	repugnancy  and	 the
     provisions	 of   the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_165">Central  Act</a>	 would	become	void
     provided the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_166">State Act</a>  has been	passed in accordance
     with clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_167">Article 254.</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	  3. Where  a law  passed by  the State	 Legislature
     while being  substantially	 within	 the  scope  of	 the
     entries in	 the State  List entrenches  upon any of the
     Entries in the Central List
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">264</span>
     the constitutionality  of the  law	 may  be  upheld  by
     invoking the  doctrine of	pith and  substance if on an
     analysis of  the provisions  of the Act it appears that
     by and  large the	law falls within the four corners of
     the State	List an	 entrenchment,	if  any,  is  purely
     incidental or inconsequential.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	  4.  Where,  however,	a  law	made  by  the  State
     Legislature on a subject covered by the Concurrent List
     is inconsistent  with and	repugnant to  a previous law
     made by Parliament, then such a law can be protected by
     obtaining the  assent of  the President  under  <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_168">Article
     254(2)</a> of the Constitution. The result of obtaining the
     assent of	the President  would be	 that so  far as the
     <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_169">State Act</a>	is concerned,  it will	prevail in the State
     and overrule the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_170">Central Act</a> in their
     applicability to  the  State  only.  Such	a  state  of
     affairs will  exist only  until Parliament	 may at	 any
     time make	a law  adding to,  or amending,	 varying  or
     repealing the  law made  by the State Legislature under
     the proviso to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_171">Article 254.</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_14">So far	as the	present <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_172">State Act</a> is concerned we are called
upon to	 consider the  various shades  of the constitutional
validity  of   the  same   under  <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_173">Article   254(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_15">     It is  neither alleged or argued that Parliament has at
any time  after the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_174">State Act</a>	was passed proceeded to pass
any law	 as contemplated  by the Proviso to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_175">Article 254.</a> As,
however, the  State law	 has already  been repealed  and the
President's assent  to the  said repeal has been received as
far back  as 6-9-1977 we are concerned only with the limited
question as  to whether	 if the	 State law  had repealed  or
overruled the provisions of the Central law what will be the
position after	the State  law itself ceases to exist. It is
true that  the doctrine	 of eclipse  would not	apply to the
constitutionality of  the Central  law and the only question
we  have   to  determine   is  whether	there  was  such  an
irreconcilable inconsistency  between the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_176">State Act</a> and the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_177">Central Act</a>s  that the	provisions of  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_178">Central Act</a> stood
repealed and unless re-enacted the said provisions cannot be
invoked even  after the	 <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_179">State Act</a>  was itself	repealed. In
order, however,	 to enter  into the  domain of repugnancy of
the two	 Acts we have to consider the relevant provisions of
the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_180">Central Act</a>s and of the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_181">State Act</a>. The High Court has on
a  very	  careful  and	cautious  analysis  of	the  various
provisions of  the two	Acts come  to a	 clear finding	that
there is no repugnancy between the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_182">State Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_183">Central
Act</a>s, but  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_184">State  Act</a> merely  creates a new and distinct
offence which  in its  nature  and  purport  is	 essentially
different from the offences contemplated by<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_185"> the Indian Penal
Code</a> and  the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_186">Corruption Act</a>. It has been pointed out by the
High Court as also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">265</span>
by the	Solicitor General  that not  only the ingredients of
the offences  created by  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_187">State  Act</a> are  different from
those  of  the	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_188">Central	 Act</a>,  but  even  the  procedure  is
different. It  was further  argued by  the Solicitor General
that there  is absolutely no repugnancy between the two Acts
and both can operate in their respective fields.
</p><p id="p_16">     In order  to appreciate this question, we would briefly
refer to  the scheme  of the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_189">State Act</a>.  <a href="/doc/1755673/" id="a_190">Section 2</a>  defines

</p><p id="p_28">     To begin with, under the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_203">State Act</a> a public-man clearly

inference that	the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_237">State  Act</a> was  passed with	 a  view  to
afford sufficient  protection to a public man by enjoining a
summary inquiry	 or investigation  by a high and independent
Tribunal of  the status	 of a  High Court  Judge or a Senior
District Judge	to instill  confidence in  the people and to
prevent public man from being prosecuted on false, frivolous
and  vexatious	allegations.  Although	the  ingredients  of
criminal misconduct  as defined	 in <a href="/doc/47837/" id="a_238">section  5(1)</a> (d) of the
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_239">Corruption Act</a>	are substantially  the same in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_240">State Act</a>
as in  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_241">Central Act</a>s but here also the punishment is much
severer in  the case of the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_242">State Act</a> than the one contained
in the	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_243">Central Act</a>s.  It is,  therefore, manifest  that the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_244">State Act</a>  does not contain any provision which is repugnant

<p id="p_40">mentary Act which runs pari passu the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_246">Central Act</a>s mentioned

have to be prosecuted under the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_254">Criminal Law (Amendment) Act</a>

applied	 to  a	public	man  by	 the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_256">State  Act</a>  after	 the

</p><p id="p_42">     It was,  however, strongly	 contended by Mr. Venu Gopal

     convicted	are   inconsistent  with   the	law  of	 the
     Commonwealth within  the meaning  of sec.	109  of	 the

     Issacs, J. observed as follows:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">	  "There can  be no  question that  the Commonwealth
     Navigation Act,  by its  own direct  provisions and the

     inconsistent  with	 the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_271">State  Act</a>  in  various  ways,
     including (1)  general supersession  of the regulations

     whatever those may be; (2) the jurisdiction to convict,
     the  State	  law  empowering   the	 Court	 to  convict

     contravention  an	indictable  offence,  and  therefore
     bringing into  operation sec.  80 of  the Constitution,
     requiring a  jury; (3) the penalty, the State providing
     a maximum	of $  50 the  Commonwealth Act prescribing a
     maximum of	 $ 100,	 or imprisonment,  or both;  (4) the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">	  "In Cowburn's case (supra) is stated the reasoning
     for that  conclusion and  we will	now refer  to  those
     statements without	 repeating them.  In short, the very
     same conduct  by the  same persons	 is  dealt  with  in
     conflicting terms by the Commonwealth and <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_272">State Act</a>s. A

     ascertain the  scope or  bearing of  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_273">State  Act</a>. It
     must simply  apply sec.  109 of the Constitution, which
     declares the invalidity protanto of the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_274">State Act</a>".
     Similarly Dixon, J. observed thus:-

     notwithstanding that  the rule  of conduct is identical
     which each	 prescribes, and sec. 109 applies. That this
     is so  is settled,	 at least  when the  sanctions	they
     impose are diverse Hume v. Palmer (supra)".</blockquote>

observed as follows-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">	  "The important thing to consider with reference to
     this  provision  is  whether  the	legislation  is	 'in

     deals not	with the matters which formed the subject of
     the earlier  legislation but  with other  and  distinct
     matters though  of a cognate and allied character, then
     <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_276">Article 254 (2)</a> will have no application. The principle

     by the  Centre and	 by the Province, both of them being
     competent to  enact the  same, the	 law of	 the  Centre

	  "It is  true, as  already pointed  out, that	on a

     Parliament prevails  against a  law of  the  State,  no
     question of  repeal arises;  but the principle on which

     subject-matter of	the later  legislation is  identical
     with that	of the	earlier, so  that they	cannot	both

of Sulaiman,  J. in  the case of Shyamakant Lal v. Rambhajan
Singh (4) where Sulaiman, J. observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">	  "When	 the   question	 is   whether  a  Provincial
     legislation is repugnant to an existing Indian law, the

     validity. There  ought to be a presumption in favour of
     its validity,  and	 every	effort	should	be  made  to

in the	shape of section 109 of the Australian Constitution,
there  was   no	 corresponding	provision  in  the  American
Constitution. Similarly, the Canadian cases have laid down a
principle  too	narrow	for  application  to  Indian  cases.
According to  the learned Judge, the safe rule to follow was
that where  the paramount legislation does not purport to be
exhaustive or  unqualified there  is no inconsistency and in
this connection observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">	  "The principle  of that decision is that where the
     paramount legislation does not purport to be exhaustive
     or unqualified,  but itself permits or recognises other

<blockquote id="blockquote_53">     not be  said  that	 any  qualification  or	 restriction

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_54">	  "The	position  will	be  even  more	obvious,  if
     another test  of repugnancy which has been suggested in

     inconsistency between  the two provisions that one must
     be taken to repeal the other by necessary implication"
     In the  case of  <a href="/doc/865455/" id="a_293">State of Orissa v. M. A. Tulloch &amp; Co</a>.
</blockquote><p id="p_54">(1) Ayyangar J. speaking for the Court observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">	  "Repugnancy arises when two enactments both within
     the competence of the two Legislatures collide and when
     the Constitution  expressly or by necessary implication
     provides that  the enactment  of  one  Legislature	 has
     superiority over  the other  then to  the extent of the
     repugnancy	 the  one  supersedes  the  other.  But	 two
     enactments may  be repugnant  to each other even though
     obedience	to   each  of	them  is   possible  without
     disobeying the  other. The	 test  of  two	legislations
     containing contradictory  provisions is  not,  however,
     the only  criterion of  repugnancy, for  if a competent
     legislature  with	a  superior  efficacy  expressly  or
     impliedly evinces	by its	legislation an	intention to
     cover the	whole field,  the enactments  of  the  other
     legislature whether  passed before	 or after  would  be
     overborne on  the ground  of repugnance.  Where such is
     the position,  the inconsistency is demonstrated not by
     a detailed comparison of provisions of the two statutes
     but  by  the  mere	 existence  of	the  two  pieces  of
     legislation".</blockquote>
<p id="p_55">     In the  case of <a href="/doc/1476698/" id="a_294">T. S. Balliah v. T. S. Rangachari</a>(2) it
was pointed  out by  this Court	 that before  coming to	 the
conclusion that	 there is a repeal by implication, the Court
must  be   satisfied  that   the  two	enactments  are	  so
inconsistent that  it becomes  impossible for  them to stand
together. In other words, this Court held that when there is
a direct  collision between  the  two  enactments  which  is
irreconcilable	then   only  repugnancy	  results.  In	this
connection, the Court made the following observations:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">	  "Before coming  to the  conclusion that there is a
     repeal by implication, the Court must be satisfied that
     the two  enactments are  so inconsistent  or  repugnant
     that they cannot
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">278</span>
     stand together  and the  repeal of	 the  express  prior
     enactment must  flow from	necessary implication of the
     language  of  the	later  enactment.  It  is  therefore
     necessary in  this connection  to scrutinise  the terms
     and consider  the true  meaning and  effect of  the two
     enactments".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57">	  "The provisions  enacted in <a href="/doc/574806/" id="a_295"> s. 52</a> of the 1922 Act
     do not  alter the	nature or  quality  of	the  offence
     enacted in	<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_296"> s. 177</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_297">  Indian Penal	Code</a> but  it  merely
     provides a new course of procedure for what was already
     an offence.  In a	case of	 this  description  the	 new
     statute is	 regarded not  as superseding, nor repealing
     by implication the previous law, but as cumulative".
	  "A plain  reading of	the section shows that there
     is no  bar to  the trial  or conviction of the offender
     under both	 enactments but	 there is  only a bar to the
     punishment of  the offender twice for the same offence.
     In other  words, the section provides that where an act
     or	 omission   constitutes	  an   offence	 under	 two
     enactments, the offender may be prosecuted and punished
     under either  or both  the enactments  but shall not be
     liable to be punished twice for the same offence".</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">     On	 a   careful  consideration,   therefore,   of	 the
authorities referred  to above,	 the following	propositions
emerge:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">	  1.   That in	order  to  decide  the	question  of
	       repugnancy it  must be  shown  that  the	 two
	       enactments    contain	 inconsistent	 and
	       irreconcilable  provisions,   so	 that	they
	       cannot stand  together or operate in the same
	       field.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">	  2.   That there  can be  no repeal  by implication
	       unless the  inconsistency appears on the face
	       of the two statutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">	  3.   That  where   the  two	statutes  occupy   a
	       particular   field,    there   is   room	  or
	       possibility of both the statutes operating in
	       the same	 field without coming into collision
	       with each other, no repugnancy results.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_61">	  4.   That where  there is  no inconsistency  but a
	       statute occupying  the same  field  seeks  to
	       create distinct	and  separate  offences,  no
	       question of  repugnancy arises  and both	 the
	       statutes continue  to  operate  in  the	same
	       field.</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">279</span>
<p id="p_57">     In the  light of  the  propositions  enunciated  above,
there can  be no  doubt that  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_298">State Act</a> creates distinct
and  separate	offences  with	 different  ingredients	 and
different punishments  and it  does not	 in any	 way collide
with the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_299">Central Act</a>s.	 On the	 other hand,  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_300">State	 Act</a>
itself permits	the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_301">Central  Act</a>, namely,  the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_302">Criminal	 Law
(Amendment) Act</a>	 to come into its aid after an investigation
is completed  and a  report is submitted by the Commissioner
or the	Additional Commissioner. It was contended however by
Mr. Venu Gopal that by virtue of the fact that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_303">State Act</a>
has obtained  the assent of the President, it will be deemed
to be  a dominant  legislation,	 and,  therefore,  it  would
overrule the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_304">Central Act</a>s.  Doubtless, the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_305">State Act</a> is the
dominant legislation  but we  are unable  to agree  with Mr.
Venu Gopal  that there	are any	 provisions in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_306">State Act</a>
which are  irreconcilably or  directly inconsistent with the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_307">Central Act</a>s so as to overrule them.
</p><p id="p_58">     Last but  not the	least  there  is  a  very  important
circumstance which  completely and conclusively clinches the
issue and  takes the  force out	 of the argument of Mr. Venu
Gopal on  the question	of repugnancy. It would be seen that
in the original <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_308">State Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_309">section 29</a> ran thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">	  "Act to  overrule other  laws, etc.-The provisions
     of this  Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything
     inconsistent therewith  contained in  any other law for
     the time  being  in  force	 or  any  custom,  usage  or
     contract or  decree  or  order  of	 a  court  or  other
     authority".</blockquote>
<p id="p_59">     This section  underwent an	 amendment which was brought
about by  <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_310">Tamil Nadu  Act</a> 16 of 1974 which substituted a new
<a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_311">section 29</a>  for the  old one.  The  new	 section  which	 was
substituted may be extracted thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">	  "Saving-The provisions  of this  Act shall  be  in
     addition to,  and not  in derogation  of, any other law
     for the  time being  in force,  and  nothing  contained
     herein shall  exempt any public man from any proceeding
     by way of investigation or otherwise which might, apart
     from this Act, be instituted against him".
</blockquote><p id="p_60">This amendment	received the assent of the President on 10th
April, 1974  and was  published in the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette	 Extraordinary	dated  16th  April,  1974.  We	have
already shown  that although the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_312">State Act</a> was passed as far
back as	 30th December,	 1973 it  received the assent of the
President on  the 10th	April, 1974  that is  to say, on the
same date  as Act  16 of  1974. <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_313">The  Act</a> was however brought
into force on the 8th May, 1974 when the new <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_314">section 29</a>
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_315"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">280</span></a>
which had  already replaced the old section and had become a
part of the statute. Therefore, for all intents and purposes
the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_316">State  Act</a> cannot  be read	in isolation,  but has to be
interpreted  in	  conjunction  with   the  express  language
contained in  <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_317">section 29</a>  of the State Act. This section has
in unequivocable  terms expressed  the	intention  that	 the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_318">State Act</a>  which was  undoubtedly the  dominant	 legislation
would only be "in addition to and not in derogation with any
other law  for the  time being	in force"  which  manifestly
includes the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_319">Central Act</a>s,  namely,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_320"> the  Indian Penal Code</a>,
the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_321">Corruption	Act</a> and	 the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_322">Criminal  Law (Amendment)	Act</a>.
Thus, the Legislature about a month before the main Act came
into force  clearly declared  its intention that there would
be no  question of  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_323">State Act</a> colliding with the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_324">Central
Act</a>s referred  to above.  The second part of <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_325">section 29</a> also
provides that  nothing contained  in  the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_326">State  Act</a>  shall
exempt any  public man	from being  proceeded with by way of
investigation or  otherwise under  a  proceeding  instituted
against him  under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_327">Central Act</a>s. It is, therefore, clear
that in	 view of  this clear  intention of  the	 legislature
there can be no room for any argument that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_328">State Act</a> was
in any	way repugnant  to the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_329">Central Act</a>s. We have already
pointed out from the decisions of the Federal Court and this
Court that  one of  the important  tests to  find out  as to
whether or  not there  is repugnancy  is  to  ascertain	 the
intention of  the legislature  regarding the  fact that	 the
dominant legislature  allowed the subordinate legislature to
operate in the same field pari passu the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_330">State Act</a>.

369 observes as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">	  "Many earlier	 statutes contain clauses similar in
     effect to	the general  rule, but without the confusing
     words as to contrary intention. These statutes, of some
     of which a list is given below, seem not to be affected
     by the  above rule,  save so  far	as  it	enables	 the
     revisers of  the statute-book  to excise the particular
     clauses.  In   accordance	with  this  rule,  penalties
     imposed by	 statute  for  offences	 already  punishable
     under a  prior statute  are regarded  as cumulative  or
     alternative and  not as  replacing the penalty to which
     the offender was previously liable."
</blockquote><p id="p_62">Such an intention is clearly discernible from the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_331">section  29</a> of  the State  Act. Mr.	Venu Gopal  tried to
rebut this argument on the ground that <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_332">section 29</a> would have
no application	where the inconsistency between the dominant
statute and  the subordinate statute is direct and complete.
We have already found on a discussion of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">281</span>
the various  provisions of  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_333">State  Act</a> that	 there is no
direct inconsistency  at all  between the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_334">State Act</a> and the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_335">Central Act</a>s,  and this	 affords a  sufficient answer to the
argument of  Mr. Venu  Gopal. Having,  therefore, given	 our
anxious consideration  to the import and ambit of <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_336">section 29</a>
it seems  to us	 that the  provisions of <a href="/doc/1837041/" id="a_337">section 29</a> would be
presumptive proof  of the  fact that  there is no repugnancy
between the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_338">State Act</a>	and the	 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_339">Central Act</a>s nor did either
the legislature	 or  the  President  intend  to	 create	 any
repugnancy between  these Acts	as a  result  of  which	 the
criticism regarding the repugnancy is completely obliterated
in the	instant case  and we, therefore, hold that the State
legislature never  intended to occupy the same field covered
by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_340">Central Act</a>s.
</p><p id="p_63">     It was  also contended  by Mr.  Venu Gopal	 that if the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_341">Central Act</a>s  being repugnant  to the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_342">State Act</a> are pressed
into service  even after  the repeal  of the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_343">State Act</a>, the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_344">Central Act</a>s  would stand  repealed hence the prosecution of
the  appellant	 would	be  hit	 by  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_345">Article  20(3)</a>  of	 the
Constitution, i.e. the appellant cannot be prosecuted for an
ex post	 facto offence.	 On our	 findings in  this case that
there is  no inconsistency  between the	 <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_346">State Act</a>  and	 the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_347">Central	 Act</a>s  the  application	 of  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_348">Article  20(3)</a>  of	 the
Constitution to	 the facts  of this  case does	not arise at
all. We,  therefore, find  ourselves in	 complete  agreement
with the  view taken  by the  High Court  that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_349">State Act</a>
creates new  and distinct  offences and	 is not	 in any	 way
repugnant  to	any  provisions	 of  the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_350">Central  Act</a>s	 and
consequently overruled	the first  limb of  the argument  of
counsel for the appellant.
</p><p id="p_64">     Similarly the  contention	of  Mr.	 Venu  Gopal  as  to
whether or  not the  prosecution of  the appellant  would be
violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_351">Article 14</a> of the Constitution is not available
to the	appellant, and consequently the learned counsel gave
up this	 point and in our opinion very rightly because since
the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_352">State  Act</a> has  now been  repealed the  question of	 the
prosecution of	the appellant  hereafter under the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_353">State Act</a>
does not  arise at  all, and, therefore, the question of two
remedies being	open to the prosecution which they may elect
at their  own option  does  not	 arise	in  this  case.	 The
appellant can  be prosecuted  only under  the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_354">Corruption Act</a>
and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_355"> the	 Penal Code</a>  and under	no other  Act at the moment.
Moreover, it  was obviously  wrong to  say that	 the earlier
Central Law  became violative  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_356">Article  14</a> as soon as the
State law was enacted.
</p><p id="p_65">     This brings  us to	 the second  limb of the argument of
the learned  counsel for  the appellant which relates to the
import	and   connotation  of	the  term  'public  servant'
appearing in <a href="/doc/72179/" id="a_357">section 21(12)</a> of the Indian
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">282</span><a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_358">
Penal Code</a>.  Clause 12	of <a href="/doc/1382517/" id="a_359">section  21</a> which is the relevant
provision so  far as the present case is concerned runs thus
:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">	  "21. The  words 'public  servant' denote  a person
     falling  under  any  of  the  descriptions	 hereinafter
     following namely:-
</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">		X	      X		     X
     Twelfth-Every person-
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_66">     (a)  in  the  service  or	pay  of	 the  Government  or
	  remunerated  by   fees  or   commission  for	 the
	  performance of any public duty by the Government:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_67">		X	      X		     X
     It was  vehemently contended  by Mr.  Venu	 Gopal	that
having regard  to the  constitutional and public duties of a
Chief Minister	or a  Minister he  cannot be  deemed to be a
public	servant	 in  any  sense	 of  the  term.	 He  further
contended that	the entire clause (12) (a) should be read as
a whole	 and cannot  be severed into two limbs in as much as
the words 'in the service or pay of the Government' are used
as synonyms. It was further contended that the words 'in the
service or  pay	 of  the  Government'  clearly	connote	 the
relationship of	 master and  servant-a relationship which is
completely beyond  the concept of the position of a Minister
or a  Chief Minister.  We, however, agree that so far as the
first part  of clause  (12) (a) is concerned, namely "in the
service	 of   the  Government'	 undoubtedly   signifies   a
relationship  of  master  and  servant	where  the  employer
employs	 the   employee	 on   the  basis   of  a  salary  or
remuneration. But  we are  of the opinion that so far as the
second limb  'in the  pay of  the Government'  is concerned,
that appears  to be  of a  much	 wider	amplitude-so  as  to
include within	its ambit even public servant who may not be
a regular  employee receiving  salary from  his	 master.  In
other words,  we think	that even  a  Minister	or  a  Chief
Minister will  be clearly  covered by the expression 'person
in the	pay of	the Government'.  Mr. Venu  Gopal,  however,
relied on  the meaning	of the	words "in  the	pay  of'  as
appearing in the various dictionaries.</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">     In Shorter Oxford English Dictionary the expression 'in
the pay of' is defined thus-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_68">	  "To give  money, etc.,  in return for something or
     in discharge of an obligation. Of a thing or action. To
     yield an  adequate	 return.  To  give  money  or  other
     equivalent value for".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_69">     Similarly 'Payer' is defined thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_70">	  "One who pays a sum of money".</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">283</span>
<p id="p_67">     In Webster's  Third New  International  Dictionary	 the
expression 'in the pay of' is indicated to mean:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">     "Compensate, remunerate, satisfy, reimburse, indemnify,
     recompense, repay.	 Pay  is  a  general  term,  lacking
     particular connotation  but sometimes bluntly stressing
     the purchase of service, pay a machinist high wages".
	  "Wages, salary remuneration".</blockquote>
<p id="p_68">     In Webster's  New World  Dictionary the  expression 'in
the pay of' is thus defined:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">	  "Stresses  the  idea	of  payment  for  a  service
     rendered, but  it often  also carries an implication of
     reward (a	bumper crop  remunerated the  farmer for his
     labors)".</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">     In Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition Vol. 31A p. 176
the meaning of the word 'pay' is given thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">     "Pay" is  remuneration, wages or salary. To remunerate;
     to recompense, to give any pay".</blockquote>
<p id="p_70">     In Venkataramaya's	 Law  Lexicon  Vol.  II	 p.1122	 the
expression 'to pay money' has the following connotation:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_74">	  "To pay  money is  to pay it in respect of a right
     which some person has to receive it".</blockquote>
<p id="p_71">     In Corpus	Juris Secundum	Vol. 70 at page 200 the word
'pay' if  used as  a noun is defined as remuneration, wages,
compensation, salary and the following observations are also
made:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">	  "To noun  'pay' has  been held  equivalent to,  or
     synonymous with,  'compensation', salary  and wages and
     has  been	 compared  with,   or  distinguished   from,
     'allowance' and 'consideration'".</blockquote>
<p id="p_72">     A careful analysis of the meanings assigned to the word
'pay' in  the various dictionaries and the texts referred to
above would  clearly reveal  that the expression 'in the pay
of' connotes  that a person is getting salary, compensation,
wages or  any amount  of money.	 This by itself however does
not lead  to the inference that a relationship of master and
servant must  necessarily exist	 in all cases where a person
is paid	 salary. This  aspect of  the  matter  would  become
crystal	 clear	 if  we	  examine   the	  nature   and	 the
constitutional position	 and status of a Minister or a Chief
Minister.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">284</span>
<p id="p_73"><a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_360">Article 164</a> of the Constitution runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_76">	  "Other provisions  as to  Ministers: (1) The Chief
     Minister shall  be appointed  by the  Governor and	 the
     other Ministers  shall be	appointed by the Governor on
     the advice	 of the	 Chief Minister,  and the  Ministers
     shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor:
	  Provided that	 in  the  States  of  Bihar,  Madhya
     Pradesh and Orissa, there shall be a Minister in Charge
     of tribal	welfare who  may in addition be in charge of
     the  welfare  of  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  backward
     classes or any other work".</blockquote>
<p id="p_74">     This Article  clearly shows  that a  Chief Minister  is
appointed by  the Governor  and having been appointed by the
Governor it  is manifest  that	he  is	subordinate  to	 the
Governor. Even	in <a href="/doc/574806/" id="a_361">section 52</a> (1) of the Government of India
Act, 1935  which preceded our Constitution the provision was
worded thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_77">	  "52 (1) The Governor of a Governor's province may,
     by notification,  appoint ministers,  not being members
     of	 his   executive  council   or	other  officials  to
     administer transferred  subjects, and  any ministers so
     appointed shall hold office during his pleasure:
	  There may  be paid to any minister so appointed in
     any province  the same salary as is payable to a member
     of the  executive council	in that	 province, unless  a
     smaller salary  is provided  by vote of the legislative
     council of the province".</blockquote>
<p id="p_75">     In this  section also it was the Governor who alone had
the power  to choose  the ministers. In fact, in <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_362">Article 164</a>
the word  'appointment' is much higher than the concept of a
person being  chosen. <a href="/doc/819531/" id="a_363">Article 164(5)</a> provides for the salary
and allowances of Ministers and runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">	  "164 (5)  The salaries and allowances of Ministers
     shall be  such as the Legislature of the State may from
     time  to	time  by   law	determine   and,  until	 the
     Legislature of  the State	so determines,	shall be  as
     specified in the Second Schedule".</blockquote>
<p id="p_76">     Under this	 provision the	Ministers on being appointed
by the Governor are entitled to such salaries and allowances
as the	Legislature of	the State may determine from time to
time and  until this is done, the emoluments will be such as
are specified in the Second
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">285</span>
Schedule. As  however all  the Legislatures of the States as
also Parliament	 have already  passed Acts providing for the
salaries and  emoluments  of  the  Chief  Minister  and	 the
Ministers the  specification  of  their	 emoluments  in	 the
Second Schedule to the Constitution have been deleted.
</p><p id="p_77">     <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_364">Article 167</a>  lays down the duties of the Chief Minister
and runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">	  "167. Duties	of Chief  Minister as  respects	 the
     furnishing of  information to Governor etc. It shall be
     the duty of the Chief Minister of each State
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_80">	  (a)  to communicate  to the  Governor of the State
	       all decisions  of the  Council  of  Ministers
	       relating to the administration of the affairs
	       of the State and proposals for legislation;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_81">	  (b)  to furnish  such information  relating to the
	       administration of  affairs of  the State	 and
	       proposals for legislation as the Governor may
	       call for;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_82">	  (c)  if the  Governor so  requires, to  submit for
	       the consideration of the Council of Ministers
	       any matter on which a decision has been taken
	       by  a   Minister	 but   which  has  not	been
	       considered by the Council".</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">     It	 is,   therefore,  clear   that	 by  virtue  of	 the
provisions contained  in <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_365">Article  167</a>,	the  Chief  Minister
undoubtedly performs a public duty of the nature as enjoined
by clauses  (a) to  (c) of  <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_366">Article 167.</a>  It is also clearly
provided in  the Constitution that the Chief Minister or the
Ministers are  entitled to  salaries or allowances obviously
in lieu	 of public  duties that	 they perform.	The salaries
given to  the Chief Minister or the Ministers are given from
the Government	funds,	and  therefore,	 there	will  be  no
difficulty in  holding that  the Ministers are in the pay of
the Government	inasmuch as  they  receive  their  salaries,
remunerations or  wages from the Government. Mr. Venu Gopal,
however, submitted  that no analogy can be drawn between the
constitutional provisions  and the  provisions contained  in
the Government	of  India  Act	because	 the  constitutional
position of  a Chief Minister under the Constitution was not
the same  as under  the Government  of India  Act where	 the
Governor enjoyed  vast and  plenary powers and was not bound
by the advice of the Council of Ministers as the Governor is
under our  Constitution. It  is not  necessary to probe into
this aspect  of the matter, because the Constitution clearly
lays down  that the Governor appoints the Chief Minister and
being the appoint-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">286</span>
<p id="p_79">ing authority  he is  also the	dismissing authority. We are
not  at	 all  concerned	 in  the  instant  case	 as  to	 the
circumstances  under  which  the  Governor  can	 appoint  or
dismiss the  Chief Minister.  Once it  is conceded  that the
Governor appoints  the Chief  Minister who  is paid a salary
according to  a statute	 made by  the legislature  from	 the
Government funds, the Chief Minister becomes a person in the
pay of	the Government	so as to fall squarely within clause
(12) of <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_367">section 21</a> of the Penal Code.
</p><p id="p_80">     There is  another circumstance  to show  that  a  Chief
Minister or a Minister is undoubtedly a public servant which
was relied  upon by the High Court in repelling the argument
of Mr. Venu Gopal. <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_368">Section 199</a> of the Code runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_83">	  "199 (2)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in
     this Code,	 when any  offence falling under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_369"> Chapter XXI
     of the  Indian Penal  Code</a>	 is  alleged  to  have	been
     committed against	a person  who, at  the time  of such
     commission	 is   the  President   of  India,  the	Vice
     President of  India,  the	Governor  of  a	 State,	 the
     Administrator of a Union Territory or a Minister of the
     Union or  of a  State or  of a  Union territory, or any
     other public  servant employed  in connection  with the
     affairs of	 the Union  or of  a State in respect of his
     conduct in	 the discharge	of his	public	functions  a
     Court of  Session may  take cognizance of such offence,
     without  the   case  being	 committed  to	it,  upon  a
     complaint in writing made by the Public Prosecutor".</blockquote>
<p id="p_81">     The use  of words	'other public  servants' following a
Minister of  the Union	or of  a State	clearly show  that a
Minister would	also be	 a public  servant as  other  public
servants contemplated by <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_370">section 199</a> (2)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_371"> of the Code</a> are<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_372"> the
Code</a> being  a statute  complimentary and allied to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_373"> the Penal
Code</a> can  be looked  into for the purpose of determining the
real meaning  and import  of the  words 'public	 servant' as
used in the aforesaid section.
</p><p id="p_82">     The Solicitor  General placed  reliance on the decision
of this	 Court in  the case  of <a href="/doc/698043/" id="a_374">Dattatraya  Narayan Patil v.
State of  Maharashtra</a>(1) where	this Court  had	 held  in  a
slightly different  context that  a Minister  was  a  public
servant. Mr.  Venu Gopal  has, however,	 distinguished	this
decision on  the ground	 that this  Court proceeded  on	 the
assumption that	 it was	 not disputed  before the Court that
the Minister  was a  Public Servant and the case having been
decided on the concession
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">287</span>
of the	parties cannot	be  relied  upon  by  the  Solicitor
General. In that case to which two of us (Untwalia and Fazal
Ali, JJ.)  were	 parties  to  the  judgment,  the  following
observations were made:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">	  "The duty  assigned to  a public  servant  by	 his
     master, be	 it be	under a	 statute or  by an executive
     order,  will  assume  the	character  of  public  duty,
     provided the  duty assigned  is not  illegal or against
     public policy.  Will it make any difference in the case
     of a  Minister? In our judgment, not. The Minister is a
     public servant-not disputed".</blockquote>
<p id="p_83">     These observations	 no doubt  fortify our	opinion that
the Chief Minister is a public servant which is based on the
reasons that  we have  already given and which are different
from those given in the case cited before us.
</p><p id="p_84">     In the case of <a href="/doc/1432437/" id="a_375">Emperor v. Sibnath Banerji &amp; Ors</a>.(1) the
Privy Council  clearly held that it was not in a position to
accept the  suggestion of  the counsel that the Minister was
not subordinate	 to  the  Governor.  This  was	the  precise
argument which	had been  put forward by Mr. Venu Gopal when
he contended  that the	Chief Minister is not subordinate to
the Governor.  The Privy Council observed as follows in this
connection:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_85">	  "So far  as it  is relevant  in the  present case,
     their Lord	 ships are  unable to accept a suggestion by
     counsel for  the respondents  that the Home Minister is
     not an  officer subordinate  to the Governor within the
     meaning of	 s.49 (1),  and so  far as  the decision  in
     <a href="/doc/1515320/" id="a_376">Emperor v.	 Hemendra Prosad Ghoshe</a> (19) I.L.R. (1939) 2
     Cal. 411 decides that a Minister is not such an officer
     their Lordships  are unable  to agree  with it. While a
     Minister  may  have  duties  to  the  Legislature,	 the
     provisions of  s.51 as  to the appointment, payment and
     dismissal of Ministers, and s.59 (3) and (4) of the Act
     of 1935, and the Business Rules made by virtue of s.59,
     place beyond doubt that the Home Minister is an officer
     subordinate to the Governor".</blockquote>
<p id="p_85">     We find  ourselves in  complete agreement with the view
taken by  the Privy  Council. In  fact the case of the Privy
Council referred  to above  was noticed	 and relied  upon by
this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1786180/" id="a_377">Rao
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">288</span>
Shiv Bahadur Singh &amp; Anr. v. The State of Vindhya Pradesh</a>(1)
where this Court observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_86">	  "Clause 9  of <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_378">section	 21</a> Indian  Penal Code shows
     that every	 officer in  the service or pay of the Crown
     for the  performance of  any public  duty is  a 'public
     servant'. The  decision of	 the Privy  Council in	King
     Emperor v.	 Sibnath Banerji(2) is decisive to show that
     a	Minister  under	 the  Government  of  India  is	 'an
     officer' subordinate  to  the  Governor.  On  the	same
     reasoning there  can be  no doubt	that the Minister of
     Vindhya Pradesh  would be	an 'Officer  of the State of
     Vindhya Pradesh.  Therefore, prior	 to the	 passing  of
     ordinance No.  XLVIII of  1949 and on the view that<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_379"> the
     Indian Penal  Code</a> with  necessary	 adaptation  mutatis
     mutandis was  in force  at least in the Rewa portion of
     Vindhya Pradesh  (if not  in the  entirety	 of  Vindhya
     Pradesh) the  first appellant  was a  public servant as
     defined in	 <a href="/doc/1382517/" id="a_380">section 21</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_381">  Indian Penal Code</a>, as adapted.
     The  amendment   of  the  said  section  brought  about
     therefore no  substantial change in the position of the

     General Clauses  Act, 1897, the word 'State Government'
     has been  defined.	 Clause	 (c)  of  <a href="/doc/1221360/" id="a_384">section  3(60)</a>  is
     applicable to  the present case and therefore the State
     Government is  to mean  the Governor for the purpose of
     the present  case. The result therefore is that accused
     No.1 is  a	 public	 servant  who  can  be	said  to  be
     removable only by the State Government, meaning thereby
     the Governor,  and I  do not  find	 any  difficulty  in
     coming to the conclusion that the second requirement of
     <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_385">Section 197</a>, Cr. P.C. also is fully satisfied as far as
     accused No.1 is concerned".</blockquote>

<p id="p_87">     In the  case of <a href="/doc/1494322/" id="a_386">S. Tara Singh v. Director Consolidation
of Holdings,  Punjab, Jullundur	 &amp; Ors</a>.(1)  the Punjab	High
Court took the same view and observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_88">	  "It follows  from the	 above conclusion that under
     <a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_387">Article 154  (1)</a> of  the Constitution  the Governor may
     act directly  or through  his subordinate	officers. In
     the present  case he  has acted through the Development
     Minister. The  question arises whether he could so act.
     Obviously	the   executive	 authority  carries  on	 the
     business of the Government and part of this business is
     the power	given to  the State Government under section
     42 of  the Consolidation  Act. Under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_388">Article 166 (3)</a> of
     the  Constitution	 the  Governor	 can  allocate	this
     business to any Minister he likes....... Moreover there
     can be  no doubt  that a Minister is subordinate to the
     Governor. The  Governor is	 the executive	head of	 the
     State and	this position  he does	not share  with	 the
     Chief Minister  or any other Minister. He allocates his
     executive duties to various Ministers under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_389">Article 166
     (3)</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_89">	  He appoints a Minister albeit on the advice of the
     Chief Minister and the Minister holds office during his
     pleasure. Therefore  it is open to a Governor under the
     Constitution to  dismiss an  individual Minister at his
     pleasure. In  these circumstances there can be no doubt
     that a  Minister is  to be	 considered  as	 an  officer
     subordinate to the Governor".</blockquote>
<p id="p_88">     We find  ourselves in  complete agreement with the view
taken and  the reasons given by the Punjab High Court in the
aforesaid case.
</p><p id="p_89">     To the  same effect  is a	decision of  the J  &amp; K High
Court in  the case  of Bakshi  Ghulam Mohd. v. G. M. Sadiq &amp;
Ors(2) where Anant Singh, J. observe as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_90">	  "A Minister  of a  State is  paid from  its public
     exchequer, and he is paid for doing public duty and, in
     my opinion, a Minister is a 'public officer' within the
     meaning of Sec. 80 as defined in Sec. 2 (17) (h) of the
     Civil Procedure Code".</blockquote>
<p id="p_90">     The opinion  expressed by	the learned Judge is clearly
in consonance with the view that we have taken in this case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">290</span>
<p id="p_91">Three facts, therefore, have been proved beyond doubt:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_91">	  1. That  a Minister  is appointed  or dismissed by
     the Governor  and is,  therefore,	subordinate  to	 him
     whatever be the nature and status of his constitutional
     functions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_92">	  2. That a Chief Minister or a Minister gets salary
     for the  public work  done or the public duty performed
     by him.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_93">	  3. That  the said  salary is	paid  to  the  Chief
     Minister or the Minister from the Government funds.</blockquote>
<p id="p_92">     It is  thus incontrovertible,  that  the  holder  of  a
public office such as the Chief Minister is a public servant
in respect  of whom  the Constitution  provides that he will
get his salary from the Government Treasury so long he holds
his  office  on	 account  of  the  public  service  that  he
discharges. The	 salary	 given	to  the	 Chief	Minister  is
coterminous with  his office  and is  not  paid	 like  other
constitutional functionaries  such as  the President and the
Speaker. These	facts, therefor,  point to  one and only one
conclusion and that is that the Chief Minister is in the pay
of the Government and is, therefore, a public servant within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/1382517/" id="a_390">section 21</a> (12)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_391"> of the Penal Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_93">     For the  reasons given  above, we	are satisfied that a
Chief Minister or a Minister is undoubtedly a public servant
as defined  in <a href="/doc/1382517/" id="a_392">section	21(12)</a> (a)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_393"> of the Penal Code</a> and the
view taken  by the  High Court	on this point was absolutely
correct in  law. The  result is	 that  all  the	 contentions
raised by Mr. Venu Gopal, counsel for the appellant fail and
the appeals are dismissed. The case before the Special Judge
will now proceed to its ultimate end according to law.
