 ORAL JUDGMENT (PER S. C. DHARMADHIKARI, J.) :


</pre><p id="p_1"> 1. The first Commercial Appeal on our board is by the original

 defendants 1 to 6 in the Suit for infringement of copyright being

 Commercial Suit (L) No. 459 of 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3"> 2.        That  Suit was filed by the respondent in this Appeal.


</p><p id="p_4"> 3.        Since detailed arguments  have been canvassed, we proceed

 to dispose of this Appeal finally by this order.


</p><p id="p_5"> 4.        At the outset, we must clarify that this Appeal challenges an

 ad-interim   order   of   the   learned   Single   Judge   in   the   above

 Commercial Suit (L) No.459 of 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7"> 5.        An application for interim injunction vide Notice of Motion

 (L)   No.   515   of   2017   was   made   in   that   Suit   by   the

 respondent/plaintiff.   In   that   application,   the   urgent   ad-interim

 injunction   was   sought   by   the   respondent/plaintiff   against   the

 appellants/original   defendants.   On   22nd  August,   2017,   that

 application for urgent ad-interim injunction has been considered

 and   granted.   It   is   such   an   ad-interim   order   which   is   under

 challenge in this Appeal.

</p><p id="p_10"> 6.        Mr. Kadam, learned Senior Advocate appearing in support of

 this Appeal submits that though this Appeal is directed against  an

 ad-interim order, the appellants/original defendants would have

 no grievance if this Court passes an order disposing of the Notice

 of Motion for interim injunction finally by this order. Equally, Mr.

 Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Advocate for the respondent/plaintiff

 would submit that the order in this Appeal can be taken as a final

 order   in   interim   injunction   application/Notice   of   Motion   (L)

 No.515 of 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12"> 7.        At the further outset, Mr. Kadam states that since the matter

 is argued on the basis of the documents and which are annexed to

 the   plaint,   and   their   contents   falling   for   interpretation   of   this

 Court, the appellants do not desire to file any affidavit-in-reply.

 They would proceed on the basis of denial. The appellants would

 reserve their rights and contentions as far as merits are concerned

 at the final hearing of the Suit. This Court, therefore, should not

 express any final opinion is the request made by Mr. Kadam.


</p><p id="p_13"> 8.        This course is also not objected by Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned

 Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent.

</p><p id="p_16"> 9.        Hence, we proceed to admit the Appeal. Respondent waives

 service. Filing of paper book is dispensed with. By consent of the

 learned Senior Counsel appearing for the parties, we dispose of

 this Appeal by the present order.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18"> 10.       At the outset, we must record our strong disapproval with

 regard   to   the   manner   with   which   the   Registry   of   this   Court   is

 proceeding   to   accept   Commercial   Suits   and   applications   for

 interim reliefs therein. The Registry should be aware of the fact

 that merely because a Commercial Suit is lodged and the parties

 desire   to   obtain   urgent   ad-interim   reliefs   does   not   mean

 dispensing with the procedural rules, and particularly the Bombay

 High   Court   (Original   Side)   Rules,   1980.   The   Registry   is

 proceeding to assign a lodging or a temporary number to the Suit

 and  to  the   application  for interim  injunction. Repeatedly  it   has

 been   observed   that   this   results   in   utter   confusion   and   chaos.

 Sometimes, the same lodging number is assigned to the interim

 application in another Suit. On most occasions, when there are

 cross suits, without even bothering to refer to its lodging register

 or   the   computer   software,   same   numbers   are   assigned   by   the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">::: Uploaded on - 11/09/2017                          ::: Downloaded on - 12/09/2017 00:16:04 :::</span>
  vikrant                                8/74                                 4-NMCAL-52-2017.odt


 Registry   officials.   They   do   not   even   bother   then   to   post   the

 matters for directions regarding removal of office objections. They

 allow such state of affairs to continue and never repair them and

 applications   or   Suits   are   disposed   of   on   lodging   number.     The

 Registry officials do not make any efforts to then number the Suit

 or application. The defects and deficiencies remain as they are and

 objections raised in the process are never complied with. There

 are no consequences ever visited on those Advocates and parties

 who have not bothered to comply with the procedural rules. This

 is not a proper approach and should be discouraged. The Registry

 officials should remind themselves that their duty does not end

 merely on registration or lodging of suits and appeals. Even when

 they are finally disposed of, the orders passed by this Court have

 to be uploaded, their certified copies prepared,   and for all this,

 final   registration   numbers   are   required.   If   there   are   permanent

 registration numbers for identifying the proceedings and Suits that

 would   assist   the   litigants.   Eventually   the   litigants   and   their

 Advocates suffer on account of inefficiency and inept handling of

 the matters by the Registry officials. Even the Court work suffers

 as   Hon'ble   Judges   have   to   wade   through   the   files   if   they   are

 required   to  refer  to  interim  and final  orders  in   Suits, for  other

 matters of similar nature. We direct that within 72 hours of the

 lodging of every suit or interim application,   the same should be

 registered. If the applicants, plaintiffs and their Advocates do not

 co-operate and have no genuine or  bona fide   reasons for their

 non-assistance, the Registry officials should take requisite steps in

 accordance with law and if the matters are on board before any

 Court,   then,   they   must   apprise   the   Court   by   a   report   and   due

 endorsement on the file itself that the Advocates and the litigants

 are not co-operating with the Registry officials in registration and

 numbering  of the Suits or Appeals. It is then for the Court to deal

 with indiscipline, non co-operation and refusal of the litigants and

 their Advocates. We do not think that the Original Side Registry

 should expect any special favours and treatment from the litigants

 and the Court. Even without or with installation of the software

 and   modern   technology,   the   Appellate   Side   of   this   Court   can

 register   commercial   appeals   and   other   proceedings   within   the

 above time, there is no reason why the Registry of the Original

 Side should not be following this practice. We say nothing more

 and expect  that corrective measures and steps would be taken.

 several persons and eminent in the field. Some of them may script

 the film, some of them may direct it, some may act in it and if it is

 a musical film, then, some may write their lyrics and these lyrics

 are   then   sung   on   a   musical   tune.   The   lyrics   or   the   words   are

 penned by the lyricists and who are eminent poets. In the instant

 case, Mr. Sahir Ludhianvi, an eminent poet, was requested to pen

 the   lyrics   for   the   film   "Deewar".   One   of   the   lyrics   went   into

 becoming a song, namely, the infringing song. The musical outline

 to   the   song   was   composed   by   Mr.   R.   D.   Burman.   Mr.   Kadam

 would submit  that the sound track of the film comprises of all this

 and once a sound recording  is made, then, that sound recording

 subsumes in itself all the works, and particularly the lyrical work

 and the music and musical tune or musical work. If such sound

 recording is then assigned and the rights created in favour of a

 distinct party like Universal, then, nothing prevents  Universal in

 dealing with this right and assigned to it further. Then, Universal

 would step in the shoes of the plaintiff and would be the owner

 recognized and in relation to the subject work. It  was therefore,

 open   for   Universal   to   have   created   rights   in   favour   of   the

 defendants, and that is how the rights in respect of the song in

 question   have   been   created.   Those   have   been   obtained   by   an

 agreement   in   writing.   If   the   sound   recording   rights   vest   in

 Universal   and   they   are   transferred/assigned   in   favour   of   the

 defendants, then, nothing remains for the plaintiff to assert and

 rely upon. They have divested themselves of the sound recording

 rights and now they cannot complain. Mr. Kadam has, therefore,

 analyzed the scheme of the Act and in great details to submit that

 if distinct rights are contemplated in the work like a film, but if

 one views the film or the efforts and steps taken in relation to

 making or preparation of a film of the nature "Deewar", then, the

 plaintiff   cannot   be   said   to   be   retaining   any   right   in   the   sound

 recording in it's favour. They have divested themselves of these

 rights.   Mr.   Kadam   has   laid   great   emphasis   on   <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_23">Section   17</a>

 contained in Chapter IV of the Copyright Act. He would submit

 that ownership of copyright in the sound recording is statutorily

 recognized.   That   is   crystallized   in   <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_24">Section   17</a>.   It   is   in   these

 circumstances that he would submit that the learned Single Judge

 could   not   have   proceeded   on   the   basis   that   the   right   of   the

 plaintiff is infringed. Thus, there was no prima facie case, nor the

 balance of convenience was in favour of the plaintiff. On the other

 hand,   irreparable   loss   and   damage   has   been   caused   to   the

 defendants by granting a blanket injunction which prevents them

 from using the song in question in any manner. Now that the film

 is   ready   for   release,   its   songs   and   music   have   already   been

 recorded and the distinct rights and in relation thereto are sold,

 have also been disposed of for the open market across the world,

 then,   all   the   more,   this   Court   should   interfere   with   the   order

 under challenge.

</p><p id="p_60"> 31.       To substantiate his arguments, Mr. Kadam would invite our

 attention to the annexures to the plaint.  He would submit that the

 learned   Single   Judge   had   before   him   the   agreement   dated   2 nd

 January,   1974.   He   laid   great   emphasis   on   clause   1   of   this

 agreement   and   the   definition   of   the   word   "record"   or

 "gramophone record". He would submit that clauses 1 to 3 of this

 agreement, and particularly the later part of clause 4 and clauses

 7 to 9 together with sub-clauses (b) and (c) of clause 9 would

 denote   that   the   plaintiff's   case   is   not   well   founded   at   all.   The

 plaintiffs have left with them nothing and they cannot claim that

 the underlying lyrics or the musical tune belongs to them. If the

 word   'record'   is   understood   in   proper   perspective,   and   if   that

 refers to films, including the original lyrics and original musical

 tune   and   which   is   part   and   parcel   of   the   sound   track,   sound

 recording rights, then assignment and transfer thereof results in

 the   plaintiffs   being   deprived   of   their   status   as   owner   of   these

 works. It is this understanding and emerging from the documents

 relied upon by the plaintiff which enables the defendants to urge

 that the impugned order is erroneous and illegal.



</p><p id="p_61"> 32.       Mr. Kadam submits that the plaintiff has made much capital

 of a letter at annexure "F" (page 83) dated 15 th  May, 2008 and

 that is addressed to Trimurti Films Pvt. Ltd./plaintiff by the said

 Universal. However, the paragraphs of this letter relied upon do

 not indicate that the said Universal acknowledged any subsisting

 rights and in the underlying works as belonging to the plaintiff.

 The   said   Universal   rather   reiterated   the   above   position   and   in

 terms  of the agreement. The plaintiff has assigned in  favour of

 Universal,   absolutely   free   from   any   encumbrances   and   without

 any limitation for the entire world, the copyright to the exclusive

 right, inter alia, to make records from recordings embodied in the

 said film. This wider assertion of the said Universal would indicate

 that the further parts of this letter do not take away anything from

 the   agreement   relied   upon   by   the   defendants.   In   these

 circumstances, Mr. Kadam would submit  that the learned Single

 Judge could not have relied upon the said letter.



</p><p id="p_62"> 33.       Finally, he submits that the learned Single Judge has based

 his order only on some admissions, but assuming there are any

 concessions and admissions on a point of law they cannot bind the

 plaintiff. Hence, no advantage can be taken of these concessions

 by the plaintiff.

 letter is on record and addressed as far back as May, 2008, then,

 anything   contrary   thereto   cannot   be   argued   by   the   defendants.

 consider an application for interim injunction, and particularly to

 find out whether there is a strong prima facie case, the balance of

 "Deewar"   and   which   has   been   made   by   it.   That   feature   film

 produced by the plaintiff had a storyline and for the proper flow

 Ludhianvi   and   the   plaintiff   and   Mr.   R.   D.   Burman.   Though

 Mr.Kadam   would   term   these   contracts   with   them   not   of

 employment but of service and the services were rendered for a

 remuneration by these persons and therefore, they were free to

 allow use of their works by anybody, including the defendants, we

 do not think that we can allow the defendants to argue on the

 contents of  the letters/agreements with Mr. Ludhianvi and Mr. R.

 D. Burman and the plaintiff. These agreements are dated 3 rd April,

 1974. They are on the subject of the picture "Deewar" and which

 was directed by Mr. Yash Chopra and produced by the plaintiff.

 during his lifetime or anybody claiming through him thereafter.

 The   same   is   the   position   with   regard   to   a   distinct   contract   or

 Universal's understanding that lyrics of the song can be used by

 the plaintiff and the rights derived under the agreement with the

 as capable of being done only by the plaintiff. If the said Universal

 derived under the agreements of 1970 and 1974, they are intact.

 Despite such rights being intact and conferred in wide terms, still

 the plaintiff   has not authorized to be done the other acts, and

 therefore,   the   authorization   is,   in   that   sense,   limited.   It   is   not

 permitting the Universal to use the lyrics of the song (partially or

 fully). Therefore, the underlying works and the copyright in the

 same is not subsumed, as urged by Mr. Kadam, prima facie in the

 agreement with Universal. If Universal do not derive such rights as

 are contended and pressed before us, then surely, the defendants

 who claim through Universal cannot be permitted to assert any

 higher   rights.   The   rights   that   they   derived   are   pursuant   to   the

 arrangement   recorded   in   writing   by   the   plaintiff   and   the

 Universal. Else, Universal would not have been able to enter into

 any   agreement   in   relation   to   the   rights   derived   by   it   and

 understood by this document at page 83 with the defendants. It

 may be that the agreement between the defendants and the said

 Universal gives an impression to the defendants that some rights

 considered only in the light of the preceding documents in favour

 of   M/s.   Universal,   then,   we   do   not   see   how   the   defendants'

 assertions   and   arguments   as   indicated   above   can   be   accepted,

 much less, at this prima facie stage. We are not inclined to go into

 any further and decide any wider or larger controversy. We must

 avoid making any observations, much less, on the interpretation of

 the legal provisions. Given the limited issue before us and which is

 whether these acts as enumerated above justify grant of interim

 injunction in the terms prayed, we should avoid making reference

 to the legal provisions in further details, much less, analyze them

 in the light of the decisions brought to our notice.

 Single Judge (one of us, Justice S. C. Dharmadhikari) in the case

 of Rupalli Shah (supra) was not dealing with any copyright in the

 underlying work.  As rightly pointed out by Mr. Tulzapurkar, in

 paragraph 45 of the order passed in the case of Rupalli shah, the

 Court proceeded  on the basis of the concession in that case that

 the copyright in the underlying work has not been claimed by the

 defendant No.2 in that Suit. It had no claim of ownership insofar

 in the Appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court were associations

 of producers of cinematograph films claiming to be the owners of

 such films including the sound track thereof. They filed objections

 repudiating the appellant's claim on the  basis that the producers

 engaged composers and song writers under contract of service for

 composing songs to be utilised in their films and that the musical

 works   prepared   by   the   composers   under   such   contracts   having

 been   utilised   and   incorporated   in   the   sound   track   of     the

 cinematograph   films   produced   by   them   and   that   therefore   no

 copyright subsisted in the composers.

<p id="p_151">

 producer to make a cinematograph film in respect of his work and

 thereby to have his work incorporated or recorded on the sound

 track   of   a   cinematograph   film,   the   latter   acquires   by   virtue   of

 consists of visual images to be seen in public and in to far as it

 consists of the acoustic portion including a lyric or a musical work

 to be heard in public without securing any further permission of

 the composer of the lyric or musical work for the performance of

 the work in public. That is why the existing and future rights of a

 music   composer   and   a   lyricist   in   their   respective   works   has

 capability of assignment subject to condition stipulated in <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_82">Section

 18</a> as also in <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_83">Section 19</a>, which required the assignment to be in

 writing, signed by the assignor or by his duly authorized agent. It

 is in that sense the relied upon paragraphs of this judgment ought

 to be read. Mr. Kadam only reads the portion where the Hon'ble

 Supreme Court discusses as to what would be subsumed in the

 term "cinematograph film" and the sound track associated with it.

 Even if that is understood from this judgment to be so subsumed,

 what   is   relevant   for   our   purpose   is   the   nature   of   the   right

 conferred   in   the   present   case   and   by   the   agreement   dated   2 nd

 January,   1974  by the  plaintiff to Polydor/Universal. We  do not

 of no  assistance. There, on facts it was found that the entire script

 was taken over for consideration from Shri Dharmendra by Shri

 who was a script writer, that a remaking of the film with the same

 title "Zanjeer" is illegal. That injunction was denied after noting

 argument was that even if there are limited rights conferred in

 favour of Universal and which flow in favour of the defendants

 under a distinct arrangement between Universal and them, still,

 they do not rule out the utilization or use of the song in question.

 The song, therefore can be used and in the way and manner the

 defendants   choose.   This   argument   is   controverted   by   Mr.

 Tulzapurkar  by pointing out that once the rights are very limited

 in   nature,   then,   such   restricted   and   limited   rights   cannot   be

 enlarged to claim the liberty or the facility as asserted before us.

 Meaning thereby, no artist in the upcoming film "Baadshaho" can

 be allowed to independently reproduce or sing the song and set to

 tune by the defendants. At best, the very same record or recording

 can   be   played   in   the   upcoming   film   "Baadshaho"   and   any

 character or artist therein can be depicted or shown as hearing it.

 injunction as claimed can be granted, and in the form prayed by

 The   defendants  can  be permitted to act  strictly within  the  four

 corners of the rights derived from Universal which rights in turn

 depend   upon   the   arrangement   between   the   predecessor   of

 Universal and the plaintiff.  Apart from this, there is no prejudice

 or loss to the appellants as their film can be released, viewed by

 the public even if the infringing song is deleted from it.

     
</p><p id="p_161"> 92.       In the view that we have taken, we have not gone by any

 concession save and except that before us, as well, it was never

 disputed that the song which the defendants seek to incorporate

 in their film "Baadshaho" is identical to that which was penned by

 Mr. Sahir Ludhianvi and set to music by Mr. R. D. Burman and

 incorporated in the film "Deewar". The learned Single Judge had

 an occasion to hear both songs as they were played during the

 course of the proceedings before him. He has recorded that the

 song "Kah Doon Tumhe" from the film "Baadshaho" is the same

 song as  it  was  in the film "Deewar", but with slight modification.

 Consequently, no concession and contrary to the factual position

 on record and purely of law has been recorded, and on that score

 as well, we do not find the order under challenge to be erroneous

 or illegal.

 no serious legal infirmity or perversity warranting our interference

 in appellate jurisdiction. We have found that since the film was to

 release   on   1st  September,   2017   and   the   rights   created   by   the

 defendants allegedly in favour of the third parties being at much

 advanced   stage,   the   learned   Single   Judge,   and   equally   we   are

 justified in taking up the matter urgently. We have seen from the

 materials produced that there is a serious issue to be tried and an

 arguable case presented by the plaintiff. Thus, they have made out

 a  prima facie  case and given the subsistence of the agreement in

 their favour way back from 1974, the balance of convenience was

 also in favour of the plaintiff. It is they who could have suffered

 irreparable   loss,   harm   and   injury   in   the   event   the   relief   was

 Private Limited and Mr. Dhond, learned Senior Counsel appearing

 the interim injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff in the Suit.

 He would submit that the plaintiff, without joining said Universal,

 who   is   a   necessary   party,   have   obtained   this   injunction   and   in

 granting that injunction/interim relief, the learned Single Judge

 M/s.   Polydor   of   India   Limited   and   the   plaintiff.   All   that   the

 are   recorded   in   the   agreement   between   the   plaintiff   and   said

 Polydor can be claimed  by the defendants to the Suit. It is the
