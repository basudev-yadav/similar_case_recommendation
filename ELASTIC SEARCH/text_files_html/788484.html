</p><p id="p_5"> 5.        Pleadings are complete in all the aforestated applications.

By this common order the aforenoted applications are being

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.        The cause of action in this suit is two-fold. Plaintiff has

firstly     sought        a    permanent     injunction    on       an    action   of

infringement         of       his   registered   trademark;         the   registered

trademarks being „TOYOTA‟                   „toyota device‟ and „INNOVA‟.

Second relief is a relief of permanent injunction in a case of

passing off. Plaintiff is stated to be the prior user of the mark

„PRIUS‟, he admittedly has no registration in India of the mark

„PRIUS‟.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.        Case of plaintiff:
</p>
<p id="p_8">          To substantiate his plea of passing off on the use of the

mark „PRIUS‟ plaintiff has submitted as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          i. Plaintiff company is a company registered in Japan,

          dealing in the manufacture and sale of automobiles and

          parts thereof. In the year 1994 plaintiff designed a concept

          car with a hybrid engine; vehicle was named „PRIUS‟

          derived from the Latin word „prior‟ or „before‟. The first

          „PRIUS‟ model was sold in December, 1997 in Japan.

          Official launch of „PRIUS‟ was in 2001. Plaintiff company

          has revenues of over U.S. 220 billion dollars and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                  Page 3 of 44</span>
       its products are widely marketed in India as also in over

      80 other countries throughout the world. Plaintiff is the

      registered proprietor of the trademark „PRIUS‟ in 28

      countries commencing from the year 1990. Defendants are

      using the mark „PRIUS‟ as an essential and leading portion

      of their trading name and the same appears on its

      products.       Such a use by the defendant is without

      authorization or permission and amounts to passing off

      and dilution of the plaintiff‟s trademark „PRIUS‟ which was

      adopted by the plaintiff in the year 1990. Defendants are

      adversely affecting the plaintiff‟s good-will.

      ii.    Plaintiff has pleaded his sale figures in foreign

      countries.      The sale units of the car show that the sale

      figures have climbed enormously from 300 units in 1997 to

      2,85,600 units in 2008. In May 2008 the global figure had

      reached the one million mark and crossed over to the 1.43

      million units in August 2008. Extensive advertisements of

      the said vehicle       both in national and international

      publications have been placed on record.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      iii.   "Business     Week"    publications      of   15.12.1997,

      21.1.1998, 27.04.1998, 27.07.1998, 13.11.2000 and again

      on 27.11.2000 had as far back as in 1997 depicted the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                        Page 4 of 44</span>
       status of this compact car and the efforts of the plaintiff

      i.e. the „TOYOTA‟ company to promote this venture. On

      31.07.1998 and again on 8.11.2001, the "New York Times"

      had reported and widely publicized this hybrid vehicle and

      the advance technology put forward by „TOYOTA‟ in it.

      Print outs from the web sites www.toyoto.com and

      www.toyotabharat.com, the Encyclopedia Britannica and

      Wikipedia on line edition attributing the source of the

      „PRIUS‟ car to the plaintiff have been emphasized to

      substantiate this argument.       Print outs and copies of

      extracts from the books titled as the „PRIUS that shook the

      World‟ and „The Toyota Way 14 Management Principles

      from the World‟s Greatest Manufacturer‟ published in the

      year 2009 have been filed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      iv. Not only in the international circles but in Indian dailies

      as well the association of „PRIUS‟ with „TOYOTA‟ being the

      first hybrid car introduced by „TOYOTA‟ company had

      received a far ranging publicity. Attention has been drawn

      to the articles in the "Economic Times" dated 27.03.1997

      and again on 15.12.1997.      The features of this car were

      again publicized on 23.09.2002 in "The Hindu". On

      4.8.2004 the "Times of India" and on 19.2.2006 "The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                        Page 5 of 44</span>
       Indian    Express"   had     widely   advertised     the    hybrid

      technology of the „PRIUS‟ a Toyota venture.                Popular

      Indian magazines like the "Auto Car", "Over Drive" and

      "Zigwheels" have given information on the revolutionary

      progress made by the Toyota Company and its efforts to

      create a hybrid system encompassed in this vehicle i.e. the

      PRIUS. This was in the year 2009.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      iv. In these circumstances, it is impossible to believe that

      the defendant was not aware of the association of „PRIUS‟

      with the „TOYOTA‟ company; that „PRIUS‟ is essentially an

      invented word and being the trademark of the plaintiff, the

      use of the same name by the defendant was nothing but

      passing off the good of the plaintiff as those of his own.

      The plaintiff has acquired a worldwide reputation and

      goodwill; this reputation has spilled over to India and the

      Indian public is aware of the same entitling the plaintiff to

      his relief.

Whirlpool Corporation</a> (1996) 5 SCC 714 have been relied upon

which had inter-alia had held: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "The concept and principle on which passing off action is
       grounded is that a man is not to sell his own goods under
       the pretence that they are the goods of another man. A

        trader needs protection of his right of prior user of a trade
       mark as the benefit of the name and reputation earned by
       him cannot be taken advantage of by another trader by
       copying the mark and getting it registered before he could
       get the same registered in his favour. We see no reason
       why a registered owner of a trade mark should be allowed
       to deceive purchasers into the belief that they are getting
       the goods of another while they would be buying the
       goods of the former which they never intended to do. In
       an action for passing off if should not matter whether
       misrepresentation or deception has proceeded from a
       registered or an unregistered user of a trademark. He
       cannot represent his own goods as the goods of somebody
       else".
</blockquote><p id="p_10">9.    It is submitted that the ratio of the decision clearly

establishes that the registration of the trademark "PRIUS‟ in

favour of the defendant is no defence in his favour; by using the

identical mark „PRIUS‟, the defendant is selling his goods which

are auto part accessories as the goods of the plaintiff; the

unwary and layman purchaser is bound to be confused and

deceived into believing that what he is purchasing i.e. the auto

parts or the auto part accessories are those of the plaintiff.

       assumed that such advertisements or mark do not travel
       beyond the borders of the countries where the plaintiff has
       the business still it has a right to protect its reputation and
       goodwill. It is more so where the trade name has been
       pirated in totality and not by way of having deceptive or
       confusing similarity. We are living in a world where there is
       enormous mobility. Well travelled Indians and tourists
       cannot remain unaware of international commodities.

<p id="p_12">11.   Reliance        has   been   placed    upon           <a href="/doc/1035577/" id="a_4">Pfizer   Ireland

Pharmaceuticals v. Intas Pharmaceuticals and Anr</a>., 2004(28)

PTC 456(Del) to support the submission that the worldwide

reputation of the trademark of the plaintiff „PRIUS‟ has been

established by his sale turnover.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.    An advertisement of the trademark by itself without the

existence of goods in the market is also to be considered as a use

of the trademark even if the plaintiff is not using or marketing

the goods under the same trademark.               This fact would be

irrelevant as admittedly the trademark „PRIUS‟ has been used by

the plaintiff in the world market much prior in time to the

defendant.    For this proposition, reliance has been placed on

<a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_5">Milmet Oftho Industries and Ors. v. Allergan Inc</a>. 2004(28)

PTC585(SC).

the plaintiff was naturally affected when it spread its wings in

was the registered owner of the trademark „Ford‟.          Defendant

who was engaged in the business of service of all vehicles also

had a filling station/petrol pump including allied services of

cleaning/policing of cars, wind screen, sale of lubricants, grease

and other automobile components at the filling station. Plaintiff

was found entitled to the interim relief.

<p id="p_15">14.   On the defence of delay as set up by the defendant reliance

has been placed upon Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft and Anr. v

Hybo Hindustan, AIR 1994 Delhi 239. In this case the use of the

name „BENZ‟ by the defendant was under consideration;

defendant was using the trademark „BENZ‟ for undergarments;

plaintiff sought an injunction in passing off action alleging that

the term „BENZ‟ was associated with the finest engineered cars

in the world and there was a clear evidence for grant of an

injunction in favour of the plaintiff; the delay in approaching the

Court could not justify the use of the trademark which was a

worldwide famous name. It was inter-alia held as follows: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "In my view, the trade mark law is not intended to protect
       a person who deliberately sets out to take the benefit of
       somebody else‟s reputation with reference to goods,
       especially so when the reputation extends worldwide. By
       no stretch of imagination can it be said that use for any
       length of time of the name „Benz‟ should be not objected
       to".

</blockquote><p id="p_16"> 15.   On the plea of infringement of the trade marks TOYOTA,

toyota device and INNOVA plaintiff has submitted as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      i-     Admittedly the plaintiff is a prior user and registered

      owner of the said trade marks in more than 40 countries.

      Trademark TOYOTA has been registered with the plaintiff

      in 21 different classes from the year 1989.           The toyota

      device has been registered with the plaintiff in five classes

      since 1989; INNOVA is also a registered trademark of the

      plaintiff since September 2003.     Registration certificates

      have been placed on record.       Extracts from Trademark

      Journal have also been filed to support this submission.

      These registrations in the favour of the plaintiff of its

      registered      trademarks   TOYOTA,     toyota      device   and

      INNOVA are prima facie evidence of the plaintiff exclusive

      user of the same; this is clear from Section 28(1) of the

      Trademark Act 1999 (hereinafter      referred to as the Act).

      ii.    Defence of the defendant that his use of the said

      name for quality description of the goods of the plaintiff is

      negatived by the documents. Attention has been drawn to

      the packaging of the defendants‟ products showing use of

      the Trademark TOYOTA, the toyota device, INNOVA and

       is submitted that the extensive use of the said marks on

      these documents of the defendant prima facie evidence his

      malafide intent; i.e. of the infringement of the trademarks

      of the plaintiff and passing off his goods to the innocent

      purchaser as that of his own; they are definitely not meant

      for a character identification of the goods as pleaded by

      the defendant.

<p id="p_17">16.   Case of defendant:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      i.     Defendant has refuted these arguments by setting up

      a defence of delay, waiver and acquiescence on the part of

      the plaintiff. Defendant had become the registered owner

      of the trademark „PRIUS‟ in 2002 on an application which

      he had filed in the year 2001.           By neither applying for

      registration    of   the   trademark     „PRIUS‟         in   India   nor

      opposing the application of the defendant for the said

      registration, the plaintiff      having approached the Court

      only in December, 2009 when the defendant has a

      continuous long user of the said mark „PRIUS‟ since 2002,

      the plaintiff has given up all claims, if any, on this mark.

      ii.    Defendant     a     partnership   firm      incorporated       on

      01.04.2001, had on 06.03.2002 applied for the registration

      of the trademark „PRIUS‟ which had been certified in his

       favour    on     11.10.2006    with    effect      from13.03.2002.

      Bills/invoices   filed   by   the   defendant      show   that   the

      defendant company is doing business under its business

      name „Prius Auto Industries‟ with the trademark „PRIUS‟

      since 2003.       Purchase orders from various companies

      which include reputed auto companies i.e. Mahindra &amp;

      Mahindra evidence the orders placed upon the defendant

      for supply of auto accessories. Similar orders placed by

      Hyundai Motors Company as also the General Motors India

      Pvt. Ltd have also been placed on record. Purchase orders

      of General Motors India Pvt. Ltd. dated 07.01.2005 show

      orders of more than 3600 items on one date.               Balance-

      sheet of the defendant company from March, 2002 upto

      2009 has also been filed showing the enhancement of its

      sale figures and corresponding profits.           The sale figures

      have swelled from 1,34,799 in 2002 to 53,60,869 in the

      year ending 31.3.2009.

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      iii.   The „Over Drive‟ described as India‟s No.1 Car and

      Bike Magazine had as early as April 2003 published the

      advertisements of the defendant under its trade name

      „PIRUS - the name you can trust‟. "Auto Car", a pioneer

      publication of automobiles has also been placed on record.

       Publications for the months of January and December,

      2004 show that the defendant company had advertised its

      goods under its aforesaid trademark. It is submitted that

      these advertisements clearly show that the defendant is

      the supplier of garnish covers and auto accessories for

      various vehicles which have been depicted in the said

      picture which include the Maruti 800, Indica, Santro Xing,

      Zen, Omni and Toyota Qualis. These pictures indicate that

      the defendant is informing his purchaser that he is selling

      auto accessories which are suitable for the aforenoted

      various vehicles which also include the Toyota group i.e.

      the „Qualis‟ as well. The „toyota device‟ and the mention of

      the vehicle „Quails‟ is only for the purpose of the

      identification of the item and its suitability to the wide

      range of vehicles mentioned thereunder; it is definitely not

      with the intent to deceive the purchaser or to confuse him

      into believing that he is selling auto accessories of

      „TOYOTA‟. It is submitted that this publication is in fact, a

      publication which has also been relied upon by the plaintiff

      and has been filed by him in his list of documents. Plaintiff

      at page 192 of his documents has filed copies of this

      publication evidencing his submission that as the way back

      introduce a similar car in India in future. Defendant also

      placed    a     certificate     dated    12.04.2003            which     is     a

      registration      certificate    of     the     fact      evidencing          his

      participation in the Auto 2006 enterprise under his

      business name.

      any, which in turn amounts to a waiver of his right. This

      unexplainable delay for more than six years from the date

      has failed to disclose this crucial fact in his plaint and this

      is obviously with a dishonest and malafide intent; the court

      while granting him the ad interim injunction was not made

      aware that the defendant was registered owner of „PRIUS‟

<p id="p_19">       In rejoinder, these arguments have been refuted by the

learned counsel for the plaintiff. It is submitted that the heavy

reliance placed by the defendant on the advertisement in the

„Auto Car‟ journal does not in any manner establish that the

plaintiff was aware of the existence of the defendant.                  A

distinction has to be drawn between constructive knowledge and

actual knowledge; extracts from the Black‟s Law Dictionary has

been    placed   on   record    to    substantiate     this    submission.

 Defendant has also not pleaded that the plaintiff had any actual

knowledge of the presence of the defendant; it is humanly

impossible to imagine that while going through a magazine a

reader would examine each and every page in meticulous detail.

At best, he would see his own advertisement on the relevant

page.    The submission of the defendant that the plaintiff had

acquired knowledge of the presence of the defendant in terms of

advertisements effected by him in the same magazine are mere

inferences and surmises; it is a wild imagination.

conclusion that the defendant had built up a reputation in the

field of goods sold by him. Plea of acquiescence raised by the

<p id="p_22">20.   Plaintiff has   also   placed on record        an affidavit of

Mr.B.K.Anand, a Chartered Accountant who after analyzing the

sale figures of the defendant has calculated that the cumulative

sale of the defendant for the period of 2002-2009 was Rs.3.54

crores only; cumulatively, the net profit, partner‟s salary and

interest on capital added up to be Rs.28.36 lakhs per annum. It

is stated that this is a miniscule figure and cannot by any stretch

of imagination be said to be a well-established business.       The

publicity campaign of the defendant shows that he has spent

Rs.1.22 lakhs in this entire period.   In these circumstances it

cannot be said that the business of the defendant is either well

established    or has earned a distinct reputation; he is man of

little worth; in such a case where infringement is negligible the

proprietor of the mark is even not bound to commence legal

proceedings immediately after he becomes aware of the

infringement.

 for the case to be thrown out at the first instance.                    The

explanation furnished by the defendant as to how he came

across the word „PRIUS‟ is blatantly false and borders on a level

of falsehood which has reached the heights of malice. It would

<p id="p_33">31.   Findings:
</p>
<p id="p_34">      Trade name under challenge is „PRIUS‟. Plaintiff is

registered with the said mark in more than 40 countries. This is

with effect from the year 1990. Plaintiff has no registration of

the mark „PRIUS‟ in India. The defendant on the other hand is

the registered proprietor of the trademark „PRIUS‟ with effect

from March 2002.      He had commenced his business in April

2001 under the firm name M/s Prius Auto Industries and he was

using the mark „PRIUS- the name you can trust‟ since then.

Defendant has been registered with this mark under class-12 for

auto parts and accessories but he is using it for auto accessories

only. He is making „Add-On Chrome Plated Accessories‟. There

are four accessories which are common to both the plaintiff and

the defendant i.e. the front grill chrome, back door garnish, the

fog lamp kit and the door handle.
</p>
<p id="p_35">32.   Claim of the plaintiff on the mark „PRIUS‟ is a claim based

on the common law remedy of passing off. Foreign magazines

i.e. the "Business Week" and the "New York Times" have

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                      Page 23 of 44</span>
 advertised the products of the plaintiff i.e. the hybrid car

„PRIUS‟ from December 1997. These are, however, stray

publications only. The "New York Times" is priced at more than

Rs.300/-; "Business Week" has since been discontinued; these

magazines are not available off the rack as a reading material

for an average Indian.     Publications of „PRIUS that shook the

world‟ and „The Toyota Way 14 Management Principles from the

Worlds Greatest Manufacturer‟ also fall in the same category;

they do not fall in the hands of an average Indian reader.              In

Indian dailies the "Economic Times" in March 1997 had first

published an article on the features of this car i.e. the „PRIUS‟.

Thereafter another random publication in December 1997

followed by advertisements in the „Times of India‟ and „Indian

Express‟ dated 23.9.2002, 4.8.2004 and 19.2.2006 have been

relied upon.     Only in 2009 the Auto Indian Magazines i.e. the

„Auto Car‟ and the „Zigwheel‟ had published information on this

vehicle.

(Del)    while   recognizing   the   principle    of    a     trans-border

reputation and the spill over of its international reputation from

foreign lands to the Indian boundaries, it had been held that its

 each case.     In the instant case, apart from these stray and

sparse advertisements effected in the foreign magazines which

even otherwise is doubtful if they were available to the common

man, there appears to be little material on record to hold that an

Indian purchaser of chrome plated auto accessories had become

aware that „PRIUS‟      is a manufactured hybrid vehicle of the

Toyota group. Plaintiff in the said case was challenging the use

of the word „FLEXGRIP‟ by the defendant.                   Plaintiff was

admittedly not a registered owner of the said trademark in

India; an action by the plaintiff had been filed in German court

but no action assailing the use of the trademark by the

defendant in India had been filed prior to the filing of the suit.

Plaintiff alleging in the plaint that it was only in the last week of

April, 1999 he learnt about this use of trademark by the

defendant was clearly falsified by his own acts as he had way

back in 1997 filed a case in the German Court; this false

concealment by the plaintiff had worked against him.

 magazine relied upon by the plaintiff was a publication of

London whereas the defendant was using the same in India

since 1999 and although the plaintiff was prior user of the

trademark since 1994 but being a foreign magazine the plaintiff

was to show that the said magazine was sold and known in India

for which there was no such document. Plaintiff was held not

entitled to the relief of an interim injunction.

</p><p id="p_38">35.    In the instant case defendant on the other hand has

placed on record his registration certificate evidencing the

registration of this trademark „PRIUS‟ in his name with effect

from March 2002. This is prima facie proof of the exclusive use

of the said mark with effect from the said date in terms of

<a href="/doc/1822802/" id="a_19">Section 28(2)</a> of the said Act. The bills and invoices filed by him

further show that the defendant company is actively conducting

its business under the name PRIUS Auto Industries and using its

trade name „PRIUS‟ since then.         The purchase orders from

reputed     companies    which   include    the      General   Motors,

Mahendra &amp; Mahendra and Hyundai show that auto accessories

in bulk are being supplied to the manufacturers of the said

vehicles.   Sale figures of the defendant have also risen and

swelled from a turnover of 1,34,799 in the year 2002 to

53,63,869 in the year 2009.        Net profits have grown from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                         Page 26 of 44</span>
 1,04,182 to 8,51,281 in the corresponding years.          Business of

the defendant company may not be matching the turnover of the

plaintiff company but that is not a consideration for dealing with

the contentions raised in the present application.

</p><p id="p_39">36.     The fact that the defendant had commenced its business

as early as 2002 became known to the defendant if not earlier

but definitely in April 2003. Publications in the "Auto Car" and

the "Over Drive" which are pioneer publications of automobiles

contain advertisements of the defendant under its trade name

„PRIUS‟. Argument of the plaintiff that this was only a

constructive knowledge and based on an inference is misplaced.

Plaintiff has relied upon the same auto magazine i.e. the "Auto

Car". Both parties are admittedly aware of this publication and

are advertising their products in the said journal. This is evident

from the publications for the months of December and January

2004.

      build up a reputation under a trade name or mark to which he
      has rights, he may lose his right to complain, and may even be

follows:

      as involved in laches. In Harcourt v. White Sr. John Romilly
      said: „It is important to distinguish mere negligence and
      acquiescence.‟ Therefore, acquiescence is one facet of delay. If
      the plaintiff stood by knowingly and let the defendants build up
      an important trade until it had become necessary to crush it,
      then the plaintiffs would be stopped by their acquiescence. If
      the acquiescence in the infringement amounts to consent, it will
      be a complete defence as was laid down in Mouson(J.G.) &amp; Co.
      v. Boehm. The acquiescence must be such as to lead to the
      inference of a license sufficient to create a new right in the

the opposition made by the defendant before the Excise

</p><p id="p_49"> 45.   Plaintiff has come to the court in December 2009. He has

pleaded knowledge with effect from 2009; this is negatived by

documentary evidence placed on record. It is impossible and

unimaginable to believe that the plaintiff who is a reputed and

worldwide established business name in automobiles and is

advertising and publishing its product in pioneer auto car

magazines including the „Auto Car‟ journal and the „Zigwheel‟

had no knowledge that the plaintiff was operating under the

trade name ‟PRIUS‟. Plaintiff has come to the court after a long

and inordinate delay i.e. a delay of more than seven years for

which there is no explanation.   His submission that he learnt

about the defendant only in 2009 on a stray web search is

patently false.
</p>
<p id="p_50">46.   Plaintiff has also not come clean to the court. Although in

his plaint he has averred that the defendant is the registered

owner of the trademark „PRIUS‟ yet he has failed to disclose the

date of the registration when the defendant was registered with

the said mark i.e. from March 2002. This would have been a

crucial factor weighing in the mind of the Court at the time

when the ex parte injunction was granted in his favour. In Old

Navy (ITM) Inc. and Ors., GAP (ITM) Inc. and Ors. and Banana

Republic (Itm) Inc. and Ors. 2007(99) DRJ 571 it was held that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                      Page 31 of 44</span>
 non-disclosure of material facts would work to the prejudice of

such a non-disclosing party disentitling him to a relief in equity.

</p><p id="p_51">47.     The word PRIUS also does not appear to be an invented

word.    Apart from the fact that it finds mention in both the

english dictionaries i.e. the Oxford and the Webster‟s, the word

PRIUS itself is a suggestive of its meaning i.e. prior in time.

Explanation of the defendant that this was a „Pehla Prayas‟ i.e.

his first effort which had led him to use this word which he had

searched from a web search is fair and plausible.          Defendant

cannot be charged with any dishonesty. PRIUS is a latin word

and although latin is not in great use or demand in India yet the

fact that this word finds mention in the english dictionary as also

the word itself being suggestive of its meaning the explanation

furnished by the defendant is reasonable. His use of the mark

PRIUS as an honest user is prima facie established. It is in fact

the plaintiff who had concealed the true picture from the Court;

it was incumbent upon him to have disclosed to the Court that

when he had come to the Court in the year 2009 defendant was

already registered with the said mark 7 years prior in time and

was carrying on business under the said name. Mere appending

of a document with the plaint is not by itself sufficient, specific

notice of the said fact should have been brought to the Court

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                        Page 32 of 44</span>
 which he did not do so. This was a dishonest concealment by

the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_52">48.   Delay, acquiescence and waiver clearly come in the way of

the plaintiff to obtain the discretionary relief prayed for by him.

He has from 2003 remained a silent spectator to the growth of

the defendant who has in relative terms scaled heights and has

grown from a mini business to a maxi business. His sale units

and net profits have climbed the rungs of the ladder of his

success.
</p>
<p id="p_53">49.   The trade dress of the defendant is also distinctly

dissimilar.      The packaging of the plaintiff‟s product is a bache

coloured rectangular carton having red writings describing its

product. Packaging of the defendant‟s carton is a blue coloured

square box having the writings in red colour.           Not only is the

shape of the          packaging   material different but all visual

impressions and their getup including its colour scheme,

description of the words i.e. their font, size and alphabetical

array are also distinctly dissimilar.    Prices of the articles are at

enormous variation.       Whereas the articles of the plaintiff are

within the price range of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.23,503/-, the same

articles are priced by the defendant between a range of Rs.275/-

to a maximum outer limit of Rs.1600/-. Rs.1,600/- is the most

 expensive auto accessory of the defendant for which the

corresponding price of the plaintiff is Rs.23,503/-. The class of

the purchaser of these auto accessories is not the low income

group; it is definitely the strata of the middle class and moreso

the higher group who has the financial capacity to buy a vehicle

in the segment of more than Rs.6 lacs.           They are purchasing

auto accessories to decorate their vehicles which are already

equipped     with     the   basic   amenities/essential       manufacturer

necessities. The purchaser is only adding accessories to his car.

He would most definitely be an educated and an intelligent

literate man who would be aware that the articles or the

accessories which he is purchasing are the accessories of the

defendant.      Even applying the test of a man of average

intelligence and of imperfect recollection such a purchaser is

not likely to be confused or deceived that he would or could be

purchasing auto accessories manufactured by the plaintiff

company i.e. Toyota Group.

practices in industrial and commercial matters. This user is not

taking any unfair advantage; his use is not detrimental to the

distinctive character or the repute of such a trademark; it does

not amount to an infringement/passing off.         It is essentially for

describing the kind, quality and quantity of the goods which he

is proposing to sell and they are auto accessories for the various

vehicles mentioned in his packing carton and also in the

 use of the trade mark as in the instant case the use of „TOYOTA‟,

„toyota device‟ and „INNOVA‟ by the defendant in relation to his

goods i.e. the auto accessories is reasonably necessary to

indicate that the goods are adaptable and suited to the vehicles

mentioned therein i.e. the „TOYOTA‟ and „INNOVA‟; „the toyota

device‟ is also indicative of this purpose only. Protection under

the aforestated exception carved out is available to the

defendant. This is an indication by the defendant to show that

his product is compatible for use as an auto accessory in the

vehicles manufactured by the plaintiff i.e. „TOYOTA‟ and the

„INNOVA‟. Even otherwise the use of the word „INNOVA‟ is not

on all the packaging materials which has been produced in the

Court. It is only on the small rectangular carton where on either

side there is a sticker of „INNOVA‟. In some of the other cartons

which have been filed by the plaintiff a visual picture of the

„INNOVA‟ vehicle has been shown and the catch cover of

„PRIUS‟ has been described to be an accessory for the Toyota

INNOVA; this is qualified by the use of the words "vehicle name

and logo are used for items identification only".            This is

sufficiently indicative of the fact that this catch cover is suitable

for the „INNOVA‟ vehicle. It is definitely not likely to deceive the

of the defendant in comparison with the price of the product of

product is for an item identification only and the vehicle name

(2) (d) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_66">59.      The judgments relied upon by the plaintiff are all

distinguishable on their own facts. In the Jolen Inc. case and

Ford Motors company case (supra), plaintiff had established its

reputation and goodwill in the country of its origin as also in

India.    In the Milmet Oftho Industries case (supra) the Court

had in fact observed that multinational corporation who had no

intention of coming to India and introducing their products in

India should not be allowed to throttle an Indian company. In

the Daimler Benz case (supra) „BENZ‟ was registered in India

since 1951. In the N.R.Dongre case (supra) the plaintiff no.1 a

multinational incorporated in USA of whom plaintiff no.2 was its

licensee in India. The trade mark and trade name "Whirlpool"

had been registered in India in 1956; in 1978 the registration

lapsed on account of failure to apply for renewal; thereafter an

application for registration was filed in 1988.          Defendant in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                      Page 40 of 44</span>
 1986 applied for the registration of the trademark „Whirlpool‟.

The prior user of the mark „Whirlpool‟ claimed by the plaintiff

was upheld as he had a continuous registration in his name

right from 1956-1977 which had held him entitled to the interim

relief.     It was only in the light of these facts that the plea of

trans-border reputation had been considered by the courts.

Word „PRIUS‟ finds its place in the english dictionary; not being

an invented word, it is clear that the judgments of Ciba Ltd., A.

Volvo &amp; Satyam Infoway (supra) are also distinguishable.

</p><p id="p_67">60.       Plaintiff is not entitled to the discretionary relief as prayed

for by him. He has not been able to make any prima facie case

in his favour for injuncting the defendant from using the

trademark „PRIUS‟ on which the defendant is admittedly               the

registered proprietor and owner since the year 2002. Principles

of equity and fair play also do not find favour with the plaintiff.

The balance of convenience in fact lies in favour of the

defendant.       If at this stage i.e. after business growth of more

than seven years the defendant is injuncted from using his trade

name under which he is selling his auto accessory products he

would suffer huge business loss which would probably bring to a

close not only his business reputation but all his legitimate

financial expectations. On the other hand no irreparable loss or

 injury will be suffered by the plaintiff as admittedly the plaintiff

is not in the market; it has not launched the vehicle „PRIUS‟ on

the Indian roads.     Plaintiff has himself conceded that certain

defects had been noted in the vehicle which had led to the

suspension of the production of the said vehicle.

</p><p id="p_68">61.   The defendant is neither guilty of infringing the registered

trademark „TOYOTA‟, „toyota device‟ or „INNOVA‟.            He is also

not guilty of the use of the word PRIUS in any manner which

would deceive a customer into believing that what he has

purchased are auto accessory parts of „PRIUS‟ which is an

associate group of the Toyota Company.           Defendant is selling

auto accessories under his registered trade name „PRIUS‟ since

2002; his packaging material and trade dress are markedly

different as that of the plaintiff, his pricing is distinct, his colour

scheme and the size of the font of the alphabets are dissimilar,

shape of the packaging is different, class of purchasers is a

higher income group with a tested intelligence knowing and fully

able to understand the nature of the goods which he is

purchasing and thereby unlikely to be confused that he is

purchasing a product of the plaintiff. Defendant has grown in

business from 2001 to 2009 i.e. from a small stature to a big

business company operating through defendants no. 1 and 4. He

 is advertising his products in leading car magazines and

participating in exhibition and auto shows of repute where other

pioneer manufacturer of automobiles i.e. the Toyota Group,

Hyundai Group, General Motors and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra are

advertising their products and participating in such shows.

These reputed car manufacturer General Motors, Hyundai

Group and Mahindra &amp; Mahihdra had placed bulk purchase

orders   on   the     defendant   who   has    been       supplying   auto

accessories to them to be fitted in their cars.               The gradual

growth and reputation built up by the defendant cannot be

destroyed in a single stroke. Plaintiff has come to the court too

late in the day. He has not been able to explain that he gained

knowledge about the presence of the defendant in the market

only in October, 2009. Why he slept over the matter and idled

over it for such a long period? PRIUS is not the monopoly of the

plaintiff in India. It is not an invented word; the meaning of the

word can be deciphered from the word itself; meaning "prior to".

It finds mention in the english dictionary, how can it then be

termed as invented or coined? Association of this word and the

same having acquired a secondary meaning with the plaintiff

company has not been established.         Plaintiff has given up all

claims if any on the use of the mark „PRIUS„ as he has knocked

six and half years. Plaintiff has also no business in India. He is

not recognized in India. His product has not come on the Indian

road.    Production of his vehicle, due to technical reasons has

now been suspended. None of the ingredients for continuing of

the interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff arise.                If

injunction is allowed to continue, the loss to be suffered by the

defendant would become irreparable as his business would come

to stand still. In these circumstances, balance of convenience is

also in favour of the defendant. The application of the defendant

under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC is accordingly allowed and the

interim ex parte injunction granted on 22.12.2009 is set aside.
