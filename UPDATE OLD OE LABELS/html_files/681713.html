ACT:
     <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_1">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1971- Praying for initiation of
proceedings for	 Contempt of  Supreme  Court  under  <a href="/doc/1869978/" id="a_2">section
15(1)(a)</a> and (b) of-Read with rule 3(a), (b) and (c) supreme
Court Contempt	of Court Rules, 1975, in respect of a speech
delivered  at	a  meeting   of	 Bar  Council,	reported  in
newspapers.



HEADNOTE:
     The respondent No. 1, Shri P. Shiv Shankar, Minister of
Law, Justice  and Company  Affairs  at	the  relevant  time,
delivered a  speech at	a meeting  of  the  Bar	 Council  of
Hyderabad. The	petitioner alleged  that in  that speech the
respondent No.	1 had  made  statements	 derogatory  to	 the
dignity of  the Supreme	 Court,	 attributing  to  the  Court
partiality  towards  affluent  people  and  using  extremely
intemperate and	 undignified language,	and that  the speech
contained slander  cast on this Court both in respect of the
Judges and  the working	 of the Court. He stated that he had
approached the	Attorney General for India and the Solicitor
General of  India  to  give  their  consent  for  initiating
Contempt proceedings. The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General having	declined to  deal with	this prayer  of	 the
petitioner, an	application for initiation of Contempt under
<a href="/doc/1869978/" id="a_3">section 15(1)(a)</a>  and (b)  of the  Act read with Explanation
(1) and	 Rule 3(a),  (b) and  (c) of the contempt of Supreme
Court Rules,  1975, was	 made, wherein Shri P. Shiv Shankar,
the  Attorney  General,	 the  Solicitor	 General  were	made
parties. The  Court issued notice. In response, Shri P. Shiv
Shankar filed  an affidavit,  stating that  he had delivered
the  speech   on  the	subject	 of  accountability  of	 the
Legislature,  Executive	 and  the  Judiciary  and  had	made
comments on  the accountability	 of the three organs and the
theoretical implications  thereof, and	that he had intended
no  disrespect	 to  any   of  the   institutions   or	 its
functionaries much  less the  Supreme Court.  It was further
stated that  the  Contempt  petition  was  not	maintainable
without the consent of the Attorney General or the Solicitor
General. In the meantime, Shri R.N. Trivedi, Advocate, filed
an application,	 claiming right	 to be impleaded as a party,
stating that  the Attorney General and the Solicitor General
should not  have been  made parties to the comtempt petition
and that the alleged non-exercise of the jurisdiction by the
Attorney-General and the Solicitor General had
548
not constituted	 contempt within the meaning of <a href="/doc/231480/" id="a_4">section 2(c)</a>
of the Act.
     Declining	to  initiate  the  contempt  proceeding	 and
dismissing the	petition and  disposing of  the	 application
filed by Shri R.N. Trivedi, the Court,
^
     HELD: Per Sabyasachi Mukharji, J.:
     Before deciding  the question  whether this application
was maintainable without the consent of the Attorney General
or the	Solicitor General,  as contended  by Dr.  Chitale on
behalf of  Shri Shiv  Shankar, and  the question whether the
Attorney General  and the  Solicitor General  could be	made
parties to the Contempt application and whether their action
or inaction was justiciable at all in any proceeding and, if
so, in what proceedings it was necessary to decide the basic
question whether the speech made by Shri P. Shiv Shankar had
amounted to  contempt of  this Court,  or  in  other  words,
whether the  speech had	 the effect  of bringing  this Court
into disrepute. [562H; 563A-B]
     Administration of justice and Judges are open to public
criticism   and	  public   scrutiny.   Judges	have   their
accountability to  the society and their accountability must
be judged by their conscience and oath of their office, that
is to  defend and  uphold  the	Constitution  and  the	laws
without fear  and favour.  This the  Judges must  do in	 the
light  given  to  them	to  determine  what  is	 right.	 Any
criticism about	 the judicial  system or  the  Judges  which
hampers the  administration of	justice or  which erodes the
faith  in  the	objective  approach  of	 Judges	 and  brings
administration of  justice into	 ridicule must be prevented.
The contempt of Court proceedings arise out of that attempt.
Judgments can  be criticised, motives of the Judges need not
be attributed.	It brings the administration of Justice into
deep disrepute.	 Faith in  the administration  of justice is
one of	the pillars  through  which  democratic	 institution
functions and  sustains. In  the free market place of ideas,
criticism about	 the judicial  system or  Judges  should  be
welcomed, so long as such criticisms do not impair or hamper
the administration of justice. This is how the courts should
approach the  powers vested  in them  as judges	 to punish a
person for  an alleged	contempt, be  it by taking notice of
the matter  suo motu  or at  the behest	 of the	 litigant or
lawyer. [563C-F]
     In this case, the Court had examined the entire speech.
Shri P.	 Shiv Shankar  had examined the class composition of
the Supreme  Court. His	 view was that the class composition
of any instrument indi-
549
cated its  predisposition, prejudices.	This is	 inevitable.
The intuition  more subtle  than major premise, on which the
decision will  depend, is  the pride  and the prejudice of a
human instrument  of a	Judge through  which objectively the
Judge seeks to administer justice according to law. So, in a
study of  accountability, if class composition of the people
manning	 the  institution  is  analysed,  there	 has  to  be
forewarning about  certain inclination and it cannot be said
that an	 expression or	view or	 propagation  of  that	view
hampers	 the   dignity	of   the  Courts   or  impairs	 the
administration of Justice. [565F-H; 566A]
     It has to be admitted frankly and fairly that there has
been erosion of faith in the dignity of the Court and in the
majesty of  law and  that has  been caused  not so  much  by
scandalising remarks  made by  politicians or  ministers but
the inability  of the  courts of  law to  deliver quick	 and
substantial justice  to the  needy. It	is a criticism which
judges and  lawyers must make about themselves. We must turn
the search light inwards. At the same time, the Court cannot
be oblivious  of the attempts made to decry or denigrate the
judicial process, if it is seriously done. This question was
examined in  <a href="/doc/338626/" id="a_5">Rama Dayal Markarha v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>,
[1978] 3  S.C.R. 497,  where  it  was  held  that  fair	 and
reasonable  criticism  of  a  judgment	which  is  a  public
document or  which is a public act of a Judge concerned with
administration of  justice would not constitute contempt. In
fact,  such   a	 fair	and  reasonable	 criticism  must  be
encouraged because  after all  no one, much less Judges, can
claim infallibility. Such a criticism may fairly assert that
the judgment  is incorrect  or an  error has  been committed
with regard to law or established facts. But when it is said
that  the   Judge  had	 a  predisposition   to	 convict  or
deliberately took  a turn  in discussion of evidence because
he had	already made  up his  mind to convict the accused or
has a  wayward bend of mind, is attributing motives, lack of
dispassionate  and   objective	approach  and  analysis	 and
prejudging of  issues, that  would bring  administration  of
justice into  ridicule. Such  criticism sometime  interferes
with the  administration of  justice and that must be judged
by the	yardstick whether  it brings  the administration  of
justice into  ridicule or hampers administration of justice.
After all,  it cannot  be  denied  that	 pre-disposition  or
subtle prejudice  or unconscious prejudice or what in Indian
language is called "Sanskar" are inarticulate major premises
in decision  making process. That element in decision making
process cannot be denied, it should be taken note of. [569B-
G]
     It has  to be  borne in  mind,  as	 has  been  said  by
Banjamin N.  Cardozo in "The Nature of the Judicial Process"
that the judge as the
550
interpreter for	 the community of its sense of law and order
must supply  omissions, correct	 uncertainties and harmonize
results with  justice through  a method	 of  free  decision.
Courts are to "search for light among the social elements of
every kind  that are  the living force behind the facts they
deal with". [569G-H; 570A]
     Though at	places, intemperate,  the statement  of	 the
Minister  in   this  case   cannot  be	said  to  amount  to
interference with  the	administration	of  justice  and  to
amount to  contempt of	court. The Administration of justice
in this	 country stands	 on surer foundation. In the speech,
it appears  that Shri  P. Shiv Shankar was making a study of
the attitude  of this  Court. It was stated that the Supreme
Court was  composed of	the element  from the  elite  class.
Whether it is factually correct or not is another matter. In
public life, where the champions of the down trodden and the
politicians are	 mostly from  the so-called  elite class, if
the class composition is analysed, it may reveal interesting
factor	as  to	whether	 elite	class  is  dominant  as	 the
champions' of  the oppressed  or of  the social legislations
and the	 same is  the position	in the	judiciary.  But	 the
Minister went  on to  say that	because the Judges had their
'unconcealed sympathy  for the	haves' they  interpreted the
expression  'compensation'  in	the  manner  they  did.	 The
expression 'unconcealed'  was unfortunate. But this was also
an expression  of opinion  about an  institutional  pattern.
Then, the  Minister went  on to say that because of this the
word 'compensation'  in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_6">Article	 31</a> was interpreted contrary
to the	spirit	and  intendment	 of  the  Constitution.	 The
Constitution had  to be	 amended to remove this 'oligarchic'
approach of  the Supreme  Court with  little or no help. The
inter-action  of   the	decisions  of  this  Court  and	 the
constitutional amendments had been viewed by the Minister in
his speech,  but that  was nothing  new. This by itself does
not affect the administration of justice. On the other hand,
such a	study is  perhaps important for the understanding of
the evolution  of the constitutional development. Criticisms
of judgments  is permissible  in a  free  society.  [573C-D;
575E-H; 576A-B,F]
     There was	one paragraph  which appeared  to be  rather
intemperate, it read thus:
     "Anti-social  elements   i.e.  FERA   violators,  bride
burners and  whole hordes  of reactionaries have found their
heaven in the Supreme Court". [576F-G]
     That, if  true, is a criticism of the laws. The Supreme
Court, as it is bound to do, has implemented the laws and in
implementing the laws it
551
is  a	tribute	 to  the  Supreme  Court  that	it  has	 not
discriminated between  persons and  persons.  Criminals	 are
entitled to be judged in accordance with law. If anti-social
elements and  criminals have  benefited by  decisions of the
Supreme Court,	the  fault  rests  with	 the  laws  and	 the
loopholes in the legislation. The Courts are not deterred by
such criticisms. [576G-H]
     Bearing in	 mind the  trend in  the law  of contempt as
noticed before,	 as well as in some of the decisions noticed
by Krishna  Iyer, J. in the case of Re: S. Mulgaokar, [1978]
3 S.C.R.  162, the speech of the Minister read in its proper
perspective, did  not bring  the administration	 of  justice
into disrepute	or impair administration of justice. In some
portions of  the speech,  the language	used could have been
avoided by  the Minister.  The Minister	 perhaps could	have
achieved his  purpose by  making his  language mild  but his
facts deadly.  With these observations, it must be held that
there was  no  imminent	 danger	 of  interference  with	 the
administration of justice, nor of bringing administration of
justice into  disrepute. In  that view, it must be held that
the Minister was not guilty of contempt of Court. [577A-C]
     Another question  of law  of some importance had arisen
in this	 matter. <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_7">Under the Act</a>, in case of criminal contempt
other than  a contempt	referred to  in <a href="/doc/576566/" id="a_8">section 14</a> which was
not this  case, namely	a contempt  of this  Court or a High
Court, this  Court or  the High Court may take action either
on its	own motion  or on  a motion  made by  the  Advocate-
General, which	in relation to this Court means the Attorney
General or  the Solicitor-General  or any  other person with
the consent  of the  Attorney-General in terms of <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_9">section 15</a>
of the	Act. Cognizance for criminal contempt could be taken
by the	Court by three methods, namely on its own motion, or
on the	motion of  the Attorney-General	 or  the  Solicitor-
General, or  on the  motion of	any other  person  with	 the
consent of  the Attorney  General. The only course open to a
citizen for  initiating proceedings  for contempt is to move
for  consent  of  the  Attorney	 General  or  the  Solicitor
General. The  question is,  does it  cast a  duty  upon	 the
Attorney General  or the  Solicitor General  to	 consent  to
application for	 grant	of  such  consent  and	whether	 the
granting or  non-granting of  such consent is justiciable by
the Court and if so whether the question of non-granting can
be brought  up in  a rolled application moved by a person to
bring it  to the notice of the Court to take action suo motu
and at	the same  time	to  consider  whether  in  the	same
proceedings the	 action	 of  the  Attorney  General  or	 the
Solicitor General in granting or not granting consent can be
challenged  or	 it  must   be	always	 by  an	 independent
proceeding. The consent certainly is linked up with
552
contempt proceedings.  In this	case, the Minister had taken
the plea  that consideration of this case could not be taken
up because  there was no consent of the law officers. Did it
or did	it not	tend to	 interfere with	 the due  course  of
judicial proceedings in terms of clause (ii) of <a href="/doc/1121027/" id="a_10">section 3(c)</a>
of the	Act? The Attorney General and the Solicitor General,
in  respect   of  this	Court,	occupy	positions  of  great
importance and	relevance. The Attorney General is a friend,
philosopher, and  guide of  the Court  (<a href="/doc/1985537/" id="a_11">Article	 76</a>  of	 the
Constitution).	Yet,   the  Act,   vests  him  with  certain
discretions. All  statutory discretions are justiciable in a
society governed  by the  rule of  law. This  Court  is	 the
finder and  interpreter of  law in cases of this nature with
the assistance	of Attorney  General, and, in his absence or
inability, the Solicitor General. [577C-H; 578A-C]
     The petitioner in this case had approached the Attorney
General and  the Solicitor  General to	look into the matter
and accord  sanction. The  conduct of the respondents Nos. 2
and 3  according to  the petitioner,  amounted to refusal to
exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law, and, therefore,
they were  impleaded as	 parties in  the present proceedings
(as necessary  and/or proper  parties) in  order  that	they
might get an opportunity to justify the stand they had taken
in the	matter	flowing	 fr  m	their  refusal	to  exercise
jurisdiction. [580E-G]
     The question  is whether  there is a duty cast upon the
Attorney General  or the  Solicitor General  to consider the
question of  granting consent  in terms	 of  clause  (b)  of
<a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_12">section 15(1)</a> of the Act, and if in fact such consent is not
granted, that  question can  be considered  by the Court. It
was not	 a question  of making	the Attorney  General or the
Solicitor General  a party  to a  contempt proceeding in the
sense that they were liable for contempt, but if the hearing
of the	contempt proceedings  is better	 proceeded  with  by
obtaining  the	consent	 of  the  Attorney  General  or	 the
Solicitor General  and the  question  of  justiciability  of
giving the  consent is	inter-linked on the analogy of order
II, Rule  I of	the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  which	 has
application to	a civil	 proceeding and	 not to	 a  criminal
proceeding, it	is permissible	to go into this question. In
the case  of  <a href="/doc/1890737/" id="a_13">Conscientious  Group  v.	Mohammed  Yunus	 and
others</a>, [1987] 3 S.C.C. 89, this Court went into the reasons
given by  the Solicitor	 General declining consent, and held
on examination	that such consent was properly refused. This
is a  complete answer  to the  contention that in a contempt
petition the grounds for either giving consent or not giving
consent or  for not  considering the application for consent
are justiciable	 and that  question cannot  be gone  into in
that  proceeding  though  it  must  be	emphasised  in	that
proceeding that	 11 the	 Solicitor General  was not  made  a
party to the proceeding. In his
553
Lordship's opinion,  it will  be  more	appropriate  for  an
officer of  the Court  whose action is being investigated to
be made	 a party  in the  proceedings, otherwise it would be
violative of  the rule	of audi	 alteram partem.  Discretion
vested in  the law  officers of	 this Court to be used for a
public purpose	in a  society governed	by rule	 of  law  is
justiciable. It	 would be more appropriate that it should be
gone into  upon notice to the law officer concerned. It is a
case where  appropriate ground	for refusal  to act  can  be
looked into by the Court. It cannot be said that the refusal
to grant  consent decides no right and it is not reviewable.
Refusal to  give consent closes one channel of initiation of
contempt out  of the  three different  channels, namely, (1)
the Court  taking cognizance  on its  own motion; (2) on the
motion by the Attorney General or the Solicitor General; and
(3) by	any other  person with the consent in writing of the
Attorney General  or the  Solicitor General.  In this  case,
apparently the	Attorney General  and the  Solicitor General
had not moved on their own. The petitioner could not move in
accordance with	 law without  the consent  of  the  Attorney
General and  the Solicitor General, though he has a right to
move and  the third is the Court taking notice suo motu. But
irrespective of	 that there  was the  right granted  to	 the
citizen of  the country	 to move  a motion with the consent.
Indubitably, cognizance could be taken suo motu by the Court
but the	 members of  the public	 have also the right to move
the Court. That right of bringing to the notice of the Court
is dependent upon consent being given either by the Attorney
General or  the Solicitor  General, and	 if that  consent is
withheld without  reasons or  without consideration  of that
right granted  to any  other person  under <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_14">section 15</a> of the
Act, that  could be  investigated in  an application made to
the Court. [581B-H; 582A-C; 584C-D]
     Where an  appeal  comes  to  this	Court,	which  is  a
judicial decision,  the judges who rendered the decision are
not necessary  parties. There is no lis between a suitor and
a judge	 in a  judicial adjudication.  But the	position  is
entirely different  where there	 is a  suitor  claiming	 the
exercise of a statutory right in his favour which he alleges
is hampered  by an  official act  of a named official in the
Act. In	 respect  of  justiciability  of  that	act  of	 the
official there is a lis and if that lis is inter-linked with
the proceeding for contempt, there is warrant for making him
party in  that proceeding  though the prayers and the notice
must be	 issued differently.  The statute gives a right to a
suitor to  move the  Court in  one of  the contingencies for
contempt or  bring to  the notice  of the Court the contempt
with the  advice and  assistance of  the Attorney General or
the Solicitor  General. If  such right	is not considered on
relevant materials,  then, that action is justiciable in the
appropriate proceeding for contempt. [585C-G]
554
     Having considered	the peculiar facts and circumstances
of this	 A case and the allegations of bias made against the
Attorney general and the Solicitor General, it appeared that
the  Attorney	General	 and  the  Solicitor  General  acted
properly in  declining to deal with the matter and the Court
could deal  with the matter on attention being drawn to this
Court. In  that view  of the matter, the petition failed and
the application of Shri Trivedi was accordingly disposed of.
[588D-E]
     Per S. Ranganathan, J. (Concurring)
     The impugned comments were made by the respondent No. 1
in the	course of  his key  note address  at  a	 seminar  on
'Accountability of  the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary
under the  Constitution	 of  India'.  The  speech,  and,  in
particular,   some   'sevoury'	 passages   therefrom	were
highlighted in the Press. The speech had been made before an
audience comprising essentially lawyers, Jurists and Judges.
It represented	primarily an  exercise	by  the	 speaker  to
evaluate  the	roles  of  the	executive,  legislature	 and
judiciary in  the country  since its independence and to put
forward	 the   theory  that,  like  the	 executive  and	 the
legislature, the  judiciary must  also be accountable to the
people. [588F-H; 589A]
     The petitioner  contended that  certain passages in the
speech seemed  to attribute a sub-conscious partiality, bias
or predeliction	 in  the  Judges  in  disposing	 of  various
matters before	them and that those comments fell within the
scope of  the decision	of this	 Court in  the case  of <a href="/doc/625529/" id="a_15">E.M.
Sankaran Namboodripad  v. T. Narayanan Nambiar</a>, [1970] 2 SCC
325. [589A-B]
     It was  true, as pointed out by Sabyasachi Mukharji, J.
that there  were passages  in the  speech which	 torn out of
context might be liable to be misunderstood, but reading the
speech as a whole and bearing in mind the select audience to
which it  was addressed, his Lordship agreed with Sabyasachi
Mukharji, J.,  that no	contempt  had  been  committed.	 The
affidavit of  the respondent No. 1 should be accepted at its
face  value   that  the	  speech  was	only  a	 theoretical
dissertation and  that he  intended no	disrespect  to	this
Court or its functioning. [589D-E]
     The second	 aspect of  the case on which arguments were
addressed before  the Court,  related to the procedure to be
followed in  such matters. This aspect raised some important
issues. [589E-F]
     The  criminal   miscellaneous  petition  filed  by	 the
petitioner purported  to be only "information" u/s 15 (1)(a)
and (b) of the
555
<a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_16">Contempt of  Courts Act</a>,  1971 ('the  Act'). The  petitioner
stated that  he came  to know from a report in the newspaper
that the  respondent No. 1, in the course of his speech, had
made certain  statements which	randered him  liable  to  be
proceeded against for contempt of court, and, appending what
was stated to be a full text of the said speech published in
the "Newstime",	 prayed for  initiation of contempt of court
proceedings suo	 motu under <a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_17"> s. 15(1)</a>  of  the	Contempt  of
Courts Act,  1971, read	 with rule 3(a) of the Supreme Court
(Contempt of Court) Rules, 1975. Though the respondent No. 1
only, according	 to the	 petitioner, was  to be charged with
contempt, the petitioner had added three more respondents to
the criminal  miscellaneous petition,  namely, the  Attorney
General for  India (by name), the Solicitor General of India
(by name)  and Sri  Ramji Rao,	Editor	of  "Newstime".	 The
petition raised	 certain questions of general importance for
consideration  to  evolve  a  proper  procedure	 for  future
guidance in these matters. [589F-H; 590A-B]
     The petitioner  sought to	charge respondent No. 1 with
"Criminal Contempt"  under <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_18">Section  15</a> of  the	Contempt  of
Courts Act, 1971.
     A conjoint	 perusal of  the Act  and the  rules of	 the
Supreme	 Court	to  regulate  proceedings  for	Contempt  of
Supreme Court  makes it	 clear that  so far as this Court is
concerned, action  for contempt may be taken by the Court on
its own	 motion or on the motion of the Attorney General (or
the Solicitor  General) or  of any  other  person  with	 his
consent in  writing. There  is no difficulty where the Court
or the	Attorney General chooses to move in the matter. When
a private  person desires  that such action should be taken,
he may	place the  information in  his possession before the
Court, requesting  the Court to take action; or he may place
the information	 before the  Attorney General requesting him
to take	 action; or  he may place the information before the
Attorney General  requesting him  to permit  him to move the
Court. In  this case,  the petitioner  alleged that  he	 had
failed in  the letter  two courses,  and he  had moved	this
'petition' praying  that this  Court should  take  suo	motu
action. On  this 'petition',  no proceedings  could commence
until and unless the Court considered the information before
it and decided to initiate proceedings. [592F-H;593A-B
     The form  of a  criminal miscellaneous petition styling
the informant  as the  petitioner  and	certain	 persons  as
respondents is inappropriate for merely lodging the relevant
information before  the Court under rule 3(a) of the Supreme
Court (Contempt	 of Court) Rules. The proper title of such a
proceeding should  be "In re .. (the alleged contempt)". The
direction given by the Delhi High Court in

where the  informant is	 not one  of the  persons  named  in
<a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_22">section 15</a>  of the  said Act,  it should  not be styled as a
petition and  should not be placed before the judicial side.
Such a	petition should	 be placed  before the Chief Justice
for orders  m chambers	and the	 Chief	Justice	 may  decide
either by  himself or  in consultation with the other judges
of  the	  Court	 whether  to  take  any	 cognizance  of	 the
information ........ " sets out the proper procedure in such
cases and  may be  adopted in future as a practice direction
or as  a rule,	by this	 Court and  the High Court. However,
this petition having been filed and similar petitions having
been perhaps  entertained earlier  in  several	courts,	 his
Lordship did  not  suggest  that  this	petition  should  be
dismissed on this ground. [593C-H; 594A-B]
     In this  case, apart from filing his information in the
form of	 a petition, the petitioner had added as respondents
to the	petition not  only the	alleged contemner  but three
more  persons  i.e.  the  Attorney  General,  the  Solicitor
General and  Shri Ramoji  Rao,	Editor	of  "Newstime".	 The
Attorney General  and Solicitor	 General were  stated to  be
impleaded in  order that  they might  get an  opportunity to
justify	 their	 stand	in   refusing  to   exercise   their
jurisdiction to grant consent to him to enable him to file a
petition under	<a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_23">section 15(1)</a>  read with  rule 3(c), and the
fourth respondent  was only a possible witness, stated to be
impleaded only	to prove  the  authenticity  of	 the  speech
reported in  the "Newstime"  in the event of a disclaimer of
the respondent No. 1. This could not be done. This petition,
as filed,  was for  initiating proceeding  for contempt only
against respondent No. 1. If the petitioner had any cause of
action against	the other persons, such persons were neither
necessary nor  even proper parties to this petition, because
such cause  of action was of a purely civil nature. At best,
the petitioner	could say  that he was entitled to a writ of
mandamus  directing   the  Attorney  General  and  Solicitor
General to discharge their statutory obligation or a writ of
certiorari  to	 quash	their  decision	 in  case  they	 had
unreasonably withheld  their  consent  to  the	petitioner's
filing	a   petition.  This   remedy  was   to	 be   sought
independently against  these  persons  by  a  separate	writ
petition. He  could not	 seek relief  against  the  Attorney
General and  the Solicitor  General by	a petition mixing up
his criminal  charge against  respondent No. 1 and his civil
grievance against  the Attorney	 General and  the  Solicitor
General.  He  could  not  get  over  the  objection  to	 the
maintainability of  a petition,	 i.e. want of cousent of the
Attorney General  or the  Solicitor General,  merely by	 the
device of adding them as respondents
557
to the	petition; no  relief was sought against the Attorney
or the Solicitor A General. This petition, if treated as one
under rule  3(c) was not maintainable for want of consent by
the Attorney General and the Solicitor General and had to be
dismissed as  such. The	 inclusion of  respondents 2 to 4 as
respondents to	the petition was totally unjustified, and if
the petition was to be taken as merely laying of information
under rule  3(a), the  names of	 respondents 2	to 4 must be
struck off  from the array of parties. His Lordship directed
accordingly. Notice  of the  petition should  not have	been
issued in  the form  it was  issued, to the Attorney General
and the	 Solicitor General  since there was no allegation of
contempt and  no relief had been sought against them. [594B-
H; 595A-D]
     The petitioner  had submitted that the Attorney General
and  the   Solicitor  General	had  acted  unreasonably  in
declining to act in this case. In addition to merely placing
the   information    with   him	   before    the    Attorney
General/Solicitor General  and seeking	their consent to his
filing a  petition before the Court, he had written a letter
containing  a	lot  of	 irrelevant  matter,  whereby  while
purporting to  seek the	 consent  of  the  Attorney  General
Solicitor General,  he had simultaneously expressed his lack
of confidence  in their	 judgment and  ability to  discharge
their duties objectively and impartially. In this situation,
the  Attorney	General/Solicitor  General  decided  not  to
exercise their statutory powers at all one way or the other.
the Attorney  General/Solicitor General acted rightly and in
the best  traditions of	 their office  by declining  to deal
with the  petitioner's	request.  The  petitioner  had	cast
aspersions against  both the  law officers,  doubting  their
ability to  act	 objectively  and  this	 stultified  by	 his
conduct this course indicated by the Statute. [598G-H; 599A-
C,F]
     As to the question whether, in a case where neither the
Attorney General nor the Solicitor General was in a position
to consider a request under <a href="/doc/1771730/" id="a_24">section 15(1)(c)</a>, the petitioner
could seek  the consent	 of some  other law officers, as the
Additional Solicitor General, it was not open to him to seek
such consent,  as under	 <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_25">section 15</a>,  the written consent of
only those  officers as have been specifically authorised by
the section  would be  taken  note  of	for  entertaining  a
petition under the section. [599G-H; 600A-B]
     Summing up the conclusion-
     (a) This  petition,  if  treated  as  and	filed  under
<a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_26">section 15(1)</a>  read with  rule 3(a)  was not in proper form,
and if	treated as  one filed under rules 3(b) and 3(c), was
not maintainable as it was not filed by the
558
Attorney General/Solicitor  General or any other person with
his consent; [600C]
     (b) In  either event,  the petitioner  should not	have
added to  the petition	respondents other  than the  person,
alleged to  be guilty  of Contempt of Court, and their names
should be deleted from the array of the Parties; [600D]
     (c) In  case  the	Attorney  General/Solicitor  General
refuse consent	or decline  to act,  their decision  is	 not
judicially  reviewable	and  a	petitioner's  remedy  is  to
approach the Court for action under rule 3(a); [600E]
     (d)  In   this  case,  the	 Attorney  General/Solicitor
General	 acted	properly  in  declining	 to  deal  with	 the
petitioner's application either way, and [600F]
     (e) This  petition was  nothing more  than	 information
under rule  3(a) on which this Court might or might not take
suo motu action and there was no need to initiate proceeding
against the respondent No. I for Contempt of Court. [600F-<a href="/doc/890137/" id="a_27">G]

</p><p id="p_5">     The following Judgments of the Court were delivered:
     SABYASACHI MUKHARJI,  J. By  an order dated 15th March,
1988  we  declined  in	this  matter  to  initiate  contempt
proceedings under  <a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_40">section 15(1)</a> (a) and (b) of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_41">Contempt
of Courts Act</a>, 1971 (hereinafter called 'the Act') read with
rule 3(a),  (b) and  (c) of  the Supreme  Court Contempt  of
Court Rules,  1975. We	also on	 that date  disposed of	 the
application for	 intervention filed by Shri R.N. Trivedi. We
stated that  we will  indicate our  reasons  by	 a  separate
judgment. We do so herein
     Shri P.  Shiv Shankar  who at the relevant time was the
Hon'ble	 Minister  for	Law,  Justice  and  Company  Affairs
delivered a  speech before  a meeting  of the Bar Council of
Hyderabad on  28th November, 1987. Shri P.N. Duda, who is an
advocate practising  in the  Supreme Court,  has  drawn	 our
attention to  that speech.  According to him, by that speech
respondent No.	1, Shri	 P. Shiv Shankar has made statements
against the  Supreme  Court  which  are	 derogatory  to	 the
dignity	 of   this  Court,   attributing  this	 Court	with
partiality towards  economically affluent  sections  of	 the
people and has used language which is extremely intemperate,
undignified, and  unbecoming of	 a person of his stature and
position It  was stated	 that Shri  P. Shiv Shankar formerly
held the  office of  a Judge  of the  High Court  before  he
resigned and took to politics.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">560</span>
<p id="p_6">     We have  read the entire speech. It is not necessary to
set out	 the A	entire speech.	The relevant portions of the
said speech for the present purpose are as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "(a) The  Supreme Court  composed of	the  element
	  from	the   elite  class   had  their	 unconcealed
	  sympathy for	the haves  i.e. the  Zamindars. As a
	  result, they	interpreted the	 word 'compensation'
	  in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_42">Article  31</a> contrary  to  the  spirit  and	 the
	  intendment  of  the  Constitution  and  ruled	 the
	  compensation must  represent	the  price  which  a
	  willing  seller  is  prepared	 to  accept  from  a
	  willing buyer	 The entire  programme of  Zamindari
	  abolition suffered a setback. The Constitution had
	  to be amended by the 1st, 14th and 17th Amendments
	  to remove  this oligarchic approach of the Supreme
	  Court with  little or	 no help.  Ultimately,	this
	  rigid	 reactionary   and  traditional	 outlook  of
	  property, led	 to the	 abolition of  property as a
	  fundamental right."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     He inter alia further observed:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "(b) Holmes  Alexander in  his column	 entitled '9
	  Men of  Terror Squad' made a frontal attack on the
	  functions of	the U.S.  Supreme Court. It makes an
	  interesting reading:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	       'Now can you tell what that black-robed elite
	       are going  to do next. Spring more criminals,
	       abolish more  protections.  Throw  down	more
	       ultras. Rewrite	more laws. Chew more clauses
	       out of  the Constitution. May be, as a former
	       Vice-President once said, the American people
	       are too	dumb to	 understand, but I would bet
	       that the	 outcropping of	 evidence at the top
	       in  testimony   before  the  US	Senate	says
	       something about	the swelling  concern  among
	       the people themselves.'
	       Should we  not ask  how true Holmes Alexander
	       was in the Indian context."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     The Minister further stated:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	  "(c) Twenty  years of	 valuable time	was lost  in
	  this confrontation  presented by  the Judiciary in
	  introducing  and   implementing   basic   agrarian
	  reforms for removal of poverty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">561</span>
	  what is  the ultimate	 result. Meanwhile  even the
	  political will  seems to  have given	way and	 the
	  resultant effect  is the  improper and ineffective
	  implementation of  the land  reform  laws  by	 the
	  Executive  and  the  Judiciary  supplimenting	 and
	  complementing each other."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     It was further stated by him:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  "(d)	 The	Maharajas   and	  the	Rajas	were
	  anachronistic in independent India. They had to be
	  removed and  yet the	conservative element  in the
	  ruling party	gave them  privy  purses.  When	 the
	  privy purses	were abolished,	 the Supreme  Court,
	  contrary to  the whole  national upsurge,  held in
	  favour of the Maharajas".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  "(e) Madhadhipatis like Keshavananda and Zamindars
	  like Golaknath  evoked a  sympathetic cord nowhere
	  in the  whole country	 except the Supreme Court of
	  India. And  the bank magnates, the representatives
	  of the  elitist  culture  of	this  country,	ably
	  supported by	industrialists, the beneficiaries of
	  independence,	 got   higher  compensation  by	 the
	  intervention of  the	Supreme	 Court	in  Cooper's
	  case. Antisocial  elements  i.e.  FERA  violators,
	  bride burners	 and a	whole horde of reactionaries
	  have found their heaven in the Supreme Court."</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">     Shri P.N.	Duda brought  the newspaper  version of	 the
said speech  to our  notice. He further stated that the said
speech contains	 slander which	was cast on this Court, both
in respect  of the  Judges and	its working.  It was alleged
that Shri  P. Shiv  Shankar has	 done this  to	malign	this
Court. Shri  Duda further  stated that he read the speech in
the News  Times and  he had  approached the learned Attorney
General of  India and the learned Solicitor General of India
to give	 their consent	for initiating contempt proceedings.
In those  circumstances, the petitioner claimed that he also
made the Editor and Publisher of the newspaper-News Times as
one of the respondents. The learned Attorney General and the
learned Solicitor  General have	 declined to  deal with this
prayer of  the petitioner  for the  reasons  stated  in	 the
letter which is an annexure to this petition. We shall refer
to that	 part of the letter later. In those circumstances an
application for initiation of contempt entitled "Information
under  <a href="/doc/1869978/" id="a_43">Section	15(1)(a)</a>  and  (b)  of	the  Act  read	with
Explanation (19	 and Rule  3(a), (b)  and (c) of Contempt of
Supreme Court Rules, 1975" in the matter of said Shri
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">562</span>
P.N. Duda was made wherein Shri P. Shiv Shankar, the learned
A Attorney  General, the  learned Solicitor  General and the
Editor of  News Times  were made  parties.  The	 application
having been  moved before  this Court on 10th February, 1988
we directed  issue of  notice returnable on 15th March, 1988
to the	respondents, namely,  Shri P.  Shiv Shankar, Shri K.
Parasaran, Shri	 Milon Banerji	and Shri  Ramji Rao, Editor,
News Times confined only to the question to consider whether
action, if  any, need  be taken	 on the said petition of the
petitioner. We	requested  the	First  Additional  Solicitor
General, Shri  B. Datta to appear as Amicus Curiae to assist
the Court.  On 11th  February, 1988  Shri Duda mentioned the
matter and  this Court	clarified that	the respondents need
not appear in the first instance in person. In the meantime,
pursuant to  the notice	 Shri P.  Shiv Shankar	has filed an
affidavit on  8th March, 1988 in which he has stated that he
had delivered  a speech on the Silver Jubilee Celebration of
the Bar	 Council of  Andhra Pradesh  at Hyderabad  where the
audience consisted  of Judges  and lawyers. On that occasion
he had made a speech on the subject of accountability of the
Legislature, the  Executive and	 the Judiciary.	 He  further
stated that  during the	 speech, he  made  comments  on	 the
accountability	of   the  three	  organs   and	 theoretical
implications thereof.  The Minister  has further  reiterated
with utmost  emphasis at  his command  that he	intended  no
disrespect to  any of  the institutions or its functionaries
much less  this Hon'ble Court. He further stated that he has
high regard  for this  Hon'ble Court. He further stated that
the contempt petition is not maintainable in law without the
consent of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General and
it  was	  liable  to   be  dismissed.  In  the	Meantime  an
application has	 been filed  by Shri  R.N. Trivedi who is an
advocate of  25 years'	standing at  the Bar in which he has
claimed the  right to be impleaded as a party. He has stated
in the	petition that  the learned  Attorney General and the
Solicitor General  should not  have been made parties to the
contempt  petition   and   the	 alleged   non-exercise	  of
jurisdiction by	 the  Attorney	General	 and  the  Solicitor
General did  not constitute  contempt within  the meaning of
<a href="/doc/231480/" id="a_44">section 2(c)</a>  of the  Act. The remedy, if any, in respect of
the alleged non-exercise of jurisdiction and power would lie
somewhere else,	 according to Shri Trivedi. Shri B. Datta at
our  request   appeared	 as   Amicus  Curiae  and  made	 his
submissions. We express our gratitude to him.
</p><p id="p_8">     Before deciding  the question  whether this application
was maintainable without the consent of the Attorney General
or the	Solicitor General  as contended	 by Dr.	 Chitale  on
behalf of  Shri Shiv  Shanker and  the question	 whether the
Attorney General and the Solicitor
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">563</span>
General could  be made	parties to  the contempt application
and whether  their action or inaction was justiciable at all
in any	proceeding and	if so  in what	proceedings,  it  is
necessary to  decide the  basic question  whether the speech
made by	 Shri P.  Shiv Shankar	and published throughout the
length and  breadth of	the country  amounted to contempt of
this Court,  or in  other words,  whether the speech has the
effect of bringing this Court into disrepute.
</p><p id="p_9">     "Justice is  not  a  cloistered  virtue.  she  must  be
allowed to  suffer the	scrutiny and respectful, even though
outspoken, comments  of ordinary  men." - said Lord Atkin in
<a href="/doc/890137/" id="a_45">Ambard v.  Attorney-General</a> for	 Trinidad and Tobago, [1936]
A.C. 322  at 335.  Administration of  justice and Judges are
open to	 public criticism  and public  scrutiny. Judges have
their accountability to the society and their accountability
must be judged by their conscience and oath of their office,
that is,  to defend and uphold the Constitution and the laws
without fear  and favour.  This the  Judges must  do in	 the
light given to them to determine what is right. And again as
has been  said in  the famous  speech of  Abraham Lincoln in
1865 "With  malice towards  none, with	charity for  all, we
must strive  to do  the right,	in the	light given to us to
determine that	right." Any  criticism	about  the  judicial
system or  the Judges  which hampers  the administration  of
justice or  which erodes the faith in the objective approach
of Judges and brings administration of justice into ridicule
must be	 prevented. The	 Contempt of Court proceedings arise
out of that attempt. Judgment can be criticised; the motives
of  the	 Judges	 need  not  be	attributed,  it	 brings	 the
administration of  justice into deep disrepute. Faith in the
administration of  justice is  one of  the  pillars  through
which democratic  institution functions and sustains. In the
free market  place of  ideas criticisms	 about the  judicial
system or  Judges  should  be  welcomed,  so  long  as	such
criticisms do  not impair  or hamper  the administration  of
justice. This  is how  Courts  should  approach	 the  powers
vested in  them as  Judges to punish a person for an alleged
contempt, be  it by  taking notice of the matter suo motu or
at the behest of the litigant or a lawyer.
</p><p id="p_10">     <a href="/doc/625529/" id="a_46">In E.M. Sankaran Namboodiripad v. T. Narayanan Nambiar</a>,
[1971] I  S.C.R. 697,  this Court  had	to  deal  with	this
jurisdiction in	 respect of  Mr. Namboodiripad	who  at	 the
relevant time  was the Chief Minister of Kerala. He had held
a press	 conference  in	 November,  1976  and  made  various
critical remarks  relating to the judiciary which inter alia
was described  by him  as "an  instrument of oppression" and
the Judges as "dominated by class hatred, class prejudices",
"instinctively" favouring the rich against the poor. He also
stated that as part of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">564</span>
the ruling  classes the	 judiciary "works  against  workers,
peasants and  A other  sections of  the working classes" and
"the law  and the system of judiciary essentially served the
exploiting classes"  (emphasis supplied)  It was  found that
these remarks were reported in the newspapers and thereafter
proceedings commenced  in the  High  Court  of	Kerala.	 The
appellant Shri	Namboodiripad was  called upon to show cause
why  he	 should	 not  be  committed  for  contempt.  In	 his
affidavit  the	 appellant  stated  that  the  reports	were
"substantially correct", though incomplete in some respects.
The appellant  further claimed	that his observations did no
more than give expression to the Marxist Philosophy and what
was contained  in the  programme of  the Communist  Party of
India.	By  a  majority	 judgment  of  the  High  Court	 the
appellant was  convicted for contempt of court and fined Rs.
1000 or	 simple imprisonment  for one  month. He  moved this
Court by  an appeal.  He contended  that the law of contempt
must be	 read without  encroaching  upon  the  guarantee  of
freedom of  speech and	expression under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_47">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of
the Constitution  and that the intention of the appellant in
making	his  remarks  at  the  press  conference  should  be
examined in the light of his political views which he was at
liberty to  put before	the people. He sought to justify the
remarks as  an exposition  of his  ideology which he claimed
was based  on the  teachigs of	Marx and  Engels and on this
ground claimed	protection of  the first  clause of  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_48">Article
19(1)</a> of  the Constitution.  The conviction of the appellant
was upheld  by this  Court. It was observed by Hidayatullah,
C.J speaking  for the  Court that  the law punishes not only
acts which  do not  in fact  interfere with  the courts	 and
administration of  justice but	also those  which have	that
tendency, that is to say, are likely to produce a particular
result. Judged	from the  angle of courts and administration
of justice, there was no doubt that the appellant was guilty
of contempt of court. The Chief Justice observed whether the
appellant misunderstood	 the teachings of Marx and Engels or
deliberately distorted	them was  not to  mush purpose.	 The
likely effect of his words must be seen and they clearly had
the effect  of lowering the prestige of judges and courts in
the eyes  of the people. (emphasis supplied) That he did not
intend any  such result may be a matter for consideration in
the sentence  to be  imposed on him but could not serve as a
justification. This  Court further  held that  the appellant
had misguided  himself about  the true	teachings  of  Marx,
Engles and  Lenin. According  to the  Chief Justice  he	 had
misunderstood the  attack by  them on  State and the laws as
involving an  attack on	 the Judiciary. No doubt the courts,
while upholding the laws and enforcing them, do give support
to the	State but  they do  not do  so	out  of	 any  impure
motives.  To  charge  the  Judiciary  as  an  instrument  of
oppression, the	 Judges as  guided and	dominated  by  class
hatred, class
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">565</span>
interests and  class prejudices, instinctively favouring the
rich against  the poor	is to draw a very distorted and poor
picture of  the Judiciary. It A was clear that the appellant
bore an	 attack upon judges which was calculated to raise in
the minds  of the  people a general dissatisfaction with and
distrust of  all judicial  decisions. According to the Chief
Justice it  weakened the  authority of	law and	 law  courts
(emphasis supplied).  It was  further held  that  while	 the
spirit underlying  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_49">Article 19(1)(a</a>), must have due play, the
Court could not overlook the provisions of the second clause
of that Article. Its provisions are to be read with Articles
129 and	 215 which  specially confer  on this  Court and the
High Courts  the power to punish for contempt of themselves.
Although <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_50">Article  19(1)(a)</a> guaranteed  complete	 freedom  of
speech and  expression, it also made an exception in respect
of contempt of court. While the right is essential to a free
society, the Constitution had itself imposed restrictions in
relation to  contempt of court and it could not therefore be
said that  the right  abolished the  law of contempt or that
attack upon  judges and courts would be condoned. We are not
concerned here	whether the  appellant in that case properly
understood the communist manifesto or the views of the Marx,
Engles and Lenin. While respectfully accepting the ratio and
the observations  of the  learned Chief Justice made in that
decision we must recognise that times and clime have changed
in the last two decades. There have been tremendous erosions
of many values. In this connection it is interesting to note
that little  over sixty	 years	ago,  on  1st  March,  1928,
Justice Holmes	wrote to Prof. Harold Laski " . . .You amaze
me by  saying, if  I understand	 you, that  criticism of  an
opinion or  judgment after  it has been rendered, may make a
man liable  for contempt. I thought that notion was left for
some of	 our middle  western states.  I must  try to get the
book and  the decision	.. "  (Holmes-Laski Letters  Vol.  I
1916-1925 Page 1032).
</p><p id="p_11">     In the instant case we have examined the entire speech.
In the	speech Shri  P. Shiv  Shankar has examined the class
composition of	the Supreme  Court. His	 view was  that	 the
class composition  of  any  instrument	indicates  its	pre-
disposition, its  prejudices. This  is	inevitable.  Justice
Holmes in his dissenting opinion in Joseph Lochner v. People
of the	State of  New York, 49 Lawyers' Edition 195-198 U.S.
1904  had  observed  "General  propositions  do	 not  decide
concrete cases.	 The decision  will depend  on a judgment or
intuition more	subtle than  any articulate  major premise."
That intuition	more subtle  than major premise is the pride
and the	 prejudice of  a human instrument of a Judge through
which objectively  the Judge  seeks  to	 administer  justice
according  to	law.  So,   therefore,	 in   a	  study	  of
accountability if class
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">566</span>
composition  of	  the  people  manning	the  institution  is
analysed we  forewarn ourselves	 of certain  inclination  it
cannot be  said that an expression or view or propagation of
that view  hampers the	dignity of the Courts or impairs the
administration of justice.
</p><p id="p_12">     The question  of contempt of court by newspaper article
criticising  the   Judges  of	the  Court   came   up	 for
consideration in the case of Re: Shri S. Mulgaokar, [1978] 3
S.C.R. 162.  In order  to appreciate the controversy in this
case it has to be stated that the issue dated 13th December,
1977, of  the Indian  Express published a news item that the
High Courts  had reacted  very strongly to the suggestion of
introducing a code of judicial ethics and propriety and that
"so adverse  has been  the criticism  that the Supreme Court
Judges, some  of whom  had prepared  the  draft	 code,	have
disowned it".  In its  issue  dated  December  21,  1977  an
article entitled "behaving like a Judge" was published which
inter alia  stated that	 the  Supreme  Court  of  India	 was
"packed" by  Mrs. Indira  Gandhi "with pliant and submissive
judges except  for a  few". It	was further  stated that the
suggestion that	 a code	 of ethics  should be  formulated by
Judges	themselves   was  "so	utterly	 inimical   to	 the
independence   of    the   judiciary,	violative   of	 the
Constitutional safeguards  in that  respect and offensive to
the self-respect  of the Judges as to make one wonder how it
was conceived  in the first place". A notice had been issued
to the	Editor-in-Chief of  the Newspaper  to showcause	 why
proceedings  for   contempt  under   <a href="/doc/927019/" id="a_51">Article  129</a>   of	 the
Constitution should  not be initiated against him in respect
of the above two news items
     It was  observed by  Chief Justice Beg in that decision
that national  interest required  that all criticisms of the
judiciary must	be strictly  rational and  sober and proceed
from the  highest motives  without  being  coloured  by	 any
partisan spirit or tactics. This should be apart of national
ethics. The  comments about  Judges  of	 the  Supreme  Court
suggesting that	 they lack  moral courage  to the  extent of
having "disowned"  what they  had done or in other words, to
the extent  of uttering	 what was  untrue, at least verge on
contempt. None	could say  that such  suggestions would	 not
make Judges  of this Court look ridiculous or even unworthy,
in the	estimation of  the public,  of the  very high office
they hold  if they  could so  easily "disown"  what they had
done after having really done it. It was reiterated that the
judiciary can  not be  immune from criticism. But, when that
criticism was  based on	 obvious distortion  or	 gross	mis-
statement and made in a manner which seems designed to lower
respect for  the judiciary  and destroy public confidence in
it, it could not be ignored. A decision on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">567</span>
question whether  the discretion to take action for Contempt
of Court  should be exercised must depend on the totality of
facts and  circumstances of  the  case.	 The  Chief  Justice
agreed with  the other	two learned  Judges in that decision
that in	 those facts  the  proceedings	should	be  dropped.
Krishna Iyer,  J. in  his judgment  observed that  the Court
should act  with seriousness  and severity  where justice is
jeopardised by	a  gross  and/or  unfounded  attack  on	 the
Judges, where  the attack  was	calculated  to	obstruct  or
destroy the  judicial process.	The Court must harmonise the
constitutional values  of free criticism, and the need for a
fearless curial	 process and  its presiding functionary, the
judge. To  criticise a	judge fairly  albeit fiercely, is no
crime but  a necessary	right. Where  freedom of  expression
subserves public  interest  in	reasonable  measure,  public
justice cannot	gag it	or manacle  it. The Court must avoid
confusion between  personal protection	of a  libelled judge
and prevention	of obstruction	of public  justice  and	 the
community's confidence	in that great process. The former is
not contempt  but latter  is,  although	 overlapping  spaces
abound. The  fourth functional	canon  is  that	 the  Fourth
Estate should  be given	 free play within responsible limits
even when  the focus of its critical attention is the court,
including the  highest court.  The fifth normative guideline
for the	 Judges to  observe is not to be hypersensitive even
where distortions and criticisms overstep the limits, but to
deflate vulgar	denunciation by	 dignified bearing,  and the
sixth consideration  is that  if  the  Court  considers	 the
attack	on   the  judge	 or  judges  scurrilous,  offensive,
intimidatory or	 malicious  beyond  condonable	limits,	 the
strong arm  of the  law	 must  strike  a  blow	on  him	 who
challenges the	supremacy of  the rule of law by fouling its
sources and stream.
</p><p id="p_13">     It is  well to  remember the  observations	 of  Justice
Brennan of U.S. Supreme Court (though made in the context of
law of	libel) in  New York  Times Company v. L.B. Sullivan,
376 U.S.  254 that  it is  a prized privilege to speak one's
mind, although	not always  with perfect  good taste, on all
public institutions  and this opportunity should be afforded
for vigorous advocacy no less than abstract discussion.

<p id="p_17">     It has  been  well	 said  that  if	 judges	 decay,	 the
contempt power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">569</span>
will not save them and so the other side of the coin is that
Judges, like  Caesar's wife,  must be  above suspicion,	 per
Krishna Iyer, J. in <a href="/doc/758140/" id="a_52">Shri Baradakanta Mishra v. The Registrar
of Orissa  High</a> Court  and another,  [1974] 1 S.C.C. 374. It
has to	be admitted  frankly and  fairly that there has been
erosion of  faith in  the dignity  of the  court and  in the
majesty of  law and  that has been caused not so much by the
scandalising remarks  made by  politicians or  ministers but
the inability  of the  courts of  law to  deliver quick	 and
substantial justice  to the  needy. Many  today suffer	from
remedyless evils  which courts of justice are incompetent to
deal with.  Justice cries in silence for long, far too long.
The procedural	wrangle is  eroding the faith in our justice
system. It  is a criticism which the Judges and lawyers must
make about themselves. We must turn the search light inward.
At the same time we cannot be oblivious of the attempts made
to decry  or  denigrate	 the  judicial	process,  if  it  is
seriously done.	 This question	was examined  in <a href="/doc/338626/" id="a_53">Rama  Dayal
Markarha v.  State of  Madhya Pradesh</a>,	[1978] 3  S.C.R. 497
where it  was held  that fair  and reasonable criticism of a
judgment which is a public document or which is a public act
of a  Judge concerned  with administration  of justice would
not constitute	contempt. In  fact such	 fair and reasonable
criticism must	be encouraged because after all no one, much
less Judges,  can claim	 infallibility. Such a criticism may
fairly assert that the judgment is incorrect or an error has
been committed both with regard to law or established facts.
But when it is said that the Judges had a pre-disposition to
convict	 or  deliberately  took	 a  turn  in  discussion  of
evidence because  he had already made up his mind to convict
the accused,  or has  a wayward bend of mind, is attributing
motives, lack  of dispassionate	 and objective	approach and
analysis and  pre-judging of  the issues  which would  bring
administration of  justice into	 ridicule. Criticism  of the
Judges would  attract greater attention than others and such
criticism sometime  interferes with  the  administration  of
justice and  that must be judged by the yardstick whether it
brings the  administration of  justice into  a	ridicule  or
hampers administration	of justice.  After all	it cannot be
denied	that   pre-disposition	or   subtle   prejudice	  or
unconscious prejudice  or what	in Indian language is called
"Sanskar" are inarticulate major premises in decision making
process. That  element in the decision making process cannot
be denied, it should be taken note of.
</p><p id="p_18">     It has  to be  borne in  mind,  as	 has  been  said  by
Benjamin N.  Cardozo in "The Nature of the Judicial Process"
at pages  16-17 that  the Judge	 as the	 interpreter for the
community  of  its  sense  of  law  and	 order	must  supply
omissions, correct uncertainties, and harmonize results with
justice through a method of free decision. Courts are to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">570</span>
"search for  light among  the social  elements of every kind
that are  the A	 living force  behind the  facts  they	deal
with". The  power thus	put in	their hands  is	 great,	 and
subject, like  all power, to abuse; but we are not to flinch
from granting  it. In the long run "there is not guaranty of
justice," said	Ehrlich,  "except  the	personality  of	 the
judge. Justice	Benjamin N. Cardozo further says at page 112
of the	said book  that judicial process comes then to this,
and little  more logic, history, custom and utility, and the
accepted standards  of right  conduct, are  the forces which
singly or  in combination  shape the  progress of  the	law.
Judges try  to see  things as  objectively as  they  please.
Nonetheless, we	 can never see them with any eyes except our
own. Therefore,	 the perception	 of a judge is important and
relevant. Judicial  process is	not only a path of discovery
but a  path of creation (Cardozo "the Nature of the Judicial
Process").
</p><p id="p_19">     President Roosevelt  in his  message to the Congress of
the United States on December 8, 1908 stated thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	  "The chief  lawmakers in  our country	 may be, and
	  often are,  the judges, because they are the final
	  seat	of  authority.	Every  time  they  interpret
	  contract, property,  vested rights, due process of
	  law, liberty,	 they  necessarily  enact  into	 law
	  parts of  a system  of social	 philosophy; and  as
	  such	interpretation	is  fundamental,  they	give
	  direction to	all lawmaking.	The decisions of the
	  courts on  economic and  social  questions  depend
	  upon their economic and social philosophy; and for
	  the peaceful	progress of  our people	 during	 the
	  twentieth century  we	 shall	owe  most  to  those
	  judges who  hold to  a twentieth  century economic
	  and social  philosophy and  not to a long outgrown
	  philosophy,  which   was  itself  the	 product  of
	  primitive economic conditions."</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">     Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo says that he remembers when
the statement  made aroused  a storm of criticism. (Cardozo-
The  Nature  of	 the  Judicial	Process-pages  171-173).  It
betrayed ignorance,  he said,  of the nature of the judicial
process. Justice  Benjamin N.  Cardozo	tells  us  that	 the
business of  the judge, was to discover objective truth. His
own little  individuality, his	tiny stock  of scattered and
unco-ordinated philosophies,  these, with all his weaknesses
and unconscious	 prejudices,  were  to	be  laid  aside	 and
forgotten. According  to Cardozo the truth is, however, that
all these  inward questionings	are born  of  the  hope	 and
desire to  transcend the  limitations which  hedge our human
nature. According to Cardozo, Roosevelt, who knew men,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">571</span>
had no	illusions on  this score.  He was  not	positing  an
ideal. He was not fixing a goal. He was measuring the powers
and the endurance of those A by whom the race was to be run.
It is well to remember the words of Justice Cardozo where he
says as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  "I have  no quarrel,	therefore, with the doctrine
	  that the  judges ought  to be in sympathy with the
	  spirit of  their times.  Alas! assent	 to  such  a
	  generality does  not carry us far upon the road to
	  truth. In  every court  there are  likely to be as
	  many estimates  of the  'Zeitgeist' as  there	 are
	  judges on  its bench.	 Of the	 power of  favour or
	  prejudice in any sordid or vulgar or evil sense, I
	  have found  no trace, not even the faintest, among
	  the judges  whom I have known. But every day there
	  is borne in on me a new conviction of the inescap-
	  able relation between the truth without us and the
	  truth within.	 The spirit  of the  age, as  it  is
	  revealed to  each of	us, is	too often  only	 the
	  spirit of  the group	in which  the  accidents  of
	  birth or  education or  occupation  or  fellowship
	  have given  us a place. No effort or revolution of
	  the mind  will overthrow  utterly and at all times
	  the empire  of these	subconscious loyalties. "our
	  beliefs and  opinions," says James Harvey Robinson
	  (32 Political	 Science Quarterly  315), "like	 our
	  standards of	conduct come  to  us  insensibly  as
	  products of our companionship with our fellow men,
	  not as  results of our personal experience and the
	  inferences  we  individually	make  from  our	 own
	  observations. We  are	 constantly  misled  by	 our
	  extraordinary faculty of 'rationalizing' -that is,
	  of devising plausible arguments for accepting what
	  is imposed  upon us by the traditions of the group
	  to which  we belong.	We are adjectly credulous by
	  nature, and  instinctively accept  the verdicts of
	  the group.  We are  suggestible  not	merely	when
	  under the  spell of  an excited  mob or  a fervent
	  revival, but	we are	ever and always listening to
	  the still  small voice  of the  herd, and are ever
	  ready to  defend and	justify its instructions and
	  warnings, and accept them as the mature results of
	  our own  reasoning. "	 This was  written,  not  of
	  judges specially,  but of  men and  women  of	 all
	  classes. The	training of  the judge,	 if  coupled
	  with what is styled the judicial temperament, will
	  help in  some degree	to emancipate  him from	 the
	  suggestive  power   of  individual   dislikes	 and
	  prepossessions. It  will help to broaden the group
	  to which his subconscious loyalties are due. Never
	  will these loyalties be utterly extinguished
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">572</span>
	  while human  nature is  what it  is. We may wonder
	  sometimes how from the play of all these forces of
	  individualism, there	can come  anything coherent,
	  anything but	chaos and  the void.  Those are	 the
	  moments in  which we	exaggerate the	elements  of
	  difference. In  the end  there emerges  some thing
	  which has  a composite  shape and truth and order.
	  It has  been said that "History, like mathematics,
	  is obliged  to assume	 that eccentricities more or
	  less balance each other, so that something remains
	  constant at  last" (Henry  Adams, "The Degradation
	  of the  Democratic Dogma," pages 291 and 292). The
	  like	is   true  of	the  work   of	courts.	 The
	  eccentricities of  judges balance one another. One
	  judge looks  at problems from the point of view of
	  history, another  from that of philosophy, another
	  from that  of social	utility, one is a formalist,
	  another  a  latitudinarian,  one  is	timorous  of
	  change, another dissatisfied with the present; out
	  of the  attrition of diverse minds there is beaten
	  something which has a constancy and uniformity and
	  average value greater than its component elements.
	  The same thing is true of the work of juries. I do
	  not mean  to suggest	that the  product in  either
	  case does  not betray	 the flaws  inherent in	 its
	  origin. The  flaws are  there as  in	every  human
	  institution. Because	they are  not only there but
	  visible,  we	 have  faith   that  they   will  be
	  corrected. There  is no assurance that the rule of
	  the majority	will be	 the expression	 of  perfect
	  reason  when	 embodied  in	constitution  or  in
	  statute. We  ought not  to expect  more of it when
	  embodied in  the judgments of the courts. The tide
	  rises and falls, but the sands of error crumble.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	       The work	 of a judge is in one sense enduring
	  and in another sense ephemeral. What is good in it
	  endures. What	 is  erroneous	is  pretty  sure  to
	  perish. The  good remains  the foundation on which
	  new structures  will be  built. The  bad  will  be
	  rejected and	cast off  in the  laboratory of	 the
	  years.  Little  by  little  the  old	doctrine  is
	  undermined. Often the encroachments are so gradual
	  that their  significance  is	at  first  obscured.</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">	  Finally  we  discover	 that  the  contour  of	 the
	  landscape has been changed, that the old maps must
	  be cast  aside, and  the ground  charted anew. The
	  process, with all its silent yet inevitable power,
	  has been  described by Mr. Henderson with singular
	  felicity: "When  an adherent of a systematic faith
	  is brought continuously in touch with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">573</span>
	  influences and  exposed  to  desires	inconsistent
	  with	that   faith,  a   process  of	 unconscious
	  cerebration may  take place,	by which  a  growing
	  store	  of   hostile	 mental	  inclinations	 may
	  accumulate,	strongly   motivating	action	 and
	  decision,  but   seldom  emerging   clearly	into
	  consciousness. In the meantime the formulas of the
	  old faith  are retained  and repeated	 by force of
	  habit, until	one day	 the realization  comes that
	  conduct and  sympathies  and	fundamental  desires
	  have	become	so  inconsistent  with	the  logical
	  framework that  it must  be discarded. Then begins
	  the task  of building	 up and	 rationalizing a new
	  faith."  (Cardozo-  The  Nature  of  the  Judicial
	  Process pages 174-179)
     If any-one	 draws attention  to this  danger and aspect
and measures an institution by the class content he does not
minimise its  dignity or  denigrate its authority. Looked in
that perspective  though at  places little  intemperate, the
statement of  the Minister  in this  case cannot  be said to
amount to  interference with  the administration  of justice
and as	to amount  to  contempt	 of  court.  The  Minister's
statement does	not interfere  with  the  administration  of
justice. Administration of justice in this country stands on
surer foundation.

<p id="p_25">     No	 contempt  proceedings	were  taken  in	 England  in

</p><p id="p_26">     Reference may  also be  made to  the decision  of	this
Court in  <a href="/doc/1890737/" id="a_54">Conscientious Group  v. Mohammed Yunus and others</a>,
[1987] 3  S.C.C. 89.  In that  case there was publication in
the Indian  Express which carried the news that Mr. Mohammed
Yunus, Chairman, Trade Fair Authority of India said that the
Supreme Court  Judge  who  held	 that  the  singing  of	 the
National Anthem was not compulsory had no right to be called
either	an  Indian  or	a  Judge.  The	Conscientious  Group
approached this Court for contempt alleging that the conduct
of Mr.	Mohammed Yunus	in making  certain adverse  comments
about the Judges who delivered the judgment of this Court in
Civil Appeal  No. 860  of 1986	National Anthem case (1986 3
S.C.C. 615)  constituted criminal  contempt and it should be
so dealt  with. Notice on this petition was issued. When the
matter subsequently  came up  before a Bench of three Judges
consisting of  Bhagwati, C.J.,	Oza and K.N. Singh, JJ., the
contemnor filed	 a reply  stating that	the petition was not
maintainable inasmuch as the petitioner had not obtained the
consent in writing of the Attorney General as required under
<a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_55">section 15</a>  of the  Act. It  appears that the petitioner was
directed by  the Division Bench to move the Attorney General
for his consent and the petition was adjourned. The Attorney
General on  being moved	 by the	 petitioner for the grant of
consent replied	 to the petitioner stating that since he was
himself a  party in  his capacity as Attorney General in the
National Anthem case, it was not appropriate for him to deal
with the  petitioner's application.  When the  case later on
came up	 before the  same three Judges Bench on December 12,
1986, the  learned Judges  directed the	 withdrawal  of	 the
petition with  liberty	to  the	 petitioner  to	 refile	 the
application after  obtaining consent of the Attorney General
as soon as the National Anthem case was over. It was further
observed  by   this  Court  that  everyone  is	entitled  to
criticise the judgment of the court but no one should attack
the Judges who delivered the judgment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">575</span>
as that	 denigrates the judicial institution and in the long
term impairs the democratic process.
</p><p id="p_27">     Subsequently the petitioner in that case filed Criminal
Miscellaneous  Petition	  No.  5244   of  1986	praying	 for
recalling the aforesaid order on the ground that at the time
when he	 applied to the court for withdrawal of the petition
he was not aware that under Rule 3(c) of the Rules framed by
this Court,  the contempt  petition could be maintained with
the consent  of	 the  Solicitor	 General,  if  the  Attorney
General, for  any reason,  was not  in a  position  to	give
consent to  the filing	of the	petition. He was so allowed.
Thereafter the	petitioner approached the Solicitor General.
But the	 Solicitor General  declined to	 give the consent in
public interest.  He gave  certain reasons in support of his
conclusion.  The   Court  in   the  aforesaid	decision  by
scrutinising reasons  was of  the opinion  that the  reasons
stated by  the Solicitor  General refusing  to grant consent
could not  be said  to be  irrelevant and  the petition	 was
dismissed.  In	 dismissing  this   application	 this  Court
observed at  page 93 of the report "No doubt, by the last of
the sentence  of the said order, the Bench has also observed
that 'the  petitioner will  not be  without remedy,  if	 the
Solicitor General  refuses his	consent	 on  any  irrelevant
ground' but  this only	means that  such a  refusal  can  be
called in  question before  this Court	by the petitioner by
appropriate process".  In other	 words, the  effect  of	 the
decision is  that the  reasons given by the Attorney General
or the Solicitor General in giving or not giving his consent
were justiciable.
</p><p id="p_28">     As we  have mentioned before the speech of the Minister
has to be read in its entirety. In the speech as we have set
out hereinbefore  it appears  that Shri	 P. Shiv Shankar was
making a study of the attitude of this Court. In the portion
set out	 hereinbefore, it  was stated that the Supreme Court
was composed of the element from the elite class. Whether it
is factually correct or not is another matter. In our public
life, where  the  champions  of	 the  down-trodden  and	 the
politicians are	 mostly from  the so-called  elite class, if
the class composition is analysed, it may reveal interesting
factors as  to	whether	 elite	class  is  dominant  as	 the
champions of the oppressed or of social legislations and the
same is the position in the judiciary. But the Minister went
on to  say that	 because the  Judges had  their 'unconcealed
sympathy  for	the  haves'   interpreted   the	  expression
'compensation'	in  the	 manner	 they  did.  The  expression
'unconcealed' is unfortunate. But this is also an expression
of opinion about an institutional pattern. Then the Minister
went on	 to say that because of this the word 'compensation'
in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_56">Article 31</a> was interpreted contrary to the spirit and the
intendment of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">576</span>
Constitution. The  Constitution therefore  had to be amended
by  the	 1st,  14th  and  17th	Amendments  to	remove	this
'oligarchic' approach of the Supreme Court with little or no
help. The  inter-action of  the decisions  of this Court and
the  Constitutional  amendments	 have  been  viewed  by	 the
Minister in  his speech,  but that  is nothing	new. This by
itself does not affect the administration of justice. On the
other hand,  such a  study  perhaps  is	 important  for	 the
understanding  of   the	 evolution   of	 the  constitutional
development. The next portion to which reference may be made
where the  speaker has	referred to  Holmes Alexander in his
column entitled	 '9 Men	 of Terror  Squad' making  a frontal
attack on the functions of the U.S. Supreme Court. There was
a comparison  after making  the quotation as we have set out
hereinbefore: "one  should ask	the question how true Holmes
Alexander was  in the Indian context. " This is also a poser
on the	performance of	the Supreme  Court. According to the
speaker twenty	years of  valuable time	 was  lost  in	this
confrontation presented	 by the judiciary in introducing and
implementing basic  agrarian reforms  for removal of poverty
what is	 the ultimate result. The nation did not exhibit the
political will	to  implement  the  land  reform  laws.	 The
removal of  the Maharajas  and Rajas  and privy	 purses were
criticised because  of the  view taken	by this	 Court which
according to  the speaker was contrary to the whole national
upsurge. This is a study in the historical perspective. Then
he made	 a  reference  to  the	Keshavananda  Bharati's	 and
Golaknath's cases  and observed that a representative of the
elitist	 culture   of  this   country,	ably   supported  by
industrialists and beneficiaries of independence, got higher
compensation by	 the intervention  of the  Supreme Court  in
Cooper's case.	This is	 also a criticism of the judgment in
R.C. Cooper's  case. Whether  that  is	right  or  wrong  is
another matter, but criticism of judgments is permissible in
a free	society. There	is,  however,  one  paragraph  which
appears to  us to  be rather  intemperate and that is to the
following effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	  "Anti-social elements	 i.e. FERA  violators, bride
	  burners and  a whole	horde of  reactionaries have
	  found their heaven in the Supreme Court".
     This, of  course, if  true, is a criticism of the laws.
</blockquote><p id="p_29">The Supreme  Court as  it is bound to do has implemented the
laws and  in implementing  the laws,  it is a tribute to the
Supreme Court  that it has not discriminated between persons
and  persons.	Criminals  are	entitled  to  be  judged  in
accordance with	 law. If  anti-social elements and criminals
have benefited	by decisions of the Supreme Court, the fault
rests with  the laws  and the  loopholes in the legislation.
The Courts are not deterred by such criticisms.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">577</span>
<p id="p_30">     Bearing in	 mind the  trend in  the law  of contempt as
noticed before,	 as well as some of the decisions noticed by
Krishna Iyer, J. m S. Mulgaokar's case (supra) the speech of
the Minister  read in  its proper perspective, did not bring
the administration  of	justice	 into  disrepute  or  impair
administration of  justice. In	some portions  of the speech
the language  used could  have been  avoided by the Minister
having the  background of  being a  former Judge of the High
Court. The  Minister perhaps could have achieved his purpose
by making his language mild but his facts deadly. With these
observations, it  must be  held that  there was	 no imminent
danger of  interference with  the administration of justice,
nor of	bringing a  institution into disrepute. In that view
it must be held that the Minister was not guilty of contempt
of this Court.
</p><p id="p_31">     The view  we have	taken on  this aspect  of the matter
would have  been sufficient to dispose of this petition. But
another question  of law  of some  importance has  arisen in
this matter.  <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_57">Under the	 Act</a> in	 case of  criminal  contempt
other than a contempt referred to in <a href="/doc/576566/" id="a_58">section 14</a> which is not
the facts  of this  case, namely,  a contempt in the fact of
this Court or a High Court, this Court or the High Court may
take action  either on its own motion or on a motion made by
the Advocate  General which  in relation to this Court means
the Attorney  General or  the Solicitor General or any other
person with  the consent of the Attorney General in terms of
<a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_59">section 15</a>  of the  Act. Therefore,  cognizance for criminal
contempt could	be taken  by  the  Court  by  three  methods
namely, on  its own motion, or on the motion of the Attorney
General or  the Solicitor  General or on motion by any other
person with  the consent  of the  Attorney  General  or	 the
Solicitor General.  Therefore, the  only course	 open  to  a
citizen for  initiating proceedings  for contempt  where the
Court does  not take  cognizance on  its motion or where the
Attorney General  or the  Solicitor General  does  not	take
action is  to move  for consent	 in writing  of the Attorney
General or  the Solicitor  General. The question is, does it
cast a	duty upon  the Attorney	 General  or  the  Solicitor
General to  consider application  for grant  of such consent
and whether  the granting or non-granting of such consent is
justiciable by	the Court  and if so whether the question of
non-granting can be brought up in a rolled application moved
by a  person to	 bring it to the notice of the Court to take
action suo  motu and at the same time to consider whether in
the same  proceeding the  action of  the Attorney General or
the Solicitor  General in  granting or	not granting consent
can be	challenged or  it must	be always  by an independent
proceeding. The consent certainly is linked up with contempt
proceedings. Indeed Mohammed Yunus' case (supra) was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">578</span>
dismissed because  no consent  was obtained.  In the instant
case the  Minister has	taken the plea that consideration of
this case cannot be taken because there is no consent of the
law officers. Does it or does it not "tend to interfere with
due course  of judicial proceedings" in terms of clause (ii)
of <a href="/doc/1121027/" id="a_60">section 3(c)</a> of the Act? If so is it justiciable in these
proceedings? Attorney General and Solicitor General of India
in  respect   of  this	 Court	occupy	positions  of  great
importance and	relevance. Attorney  General, though  unlike
England is  not a  member of  the Cabinet yet is a friend of
the  Court,  and  in  some  respects  acts  as	the  friend,
philosopher and	 guide of  the Court.  (See <a href="/doc/1985537/" id="a_61">Art.  76</a> of	 the
Constitution).	Yet   the  Act	 vests	him   with   certain
discretions. All  statutory discretions are justiciable in a
society governed  by the  rule of law. one must remember the
remarks of  Thomas Fuller-  "Be you ever so high, the law is
above you"  and this  Court is the finder and interpreter of
that law  in cases  of this  nature with  the assistance  of
Attorney  General  and	in  his	 absence  or  inability	 the
Solicitor General.
</p><p id="p_32">     It is  well to remember what Burke said in the House of
Commons in  1772 in  connection with  the motion  for select
committee for  enquiry into  the affairs  of the  East India
Company and  Clive. He said that when discretionary power is
lodged in  the hands  of any man or class of men, experience
proves that  it will  always be	 abused. Where no laws exist
men must  be arbitrary and very necessary acts of government
will often  be, in such cases, represented by the interested
and malevolent	as instances  of wanton oppression (Clive of
India -	 Nirad C.  Chaudhry, page  381). Times	have changed
here, the  discretion is vested on a very high dignitary and
a friend of the Court, yet it is subject to scrutiny.
</p><p id="p_33">     On this  aspect it	 is necessary to refer to the letter
dated 3rd  December, 1987,  which Shri P.N. Duda, petitioner
herein wrote  to the  Attorney General	wherein he requested
for grant  of consent  for initiating  contempt	 proceedings
against Shri  P. Shiv Shankar and others namely, the Editor,
Hindustan Times	 and the  Printer and  Publisher,  Hindustan
Times. After  setting out  the contempt as alleged by him in
that letter, he stated, inter alia, as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  "I am	 more aware  than  any	that  you  may	feel
	  embarrassed in  giving consent  for prosecution of
	  Shri Shiv  Shankar, who happens to be the Minister
	  who effectively  hires and fires law officers, and
	  for all  purposes during  whose pleasure they hold
	  their offices. Since emergency period we have seen
	  the modalities  of this  hiring and  firing  which
	  causes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">579</span>
	  apprehensions	 in   my  mind	about  the  possible
	  outcome of  this request.  I, however,  thought it
	  fit to  make this  request, reminding	 you of your
	  duties as the ex-officio leader of the bar to give
	  your consent for prosecution of the persons named.
	  The other  two are  being named because the one is
	  the Editor and the other the Printer and Publisher
	  of the  paper, viz.  the  Hindustan  Times,  which
	  published the report.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  I will  expect you  to take  a  decision  in	this
	  matter within	 a  week  of  the  receipt  of	this
	  request. If  I do not hear from you in either way,
	  I will presume that you have declined the consent.
	  In that  event I will consider myself free to move
	  the court  for taking	 action on  its	 own  motion
	  under <a href="/doc/1869978/" id="a_62">section	 15(1)(a)</a> of  the Contempt of Courts
	  Act 1971  seeking my	participation as  an  amicus
	  curiae."</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">     A copy  of the  said letter  was sent  to the Solicitor
General of  India with request to treat it as a request made
to him	independently also under <a href="/doc/1821697/" id="a_63">section 15(1)(b)</a> of the Act
read with  Rule 3(3)  of the Supreme Court Contempt of Court
Rules, 1975.  He wrote	another letter on 8th December, 1987
in which  he reminded  the Attorney General of certain stand
taken by  him in  respect of  Shri Charanjit  Lal Sahu.	 The
relevant portion of the said letter reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "I may  invite your  attention to  the  remarkable
	  stand you took when a PIL matter initiated by Shri
	  Charanjit Lal	 Sahu came  before a  bench  of	 the
	  Supreme Court,  and  how  concerned  you  felt  in
	  seeing Shri  Sahu being prosecuted for having made
	  some statements  about the  Court, which were more
	  foolish  than	 intemperate,  for  maintaining	 the
	  dignity of  the court.  No-one would have taken Mr
	  Shau's statement  seriously, nor  was it addressed
	  to a	large audience. Shri Shiv Shankar's diatribe
	  against the  Supreme Court is more intemperate, is
	  addressed to	a very	nation-wide large  audience,
	  and the maker of the statement is a man of status,
	  whom no-one  will ignore.  I think  you will	keep
	  this aspect in mind in considering my request."</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">     A copy  of the  said letter  was also  forwarded to the
Solicitor General  of India.  In reply	the Attorney General
wrote a	 letter on  14th December,  1987 in which he stated,
inter alia, as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">580</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  "You suggest	that we	 cannot discharge our duties
	  impartially. In  other words,	 you have  sought to
	  undermine the	 credibility of	 any decision we may
	  take. These  two deeply  hurtful  allegations	 are
	  calculated to	 ensure that  in which	ever way  we
	  exercise our function, justice will not be seen to
	  be  done.   Therefore,  we   feel  that   in	 the
	  circumstances no  useful purpose will be served in
	  exercising our function at all.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	   This	 letter has  the approval  of the  Solicitor
	  General to whom a copy of your letter was sent. "</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">     Shri Duda	wrote another  letter on 19th December, 1987
both to	 the Attorney  General and the Solicitor General, in
which he stated, inter alia, as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	  "Needless  to	  point	 out  that  your  letter  is
	  suggestive of	 your refusal to discharge your duty
	  to accede  or not  to	 accede	 to  my	 request  of
	  granting sanction  and legally  I am entitled to a
	  mandamus against  you from  an  appropriate  court
	  seeking  direction   against	you  to	 decide	 the
	  matter, one  way or  the other.  I have thought it
	  fit to  make an  alternative	request	 to  you  to
	  relieve me  of  the  unpleasant  duty	 of  seeking
	  relief in any other way."</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">     After setting  out	 the  facts  in	 the  petition,	 the
petitioner inter  alia, stated	that he	 had approached	 the
learned Attorney  General and  the Solicitor General to look
into these  aspects of	the matter  and accord sanction. The
conduct of  the said  respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 3,
according to the petitioner, amounted to refusal to exercise
jurisdiction vested in them by law and, therefore, they were
impleaded  as	parties	 in   the  present  proceedings	 (as
necessary and/or  proper parties) in order that they may get
an opportunity	to justifying  the stand  they have taken in
the  matter   flowing  from   their  refusal   to   exercise
jurisdiction. Upon  this notice	 was issued by this Court to
all the respondents in the manner indicated above.
</p><p id="p_38">     Shri Gopal Subramaniam has appeared before us and filed
a statement  signed by the learned Attorney General and also
made his oral submissions. Shri Trivedi, intervener has also
made his submissions. The main plank of their submissions is
that the  actions of  the Attorney General and the Solicitor
General to  act were  motivated because of the allegation of
bias in the aforesaid letter. Reliance was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">581</span>
placed	in  the	 case  of  Vassiliades	v.  Vassiliades	 and
another, A.I.R.	 1945 P.C.  38 where  the Judicial Committee
reiterated that it was highly desirable that all proceedings
should be dealt with by persons who are above any suspicion,
however, unreasonable,	of being  biased. It  was reiterated
that in	 any case,  there was  no question of the petitioner
being without  remedy because  the  Court  can	always	take
action suo  motu. The  question, therefore, is whether there
was a  duty cast  upon the Attorney General or the Solicitor
General to  consider the  question of  granting	 consent  in
terms of  clause (b)  of <a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_64">section  15(1)</a> of  the	 Act  in  an
appropriate case and if in fact such consent was not granted
that question  could be considered by the Court. It is not a
question of  making the	 Attorney General  or the  Solicitor
General a  party to  a contempt proceeding in the sense that
they are  liable for  contempt, but  if the  hearing of	 the
contempt proceedings  can be  better proceeded	by obtaining
the consent of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General
and the	 question of justifiability of giving the consent is
interlinked on the analogy of Order II Rule I of the Code of
Civil Procedure	 which has application to a civil proceeding
and not	 to a  criminal proceeding,  it is permissible to go
into this  question. Indeed,  in the  case of  Conscientious
Group (supra)  precisely this was done, where an application
for contempt was filed and which was revived pursuant to the
previous order and the Court while doing so had reserved the
right to  consider on  the previous occasion the question if
the Solicitor  General refuses to give consent improperly or
on irrelevant ground the Court could consider that question.
In the	case of	 Conscientious Group, (supra) the Court went
into the  reasons given	 by the	 Solicitor General declining
consent. This  Court in	 that case  held on examination that
such consent was properly refused. This is a complete answer
to the	contention that	 in a  contempt petition the grounds
for either  giving consent  or not giving consent or for not
considering the	 application for consent are justiciable and
that question can not be gone into in that proceeding though
it must	 be emphasised in that proceeding that the Solicitor
General was  not made  a party	to  the	 proceeding.  In  my
opinion it  will be  more appropriate  for an officer of the
Court whose  action is being investigated to be made a party
in the	proceedings otherwise  it would	 be violative of the
rule of	 audi alteram  partem.	On  behalf  of	the  learned
Solicitor General,  Shri A.K.  Ganguly	has  made  elaborate
submissions. It	 was submitted	by  Shri  Ganguly  that	 the
procedure followed  by the petitioner simultaneously seeking
the consent  of the  Attorney General was not proper and the
Solicitor General  had been  invoked and that was not proper
and legal.  It is not possible to accept this submission. It
was contended  that  there  was	 no  doctrine  of  necessity
applicable in this case because even if the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">582</span>
Attorney General  or the  Solicitor General  does  not	give
consent a  party is  not without a remedy and can bring this
to the	notice	of  the	 Court.	 Discretion  vested  in	 law
officers of  this Court to be used for a public purpose in a
society governed  by rule  of law is justiciable. Indeed, it
was gone into in the case of Conscientious Group (supra) and
it will be more appropriate that it should be gone into upon
notice to  the law  officer concerned.	It is  a case  where
appropriate ground  for refusal to act can be looked into by
the Court.  It cannot  be said as was argued by Shri Ganguly
that the refusal to grant consent decides no right and it is
not reviewable.	 Refusal to  give consent closes one channel
of initiation  of contempt.  As mentioned hereinbefore there
are three  different channels,	namely, (1) the Court taking
cognizance on  its own	motion; (2)  on the  motion  by	 the
Attorney General  or the  Solicitor General;  and (3) by any
other person  with the	consent in  writing of	the Attorney
General or  the Solicitor  General. In	this case apparently
the Attorney  General and  the Solicitor  General  have	 not
moved on  their	 own.  The  petitioner	could  not  move  in
accordance with	 law without the consent of Attorney General
and the	 Solicitor General though he has a right to move and
the  third   is	 the  court  taking  notice  suo  motu.	 But
irrespective of	 that there was right granted to the citizen
of the	country to  move a  motion with the consent. In this
case whether  consent  was  to	be  given  or  not  was	 not
considered for	the reasons  stated by the Attorney General.
Those reasons  are linked  up with  the Court  taking up the
matter on  its own  motion. these  are inter-linked. In that
view of	 the matter  these are justiciable and indeed it may
be instructive	to consider  why this  practice grew  up  of
having the  consent .  This was explained in <a href="/doc/994171/" id="a_65">S. K. Sarkar v.
V. C. Misra</a>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 331 where Sarkaria, J. speaking
for the	 Court observed	 at page  339 of the report that the
whole object of prescribing these procedural modes of taking
cognizance under  <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_66">section 15</a> of the Act was to safeguard the
valuable time  of the  High Court or the Supreme Court being
wasted	by   frivolous	complaints  of	contempt  of  court.
Frequent use  of this  suo motu	 power	on  the	 information
furnished by  an  incompetent  petition,  may  render  these
procedural safeguards provided in subsection (2), otiose. In
such cases,  the High  Court may be well advised to avail of
the advice  and assistance  of the  Advocate-General  before
initiating  proceedings.   In  this   connection  the  Court
referred to  the observations  of Sanyal Committee appointed
to examine this question where it was observed: "In the case
of criminal  contempt, not  being contempt  committed in the
face of	 the court, we are of the opinion that would lighten
the burden of the court, without in any way interfering with
the sanctity  of the administration of justice, if action is
taken on  a motion  by some  other agency.  Such a course of
action would give

considerable assurance	to the	individual charged  and	 the
public at  large. Indeed, some High Courts have already made
rules for  the association  of the  Advocate-General in some
categories of  cases at	 least .  . .  " It was the practice
that except  where the	Court feels  inclined to take action
suo motu  parties were entitled to move only by the consent.
If no  justiciable reason  was given  in an appropriate case
and such  consent was  refused can  it be said that it would
not be proper for the Court to investigate the same?
</p><p id="p_39">     The  question   of	 contempt   of	court  came  up	 for
consideration in the case of <a href="/doc/362688/" id="a_67">C. K. Daphtary and others v. O.
P. Gupta  and others</a>, [1971]  Suppl. S.C.R. 76. In that case
a petition  under <a href="/doc/927019/" id="a_68">Article  129</a> of the Constitution was filed
by Shri	 C.K. Daphtary and three other advocates bringing to
the notice  of this  Court alleged contempt committed by the
respondents. There this Court held that under <a href="/doc/927019/" id="a_69">Article 129</a> of
the Constitution  this Court  had the  power to	 punish	 for
contempt  of  itself  and  under  <a href="/doc/827301/" id="a_70">Article  143(2)</a>  it  could
investigate any	 such contempt.	 This Court  reiterated that
the Constitution made this Court the guardian of fundamental
rights. This  Court further held that under the existing law
of contempt of court any publication which was calculated to
interfere  with	  the  due   course  of	 justice  or  proper
administration of  law would  amount to contempt of court. A
scurrilous attack  on a	 judge, in  respect of a judgment or
past conduct  has in  our country  the inevitable  effect of
undermining the	 confidence of	the public in the Judiciary;
and  if	 confidence  in	 Judiciary  goes  administration  of
justice definitely  suffers. In	 that case  a  pamphlet	 was
alleged to  have contained  statements amounting to contempt
of the	Court. As  the Attorney	 General did not move in the
matter, the President of the Supreme Court Bar and the other
petitioners chose  to bring  the matter to the notice of the
Court. It  was alleged that the said President and the other
members of  the Bar  have no  locus standi.  This Court held
that the  Court could issue a notice suo motu. The President
of  the	  Supreme  Court  Bar  and  other  petitioners	were
perfectly entitled  to bring  to the notice of the Court any
contempt of the Court. The first respondent referred to Lord
Shawcross   Committee's	   recommendation   in	 U.K.	that
"proceedings should  be instituted  only  if  the  Attorney-
General in  his discretion  considers them  necessary." This
was only a recommendation made in the light of circumstances
prevailing in  England. But  that is  not the  law in India,
this Court  reiterated. It has to be borne that decision was
rendered on  19th March,  1971 and  the present Act in India
was passed  on 24th  December, 1971. Therefore that decision
cannot	be   of	 any  assistance.  We  have  noticed  Sanyal
Committee's recommendations  in India as to why the Attorney
General should be associated with it, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">584</span>
     thereafter in  U.K.  there	 was  report  of  Phillimore
Committee in  1974. In	India  the  reason  for	 having	 the
consent of  the Attorney  General was examined and explained
by Sanyal Committee Report as noticed before.
</p><p id="p_40">     Our attention  was drawn  by Shri Ganguly to a decision
of the	 Allahabad  High Court	in <a href="/doc/1043410/" id="a_71">G.N.	 Verma v.  Hargovind
Dayal  and  others</a>,  A.I.R.  1975  Allahabad  52  where	 the
Division Bench	reiterated that	 Rules which provide for the
manner in  which proceedings for Contempt of Court should be
taken continue	to apply  even after  the enactment  of	 the
<a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_72">Contempt of  Courts Act</a>, 1971. Therefore cognizance could be
taken suo  motu and information contained in the application
by a  private individual  could	 be  utilised.	As  we	have
mentioned hereinbefore indubitably cognizance could be taken
suo motu  by the  Court but  members of the public have also
the right  to move  the Court. That right of bringing to the
notice of  the Court  is dependent  upon consent being given
either by  the Attorney General or the Solicitor General and
if that	 consent is  withheld without  reasons or L) without
consideration of  that right  granted to  any  other  person
under <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_73">section 15</a> of the Act that could be investigated on an
application made to the Court.
</p><p id="p_41">     It was  contended that neither the Attorney General nor
the Solicitor  General were  proper  or	 necessary  parties.
Reliance was  placed on	 <a href="/doc/567203/" id="a_74">B. K.	Kar v. The Chief Justice</a> and
his Companion Judges of the Orissa High Court and others,
[1962] 1  S.C.R. 319.  In that case under an order passed by
the appellant,	a Magistrate,  one was	put in possession of
some property on October 14, 1955. In revision the order was
set aside  by the  High Court  on August  27, 1957  and	 the
opposite party	S  applied  on	November  20,  1957  to	 the
appellant for  redelivery of possession. applied to the High
Court for a review of its previous order and on November 25,
1957, the  application was  admitted and an interim stay was
granted of  the proceedings before the appellant. A telegram
addressed to  a pleader,  not the  counsel for	G, was filed
along with  the application. The appellant refused to act on
this application  and telegram	and on November 27, 1957, he
allowed the  application of  S for  restitution. On November
28, 1957, a copy of the order of the High Court was received
and thereupon  the writ for redelivery of possession was not
issued. The  High Court convicted the appellant for contempt
of court  for passing  the order for restitution on November
27, when  the High  Court had  stayed the  proceedings.	 The
appellant appealed  to this  Court and	impleaded the  Chief
Justice and  Judges of	the High  Court as respondents. This
Court held that the appellant was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">585</span>
not guilty  of contempt	 of court. It further held that in a
contempt matter	 the Chief  Justice and	 Judges of  the High
Court should  not be  A made parties and the title of such a
proceeding should  be "In  re .....  the alleged contemnor".
Mudholkar, J. speaking for the Court observed at page 321 of
the report  that the  decision of Judges given in a contempt
matter is  like any other decision of those Judges, that is,
in matters  which come	up  before  them  by  way  of  suit,
petition, appeal  or reference.	 Since	that  was  the	real
position, this	Court observed that there was no warrant for
the practice  which was	 in vogue  in India there, and which
had been  in vogue  for over  a century, of making the Chief
Justice and Judges parties to an appeal against the decision
of a  High Court in a contempt matter. The said observations
were sought  to be  relied in  aid of  the proposition	that
where the  decision of the Attorney General or the Solicitor
General was  involved, they  were not  necessary  or  proper
parties. Reliance  on this  decision  for  this	 purpose  is
entirely misconceived.	Where an appeal comes to this Court,
which is  a judicial  decision, the  Judges who rendered the
decision are  not necessary parties. There is no lis between
a suitor  and a	 judge in  a judicial  adjudication. But the
position  is   entirely	 different  where  there  is  suitor
claiming the  exercise of  a statutory	right in  his favour
which he  alleges is  hampered by an official act of a named
official in  the Act.  In respect  of justiciability of that
act of the official there is a lis and if that lis is inter-
linked with  the proceeding  for contempt,  there is warrant
for making  him party  in that proceeding though the prayers
and the notice must be issued differently.
</p><p id="p_42">     As mentioned hereinbefore in the case of S.C. Sarkar v.
V.C. Misra  (supra) this Court had observed that it may well
be advices  to avail  of the  advised and  assistance of the
Advocate General before initiating proceedings. Shri Ganguly
appearing for the Solicitor General sought to urge before us
that advice  and assistance  could not	be  compelled  by  a
suitor. This  cannot be agreed to. The statute gives a right
to a  suitor to	 move the  Court in one of the contingencies
for contempt  or bring	to  the	 notice	 of  the  Court	 the
contempt with  the advice  and assistance  of  the  Attorney
General or  the Solicitor  General. If	such  right  is	 not
considered  on	 relevant  materials  then  that  action  is
justiciable in an appropriate proceeding for contempt.
</p><p id="p_43">     Reference may  be made  to the case of Attorney General
v. Times  Newspapers Ltd.,  [ 1973]  3 All  E.R. 54. In that
case a	drug company  began to-	 make and sell in the United
Kingdom a  sedative which  contained the  drug	thalidomide.
Lord Morris  observed in  that case  that  the	purpose	 and
existence of courts of law is to preserve freedom
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">586</span>
within	the  law  for  all  well  disposed  members  of	 the
community and  anything which  hampers the administration of
law should  be prevented  but it  does not mean that if some
conduct ought  to be  stigmatised as being contempt of court
it could  receive absolution  and be  regarded as legitimate
because it  had been  inspired by  a desire to bring about a
relief of  some	 distress  which  was  a  matter  of  public
sympathy and concern. Dealing with this aspect Lord Cross of
Chelsea has  observed that  'contempt  of  court'  means  an
interference with  the administration  of justice  and it is
unfortunate that  the offence should continue to be known by
a name which suggests to the modern mind that its essence is
a supposed affront to the dignity of the court. 'Justice' he
said  is   an  ambiguous   word.  When	 we  speak   of	 the
administration of  justice we mean the administration of the
law, but  often the  answer which  the	law  gives  to	some
problem is  regarded by	 many people  as unjust.  Lord Cross
further observed  that there  must be  no prejudging  of the
issues in  a case  is one  thing. To say that no one must in
any  circumstances   exert  any	  pressure  on	a  party  to
litigation  to	 induce	 him  to  act  in  relation  to	 the
litigation in  a way  in which he would otherwise not choose
to act	is another and a very different thing. Lord Cross at
page 87 of the report observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	  "In conclusion  I would  say that  I disagree with
	  the  views   expressed  by  Lord  Denning  MR	 and
	  Phillimore LJ	 (1973 1  All E.R.  815) as  to	 the
	  'role' of the Attorney-General in cases of alleged
	  contempt of court. If he takes them up he does not
	  do so	 as a  Minister of  the Crown  'putting	 the
	  authority of	the Crown  behind the complaint'-but
	  as 'amicus  curiae' bringing	to the notice of the
	  court some  matter of	 which he considers that the
	  court shall  be informed  in the  interests of the
	  administration of  justice. It  is, I	 think, most
	  desirable that  in civil  as well  as in  criminal
	  cases anyone	who thinks  that a criminal contempt
	  of court  has been  or is  about to  be  committed
	  should, if  possible, place  the facts  before the
	  Attorney-General for	him to	consider whether  or
	  not those  facts appear  to disclose a contempt of
	  court	 of   sufficient  gravity   to	warrant	 his
	  bringing the matter to the notice of the court. Of
	  course, in  some cases  it may  be essential if an
	  application is to be made at all for it to be made
	  promptly and	there may  be no time for the person
	  affected by  the 'contempt'  to put  the  .  facts
	  before the  attorney before  moving himself. Again
	  the fact that the attorney declines to take up the
	  case will not prevent the complainant from seeking
	  to persuade the court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">587</span>
	  that notwithstanding	the refusal  of the attorney
	  to act  the matter  complained  of  does  in	fact
	  constitute a	contempt of  which the	court should
	  take notice.	Yet, again,  of course, there may be
	  cases where  a serious  contempt appears  to	have
	  been committed  but for one reason or another none
	  of the parties affected by it wishes any action to
	  be taken  in respect	of it.	In such cases if the
	  facts come  to the  knowledge of the attorney from
	  some other  source he will naturally himself bring
	  the matter to the attention of the court.</blockquote>
<p id="p_44">     Lord Cross	 has noticed  in  his  speech  that  if	 the
Attorney General  declines to  take up the case, it will not
prevent the  complainant from  seeking to persuade the Court
that notwithstanding refusal of the Attorney General to act,
the  matter  complained	 of  does,  in	fact,  constitute  a
contempt of  which the	Court should  take notice.  But that
does not  derogate the	rights of the individual to move the
Court. See  the observations of Lord Reid. In Indian Express
Newspapers (Bombay)  Pvt. Ltd.	and Ors.  etc. v.  Union  of
India and  others, [ 1985] 1 S.C.C. 641, the observations of
the aforesaid decision in Thalidomide case were relied upon.
</p><p id="p_45">     Reliance was  also placed	on the	observations of	 the
House of  Lords in  Gouriot  and  others  v.  H.M.  Attorney
General,  [1978]   Appeal  Cases  435.	There  it  held	 the
initiation  of	litigation  and	 the  determination  of	 the
question whether  it is	 a  proper  case  for  the  Attorney
General to  proceed in,	 is a  matter  entirely	 beyond	 the
jurisdiction of	 that or  any other  Court. It is a question
which the  law	has  made,  to	reside	exclusively  in	 the
Attorney General.  The House  of  Lords	 was  reversing	 the
decision of  the Court	of Appeal  in the celebrated case of
Gouriet v. Union of Post office Workers, [19781 Appeal Cases
435 where  the House  of Lords could find no legal basis for
the lower courts' attempt to outflank the Attorney General's
refusal to  grant his  fiat to	Mr. Gouriet. In the Court of
Appeal, all  the three	Judges,	 Denning  M.R.,	 Lawton	 and
Ormrod LJ,  upheld the plaintiff's claim for declaration and
interim injunction  even in  the  absence  of  fiat  by	 the
Attorney General.  The statutory  provisions  were  entirely
different. It  may be  in  the	context	 that  the  Attorney
General	 had   to  move	 in  his  discretion  which  is	 not
justiciable. But  in our  opinion it is justiciable. English
decisions are  of persuasive  value and	 we would  prefer to
rest out  decision on  the observations	 of Lord  Denning in
Gouriet v.  Union of  Post office  Workers &amp;  Ors., [1977] 1
Q.B. 729  at 752  to 763  though made in connection with the
Attorney General's discretion in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">588</span>
giving consent	in instituting	a suit	for injunction	by a
member of  the public.	In U.K.	 the  position	of  Attorney
General as  a member  of the Cabinet is different. There the
contempt  of  Court  is	 regulated  by	different  statutory
provisions which  were examined	 by  a	Committee  known  as
Phillimore Committee  Report. See  also the  observations of
Sikri J.  as the  Chief Justice then was, in C.K. Daphtary &amp;
Ors. (supra)  at page 109 of the report.
</p><p id="p_46">     Our attention  was drawn  to the decision of the Andhra

ratio stated  in view of the terms of <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_75">section 15</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_49">     RANGANATHAN, J.  I agree  with  the  conclusion  of  my
learned	 brother   that	 no  case  has	been  made  but	 for
initiating contempt  proceedings against  respondent No.  1.
The principles	applicable to,	and  the  case	law  on	 the
subject have  been discussed  by him  at length and I do not
have much  to  add.  The  impugned  comments  were  made  by
respondent No.	1 in the course of his key note address at a
seminar on 'Accountability of the Legislature, Executive and
Judiciary under	 the Constitution  of India'  organised by a
Bar Council.  Though, in  view of  the position	 held by the
speaker, the  contents of  the speech,	and. in	 particular,
some 'savoury' passages therefrom have been highlighted in a
section of the Press, the speech was made before an audience
comprising essentially	of lawyers,  jurists and judges. The
speech represented  primarily an  exercise by the speaker to
evaluate  the	roles  of  the	executive,  legislature	 and
judiciary in  this country since its independence and to put
forward the theory that, like the executive and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">589</span>
the legislature,  the judiciary	 must also be accountable to
the people.  The petitioner  contends that there are certain
passages in  the speech	 which	seem  to  attribute  a	sub-
conscious partiality,  bias or	predeliction  in  judges  in
disposing of  various matters  before them  and	 that  these
comments fall within the scope of the decision of this Court
in the	case of	 <a href="/doc/625529/" id="a_77">E.M. Sankaran Namboodiripad v. T. Narayanan
Nambiar</a>, [1970] 2 S.C.C. 325. Barrie &amp; Lowe in their "Law of
Contempt," (Second  Edition, PP. 233, 240-1) and Arlidge and
Eady in	 their "Law of Contempt" (Second Edition, PP. 162-3,
</p><p id="p_50">168), on  a review  of the  judicial decisions on the topic,
seem to	 suggest that even allegation of partiality and bias
on the	part of judges may not amount to contempt so long as
it is  free from  the taint of 'scurrilous abuse' and can be
considered to  be 'fair	 comment'. The	observations made by
the Lord  Justice Phillimore  Committee on Contempt of Court
in 1974 on this type of contempt (Paras 160 &amp; 161) also make
interesting  reading.	I  do  not,  however,  think  it  is
necessary to  pursue this  aspect  of  the  matter.  In	 the
present case,  it is  true, as	pointed out  by	 my  learned
brother, there are passages in the speech which, torn out of
context, may  be liable to be misunderstood. But reading the
speech as a whole and bearing in mind the select audience to
which it  was addressed,  I agree with my learned brother no
contempt has  been committed. I think that we should accept,
at its	face value,  the affidavit  of respondent No. 1 that
the speech  was only  a theoretical dissertation and that he
intended no disrespect to this Court or its functioning.
</p><p id="p_51">     2. The  second aspect  of the  case on  which arguments
have been  addressed before us relate to the procedure to be
followed  in  such  matters.  As  this	aspect	raises	some
important issues,  I would  like to  state my  views thereon
separately.
</p><p id="p_52">     3. The  criminal miscellaneous  petition filed  by	 the
petitioner purports  to be  only "information"	u/s 15(1)(a)
and (b) of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_78">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1971 ('the Act'). The
petitioner seeks  to inform  this Court that he came to know
from a report in 'Hindustan Times' that respondent No. 1, in
the course  of a  speech delivered  by him  at Hyderabad  on
November 28, 1987, had made certain statements which, in the
petitioner's opinion,  rendered him  liable to	be proceeded
against for  contempt of  court. Appending what is stated to
be a  full text	 of the	 said speech  as  published  in	 the
'Newstime", the	 petitioner prays  that this Court should be
pleased to  "initiate contempt of court proceedings suo motu
under<a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_79"> S.  15(1)</a> of the Contempt of Court Act, 1971 read with
rule 3(a)  of the  Supreme Court  (Contempt of Court) Rules,
1975". Though the prayer is vague as to the person
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">590</span>
against whom  the  proceedings	are  to	 be  initiated,	 the
allegations in	the petition  leave  no	 doubt	that  it  is
respondent No.	l, and	only he,  who, even according to the
petitioner, is	to be  charged with  contempt. Nevertheless,
the petitioner	has added  three  more	respondents  to	 the
Criminal Miscellaneous Petition, namely the Attorney General
of India (by name), the Solicitor General of India (by name)
and Sri	 13 Ramoji Rao, Editor of "Newstime". In my opinion,
this petition  raises certain question of general importance
which need  to	be  discussed  so  as  to  evolve  a  proper
procedure, at  least for future guidance in these matters. I
proceed to discuss these aspects.
</p><p id="p_53">     4. <a href="/doc/927019/" id="a_80">Article	 129</a> of	 the Constitution  declares that the
Supreme Court  shall be	 a court of record and that it shall
have all  the powers  of such a court including the power to
punish for  contempt of	 itself. However,  the powers of the
Supreme Court  and High	 Court	in  this  regard  have	been
recently classified  in the  <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_81">Contempt of  Courts Act</a>,  1971.
<a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_82">This Act</a>  defines "contempt of court" and classifies it into
two categories,	 "civil contempt"  and "criminal  contempt".
These definitions  need not be set out here, particularly as
the petitioner	has filed a 'criminal miscellaneous petition
and  it	 is  quite  clear  that	 what  he  seeks  to  charge
respondent No.	1 with	is "criminal  contempt". <a href="/doc/576566/" id="a_83">Section  14</a>
deals with  contempt in the face of the court and we are not
concerned with	it here.  <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_84">Section 15</a>  specifies how criminal

<p id="p_55">     6. A  conjoint perusal  of the  Act and  rules makes it
clear that,  so far  as this  Court is concerned, action for
contempt may  be taken	by the Court on its own motion or on
the motion of the Attorney General (or Solicitor General) or
of any other person with his consent in writing. there is no
difficulty where the court or the Attorney-General choose to
move in	 the matter. But when this is not done and a private
person desires	that such  action should  be taken,  one  of
three courses  is open	to him. He may place the information
in his	possession before the Court and request the Court to
take action:  (vide <a href="/doc/362688/" id="a_88">C.K.  Daphtary  v.	O.P.  Gupta</a>,  [1971]
Suppl. S.C.R.  76 and <a href="/doc/994171/" id="a_89">Sarkar v. Misra</a>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 331);
he may place the information before the Attorney
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">593</span>
General and  request him to take action; or he may place the
information before  the Attorney  General and request him to
permit him  to move  the Court.	 In the	 present  case,	 the
petitioner alleges  that he  has failed	 in the	 latter	 two
courses-this will be considered a little later-and has moved
this "petition" praying that this Court should take suo motu
action. The  "petition" at  this stage,	 constitutes nothing
more than  a mode  of laying the relevant information before
the Court  for such  action as the Court may deem fit and no
proceedings  can   commence  until   and  unless  the  Court
considers the  information before it and decides to initiate
proceedings. Rules 3 and 4 of the Supreme Court (Contempt of
Court)	Rules  also  envisage  a  petition  only  where	 the
Attorney General  or any  other	 person,  with	his  written
consent, moves	the Court.  Rule 5  is	clear  that  only  a
petition moved	under rule  3(b) and  (c) is  to  be  posted
before the  Court for  preliminary hearing.  The form  of  a
criminal miscellaneous petition styling the informant as the
petitioner and	certain	 other	persons	 as  respondents  is
inappropriate for  merely lodging  the relevant	 information
before the  Court under	 rule 3(a).  It would  seem that the
proper title  of such a proceeding should be " In re .. (the
alleged contemner)" (see: <a href="/doc/567203/" id="a_90">Kar v. Chief Justice</a>, [1962] 1 SCR
320 though  that decision related to an appeal from an order
of conviction  for contempt  by the High Court). The form in
which this  request has	 to be sought and considered in such
cases has  also been touched upon by the Delhi High Court in
<a href="/doc/1264248/" id="a_91">Anil Kumar  Gupta v.  K. Subba	Rao, ILR</a>  1974 Delhi 1. This
case, at  the outset,  pointed out  that the information had
been erroneously  numbered by  the office  of the  Court  as
Criminal original  No. 51  of 1978  and concluded  with	 the
following observations:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">	  "The office  is to take note that in future if any

<p id="p_56">     I think  that the	direction given	 by the	 Delhi	High
Court sets out
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">594</span>
the proper  procedure in  such cases  and  may	be  adopted,
atleast in  future, as a practice direction or as a rule, by
this Court and other High Courts. However, a petition having
been  filed   and  similar  petitions  having  perhaps	been
entertained earlier in several courts, I do not suggest that
this petition should be dismissed on this ground.
</p><p id="p_57">     7. In  this case,	apart from filing his information in
the form  of a	miscellaneous petition,	 the petitioner	 has
added as  respondents to  the petition	not only the alleged
contemner but three more persons. He says that he approached
the Attorney  General of  India and the Solicitor General of
India for  their written  consent to  enable him  to file  a
petition under	<a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_95">Section 15(1)</a>  read with  rule 3(c) but that
they have  refused to  exercise the  jurisdiction vested  in
them by	 law and  that, therefore, "they have been impleaded
as parties  in the  present proceedings (as necessary and/or
proper parties) in order that they may get an opportunity to
justify the stand they have taken in the matter flowing from
their  refusal	 to  exercise	jurisdiction."	So   far  as
respondent No.	4, is  concerned, the  only reason given for
impleading him	is that	 the full  text	 of  the  speech  of
respondent No.	1 has come out in the newspaper published by
him and	 placed before	the court  and	that  he  was  being
impleaded only	to prove  the authenticity of the speech, in
the event of possible disclaimer of the respondent No. 1. In
other words,  respondent No.  4 is  only a  possible witness
through whom  he proposes  to prove  the authenticity of the
speech which  contains the  words of alleged contempt. In my
opinion this cannot be done. Assuming that a petition is the
proper form of approach to the court under rule 3(a), I have
indicated earlier  the proper  title to	 such a petition. It
will have  no respondents  and it  will be  for the court to
issue notice  to persons  against whom	a case	for contempt
needs examination.  Viewed as  a petition  under rule  3(c),
rule 4	envisages only	that the petition should contain the
name,  description   and   place   of	residence   of	 the
petitioner(s)  and   the  persons   charged.  It   does	 not
contemplate any other person being made a party to it. Under
rule 6 the notice to the person charged is to be in the form
appended to  the rules and the form of notice not only makes
it clear that it is to be addressed only to a person charged
with contempt  of court but also contains certain directions
appropriate only to such a person. This is naturally so, for
it is  obvious that  the only persons who can be respondents
in such	 a petition  are the  persons who  are charged	with
criminal  contempt.  The  petition,  as	 filed	here,  is  a
petition for  initiating proceedings  for contempt  of court
only against  respondent No.  1. Even  if the petitioner has
any other  cause  of  action  against  other  persons,	such
persons are neither necessary nor even proper parties to the
petition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">595</span>
<p id="p_58">This is	 especially so	because such cause of action is of a
purely civil  nature. At best the petitioner can say that he
is entitled  to a  writ of  mandamus directing	the Attorney
General and  Solicitor General	to discharge their statutory
obligation in  case  they  fail	 to  do	 so  or	 a  writ  of
certiorari to  quash their  decision in	 case they  withhold
unreasonably  their  consent  to  the  petitioner  filing  a
petition. But  this is	a remedy  to be sought independently
against these persons by a separate writ petition. He cannot
seek  to   get	relief	against	 the  Attorney	General	 and
Solicitor General  by  a  petition  mixing-up  his  criminal
charge against	respondent No.	1 and  his civil  grievances
against the  Attorney General  and Solicitor  General. It is
true that  on the  terms of  <a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_96">Section 15(1)</a>  and rule 3(c), a
petition for  contempt will not be maintainable by a private
person without	the written  consent of the Attorney General
or the	Solicitor General.  But he  cannot seek	 to get over
this objection	to the maintainability of a petition without
such  consent  merely  by  the	device	of  adding  them  as
respondents to	the petition,  even if	he had added, in the
petition, a  prayer for	 some relief  against them.  But, in
this case,  even such a prayer is not there and no relief is
sought against	the Attorney  General or  Solicitor General.
This petition,	therefore, if  treated as  a petition  under
rule 3(c),  is not  maintainable for  want of consent by the
Attorney General  and the  Solicitor General  and has  to be
dismissed as  such. That  apart, as  I have  already pointed
out, the  inclusion of	respondents 2 to 4 as respondents to
the  petition  is  totally  unjustified	 and,  even  if	 the
petition is  to be  taken on  record as	 a  mere  laying  of
information under rule 3(a), the names of respondents 2 to 4
must be struck off from the array of parties. I would direct
accordingly.
</p><p id="p_59">     8.	 This	case  itself   illustrates   the   type	  of
difficulties which  can arise  by filing  such a  rolled  up
petition. Having  regard to  the nature	 of the	 allegations
against respondent  No. 1 and the form in which the petition
had been  presented, we were of opinion that the question as
to "what  action, if  any, need	 be taken"  by this Court on
such a petition called for consideration and we directed the
issue of  such a  notice by  our order	dated 10.2.1988. The
terms of  the order make it clear that we wanted to hear the
parties	 mentioned   in	 the  petition	and  the  Additional
Solicitor General  on the  above question. Some aspects that
arise  for   consideration  are:  whether  the	petition  is
properly framed;  what is  the relief,	if any,	 that can be
given to  the petitioner  against the alleged refusal of the
Attorney General  and Solicitor	 General to  give consent to
the petitioner	to file a contempt petition; and whether, in
case they  considered themselves disabled from acting on the
application, the  Additional Solicitor General can be called
upon to exercise the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">596</span>
function. We  needed assistance	 on  these  issues.  If	 the
Attorney A  General/Solicitor  General	had  not  been	made
parties, we  would have	 called upon them to assist us under
rule 10.  Since, however, they had been added as parties, we
directed notices  to issue  to them  "as to  what action, if
any, need  be taken on the petition." Unfortunately, we find
that a	notice was  issued not	only to the first respondent
named in  the petition	(the alleged  contemner) but also to
the other  "respondents" named	in the petition, in the form
prescribed under  the rules  containing recitals  which	 are
appropriate only  in the  case	of  a  person  charged	with
contempt of  court, though  a mention  was specifically made
that the  contempt charge was only against respondent No. 1.
The issue  of notices  in the  prescribed form	to the other
respondents was	 unjustified. This  type of difficulty arose
only because  the petition  joined, as	respondents, persons
who are	 totally  unnecessary  for  deciding  the  issue  of
contempt. There	 was no	 question of  any 'contempt'  notice
being issued  to the  Attorney General/Solicitor  General as
there was  not even  a suggestion  of  any  such  allegation
against them  and no  other  relief  had  also	been  sought
against them.  I think	that, in  the circumstances, notices
should not  have been  issued to  them in  the form in which
they were issued.
</p><p id="p_60">     9. I may next consider the question whether even if the
petitioner was particular about his right to file a petition
under rule  3(C), he  can  have	 any  recourse	against	 the
Attorney General  and the  Solicitor General  in  case	they
refuse their  consent or, as alleged in this case, refuse to
deal with the petitioner's application. One possible view is
that the discretion to be exercised by the Attorney General/
Solicitor General  is a	 quasi-judicial discretion  and that
its exercise is subject to judicial review by this court. In
this connection,  reference was made to the judgment of this
Court in  <a href="/doc/1890737/" id="a_97">Conscientious Group  v. Mohammed  Yunus and  ors.,
J.T</a>. 1987(2) 377. In that case, the petitioner had withdrawn
a contempt  petition filed by it as the Attorney General had
expressed his  inability to  exercise his  jurisdiction	 for
reasons stated	by  him.  Subsequently,	 the  petitioner  on
learning that  it could	 get the  consent of  the  Solicitor
General, sought to have the earlier order recalled. Bhagwati
C. J. Observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">	  " ..	we would make it clear that it would be open
	  to  the   petitioner	to  approach  the  Solicitor
	  General and to revive the petition after obtaining
	  the consent  of the  Solicitor General  under Rule
	  3(c).	 Since	this  remedy  is  available  to	 the
	  petitioner for reviving the petition for contempt,
	  we do	 not propose  to recall the order permitting
	  withdrawal of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">597</span>
	  the petition.	 The petition  can be revived by the
	  petitioner after  obtaining  the  consent  of	 the
	  Solicitor General.  We  may  point  out  that	 the
	  petitioner will  not be  without  remedy,  if	 the
	  Solicitor  General  refuses  his  consent  on	 any
	  irrelevant ground. "</blockquote>
<p id="p_61">     The matter	 was then  referred to the learned Solicitor
General who declined consent stating that it would not be in
public	interest   to  give  his  consent.  The	 court	then
considered  the	 reasons  given	 by  the  learned  Solicitor
General and came to the conclusion that the ground stated by
him for	 declining the	consent could  not  be	said  to  be
irrelevant in  the  eye	 of  the  law  or  characterised  as
arbitrary,  illegal   or  unreasonable.	  The  petition	 for
contempt was, threfore, dismissed. From these circumstances,
it is sought to be suggested that the action of the Attorney
General/Solicitor General  is subject  to judicial review by
this Court.
</p><p id="p_62">     10. In  my opinion this is not the necessary conclusion
that follows  from the	observations  extracted	 above.	 Our
attention has  been drawn  by Sri Ganguly, appearing for the
learned Solicitor  General, to the decision in Rajagopal Rao
v. Murtza  Mutjahdi, [1974]  1 Andhra  Law Times, 170 and <a href="/doc/734816/" id="a_98">N.
Venkataramarlappa v.  D.K. Naikar</a>, A.I.R. 1978 Kar. 57, that
the grant  or refusal  of consent  is  not  justiciable.  My
learned brother	 has not  accepted the	correctness of these
decisions on  the ground that the statute confers a duty and
discretion on  these law  officers  and	 that  their  action
cannot be  beyond judicial  review as no person can be above
law. I	am, however, inclined to think there is something to
be said	 in favour  of the view taken by the two High Courts
for two reasons.
</p><p id="p_63">     11. In  the  first	 place	the  role  of  the  Attorney
General/Solicitor General  is more akin to that of an amicus
curiae to  assist the  court  in  an  administrative  matter
rather	than   a  quasi-judicial   role	 determining  a	 lis
involving rights  of a	member of  the public  vis-a-vis  an
alleged contemner.  As pointed	out by	the Supreme Court in
S.C. Sarkar  v. V.C.  Misra, [1981]  2 S.C.R. 331, there are
difficulties in	 the Court  making frequent  use of  the suo
motu power  for punishing  persons guilty  of contempt.	 The
Attorney General  offers his aid and assistance in two ways.
On the one hand, he moves the Court for action when he comes
across cases where he thinks there is necessity to vindicate
the dignity  and reputation  of the  Court. On the other, he
helps in  screening complaints	from the public to safeguard
the valuable time of the Court The observations of Lord Reid
and Lord Cross in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">598</span>
Thalidomide case: A.G. v. Times Newspapers, [1972] A.C. 277,
of the House of Lords, in a different context, in Gouriet v.
Union of  Post office  Workers, [1978]	A.C. 435 and of Lord
Denning and  Lawton LJ,	 in the	 same case  in the  Court of
Appeal (1977-1	Q.B. 729)  bring  but  this  aspect  of	 the
Attorney General's functions.
</p><p id="p_64">     12. Secondly,  if we  analyse the types of action which
the  Attorney  General/Solicitor  General  may	take  on  an
application made to him, the position will be this. Firstly,
he may	grant permission  in which  case no further question
will arise.  I do  not think  it will  be open	to any other
person to  come to the court with a prayer that the Attorney
General/Solicitor General  ought not  to have  given his con
sent. For,  it would  always be	 open to  the Court, in case
they find  no reason  to initiate  action,  to	dismiss	 the
petition.  Secondly,   it  is  possible	 that  the  Attorney
General/Solicitor General  may not  be able to discharge his
statutory function  in a  particular case  for one reason or
other. This  was what happened in the case of Mohammed Yunus
cited earlier. In that case it was only the Attorney General
who was	 unable to  discharge his functions under <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_99">Section 15</a>
and the	 petitioner could  move the  Solicitor General,	 who
declined consent. But there might be cases in which both the
Attorney General  and the  Solicitor General  are not  in  a
position to  take a decision on the application made to them
by a  private party.  Thirdly, both of them may refuse their
consent. In  the latter	 two cases,  I am unable to see what
purpose would  be served  by the  Court spending its time to
find out  whether  the	Attorney  General/Solicitor  General
should have  given a  decison one way or the other. For, the
petitioner is  not without  remedy. It is open to him always
to place  the information in his possession before the Court
and request  the Court	to take	 action. (see, Lord Cross in
A.G.  v.  Times	 Newspaper,  [1974]  A.C.  277	at  p.	321.
Bhagwati, C.J.	could have  meant this when he said that, if
the  consent  of  the  Solicitor  General  was	withheld  on
irrelevant grounds, the petitioner was not without remedy.
</p><p id="p_65">     13. the  petitioner has  submitted	 that  the  Attorney
General	 and   Solicitor  General   acted  unreasonably	  in
declining to  act in  the present case. Though, as indicated
earlier, it  will not  be a fruitful exercise to review such
decision, particularly	when a	request for  suo motu action
under rule 3(a) has been made, the point having been raised,
I shall	 consider how  valid this  complaint  is.  What	 the
petitioner here	 did was that, instead of merely placing the
information with  him before  the Attorney General/Solicitor
General and  seeking their  consent to his filing a petition
before the Court, the petitioner wrote a letter contain-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">599</span>
<p id="p_66">ing a  lot of  other irrelevant	 matter. In  particular,  in
paragraph   7,	  he	suggested    that    the    Attorney
General/Solicitor General  might feel  embrassed  in  giving
consent for  the prosecution  as the  person  sought  to  be
charged happened  to be	 the Minister "who effectively hires
and fires  law	officers  and  for  all	 purposes  at  whose
pleasure they  hold their  office." He	also  expressed	 his
apprehensions about  the possible outcome of his request. In
other words,  the petitioner,  while purporting	 to seek the
consent	  of   the   Attorney	General/Solicitor   General,
simultaneously expressed  his lack  of confidence  in  their
judgment  and	their  ability	to  discharge  their  duties
objectively and	 impartially. It  is not surprising that, in
this situation,	 the  learned  Attorney	 General/  Solicitor
General decided	 not to	 exercise their	 statutory powers at
all one	 way or	 the other. The learned Attorney General has
placed before  us a  statement explaining  his stand  in the
matter. He  has pointed out that two occasions had arisen in
the past  when, for  compelling reasons,  he could  not deal
with an	 application for consent filed before him. So far as
the present case is concerned, he has stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">	  "The Attorney General has declined to exercise his
	  functions under  <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_100">Section 15</a> of the Contempt of the
	  Courts Act  in view  of the allegations of lack of
	  impartiality and  independence. These	 allegations
	  contain a  reflection of  bias and  foreclosure on
	  the part  of	the  Atorney  Genera.  The  Attorney
	  General declined  to investigate  the matter since
	  the allegation  of bias should normally disentitle
	  him from  proceeding further	with the matter. The
	  Attorney  General   has   followed   this   course
	  consistently."</blockquote>
<p id="p_67">     From the above narration, it is clear that the Attorney
General/ Solicitor  General acted  rightly and	in the	best
traditions of  their office  by declining  to deal  with the
petitioner's request  and leaving  it to  the petitioner  to
follow such  other course  as he  considered advisable.	 The
petitioner had	cast aspersions agaist both the Law officers
doubting their	ability act  objectively and thus stultified
by his own conduct this course indicated by the statute.
</p><p id="p_68">     14. The  last question  that remains to be touched upon
is whether, in a case where neither the Attorney General nor
the Solicitor General is in a position to consider a request
under <a href="/doc/1771730/" id="a_101">Section 15(1)(c)</a>, it is open to the petitioner to seek
the consent of some other law officer such as the Additional
Solicitor General.  Apart from the fact that, in the present
case, the  petitioner would  have  had	the  same  criticism
against the  Additional Solicitor  General as he had against
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">600</span>
Attorney General/Solicitor  General, the clear answer to the
question appears  to be	 that it  is not open to him to seek
such consent.  <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_102">Section 15</a>  is quite  clear that	 the written
consent of  only those	officers as  have been	specifically
authorised by  the  section  would  be	taken  note  of	 for
entertaining a	petition under	the section.  But this	does
not, in	 any way, deprive the petitioner of his remedy as he
can come  to Court,  as indeed	he has	done, requesting the
court to take suo motu action.
</p><p id="p_69">     15. For  purposes of  convenience,	 I  may	 sum  up  my
conclusions. They are:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">     (a) This  petition,  if  treated  as  one	filed  under
     <a href="/doc/618013/" id="a_103">Section 15(1)</a>  read c.  with rule 3(a) is not in proper
     form and,	if treated as one filed under rules 3(b) and
     3(c), is  not maintainable	 as it	is not	filed by the
     Attorney General/Solicitor	 General or  by	 any  person
     with his consent.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_53">     (b) In  either event  the petitioner  should  not	have
