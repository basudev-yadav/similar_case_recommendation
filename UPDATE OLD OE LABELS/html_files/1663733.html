ACT:
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_1">Punjab	Sales Tax Act</a> (Punj. 46 of 1948),<a href="/doc/1718351/" id="a_2"> s. 5(2)</a> (a)  (vi)-
Deduction  of  sale  price of  cotton  seeds  from  purchase
turnover it permissible.



HEADNOTE:
The respondent a dealer purchased unginned cotton and  after
ginning	 the cotton and removing the seeds sold	 the  ginned
cotton	to customers outside the State.	 The  respondent
paid  parchase tax on the purchase turnover. In	 respect  of
cotton seeds sold by it	   to	 registered    dealers,the
respondent claimed deduction from the parchase	turnover
under<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_3"> s.  5</a> (2) (a) (vi) of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_4">Punjab Sales Tax Act</a>,  1948.
But the assessing  authority did not allow  the	 deduction
holding that the goods sold viz., cottonseeds were not the
goods in respect of which purchase taxhad  been levied	as
the  unginned cotton underwent a manufacturing	process	 and
the  goods.  produced were different from  those  purchased.
The  respondent	 filed a writ petition in  the	High  Court,
which  was allowed and the State's Letters.   Patent  Appeal
was dismissed.	Allowing the State's appeal, this Court;
HELD : The respondent was not entitled to deduction under<a href="/doc/1718351/" id="a_5"> s.
5(2)</a> (a) (vi) of the Act in respect of cotton seeds sold by
it to registered dealers.
"Declared goods" in<a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_6"> s. 14</a> of the Central Sales Tax Act	1956
are  individually specified under separate  items.   "Cotton
ginned' or unginned" is, treated as a single commodity under
one  item  of declared goods.  It is.  evident	that  cotton
ginned or unginned being. treated as a single commodity	 and
as  a  single species of declared goods	 cannot	 be  subject
unders.	 15(a)	of  the	 <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_7">Central Sales	Tax  Act</a>  to  a	 tax
exceeding two per cent of the sale or purchase price thereof
or  at more than one state.  But so far as cotton seeds	 are
concerned  it cannot be held that the sale of  cotton  seeds
must be treated as a sale of 'declared goods for the purpose
of  is.	 15(a) or (b) of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_8">Central Sales  Tax	 Act</a>,  1956.
Cotton	in its unginned state contains cotton seeds, but  it
is  by a manufacturing process that the cotton and the	seed
are separated and it is not correct to say that the seed  so
separated is cotton itself or part of the cotton.  They	 are
two.   distinct	  commercial   goods   though	before	 the
manufacturing  process the seeds might have been a  part  of
the cotton itself. [853 <a href="/doc/213382/" id="a_9">E]

</p><p id="p_6">	       Civil Appeal No. 2518 of 1966
      The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Ramaswami,  J. In this case the respondent is a	 partnership
firm  carrying on the business of buying and selling  cotton
and  also of ginning and pressing cotton at  Bamala.   The
respondent  purchased unginned cotton and after ginning	 the
cotton	by a mechanical process and removing the seeds	sold
the ginned cotton to customers outside, the State.  For	 the
period	from  1st  April,  1961	 to  31st  March,  1962	 the
respondent  paid purchase tax on the purchase turnover.	  In
respect	 of cotton seeds sold by it to	registered  dealers,
the respondent claimed deduction from the purchase  turnover
under <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_10"> s. 5</a> (2) (a) (vi) of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_11">Punjab Sales Tax  Act</a>,	1948
(Act No. 46 of 1948).  But, the assessing authority did	 not
allow the deduction holding that the goods sold viz., cotton
seeds  were not the goods in respect of which  purchase	 tax
had  been levied.  In other words, the	assessing  authority
took  the stand that the uncotton underwent a  manufacturing
process	 and  the goods produced were different	 from  those
purchased.  So the respondent firm was assessed to pay a tax
of Rs. 16,452 by the order of the assessing authority dated
11th September, 1963.  The respondent firm thereafter  filed
a  writ petition No. 1917 of 1963 in the Punjab	 High  Court
for quashing the assessment.  The writ petition was  allowed
by the High Court which quashed the assessment and  directed
the assessing authority to redetermine the tax in the  light
of  its	 judgment.   In allowing the writ  petition  of	 the
respondent the High Court followed its previous decision  in
<a href="/doc/213382/" id="a_12">Patel  Cotton  Company	Private Ltd. v. State  of  Punjab  &amp;
Ors</a>.(1).  The appellants preferred a Letters  Patent  Appeal
which  was  dismissed.	The present appeal  is	brought	 by,
certificate from the judgment of the Punjab High Court dated
31st March, 1965.

</blockquote><p id="p_14">On  behalf of the appellants the argument was stressed	that
ginning	 process  was a manufacturing  process,	 and  ginned
cotton	 and   cotton  seeds   were   different	  commercial
commodities  and  the  respondent was not  entitled  to	 the
exemption  under<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_23"> s. 5</a> (2) (a) (vi) of the Act.	It was	said
that  unginned	cotton	was transformed	 into  two  distinct
commercial commodities and there was no substantial identity
between	 unginned cotton and ginned cotton or cotton  seeds.
It was argued that the ginning process required	 complicated
machinery  of  manufacture.   Reference	 was  made  in	this
connection to the mechanical aspect of the ginning  process
described in Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. 6:--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	       "Hand   separation  of  lint  and  seed	 was
	      replaced	rapidly use of saw-type gins in	 the
	      United  States  after the	 inventions  of	 Eli
	      Whitney  in 1794 and of Hokden Holmesin  1796.
	      Whitney's gin was improved upon by  Holmes.who
	      substituted   toothed  saws  for	the   hooked
	      cylinder	and flat metal ribs for the  slotted
	      bar used by Whitney.  The saws, metal ribs and
	      doffing brush in these early models persist in
	      modem  gins, with no basic change	 in  ginning
	      principle	 having	 be-en made,  although	some
	      modem  gins  substitute an air blast  for	 the
	      doffing brushes.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">	      853</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      Additional gin machinery has been developed to
	      keep pace with changes in harvesting practices
	      which  have resulted in a trend  from  careful
	      hand  picking  to, rougher hand and  machine
	      harvesting.  These developments include  seed-
	      cotton  driers,  seed-cotton  cleaners,	burr
	      extractors,   greenboll  traps  and   magnetic
	      devices  for removing metal.   Line  cleaners,
	      designed	to remove trash from lint  after  it
	      had been removed from the seed, were added  to
	      modem  gins  in  the  late  1940s	 and  1950s.
	      Improvement  in  grade, which  resulted  in  a
	      higher price for the lint, was, in some cases,
	      offset   by   the	  loss	 in   weight.	 Gin
	      installations  include presses for baling	 the
	      lint  and equipment for moving the seed  away
	      from  the gin stands.  While some of the	seed
	      is  saved	 for planting purposes, most  of  it
	      moves   directly	 to   an   oil	 mill	 for
	      processing"(1).
</blockquote><p id="p_15">In our opinion, the appellants are right in their contention
that  the ginning process is a manufacturing  process.	 But
the question presented for determination in the present case
is  somewhat  different	 viz.,	whether	 the  respondent  is
entitled to the exemption under<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_24"> s. 5</a> (2) (a) (vi) of the Act
in  the context and setting of the language of	<a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_25">sections  14</a>
and <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_26">15</a> of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.  "Declared goods"
in  <a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_27">section  14</a>	 of  the Central Sales	Tax  Act,  1956	 are
individually specified under separate items.  "Cotton ginned
or unginned" is treated as a single commodity under one item
of declared goods.  It is evident that cotton ginned or	 un-
ginned	being treated as a single commodity and as a  single
species of declared goods cannot be subject under s.- 15 (a)
of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_28">Central Sales Tax Act</a> to a tax exceeding two per cent
of  the sale or purchase price thereof or at more  than	 one
stage.	 But  so far as cotton seeds are  concerned,  it  is
difficult  to accept the contention that the sale of  cotton
seeds  must be treated as a sale of declared goods  for	 the
purpose	 of<a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_29"> s. 15</a> (a) or (b) of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_30">Central Sales  Tax	Act</a>,
1956.  It is true that cotton in its unginned state contains
cotton seeds.  But it is by a manufacturing process that the
cotton	and the seed are separated and it is not correct  to
say that the seeds so separated is cotton itself or part  of
the  cotton.  They are two distinct commercial goods  though
before the manufacturing process the seeds might have been a
part  of the cotton itself.  There is hence no	wan-ant	 for
the  contention	 that  cotton seed  is	not  different	from
cotton.	  It follows that the respondent is not entitled  to
deduct the sale price of the cotton seeds from the  purchase
turnover  under	<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_31"> s.  5</a>	(2) (a) (vi) of	 the  Act.   In	 our
opinion,  the assessing authority was right in holding	that
the  respondent was not entitled to deduction in respect  of
cotton	seeds  sold  by it to  registered  dealers.   It  is
conceded that the assessing authority had

<p id="p_16">already granted deduction under<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_32"> s. 5</a> (2) (a) (vi) so far  as
ginned cotton is concerned.
</p><p id="p_17">	  For these reasons we hold that the judgment of the
Punjab	High Court dated 31st March, 1965 in Letters  Patent
Appeal	No.  100 of 1965 should be set aside  and  the	writ
