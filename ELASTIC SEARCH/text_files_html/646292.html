HEADNOTE:
The  appellant	was prosecuted for  having  made  statements
dafamatory  to	the then Law Minister of the  Government  of
Maharashtra.   The  Government	decided	 to  prosecute	 the
appellant for an offence tinder <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_1">Section 500</a> of Indian  Penal
Code  on  the ground that the Law Minister  was	 defamed  in
respect	 of  his  conduct in the  discharge  of	 his  public
functions.   Sanction  was purported to have  been  accorded
under <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_2">section 199(4)(a)</a>.  Thereafter, the public  prosecutor
filed  a  complaint  in the court  of  the  Sessions  Judge.
Process	 was  issued  against the appellant  upon  the	said
complaint.   The appellant filed an application	 to  dismiss
the   complaint	 on  the  ground  that	the  court  had	  no
jurisdiction  to  entertain the	 complaint.   The  appellant
contended  that	 the  allegations  were	 made  against	Shri
Antulay	 in  relation to what he had done  in  his  personal
capacity  and  not  in	his capacity  as  a  Minister.	 The
appellant  challenged the jurisdiction of the court on	some
other	grounds,  also	challenging  the  validity  of	 the
sanction.   The Sessions Judge rejected the  contentions  of
the  appellant	and framed a charge  against  the  appellant
under  <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_3">section	500</a>  of	 the  Penal  Code.   The  appellant,
thereupon,  filed a revision application in the High  Court.
The  High Court without going into the merits held that	 the
revision  application  was  not	 maintainable  in  view	  of
provisions of <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_4">section 397(2)</a>.
Allowing the appeal by special leave,
HELD : 1. On a plain reading of <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_5">section 482</a> it would  follow
that nothing in the code which would include <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_6">section  397(2)</a>
shall  be deemed to limit or affect the inherent  powers  of
the  High Court.  However, it cannot be said that  the	said
bar is not to operate in the exercise of the inherent  power
at  all	 because it would be setting at naught	one  of	 the
limitation  imposed upon the exercise of revisional  powers.
A happy and harmonious solution would be to say that the bar
provided in <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_7">section 397(2)</a> operates only in, exercise of the
revisional power of the High Court meaning thereby that	 the
High Court will have no power of revision in relation to any
interlocutory  order.	The inherent power would  come	into
play  there  being no other provision in the  code  for	 the
redress of the grievance of the aggrieved party. in case the
impugned order brings about a situation which is an abuse of
the process of the court or for the purpose of securing	 the
ends of justice interference by the High Court is absolutely
necessary,  then  nothing contained in	<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_8">section	 397(2)</a>	 can
limit  of affect the exercise of the inherent power  by	 the
High  Court.  Such cases would be few and far between.	 The
High Court must exercise the inherent power very  sparingly.

bar  created  by <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_10">section 397(2)</a> will not  prevent  the	High

criminal   proceeding  as  early  as  possible	instead	  of

The  strict test for interpreting the. words  'Interlocutory
Order' cannot be applied while interpreting it as  appearing
in  <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_11">section 397(2)</a>.. The interpretation that what is  not  a
final  order  must  be an  interlocutory  order	 is  neither
warranted  nor	justified.  If it were so, it  would  render
almost	nugatory the revisional power of the Sessions  Court
or  High  Court conferred by <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_12">section 397(1)</a>.   Although	 the
words  occurring  in  a Particular  statute  are  plain	 and
unambiguous  they have to be interpreted in a 'manner  which
would  fit  in the context of the other	 provisions  of	 the
Statute	  and  bring  about  the  real	intention   of	 the
legislature. There may be an order passed during the  course
of a proceeding which may be not final but yet it may not be
interlocutory  order pure or simple.  Some kinds  of  orders
may  fall in between the two.  The bar of <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_13">section 397(2)</a>  is
not  meant  to	be attracted to such  kind  of	intermediate
orders.	  They may not be final orders for the	purposes  of
<a href="/doc/1446285/" id="a_14">Article 134</a> of the Constitution yet it would not be  correct
to  characterise  them as merely  interlocutory	 within	 the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_15">section 397(2)</a>. [756 F-H, 757 A--F, 759 <a href="/doc/1417015/" id="a_16">E]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
UNTWALIA  J.-This  is an appeal by special  leave  from	 the
order of the Bombay High Court rejecting the application  in
revision filed by the appellant under <a href="/doc/1632932/" id="a_21">section 397(1)</a> of	 the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 hereinafter to be  referred
to  as the 1973 Code or the new Code, on the ground that  it
was  not maintainable in view of the provision contained  in
subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_22">section 397</a>.	The High Court has not	gone
into its merits.
</p><p id="p_5">It  is not necessary to state the facts of the case  in	 any
detail for the disposal of. this appeal.  A bare skeleton of
them will suffice.  In a press conference held at New  Delhi
on  the 27th September, 1974 the appellant is said  to	have
made certain statements and handed over a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">751</span>
press	hand-out"  containing  allegedly   some	  defamatory
statements  concerning	Shri  A. R. Antulay,  the  then	 Law
Minister  of  the  Government  of  Maharashtra.	  The	said
statements  were published in various newspapers. The  State
Government decided to prosecute the appellant for an offence
under <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_23">section 500</a> of the Indian Penal Code as it was of	 the
view  that  the Law Minister was defamed in respect  of	 his
conduct in the discharge of his public functions.   Sanction
in accordance with <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_24">section 199</a> (4) (a) of the 1973 Code	 was
purported  to  have been accorded by the  State	 Government.
Thereupon  the	Public Prosecutor filed a complaint  in	 the
Court of the Sessions Judge, Greater Bombay.  Cognizance  of
the offence alleged to have been committed by the  appellant
was  taken by the Court of Sessions without the	 case  being
committed  to  it as permissible under	sub-section  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_25">section 199</a>.  Process was issued against the appellant	upon
the said complaint.
</p><p id="p_6">The  Chief  Secretary to the Government of  Maharashtra	 was
examined  on  the 17th February, 1975 as a  witness  in	 the
Sessions  Court	 to prove the sanction order  of  the  State
Government.   Thereafter  on tile 24th February,  1975	Shri
Madhu Limaye, the appellant, filed an application to dismiss
the   complaint	 on  the  ground  that	the  Court  had	  no
jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.  The stand taken on
behalf	of  the	 appellant was that  allegations  were	made
against Shri Antulay in relation to what he had done in	 his
personal capacity and not in his capacity of discharging his
functions as a Minister.  Chiefly on that ground and on some
others,	 the jurisdiction of the Court to proceed  with	 the
trial was challenged by the appellant.
</p><p id="p_7">The appellant raised three contentions in the Sessions Court
and  later in the High Court assailing the validity and	 the
legality of the trial in question. They are :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      (1)   That even assuming the allegations	made
	      against  Shri  Antulay were  defamatory,	they
	      were  not	 in respect of his  conduct  in	 the
	      discharge	 of his public functions  and  hence
	      the aggrieved person could file a complaint in
	      the Court of a competent Magistrate who  after
	      taking cognizance could try the case or commit
	      it to the Court of Sessions if so warranted in
	      law.   The  Court of Sessions could  not	take
	      cognizance  without the committal of the	case
	      to it.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      (2)   The sanction given was bad in as much as
	      it  was not given by the State Government	 but
	      was given by the Chief Secretary.
	      (3)   The Chief Secretary had not applied	 his
	      mind to the entire conspectus of the facts and
	      had given the sanction in a mechanical manner.
	      The sanction was bad on that account too.
</blockquote><p id="p_8">The Sessions Judge rejected all these contentions and framed
a  charge  against the appellant under <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_26">section	500</a>  of	 the
Penal Code.  The appellant, thereupon, challenged- the order
of  the Sessions Judge in the revision filed by him  in	 the
High Court.  As already 'stated, without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">752</span>
entering into the merits of any of the contentions raised by
the appellant, it upheld the preliminary objection as to the
maintainability	 of  the revision application.	 Hence	this
appeal.
</p><p id="p_9">The  point which falls for determination in this  appeal  is
squarely covered by a decision of this Court to which one of
us (Untwalia was a party in <a href="/doc/1546207/" id="a_27">Amar Nath and Others v. State of
Haryana	 &amp; Anr But</a> on a careful consideration of the  matter
and  on	 hearing  learned counsel for the  parties  in	this
appeal	we thought it advisable to enunciate  and  reiterate
the  view taken by two learned judges of this Court in	Amar
Nath's	case but in a somewhat modified and modulated  form.
In  Amar  Nath's case, as in this, the order  of  the  Trial
Court issuing process against the accused was challenged and
the  High Court was asked to quash the	criminal  proceeding
either	in exercise of its inherent power under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_28">section	 482</a>
of the 1973 Code corresponding to <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29">section 561A</a> of'<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30"> the	Code</a>
of Criminal Procedure, 1898-hereinafter called the 1898 Code
or  the	 old Code, or under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_31">section 397(1)</a> of the  new	Code
corresponding  to <a href="/doc/1552733/" id="a_32">section 435</a> of the old Code.	 Two  points
were decided in Amar Nath's case in the following terms :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      (1)   "While  we	fully  agree  with-the	view
	      taken  by	 the  learned  Judge  that  where  a
	      revision	to the High Court against the  order
	      of  the Subordinate Judge is expressly  barred
	      under  sub-s. (2) of<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_33"> s. 397</a> of the  1973	<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">Code
	      the</a> inherent powers contained in<a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_35"> s. 482</a>  would
	      not  be available to defeat the bar  contained
	      in<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_36"> s. 397(2)</a>."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      (2    The	 impugned order of  the	 Magistrate,
	      however, was not an interlocutory order.
</blockquote><p id="p_10">For  the  reasons  stated  hereinafter	we  think  that	 the
statement  of  the  law apropos point no.  1  is  not  quite
accurate  and  needs some modulation.  But we  are-going  to
reaffirm the decision of the Court on the second point.
Under  <a href="/doc/1552733/" id="a_37">section 435</a> of the 1898 Code the High Court  had	 the
power to "call for and examine the record of any  proceeding
before any inferior Criminal Court 'situate within the local
limits	of  its jurisdiction for the purpose  of  satisfying
itself	as to the correctness, legality or propriety of	 any
finding, sentence or order recorded or passed. and as to the
regularity  of any proceedings of such inferior Court",	 and
then to pass the necessary orders in accordance with the law
engrafted  in  any of the sections  following  <a href="/doc/1552733/" id="a_38">section	435</a>.
Apart  from the revisional power, the High  Court  possessed
and possesses the inherent powers to be exercised ex  debito
justitiae  to do the real and the substantial  'justice	 for
the administration of which alone Courts exist.	 In  express
language this power was recognized and saved in <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_39">section 561A</a>
of  the	 old Code.  Under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_40">section 397(1)</a> of the	 1973  Code,
revisional  power  has been conferred on the High  Court  in
terms  which are identical to those found in <a href="/doc/1552733/" id="a_41">section 435</a>  of
the 1898 Code.	Similar is the position apropos the inherent
powers of the High Court.  We may read the language
(1)  Criminal  Appeal  No. 124 of 1977 decided on  the	29th
July, 1977.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">753</span>
<p id="p_11">of  <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_42">section  482</a> (corresponding to <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_43">section 561A</a> of  the	 old
Code) of the, 1973 Code.  It says
	      "Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit
	      or  affect  the inherent powers  of  the	High
	      Court to make such orders as may be  necessary
	      to  give effect to any order under this  Code,
	      or  to  prevent abuse of the  process  of	 any
	      Court  or	 otherwise  to secure  the  ends  of
	      justice."
</p><p id="p_12">At  the	 outset the following principles may be	 noticed  in
relation  to the exercise of the inherent power of the	High
Court  which  have been followed ordinarily  and  generally,
almost invariably, barring a few exceptions :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      (1)   That the power is not to be resorted  to
	      if  there is a specific provision in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44"> the	Code</a>
	      for  the	redress	 of  the  grievance  of	 the
	      aggrieved party ;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      (2)   That   it  should  be   exercised	very
	      sparingly	 to prevent abuse of process of	 any
	      Court  or	 otherwise  to secure  the  ends  of
	      justice;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      (3)   That  it  should  not  be  exercised  as
	      against  the express bar of law  engrafted  in
	      any other provision<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_45"> of the Code</a>.
</blockquote><p id="p_13">In  most  of the cases decided during  several	decades	 the
inherent  power of the High Court has been invoked  for	 the
quashing  of  a	 criminal proceeding on one  ground  or	 the
other.	 Sometimes the revisional jurisdiction of  the	High
Court has also been resorted to for the same kind of  relief
by  challenging	 the  order  taking  cognizance	 or  issuing
processes  or framing charge on the grounds that  the  Court
had no jurisdiction to take cognizance and proceed with	 the
trial,	that the issuance of process was wholly	 illegal  or
void,  or that no charge could be framed as no	offence	 was
made out on the allegations made or the evidence adduced  in
Court.	In the background aforesaid we proceed to examine as
to  what is the correct position of law after the  introduc-
tion of a provision like sub section (2) of <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_46">section 397</a>	 in,
the 1973 Code.
</p><p id="p_14">As  pointed out in Amar Nath's case (supra) the	 purpose  of
putting	 a bar on the power of revision in relation  to	 any
interlocutory  order passed in an appeal, inquiry, trial  or
other  proceeding is to bring about expeditious disposal  of
the cases finally, More often than not, the revisional power
of  the	 High Court was resorted to in	relation  to  inter-
locutory   orders  delaying  the  final	 disposal   of	 the
proceedings.  The Legislature in its wisdom decided to check
this  delay by introducing sub-section (2), in <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_47">section	397</a>.
On  the one hand, a bar has been put in the way of the	High
Court  (as also of the Sessions Judge) for exercise  of	 the
revisional power in relation to any interlocutory order,  on
the  other, the power has been conferred in almost the	same
terms  as  it was in the 1898 Code.  On a plain	 reading  of
<a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_48">section	 482</a>, however, it would follow that nothing  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_49">	 the
Code</a>,  which  would include subsection (2)  of	<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_50">section	 397</a>
also,  "shall  be  deemed to limit or  affect  the  inherent
powers of the High Court".  But, if we were to say that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">754</span>
said  bar is not to operate in the exercise of the  inherent
power  at  all,	 it will be setting at	naught	one  of	 the
limitations  imposed  upon the exercise	 of  the  revisional
powers.	 In such a situation, what is-the harmonious way out
? In our opinion, a happy solution of this problem would  be
to  say that the bar provided in sub-section (2) of  <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_51">section
397</a> operates only in exercise of the revisional power of the
High Court, meaning thereby that the High Court will have no
power  of revision in relation to any  interlocutory  order.
Then  in  accordance  with  one	 of  the  other	  principles
enunciated  above, the inherent power will come	 into  play,
there  being no other provision in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_52"> the Code</a> for the  redress
of  the grievance of the aggrieved party.  But then, if	 the
order assailed is purely of an interlocutory character which
could  be corrected in exercise of the revisional  power  of
the  High  Court under the 1898 Code. the  High	 Court	will
refuse	to  exercise its inherent power.  But  in  case	 the
impugned order clearly brings about a situation which is  an
abuse  of  the process of the Court or for  the	 purpose  of
securing the ends of justice interference by the High  Court
is  absolutely necessary, then nothing contained in  <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_53">section
397(2)</a>	can  limit or affect the exercise  of  the  inherent
power  by the High Court.  But such cases would be  few	 and
far  between.	The High Court must  exercise  the  inherent
power	very  sparingly.   One	such  case  would   be	 the
desirability  of  the  quashing of,  a	criminal  proceeding
initiated   illegally,	vexatiously  or	 as  being   without
jurisdiction.	Take for example a case where a	 prosecution
is launched under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_54">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> without a
sanction.  then	 the trial of the accused  will	 be  without
jurisdiction  and  even after his acquittal a  second  trial
after proper sanction will not be barred on the doctrine  of
Autrefois   Acquit.   Even  assuming,  although	  we   shall
presently  show	 that it is not so, that in such a  case  an
order of the Court taking cognizance or issuing processes is
an interlocutory order. does it stand to reason to say	that
inherent  power	 of the High Court cannot be  exercised	 for
stopping  the  criminal	 proceeding as	early  as  possible,
instead	 of harassing the accused upto the end ? The  answer
is  obvious  that the bar will not operate  to	prevent	 the
abuse of the process of the Court and/or to secure, the ends
of justice.  The label of the petition filed by an aggrieved
party is immaterial.  The High Court can examine the  matter
in  an	appropriate  case under its  inherent  powers.	 The
present case undoubtedly falls for exercise of the power  of
the  High Court in accordance with <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_55">section 482</a> of  the	1973
Code.  even assuming. although not accepting, that  invoking
the revisional power of the High Court is impermissible.

<p id="p_16">	      ble,  desirable or expedient to lay  down	 any
	      inflexible   rule	 which	would	govern	 the
	      exercise	 of  this   inherent   jurisdiction.
	      However,	we may indicate some  categories  of
	      cases where the inherent jurisdiction can	 and
	      should   be   exercised	for   quashing	 the
	      proceedings.  There may be cases where it	 may
	      be  possible  for the High Court to  take	 the
	      view  that the institution or  continuance  of
	      criminal proceedings against an accused person
	      may amount to the abuse of the process of	 the
	      court  or	 that the quashing of  the  impugned
	      proceedings would secure the ends of  justice.
	      If  the criminal proceeding in question is  in
	      respect  of  an offence alleged to  have	been
	      committed	  by  an  accused  person   and	  it
	      manifestly  appears that there is a legal	 bar
	      against the institution or continuance of	 the
	      said  proceeding	the  High  Court  would	  be
	      justified	 in quashing the proceeding on	that
	      ground.	Absence	 of the	 requisite  sanction
	      may,  for instance, furnish cases	 under	this
	      category.	  Cases	 may also  arise  where	 the
	      allegations in the First Information Report or
	      the complaint, even if they are taken at their
	      face value and accepted in their entirety,  do
	      not  constitute the offence alleged;  in	such
	      cases  no	 question of  appreciating  evidence
	      arises;  it is a matter merely of	 looking  at
	      the complaint or the First Information  Report
	      to  decide  whether  the	offence	 alleged
	      is  disclosed or not.  In such cases it  would
	      be legitimate for the High Court to hold	that
	      it  would	 be manifestly unjust to  allow	 the
	      process  of  the criminal court to  be  issued
	      against the accused person.  A third  category
	      of cases in which the inherent jurisdiction of
	      the High Court can be successfully invoked may
	      also  arise.   In	 cases	falling	 under	this
	      category	the  allegations  made	against	 the
	      accused	person	do  constitute	an   offence
	      alleged but there is either no legal  evidence
	      adduced  in  support of the case	or  evidence
	      adduced clearly or manifestly fails to.  prove
	      the  charge'.  In dealing with this  class  of
	      cases  it	 is important to bear in-  mind	 the
	      distinction  between a case where there is  no
	      legal  evidence  or where	 there	is  evidence
	      which  is manifestly and clearly	inconsistent
	      with the accusation made and cases where there
	      is  legal evidence which on  its	appreciation
	      may  not support the accusation  in  question.
	      In exercising its jurisdiction under<a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_58"> s.  561-A</a>
	      the  High	 Court	would  not  embark  upon  an
	      enquiry as to whether the evidence in question
	      is  reliable or not.  That is the function  of
	      the trial magistrate, and ordinarily it  would
	      not  be open to any party to invoke  the	High
	      Court's inherent Jurisdiction and contend that
	      on  a reasonable appreciation of the  evidence
	      the accusation made against the accused  would
	      not be sustained."

</p><p id="p_18">Ordinarily  and	 generally  the	 expression   'interlocutory

edition of Halsbury's Laws of England at page 742,  however,
it has been stated in para 1606
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">756</span>
	      "....... a judgment or order may be final	 for

	      words
	      "An  order which does not deal with the  final
	      rights of the parties, but either (1) is	made
	      before  judgment, and gives no final  decision

</p><p id="p_21">In S. Kuppuswami Rao v. The King(1) Kania C. J.,  delivering
the  judgment  of  the Court has referred  to  some  English
decisions  at pages 185 and 186.  Lord Esher M. R.  said  in
Salaman v. Warner(2) "If their decision, whichever way it is
given, will, if it stands, finally dispose of the matter  in
dispute, I think that for the purposes of these rules it  is
final.	 On the other hand, if their decision, if  given  in
one way, will finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but,
if given in the other, will allow the action to go on,	then
I  think  it is not final, but interlocutory." To  the	same
effect are the observations quoted from the judgments of Fry
L.  J.	and Lopes L. J. Applying the said  test,  almost  on
facts  similar to the ones in the instant case, it was	held
that the order in revision passed by the High Court (at that
time, there was no bar like <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_61">section 397</a> (2) was not a "final
order"	within	the  meaning  of  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_62">section  205</a>	(1)  of	 the
Government of India Act, 1935.	It is to be noticed that the
test  laid  down therein was that if the  objection  of	 the
accused	 succeeded, the proceeding could have ended but	 not
vice versa.  The order can be said to be a final order	only
if, in either event, the action will be determined.  In	 our
opinion	  if  this  strict  test  were	to  be	applied	  in
interpreting  the words 'interlocutory order"  occurring  in
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_63">section	 397(2)</a>,  then	the order taking  cognizance  of  an
offence	 by  a	Court, whether it is so	 done  illegally  or
without	 jurisdiction, will not be a final order  and  hence
will  be  an interlocutory one.	 Even so, as  we  have	said
above,	the inherent power of the High Court can be  invoked
for  quashing  such  a	criminal  proceeding.	But  in	 our
judgment   such	  an  interpretation   and   the   universal
application of the principle that what is not a final  order
must  be  an interlocutory order is  neither  warranted	 nor
justified  If it were so it will render almost nugatory	 the
revisional  power  of the Sessions Court or the	 High  Court
conferred  on  it  by <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_64">section 397(1)</a>.	On  such  a  'strict

<p id="p_24">only those orders would be revisable which are orders passed
on  the	 final	determination  of the  action  but  are	 not
appealable  under Chapter XXIX of the Code.  This  does	 not
seem to be the intention of the Legislature when it retained
the revisional power of the High Court in terms identical to
the  one  in the, 1898 Code.  In what cases  then  the	High
Court will examine the legality or the propriety of an order
or  the legality of any proceeding of an  inferior  Criminal
court ? Is it circumscribed to examine only such  proceeding
which  is  brought  for	 its  examination  after  the  final
determination  and wherein no appeal lies ? Such cases	will
be  very  few  and far between.	 It  has  been	pointed	 out
repeatedly, vide, for example, The River Wear  Commissioners
v.  William Adamson(1) and <a href="/doc/725224/" id="a_65">R. M. D. Chamarbaugwalla  v.	 The
Union  of India</a> ( 2) that although the word occurring  in  a
particular  statute are plain and unambiguous, they have  to
be interpreted in a manner which would fit in the context of
the other provisions of the statute and bring about the real
intention  of  the  legislature.   On  the  one	 hand,	 the
legislature  kept  intact the revisional power of  the	High
Court  and,  on the other, it put a bar on the	exercise  of
that power in relation to any interlocutory order.  In	such
a situation it appears to us that the real intention of	 the
legislature was not to equate the expression  "interlocutory
order"	as  invariably being converse of  the  words  "final
order".	 There may be an order passed during the course of a
proceeding  which may not be final in the sense	 noticed  in
Kuppuswami's  case  (supra),  but,  yet it  may	 not  be  an
interlocutory order-pure or simple.  Some kinds of order may
fall   in  between  the	 two.	By  a  rule  of	  harmonious
construction,  we, think that the bar in sub-section (2)  of
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_66">section	 397</a> is not meant to be attracted to such  kinds  of
intermediate  orders.  They may not be final orders for	 the
purposes  of <a href="/doc/1446285/" id="a_67">Article 134</a> of the Constitution, yet  it  would
not be correct to characterise them as merely  interlocutory
orders within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_68">section 397(2)</a>.  It is  neither
advisable,  nor possible, to make a catalogue of  orders  to
demonstrate which kinds of orders would be merely, purely or
simply	interlocutory  and which kinds of  orders  would  be
final, and then to prepare an exhaustive list of those types
of orders which will fall in between the two.  The first two
kinds are well-known and can be culled out from many decided
cases.	 We  may, however, indicate that the type  of  order
with which we are concerned in this case, even though it may
not be final in one sense, is surely not interlocutory so as
to attract the bar of subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_69">section 397</a>.  In our
opinion it must be taken to be an order of the type  falling
in the middle course.

refer  to what has been said by Kania C. J. in	Kuppuswami's

Lowndes	 in  the case of <a href="/doc/1417015/" id="a_70">Abdul Rahman V. D.  K.	 Cassim	 and
Sons</a>(3).   The learned law Lord said with reference  to	 the

dispose	 finally of the rights of the parties.	It no  doubt

"case  decided"	 occurring in section 1 1 5 of the  Code  of
Civil  Procedure.  Some High Courts had taken the view	that
it  meant the final order passed on final  determination  of
the  action.   Many  others had however,  opined  that	even
interlocutory  orders were covered by the said	term.	This
Court struck a mean and it did not approve of either of	 the
two  extreme lines.  <a href="/doc/595622/" id="a_71">In Baldevdas v. Filmistan	Distributors
(India) Pvt. Ltd</a>.(1) it has been pointed out :

</blockquote><p id="p_29">We  may	 give a clear example of an order in  a	 civil	case
which  may  not	 be a final order  within  the	meaning	 of
<a href="/doc/1011888/" id="a_72">Article	 133  (1)</a> of the Constitution, yet it  will  not  be
purely or simply of an interlocutory character.	 Suppose for
example,  a defendant raises the plea of jurisdiction  of  a
particular  Court to try the suit or the bar  of  limitation
and succeeds, then the action is determined finally in	that
Court.	 But  if the point is decided against him  the	suit
proceeds.   Of course, in a given case the point raised	 may
be  such that it is interwoven and interconnected  with	 the
other issues in the case, and that it may not be possible to

decided,  as  pointed out by this Court in  some  decisions,
within	the  meaning  of section 115 of the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure.   We think it would be just and proper  to  apply
the  same kind to test for finding out the real	 meaning  of

of  this  Court in <a href="/doc/277167/" id="a_75">Mohan Lal Magan Lal Thacker v.  State  of
Gujarat</a>(2)  After an enquiry under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_76">section 476</a> of  the	1898
Code  an order was made directing the filing of a  complaint
against	 the appellant.	 It was affirmed by the High  Court.

under  <a href="/doc/1461463/" id="a_77">Article	134(1) (c).</a>  A question	 arose	whether	 the
order  was  a "final order" within the meaning of  the	said
constitutional	 provision.   Shelat  J.,   delivering	 the
judgment on behalf of himself and two other learned  Judges,
said that it was a final order.	 The dissenting judgment was

enumerated  at page 688.  One of the tests is "If the  order
in  question is reversed would the action have to go  on  ?"
Applying that test to the facts of the instant case it would
be  noticed that if the plea of the appellant  succeeds	 and
the  order of the Sessions Judge is reversed,  the  criminal
proceeding as initiated and instituted against him cannot go
on.  If, however, he loses on the merits of the	 preliminary
point  the  proceeding	will go on.  Applying  the  test  of

<p id="p_32">not be a final order.  But applying the fourth test noted at
page 688 in Mohan Lal's case it would be a final order.	 The
real  point of distinction, however, is to be found at	page
693 in the judgment of Shelat, J.The passage runs thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	      "As   observed  in  <a href="/doc/2154/" id="a_78">Ramesh v.  Patni</a>-[1966]  3
	      S.C.R. 198 the finality of that order was	 not
	      to be judged by correlating that	  order with
	      the controversy in the complaint,viz.  whether
	      the   appellant  had  committed  the   offence
	      charged  against him therein.  The  fact	that
	      that  controversy	 still	remained  alive	  is
	      irrelevant."
</blockquote><p id="p_33">The majority view is based upon the distinction pointed	 out
in the above passage and concluding that it is a final order
within	the meaning of <a href="/doc/1461463/" id="a_79">Article 134(1) (c).</a>   While  Bachawat
J.,  said at page 695 : "It is merely a preliminary step  in
the prosecution and therefore an interlocutory orders." Even
though	there  may  be	a  scope  for  expressing  different
opinions  apropos  the nature of the order which  was  under
consideration	in  Mohan  Lars	 case,	in   our   judgment,
undoubtedly,  an order directing the filing of	a  complaint
after  enquiry	made  under a provision of  the	 1973  Code,
similar	 to  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_80">section  476</a> of the 1898 Code will	 not  be  an
interlocutory  order within the meaning of '<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_81">section  397(2)</a>.
The  order will be clearly revisable by the High Court.	  We
must,  however, hasten to add that the majority decision  in
Mohan  Lal's case treats such an order as an  order  finally
concluding  the	 enquiry  started  to  find  out  whether  a
complaint  should be lodged or not, taking  the	 prosecution
launched  on  the  filing of the  complaint  as	 a  separate
proceeding.   From  that  point of  view  the  matter  under
discussion  may	 not be said to be squarely covered  by	 the
decision  of  this Court in Mohan Lal's case.  Yet  for	 the
reasons already alluded to, we feel no difficulty in  coming
to  the conclusion, after due consideration, that  an  order
rejecting  the	plea of the accused on a point	which,	when
accepted,  will	 conclude the  particular  proceeding,	will
surely	be not an interlocutory order within the meaning  of
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_82">section 397(2)</a>.
</p><p id="p_34">We  may	 also  refer  to  the  decision	 of  this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/627930/" id="a_83">Parmeshwari Devi v. State and Anr</a>.(1) that an order made  in
a criminal proceeding against a person who is not a party to
the enquiry or trial and which adversely affected him is not
an  interlocutory  order within the meaning of	<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_84">section	 397</a>
(2).  Referring to a passage from the decision of this Court
in  Mohan  Lals case- the passage which is to  be  found  in
Halsbury's  Laws of England, Volume 22, it has been said  by
Shinghal  J., delivering the judgment of the Court, at	page
164 :

the  suit  and restoring the suit to the file of  the  Trial
Court  is  not a final order within the meaning	 of  Article
</p><p id="p_37">133.  It is to be noticed that if the High Court would	have
refused to set aside the ex-parte decree, the proceeding for
setting it aside would have finally ended and on some of the
principles  culled out by the majority in Mohan	 Lars  case,
such  an  order	 would have been a  final  order.   We	are,
however,  not  under  any  necessity  to  enter	 into	this
controversial arena.  In our opinion whether the type of the
order  aforesaid  would be a final order or not,  surely  it
will  not  be an interlocutory order within the	 meaning  of
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_86">section 397</a> of the 1973 Code.
Before	we  conclude  we may point out	an  obvious,  almost
insurmountable, difficulty in the way of applying  literally
the  test laid down in Kuppuswami Rao's case and in  holding
that  an order of the kind under consideration being  not  a
final order must necessarily be an interlocutory one.  If  a
complaint  is dismissed under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_87">section 203</a> or  under  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_88">section
204(4)</a>,	 or  the Court holds the proceeding to	be  void  or
discharges the accused, a revision to the High Court at	 the
instance  of  the  complainant or the  prosecutor  would  be
competent,  otherwise  it will make <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_89">section 398</a> of  the	 new
Code otiose.  Does it stand to reason, then, that an accused
will  have no remedy to move the High Court in	revision  or
invoke	its inherent power for the quashing of the  criminal
proceeding initiated upon a complaint or otherwise and which
is  fit	 to be quashed on the face of it ?  The	 legislature
left  the power to order further inquiry intact in  'section
</p><p id="p_38">398.   Is  it  not, then, in consonance with  the  sense  of
justice	 to leave intact the remedy of the accused  to	move
the  High Court for setting aside the order  adversely	made
against	 him  in  similar circumstances	 and  to  quash	 the
proceeding ? The answer must be given in favour of the	just
and reasonable view expressed by us above.
For  the  reasons stated above, we allow  this	appeal,	 set
aside the judgment and order of the High Court and remit the
case  back to it to dispose of the appellant's	petition  on
merits,	 in the manner it may think fit and proper to do  in
accordance with the law and in the light
of this judgment.
