JAYANT NATH, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">IA No. 2378/2015
</p><p id="p_2">1.    This application is filed by defendant No.1 under Order VII Rule 11
CPC seeking rejection of the plaint and dismissal of the suit.
</p><p id="p_3">2.    The present suit is filed by the plaintiffs seeking a decree of
declaration that the plaintiffs are the owners of the copyright in the work
"Eight Science Olympiad Books Parts 1-8" as per the agreement dated
20.12.2012. A decree of declaration is also sought that the plaintiffs are the
owners of the copyright in the work "Maths Olympiad Parts 1-6". A decree
of permanent injunction is also sought to restrain the defendants from
interfering or disturbing the peaceful sale or publication or in any manner
exploiting the copyright in the said works by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    Plaintiff No. 1-M/s. Blueberry Books is said to be a partnership firm
comprising of plaintiffs No. 2 and 3. It has been urged in the plaint that the
plaintiffs are the publishers of books and were approached by defendant



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 1498/2014                                                 Page 1 of 10</span>
 No.1 expressing an intention to write books on science subjects. An
agreement was entered into between the plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 on
20.12.2012 by which it was agreed that the plaintiffs would publish the work
and that all the copyright in the "Eight Science Olympiad Books Parts 1-8"
was to vest in the plaintiffs. Similarly, following such publication, defendant
No.1 also agreed to write Maths Olympiad Books on behalf of the plaintiffs
under a similar arrangement and entered into an oral understanding in this
regard. Thereafter on 21.03.2014, the plaintiffs claim to have received a
notice from the defendant stating that the terms of the agreement dated
20.12.2012 were incoherent, etc. and that the plaintiffs should stop printing,
publishing or distributing any books published on Science Olympiad
authored by the defendant. Hence, the present suit.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    The defendant in the present application states that though the suit is
filed by a firm but the plaintiffs have nowhere in the plaint asserted that
plaintiff No.1 is a registered partnership firm and that plaintiffs No. 2 and 3
are the registered partners. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_1">Section 69(2)</a> of the Indian
Partnership Act to contend that the mandatory provisions of the said section
have not been adhered to and the suit filed by an unregistered firm is liable to
be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_7">6.    Learned counsel for the defendants has strenuously urged relying upon
the judgment of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/1753479/" id="a_2">North Delhi Power Ltd. vs.
Jagdamba Gasket (India</a>), 2010 SCC OnLine Delhi 1898 and the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_3">Section 69(2)</a> of the Indian Partnership Act that the present suit is barred
by law.

<p id="p_8"> 7.     Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs however relies upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/39217891/" id="a_4">Haldiram Bhujiawala &amp; Anr.
vs. Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar &amp; Anr</a>., (2000) 3 SCC 250 to contend that
the a suit seeking enforcement of statutory rights is not barred under law and
<a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_5">Section 69(2)</a> of the Indian Partnership Act has no application to such a suit.
It is urged that the present suit is for enforcement of statutory rights and
hence, the application is misconceived.
</p><p id="p_9">8.     In rejoinder, learned counsel for the defendants urges that the claim of
the plaintiffs is based on an agreement dated 20.10.2012 and other
documents to claim exclusive rights on the copyright in question. It is urged
that under <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_6">Section 17</a> of the Copyright Act, the author of a work is the first
owner of the copyright and assignment is possible under <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_7">Section 18</a> and <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_8">19</a>
of the Copyright Act by a deed in writing signed by the assignor. Hence, it is
urged that the defendants being the original author is the original owner of
the copyright and the issue revolves around the agreement between the
parties.

the suit was filed for permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) 1498/2014                                                  Page 3 of 10</span>
 infringing the trade mark HALDIRAM BHUJIAWALA or using an identical
name/mark deceptively similar thereto. The case related to a dispute within
the family. The original trade mark HALDIRAM BHUJIAWALA was
registered in the name of the partnership firm. On dissolution of the firm in
1974, the trade mark fell to the exclusive share of one son Sh.Moolchand
who became the proprietor of the trade mark while the daughter-in-law was
given ownership of the trade mark for West Bengal. In those facts, the issue
arose as to whether the suit was barred under <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_11">Section 69(2)</a> of the Indian
Partnership Act as the firm was not registered on date when the suit was
filed. The Court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "9. The question whether Section 69(2) is a bar to a suit filed by
     an unregistered firm even if a statutory right is being enforced or
     even If only a Common Law right is being enforced came up
     directly for consideration in this Court in <a href="/doc/1664373/" id="a_12">M/s. Raptokas Brett
     Co. Ltd. v. Ganesh Property</a>. In that case, Majmudar J speaking
     for the Bench clearly expressed the view that Section 69(2)
     cannot bar the enforcement by way of suit by an unregistered
     firm in respect of a statutory right or a common law right. On the
     facts of that case, it was held the right to evict a tenant upon
     expiry of the lease was not a right 'arising from a contract' but
     was a common law right or a statutory tight under the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_13">Transfer of
     Property Act</a>. The fact that the plaint in that case referred to a
     lease and to Its expiry, made no difference. Hence, the said suit
     was held not barred. It appears to us that in that case the
     reference to the lease in the plaint was obviously treated as a
     historical fact. That case is therefore directly in point. Following
     the said judgment, it must be held in the present case too that a
     suit is not barred by <a href="/doc/792696/" id="a_14">Section 69(2)</a> if a statutory right or a
     common law right is being enforced.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     10. The next .question is as to the nature of the right that is being
     enforced in this suit. It is well settled that a passing off action is a
     common law action based on tort (vide) Bengal Waterproof Ltd.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      v. Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing Company. Therefore, in
     our opinion, a suit for perpetual injunction to restrain the
     defendant not to pass-off the defendant's goods as those of
     plaintiffs by using the plaintiffs' trade mark and for damages Is
     an action at common law and is not barred by <a href="/doc/792696/" id="a_15">Section 69(2)</a>, The
     decision in <a href="/doc/1689892/" id="a_16">M/s. Virendra Dresses Delhi v. Varinder Garments</a>
     and the decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
     in <a href="/doc/151658/" id="a_17">M/s. Bestochem 'Formulation v. Dlnesh Ayurvedic Agencies</a>
     state that <a href="/doc/792696/" id="a_18">Section 69(2)</a> does not apply to a passing-off action as
     the suit is based on tort and not on contract. In our opinion, the
     above decisions were correctly decided. (The special leave
     petition No. 18418 of 1999 against the latter was in fact
     dismissed by this Court on 28-1-2000.) The learned senior
     counsel for the appellants no doubt relied upon <a href="/doc/907667/" id="a_19">Ruby General
     Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pearey Lai Kumar</a>. That was an arbitration
     case in which the words "arising out of a contract" were widely
     interpreted but that decision, in our view, has no relevance in
     interpreting the words "arising from a contract" in <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_20">Section 69(2)</a>
     of the Partnership Act.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     11. Likewise, if the reliefs of permanent injunction or damages
     are being claimed on the basis of a registered trade mark and its
     infringement, the suit is to be treated as one based on a statutory
     right under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_21">Trade Marks Act</a> and is, in our view, not barred
     by <a href="/doc/792696/" id="a_22">Section 69(2)</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     12. For the aforesaid reasons, in both these situations, the
     unregistered partnership in the case before us cannot be said to be
     enforcing any right "arising from a contract". Point 1 is therefore
     decided in favour of the plaintiffs-respondents."

      "25. Further <a href="/doc/792696/" id="a_23">Section 69(2)</a> is not attracted to any and every
     contract referred to in the plaint as the source of title to an asset
     owned by the firm. If the plaint referred to such a contract it
     could only be as a historical fact. For example, if the plaint filed

      a Motor Car from a foreign buyer under a contract and that the
      defendant has unauthorisedly removed it from the plaintiff firm's
      possession, - it is clear that the relief for possession against
      defendant in the suit does not arise from any contract with
      defendant entered into in the course of plaintiff firms' business
      with defendants but is based on the alleged unauthorised removal
      of the vehicle from the plaintiff firm's custody by the defendant.
      In such a situation, the fact that the unregistered firm has
      purchased the vehicle from somebody else under a contract has
      absolutely no bearing on the right of the firm to sue the defendant
      for possession of the vehicle. Such a suit would be maintainable
      and <a href="/doc/792696/" id="a_24">Section 69(2)</a> would not be a bar, even if the firm is
      unregistered on the date of suit. The position in the present case
      is not different."

<p id="p_12">11.    Reference may also be had to the judgment of the Supreme Court in
the case of Raptakos Brett &amp; Co. Ltd. vs. Ganesh Property, (1998) 7 SCC
</p><p id="p_13">184. The court there was dealing with a case where the owner of the suit
premises had rented out the property by a registered lease deed for a period
of 21 years. On the expiry of the said period, the Firm filed a suit for decree
of possession. The defendant took the plea that even after the expiry of the
lease period as the rent had been accepted, the defendant became a tenant by
holding over under Section 116 of the Transfer of Properties Act. The plea of
the firm being unregistered was also taken. In those facts, the Supreme Court
held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "14. However, the aforesaid conclusion will not clinch the matter
      one way or the other. The reason is obvious. While considering
      the question whether the suit as filed is hit by Section 69 Sub-
      section (2) of the <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_25">Partnership Act</a> or not, we have to see what the
      plaintiff claims as his cause of action. It is obvious that if the suit
      is based solely on the ground that the erstwhile tenant defendant
      unlawfully remained in possession after the expiry of the lease




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) 1498/2014                                                      Page 6 of 10</span>
      and is required to hand over possession to the plaintiff, the suit
     can be said to be based on the sole cause of action for
     enforcement of a right arising at general law and under the
     <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_26">Transfer of Property Act</a> in favour of the plaintiff and against the
     defendant who was earlier protected by the contract between the
     parties. Shri Nariman in this connection was right when he
     contended that the aforesaid decisions of this Court only decide
     the status of such an erstwhile tenant and there can not be any
     dispute that the appellant on the expiry of the lease, especially
     when there was no evidence to show that he was a tenant by
     holding over, had continued in occupation as a tenant at
     sufferance. However, the nature of the right sought to be
     enforced by the plaintiff has to be culled out from the recitals in
     the plaint even against such a tenant at sufferance.
     xxxxxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     23. ... The net result to this discussion is that the present suit can
     be said to be partly barred by Section 69 Sub-section (2) so far as
     it sought to enforce the obligation of the defendant under Clauses
     14 and 17 of the contract of lease read with the relevant recitals
     in this connection as found in paragraph 2 of the plaint. But it
     was partly not barred by Section 69 Sub-section (2) in so far as
     the plaintiff based a part of its cause of Action also on the law of
     the land, namely, <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_27">Transfer of Property Act</a> where under the
     plaintiff had sought to enforce its statutory right Under <a href="/doc/1879190/" id="a_28">Section
     108(q)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1085742/" id="a_29">Section 111(a)</a> of the Property Act.
     Enforcement of the right had nothing to do with the earlier
     contract which had stood determined by efflux of time. The first
     point for determination therefore, has accordingly, to be held
     partly in favour of the plaintiff and partly in favour of the
     defendant. As the decree for possession is passed on the basis of
     both parts of causes of Action, even if it is not supportable on the
     first part, it will remain well sustained on the second part of the
     very same cause of Action.

     appellant partly succeeds thereon the ultimate decree for peaceful
     possession against the appellant would remain well sustained."

<p id="p_14"> 12.   In the present case, it is clear that the suit is based on statutory rights
arising under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_30">Copyright Act</a> especially <a href="/doc/214776/" id="a_31">sections 18</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/96884/" id="a_32">19</a> of the said Act.
Reference in this context may be had to the judgment of this court in <a href="/doc/109874394/" id="a_33">The
Gramophone Company of India Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd</a>.,
2010(44) PTC 541 (Del), where the court held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      "27. At the outset, <a href="/doc/1194266/" id="a_34">Section 16</a> of the Act may be noticed.
      <a href="/doc/1194266/" id="a_35">Section 16</a> provides that no copyright can be acquired in respect
      of any work except in accordance with the provisions of the

      which the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_36">Copyright Act</a> creates; to the extent it creates, and;
      subject to the limitations that the Act imposes, vest in the owner
      of the copyright in the work, whether it is a primary work such
      as a literary, dramatic or musical work, or a derivate work such
      as a sound recording or cinematograph film. No right, which the

<p id="p_15">13.   Hence, copyright is a statutory right. No doubt, to explain as to how
the copyright vests in the plaintiffs a narration of historical facts has been
made. This narration of historical facts are ancillary and incidental to the
rights which are sought to be agitated by the plaintiffs, namely, its copyright.

or ancillary issues are also arising in the course of adjudication of the
controversy in the plaint, would not be sufficient to hold that the suit is
barred under <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_39">Section 69(2)</a> of the Partnership Act.

vs. Ganesh Property</a>(supra) held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      "29. We, prima facie, find substance in what is contended by
      Dr. Singhvi for the respondent. It is obvious that even if the suit
      is filed by an unregistered partnership firm, against a third party
      and is treated to be incompetent as per Section 69 Sub-section
      (2) of the <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_41">Partnership Act</a>, if pending the suit before a decree is
      obtained the plaintiff puts its house in order and gets itself
      registered the defect in the earlier filing which even though may
      result in treating the original suit as still born, would no longer
      survive if the suit is treated to be deemed to be instituted on the
      date on which registration is obtained. If such an approach is
      adopted, no real harm would be caused to either side. As rightly
      submitted by Dr. Singhvi that, Order 7 Rule 13 of the CPC
      would permit the filing of a fresh suit on the same cause of
      Action and if the earlier suit is permitted to be continued it
      would continue in the old number and the parties to the
      litigation would be able to get their claim adjudicated on merits
      earlier while on the other hand if such subsequent registration is
      not held to be of any avail, all that would happen is that a fresh
      suit can be filed immediately after such registration and then it
      will bear a new number of a subsequent year. That would
      further delay the adjudicatory process of the court as such a new
      suit would take years before it gets ready for trial and the parties
      will be further deprived of an opportunity to get their disputes
      adjudicated on merits at the earliest and the arrears of cases
      pending in the court would go on mounting. It is axiomatic to
      say that as a result of protracted litigation spread over tiers and
      tiers of court proceedings in hierarchy, the ultimate result before
      the highest court would leave both the parties completely
      frustrated and financially drained off. To borrow the analogy in
      an English poem with caption "death the leveller", with
      appropriate modification, the situation emerging in such cases
      can be visualised as under: "upon final court's purple alter see
      how victor victim bleed". All these considerations in an
      appropriate case may require a re-look at the decision of the two
      member Bench of this Court in Shreeram Finance. However, as

       we have noted earlier, on the facts of the present case, it is not
      necessary for us to express any final opinion on this question or
      to direct reference to a larger Bench for reconsidering the
      aforesaid decision. With these observations we bring down the
      curtains on this controversy. Point No. 2, therefore, is answered
      by observing that it is not necessary on the facts of the present
      case in the light of our decision on the first point to decide this
      point one way or the other. Point No. 2 is, therefore, left
