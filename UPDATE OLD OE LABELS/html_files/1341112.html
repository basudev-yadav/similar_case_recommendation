<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">1.     Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">2.     Challenge in these appeals is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the

Orissa High Court allowing the writ petition filed by the respondent in Writ Petition (C)

No.8282/2004 dated 27.10.2005 and the order dated 10.1.2007 passed in the Review

Petition No.13/2006 arising out of said writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">2.     The background facts as highlighted by the appellants are as follows:



</p><p id="p_8">       The dispute relates to an alleged lease of 53.95 acres of land executed by

Hatapatta dated 25.1.1933 by erstwhile intermediaries i.e. Chakradhar Mohapatra and
Ramakrushna Mohapatra in favour of one Kamala Devi. The respondent Harapriya

Bishoi claimed to be the successor in interest of Kamala Devi. Undisputedly, the alleged

Hatapatta is an unregistered document. The land is presently situated in the capital city

of Bhubaneswar in the State of Orissa. The purported Hatapatta described the land as

being for permanent cultivation but as per records or rights published in 1930-31 the

land is classified as "uncultivable" within Anabadi Land. The land is further described

as Jhudi jungle i.e. bushy forest. The estate of intermediaries Chakradhar Mohapatra

and Ramakrushna Mohapatra is vested in the State by virtue of a Notification dated

1.5.1954 issued under Section 3 of the Orissa Estate Abolition Act, 1951 (in short the

`Act'). In respect of the land in question the Orissa Estate Abolition Case 4 of 1970 was

registered. Originally the case was registered as OEA 18 of 1967 with OEA Collector,

Cuttack. On transfer of certain villages from Cuttack district to Puri District, the case

was transferred to OEA Collector, Bhubneshwar and was re-numbered as OEA Case

No.4 of 1970.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">       By order dated 6.1.1971 in the said OEA case the OEA Collector set aside the

disputed lease deed on the ground of not being genuine. The Collector found that since

the lands were lying fallow, the rent receipts were not genuine.       The Ekpadia or

Zamabandi Register in the Tahsil Officer had no mention of Kamala Devi as a lessee.

The lease was unregistered even though vast tracts of land were transferred. It was thus

held that the lease deed was back dated and was created with the object of defeating the

purpose of the Act. The said order dated 6.1.1971 was upheld by Additional District

Magistrate, Puri by order dated 28.5.1974.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">       Between the period 1962 to 1973 settlement proceedings were carried out under

the Orissa Survey and <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_1">Settlement Act</a>, 1958 (in short the `<a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_2">Settlement Act</a>'). By

publication dated 6.12.1973, the State was recorded as the owner/title holder of the

entire land of 1056.8 acres under Khatian No.1076 of village Gadakana of which the

disputed land is a part. Further, by Revenue Department Notification No.13699-EA-1-

ND-1/74/R    published in the Extraordinary          Gazette No.371 dated 18.3.1974, the

Government of Orissa notified that the intermediaries interest of all intermediaries in

respect of all estates other than those which have vested in the State have passed to and

became vested in the State free from all encumbrances.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">       The order dated 28.5.1974 was challenged before the Orissa High Court by filing

OJC No.882 of 1974. The High Court             by order dated 29.10.1976 directed the OEA

Collector, Bhubneshwar to examine the matter afresh by issuing notice to the lessor and

the lessee and also to ensure that the interest of the State was protected. Pursuant to the

order of the High Court dated 29.10.1976 remanding the matter to the OEA Collector,

the Collector heard the matter afresh and by order dated 24.4.1989 held that the lease

was entered into prior to 1.1.1946. But he found that the claimant was only in possession

of 7 acres of land and hence recommendation was made only for registering a settlement

in respect of such 7 acres of land. Significantly, the General Administration Department

(in short GA Department) was not brought on record in the proceedings. The record

was then submitted to the Board of Revenue. By order dated 27.4.1991, the Board of

Revenue held that due enquiry had not been made as per the orders of the High Court in

the earlier writ petition and the matter was returned to the Collector for fresh enquiry.

Interestingly, the order of OEA Collector dated 24.4.1989 was challenged in OJC 2063 of

1992 in the High Court. There was, however, no challenge to the order passed by the

Board of Revenue dated 27.4.1991. By order dated 2.11.1992 the High Court allowed the

writ petition being of the view that the finding of the Collector was to the effect that the

lease was not executed after 1.1.1946, so as to defeat the provisions of the Act. Therefore,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3</span>
the OEA Collector had no jurisdiction to proceed further in the matter. Thus (a) the

determination of the extent of possession of the parties and (b) referral of the matter to

the Board of Revenue was beyond jurisdiction of the Collector. The High Court quashed

the order of the Collector directing settlement of portion of the leased property and

declared the proceedings before the Board of Revenue to be non est.



       The High Court confined its order only to issue of jurisdiction and the scope of

power under <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_3">Section 5(i)</a> and there was no finding recorded regarding the genuineness

of the lease dated 25.1.1933. Additionally, the GA Department of the State which is the

relevant Department under the Orissa Government Rules of Business was not a party in

the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">       After the death of Kamala Devi, her purported successor Kishore Chandra

Pattnaik filed a writ petition bearing No.OJC 15984 of 1997 praying for a direction to

the State to accept rent in respect of the disputed property. Again, the GA Department

was not arrayed as a party in the case at the time of filing of the writ petition. The GA

Department was later arrayed as a party pursuant to the order dated 3.8.2000 passed in

said OJC. One Anup Kumar Dhirsamant who was the Power of Attorney holder of

Kishore Chandra Pattnaik executed a sale deed dated 6.3.2000 covering 23.30 acres of

land on behalf of the latter in favour of the present respondent who is also the mother of

Dhirsamant.     Thus, the respondent came into the picture as a vendee of Kishore

Chandra Pattnaik who in turn is the son of Kamala Devi. Kishore Chandra Pattnaik

claimed that the original power of attorney did not empower the holder to sell the land.

His plea was that the aforesaid sale was in pursuance of a forged and interpolated

document. The sale deed dated 6.3.2000 was an impounded document for evasion of

stamp duty. On 8.4.2002, a Settlement Rent Objection case under the <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_4">Settlement Act</a>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4</span>
bearing case No.4013 of 2002 was instituted by the Assistant Settlement Officer,

Gadakna on the strength of the petition filed by GA Department for recording the case

land in favour of GA Department. The petition was allowed on 30.12.2002 in favour of

the GA Department. Against the said order, Settlement Appeal cases were preferred by

Kishore Chandra Pattnaik and present respondent Harapriya Bisoi. The appeals were

disposed of by order dated 7.10.2004 and the record of rights in favour of GA

Department was directed not to be interfered with. The respondent also filed a Civil Suit

bearing No.2/12 of 2004 before learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Bhubaneswar, for a

declaration of right, title and interest in respect of disputed land.        The IAs were

dismissed and the Civil Court held that the right, title and interest of the present

respondent had not been determined finally by OJC 2063 of 1992. It was held that the

findings of the High Court related only to the power and jurisdiction of the Collector

and the Board of Revenue. Respondent filed OJC 8282 of 2004 seeking a direction to the

State to accept rent from her in respect of the case land, for a declaration of tenancy in

her favour and for an injunction against the State restraining them from interfering

with her possession. By order dated 27.10.2005 the High Court allowed the writ petition

and that is the subject matter of challenge in one of the present appeals.



</p><p id="p_17">       It is to be noted that in its order dated 27.10.2005 the High Court relied upon the

earlier judgment in OJC 2063 of 1992 and held that in view of the finding in that case

Kamala Devi and Kishore Chandra Pattnaik were deemed to be tenants under the State

government under <a href="/doc/163340157/" id="a_5">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act and the present respondent being successor in

interest of Kamala Devi was to step into her shoes and has to be treated as a tenant

under the Act. The relevant findings of the High Court in the judgment are as follows:



  "(i)  In paras 10 and 11 of the judgement of the High Court in OJC No.
  2063/1992 it was held that the lease deed having been executed prior to 1.1.1946


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>
     and the same have been found to be a genuine document, the OEA Collector could
     not have proceeded with the case any further and he should have dropped the
     proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     (ii)   In the subsequent paras in the judgment in OJC No. 2063/1992, the Court
     held that the OEA Collector had no jurisdiction to decide the question of actual
     possession and make a recommendation to the Board of Revenue for concurrence.
     "The orders passed by the Board of Revenue in pursuance of the references of the
     case by the OEA Collector shall be taken to be non-est. The proceedings initiated
     under<a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_6"> S. 5</a> (i) of the OEA Act shall be taken to have been dropped."

</p><p id="p_19">     (iii)   This Court while disposing of the earlier writ application taking note of<a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_7"> S. 5</a>
</p><p id="p_20">     (i) has held that Late Kamla Devi was a tenant under the ex-intermediaries before
     the vesting and on the date of vesting and was in possession of the entire disputed
     property - hence Late Kamla Devi was a deemed tenant under<a href="/doc/109284855/" id="a_8"> S. 8</a> (1) of the OEA
     Act.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     (iv) In view of the decision of the High Court in OJC No. 2063/1992, late Kamla
     Devi and thereafter her successor Kishore Chandra Pattnaik are deemed to be
     tenants under the State Government and therefore the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar
     was duty bound to collect rent from them.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     (v) Kishore Chandra Pattaik being deemed to be a tenant under the State
     Government, the, Petitioner, Harpriya Bishoi, has stepped into his shoes after
     purchasing the land from him and, consequently, the Petitioner is to be treated as
     a tenant under the State and rent is to be collected from her."
</p>
<p id="p_23">


</p><p id="p_24">4.      In support of the appeals, learned counsel for the State submitted that the High

Court has completely mis-construed the decision in OJC 2063 of 1992. In the said

judgment the High Court had not returned any finding or expressed any observation

with regard to the genuineness of the lease deed of 1933. The only issue before the High

Court was whether the OEA Collector had exercised its powers correctly under <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_9">Section

5(i)</a> of the Act. No further issue was under consideration of the High Court. Only the

scope and jurisdiction of the Collector and the Board of Revenue was decided. In the

said decision the High Court had not returned any finding that late Kamala Devi was a

tenant under the ex-intermediaries before the vesting and on the date of vesting and

was in possession of the entire disputed property. The High Court has erroneously

recorded the said finding in the impugned judgment. Therefore, the High Court was in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                             6</span>
error by holding that Kamala Devi and thereafter her successor Kishore Chandra

Pattnaik were deemed to be tenants under <a href="/doc/163340157/" id="a_10">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. It is pointed out that

the proceedings in OEA Case No.4 of 1970 were under <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_11">Section 5(i)</a> of the Act and not

under <a href="/doc/163340157/" id="a_12">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. Neither the order of OEA Collector in OEA Case No.4 of

1970 dated 24.4.1989 nor the High Court's order in OJC 2063 of 1992 recognizes the

predecessors in interest of the respondent as tenants under <a href="/doc/163340157/" id="a_13">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. The

OEA Collector had categorically held in the order dated 24.4.1989 that the plea of the

claimants that the proceedings to be treated as one under <a href="/doc/163340157/" id="a_14">Section 8(1)</a> does not hold

water.    The OEA Collector was therefore conscious of the fact that there was no

exercise of power under <a href="/doc/163340157/" id="a_15">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act, but only under <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_16">Section 5(i)</a> of the Act.

Further, the High Court was in error in its interpretation of <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_17">Section 5(i)</a> of the Act. The

settlement of the lease in favour of the lessee under the first proviso of <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_18">Section 5(i)</a> has

to be necessarily confirmed by a member, Board of Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">5.       It has also been highlighted that a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1225793/" id="a_19">State of Orissa v.

Brundaban Sharma</a> (1995 Supp (3) SCC 249) has been completely lost sight of. The

conceptual different between <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_20">Section 5(i)</a> of the Act and <a href="/doc/109284855/" id="a_21">Section 8</a> has been lost sight of.

It was clearly observed in Brundaban's case (supra) that the order of the Collector

under <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_22">Section 5(i)</a> of the Act is required to be confirmed by Board of Revenue even if

Collector upholds genuineness of the lease. Several gross acts of fraud have been

committed by the respondent and/or others involved. This clearly invalidates every

action. The vendor's claims are pending adjudication before various courts. The record

of rights has attained finality in the settlement proceedings and the High Court should

not have unsettled them in the manner done. Therefore, it is submitted that the

impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be maintained.
</p>
<p id="p_27">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            7</span>
</p><p id="p_28">6.     On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that

consequences of vesting and the finding of the Collector that the lease was prior to

1.1.1946 and is a genuine one has been confirmed in the earlier judgment. The same has

attained finality. The State of Orissa was represented by the Secretary to Government,

Revenue Department, Bhubneshwar and the Member, Board of Revenue was also a

party. It is submitted that the decision in Brundaban's case (supra) was rendered in a

different set up and has no application to the facts of the present case.



</p><p id="p_29">7.     Certain factors need to be noted in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">8.     In Brundaban's case (supra) this Court held that even in a case where the OEA

Collector "decides not to set aside the lease, he should have referred the case to the

Board of Revenue. The object of conferment of such power on the Board of Revenue

appears to be to prevent collusive or fraudulent acts or actions on the part of the

intermediaries and lower level officers to defeat the object of the Act." This Court

further held that even if the OEA Collector decides that a lease was purported to have

been granted before 1.1.1946 and is not liable to be set aside, without reference or

confirmation by the Board of Revenue, such lease would not attain finality             The

judgment finally concludes that, "the' order passed by the Tehsildar (exercising powers

as the OEA Collector) without confirmation by the Board is non est. A non est order is

a void order and it confers no title and its validity can be questioned or invalidity be set

up in any proceeding or at any stage."
</p>
<p id="p_32">

</p><p id="p_33">9.     It is important to note, that in the facts of the present case, the Member, Board

of Revenue in its order dated 27.4.1991 while considering the decision of the OEA

Collector in OEA Case No. 4 of 1970, had observed that a detailed enquiry had not been



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                            8</span>
made by the OEA Collector "to ascertain who was in possession of the case land prior

to 1.1.1946 and from 1.1.1946 to 1.5.1954 (date of vesting of estate) and thereafter". The

Member, Board of Revenue, had further stated that, "the OEA Collector should have

verified the records to ascertain who were the ex-intermediaries (lessors) and if they

had right to alienate the land and if they have got compensation u/ s 28 of the OEA

Act". Further, "the O.Ps did not press their claim for a considerable period of time"

and "after notice was published in the newspaper 'Prajatantra' dated 22.7.87, a number

of interveners have preferred their claims before the OEA Collector", who have not

been examined.
</p>
<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">10.      The Member, Board of Revenue in its order had concluded that, "the case land

are within Bhubaneswar Municipality where the capital of state has been established

and a number of Government institutions have developed.. In view of the above points it

is necessary on the part of the OEA Collector to conduct a detailed enquiry".



</p><p id="p_36">11.      Without such confirmation by Member, Board of Revenue, the order of the OEA

Collector had not attained finality, and hence, the lease deed in favour of Kamala Devi

did not attain finality.
</p>
<p id="p_37">

</p><p id="p_38">12.      Certain provisions of the Act need to be noted.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">13.      <a href="/doc/95498655/" id="a_23">Section 2(h)</a> defines an `intermediary' as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "Intermediary' with reference to any estate means a proprietor, sub-proprietor,
      landlord, land holder, malguzar, thikadar, gaontia, tenure-holder, under-tenure

interest therein held or owned by or vested in an Intermediary.



</p><p id="p_42">15.    Significantly, as the above definitions would show, an `intermediary' and an

`intermediary interest' cover all the holders or owners of interest in land between the

State and the 'Raiyat' i.e. the actual cultivator or tiller of the soil. This is in line with the

object and purpose of the 1951 Act i.e. to establish a direct relationship between the tiller

and the State, and to abolish all intermediary interests, by whatever name called.



</p><p id="p_43">16.    `Raiyat' is the actual tiller of the soil, and is defined in <a href="/doc/95498655/" id="a_25">section 2(n)</a> as:

          law or rules, the custom prevalent in that area.

<p id="p_44">17.    <a href="/doc/179621517/" id="a_26">Section 3</a> of the Act empowers the State to declare,, by notification, that the estate

specified in the notification has passed to and become vested in the State free from all

the intermediary interests of all intermediaries or a class of intermediaries in the whole or

part of the estate have passed to and become vested in the State free from all encumbrances.

Where a lease or transfer has been made prior to 1.1.1946, solely with the object of defeating

the provisions of the Act or to claim higher compensation, <a href="/doc/118250866/" id="a_30">Section 5(i)</a> empowers the

collector to set aside such lease, settlement or transfer and take possession of the land from

such person.

<p id="p_46">

</p><p id="p_47">19.    By virtue of <a href="/doc/109284855/" id="a_31">Section 8</a>, any person who immediately before the vesting of an estate in

the State government was in possession of any holding as a tenant under an intermediary,

would on the from the date of the vesting, be deemed to be a tenant of the State government.

The words 'holding as a tenant' mean the `Raiyat' and not any other class of tenant:

Reference in this regard may be drawn to the definition of `holding' in the Orissa Tenancy

Act, 1913. `Holding' means a parcel or parcels of land held by a raiyat and forming the

subject of a separate tenancy".
</p>
<p id="p_48">


</p><p id="p_49">20.    <a href="/doc/109284855/" id="a_32">Section 8</a> thus confers protection only on the `Raiyat' i.e. the actual tiller of the soil.

the 'Raiyat' under the Act. Thus, the mere execution of a lease by the intermediary in

favour of a person would not confer the status of a 'raiyat' on the lessee nor would

protect the possession of such lessee under <a href="/doc/109284855/" id="a_33">Section 8</a>. In fact, a `lease' would amount to a

transfer of an interest of the intermediary in the land to the lessee. In such a situation,

under <a href="/doc/109284855/" id="a_35">Section 8</a>, one has to be a Raiyat cultivating the land directly and having the rights

of occupancy under the tenancy laws of the State. Thus, a `lessee' who is not actually

      of all persons, who hold some right in land between the State at the apex and the

      and rent receivers and to establish direct relationship between the State, in which
      all such interests vest, after abolition under the Act, and the tillers of the soil."

<p id="p_51">22.      On the facts of the present case, it is clear that the land was not under cultivation

by Kamala Devi. As per the record of rights published in 1930-31, the disputed land is

classified as Anabadi Land i.e. uncultivable. The land is further described in the records

as Jhudi jungle, i.e. bush forest. In addition, by order dated 6.1.1971 in OEA Case 4 of

1970, the OEA Collector, Bhubaneshwar had found that the lands were lying fallow and

were not in physical possession of any person. The land thus not being cultivated, Kamala

Devi cannot prima facie be considered as a 'Raiyat' under the Act.

it would, make Kamla Devi a 'tenure-holder' as opposed to a 'raiyat'. <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_47">Section 2(h)</a> of the

Act defines `intermediary' to include 'tenure-holder'. Thus, a "tenure holder" being an

`Hatapatta', purportedly more than 53.95 acres of land has been given by way of lease by

the ex-intermediary to Kamala Devi, she or her successor-in-interest is presumed to be a

`tenure-holder' and, therefore, an `intermediary' under the Act.

that in view of the finding that the order of the Collector was indefensible, obviously the

right, title and interest of the respondent extended to the whole area. This stand is clearly

unsustainable. The Collector's order only referred to certain enquires made to confirm

possession of only 7 acres of land. The High Court apparently has not considered this

aspect. The High Court has also not considered the effect of alleged fraud and the fact

that the relevant department was not a party in the proceedings before the High Court in

<p id="p_75">

</p><p id="p_76">33.    By "fraud" is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any expectation of

advantage to the party himself or from the ill will towards the other is immaterial. The

expression "fraud" involves two elements, deceit and injury to the person deceived.

Injury is something other than economic loss, that is, deprivation of property, whether

movable or immovable or of money and it will include and any harm whatever caused to

any person in body, mind, reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or

non-pecuniary loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver, will almost always cause loss

or detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit or

advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the second

</p><p id="p_77">34.    A "fraud" is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something

by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to gain by another's

loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. (<a href="/doc/113963352/" id="a_53">See S.P. Changalvaraya Naidu v.

Jagannath</a> (1994 (1) SCC 1).
</p>
<p id="p_78">

</p><p id="p_79">35.    "Fraud" as is well known vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice never dwell

together. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which includes the other person

or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the

former either by words or letter. It is also well settled that misrepresentation itself

amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may also give reason to claim

relief against fraud. A fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in

leading a man into damage by willfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on

falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes representations, which he knows to be

false, and injury enures therefrom although the motive from which the representations

proceeded may not have been bad. An act of fraud on court is always viewed seriously.

A collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the others in relation to a

property would render the transaction void ab initio. Fraud and deception are

synonymous. Although in a given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is

anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted with fraud cannot be

perpetuated or saved by the application of any equitable doctrine including res judicata.

system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human conduct. Michael Levi

likens a fraudster to Milton's sorcerer, Comus, who exulted in his ability to, `wing me

into the easy hearted man and trap him into snares'. It has been defined as an act of

trickery or deceit. In Webster's Third New International Dictionary "fraud" in equity

has been defined as an act or omission to act or concealment by which one person

obtains an advantage against conscience over another or which equity or public policy

forbids as being prejudicial to another. In Black's Legal Dictionary, "fraud" is defined

as an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in reliance

upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or surrender a legal right; a

false representation of a matter of fact whether by words or by conduct, by false or

misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed,

which deceives and is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal

injury. In Concise Oxford Dictionary, it has been defined as criminal deception, use of

false representation to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick. According to

Halsbury's Laws of England, a representation is deemed to have been false, and

therefore a misrepresentation, if it was at the material date false in substance and in fact.

<a href="/doc/299780/" id="a_55">Section 17</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines "fraud" as act committed by a party

to a contract with intent to deceive another. From dictionary meaning or even otherwise

fraud arises out of deliberate active role of representator about a fact, which he knows to

be untrue yet he succeeds in misleading the representee by making him believe it to be

true. The representation to become fraudulent must be of fact with knowledge that it

was false. In a leading English case i.e. Derry and Ors. v. Peek (1886-90) All ER 1 what

constitutes "fraud" was described thus: (All ER p. 22 B-C) "fraud" is proved when it is

shown that a false representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its

truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false". But "fraud" in public law



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                            18</span>
is not the same as "fraud" in private law. Nor can the ingredients, which establish

"fraud" in commercial transaction, be of assistance in determining fraud in

Administrative Law. It has been aptly observed by Lord Bridge in Khawaja v. Secretary

of State for Home Deptt. (1983) 1 All ER 765, that it is dangerous to introduce maxims of

common law as to effect of fraud while determining fraud in relation of statutory law.

"Fraud" in relation to statute must be a colourable transaction to evade the provisions of

a statute. "If a statute has been passed for some one particular purpose, a court of law

will not countenance any attempt which may be made to extend the operation of the Act

to something else which is quite foreign to its object and beyond its scope. Present day

concept of fraud on statute has veered round abuse of power or mala fide exercise of

power. It may arise due to overstepping the limits of power or defeating the provision of

statute by adopting subterfuge or the power may be exercised for extraneous or

irrelevant considerations. The colour of fraud in public law or administration law, as it

is developing, is assuming different shades. It arises from a deception committed by

disclosure of incorrect facts knowingly and deliberately to invoke exercise of power and

procure an order from an authority or tribunal. It must result in exercise of jurisdiction

which otherwise would not have been exercised. The misrepresentation must be in

relation to the conditions provided in a section on existence or non-existence of which the

power can be exercised. But non-disclosure of a fact not required by a statute to be

disclosed may not amount to fraud. Even in commercial transactions non-disclosure of

every fact does not vitiate the agreement. "In a contract every person must look for

himself and ensures that he acquires the information necessary to avoid bad bargain. In

public law the duty is not to deceive. (<a href="/doc/1697217/" id="a_56">See Shrisht Dhawan (Smt.) v. M/s. Shaw Brothers</a>

drawn to clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of the proviso but in our opinion none of
these provisos was applicable to the facts of the case so as to exclude the
operation of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/138769850/" id="a_67">Section 4</a>. Under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/138769850/" id="a_68">Section 4</a>:
"If any dispute arises as to the validity of the claim of any person to any
land under clauses (i) to (v) of the proviso to sub-section (1), it shall be open
to such person or to any other person interested in the transaction or to the
State Government, to apply to the District Judge of the district in which
the land is situated, for a decision as to the validity of such claim."
Under sub-section (4) the District Judge to whom such application is made
was to decide whether the claim to the land was valid or not after giving
notice to all persons concerned and where the application was not made by
the State Government, to the Government itself, and his decision was to be
final. Madras Act 26 of 1948, was passed on April 19, 1949, being an Act to
provide for the repeal of the Permanent Settlement, the acquisition of the
rights of landholders in permanently settled and certain other estates in the
Province of Madras, and the introduction of ryotwari settlement in such
estates. Apparently because of the preamble to the Act it was contended
that with the enactment of the repeal of the Permanent Settlement by the
Act of 1948, which also provided for the acquisition of the rights of
landholders in permanently settled estates, the Act stood repealed. We fail
to see how because of the preamble to the Act it can be said that it stood
repealed by the enactment of the later Act unless there were express words
to that effect or unless there was a necessary implication. It does not stand
to reason to hold that the alienation of large blocks of land which were
rendered void under the Act became good by reason of the passing of the
later Act. Our attention was drawn to <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_69">Section 63</a> of the later Act which
provided that:
</p>
<p id="p_99">
</p><p id="p_100">       "If any question arises whether any land in an estate is a forest or is
situated in a forest, or as to the limits of a forest, it shall be determined by
the Settlement Officer, subject to an appeal to the Director within such time
as may be prescribed and also to revision by the Board of Revenue."


In terms the section was only prospective and it did not seek to impeach
any transaction which was effected before the Act and was not applicable
to transactions anterior to the Act. In our opinion <a href="/doc/198083419/" id="a_70">Section 56(1)</a> of the

          later Act to which our attention was drawn by the learned counsel does
          not fall for consideration in this case and the disputes covered by that
          section do not embrace the question before us.

          5,     <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_71">Madras General Clauses Act</a> 1 of 1891, deals with the effect of
          repeals off statutes. <a href="/doc/109284855/" id="a_72">Section 8</a>, sub-section (f) thereof provides that:
          "Where any Act, to which this Chapter applies, repeals any other

          punishment as aforesaid; and any such investigation, legal proceeding or
          remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such fine,
          penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act
          had not been passed."
</p><p id="p_104">          This shows that even if there was a repeal any investigation started before
          the repeal would have to be continued and legal proceedings under the Act
          could be prosecuted as if the repealing Act had not been passed.


</p><p id="p_105">          6. There is also no force in the contention that unless there was a
          notification under <a href="/doc/102798992/" id="a_73">Section 2(b)</a> of the Act declaring a particular land to be
          forest land, the applicability of the Act would be excluded. The definition of
          `forest land' in that section is an inclusive one and shows that `forest land'
          would include not only waste land containing trees, shrubs and pasture
          lands but also any other class of lands declared by Government to be forest
          land. This does not mean that before a piece of land could be said to be
          forest land there would have to be a notification by the Government under
          the Act."
