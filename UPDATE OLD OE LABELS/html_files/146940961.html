<p id="p_1">06.   19.03.2009           A counter-affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

                   respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                           The petitioner had got a five years security

                   clearance from Government of India and on basis of the said

                   security clearance he was permitted to act as ground

                   handling agent at various airports in the country. This

                   clearance was suddenly without prior notice or without

                   disclosing any reason whatsoever, one fine morning,

                   withdrawn. The result is that the petitioner's entire business

                   of running ground handling agency came to an absolute

                   naught. Petitioner challenged this before this Court. The

                   only thing that could be said was that the security clearance

                   was withdrawn in national interest.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                           In view of national security and national interest

                   several times the case was adjourned without interim order

                   to enable Central Government to respond and file a counter-

                   affidavit but the same was not done. This Court had to pass
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                    -2-</span>




interim order. Even after interim order was passed, the

various authorities under the Central Government chose to

sit over the orders of the High Court as is noticed in

previous orders as if they were appellate authority over the

High Court. Again the matter was adjourned for counter-

affidavit. Such was the urgency on the part of the Central

Government to shut the petitioner from conducting his

business.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         Today a counter-affidavit has been filed in which it

is stated that the reasons can not be disclosed because they

are super secret. In other words, what is submitted on the

bogey of national security is that fundamental rights of

citizens and rights contained in Part III of the Constitution

can be suspended ad infinitum by a major executive fiat.

This is preposterous in the counter-affidavit.

</p><p id="p_5">         It is further stated that the report on basis of which

action has been taken would be produced before this Court

in a sealed envelope for perusal of the Court. The so-called

sealed envelope was produced. It contains one page letter

which mentions nothing except that there is an adverse IB

report. I wonder what is so secret about this except that it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              -3-</span>




           was only an attempt to mislead and browbeat the Court.

</p><p id="p_6">                    Learned Counsel for the Union of India has

           produced a recent Division Bench Judgment of Bombay

           High Court, Writ Petition No. 420 of 2009 dated 12 th

           March, 2009 in a controversy of similar nature. A copy of

           the judgment the deponent of the counter-affidavit must

           have given to the counsel. The judgment itself clearly

           noticed that the department was obligated by the court to

           produce entire file but in practice again they chose to

           withhold the file and were producing something in a sealed

           envelope a super secret document which stated above is

           absolutely otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                   In such a situation, I direct that the entire original

           file in relation to the petitioner be produced for perusal of

           the court under sealed cover on the next date i.e. on 25th

           March, 2009 at 10.30A.M. under the same heading.
