HEADNOTE:
	  The appellant society was incorporated in terms of <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_1">section
	2(r)</a>  of  the Copyright Act. 1957 (Act 14 of 1957),  in	 the
	State of Maharashtra on August 23, 1969 as a company limited
	by  guarantee  for the purpose of carrying  on	business  in
	India  of  issuing or granting licences for  performance  in
	public	of all existing and future Indian musical  works  in
	which  copyright  within  the meaning of<a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_2"> s. 13</a>	subsists  in
	India.	 The appellant company has amongst its	members	 the
	composers of musical works, authors of literary and dramatic
	works  and artistes.  In accordance with the  provisions  of
	<a href="/doc/1186979/" id="a_3">section 33</a> of the Copyright Act, the appellant published  on
	September 27, 1969 and November 29, 1969 in the	 "Statesman"
	and  the Gazette of India respectively a tariff laying	down
	the fees, charges and royalties that it proposed to  collect
	for the grant of licences for performance in public of works
	in  respect of which it claimed to be an assignee  of  copy-
	rights	and  to have authority to grant	 the  aforesaid	 li-
	cences.	 A number of persons including various	associations
	of  producers  of cinematograph films  including  the  sound
	track  thereof and the Cinematograph Exhibitors	 Association
	of  India filed objections in respect of the  tariff  before
	the  Copyright Board in accordance with the  provisions	  of
	<a href="/doc/1695816/" id="a_4">section 34</a> of the Act, repudiating the rights of the  appel-
	lant.	The  Copyright Board held  : (1) In the	 absence  of
	proof  to  the contrary, the composers of lyrics  and  music
	retained  the copyright in their musical works	incorporated
	in  the	 sound track of cinematograph  films  provided	such
	lyrical	 and musical works were printed on written and	that
	they  could  assign the performing right in  public  to	 the
	appellant.  (2) The tariff as published by the appellant was
	reasonable.   (3) The appellant had the right to  grant	 li-
	cences	for  the public performance of music  in  the  sound
	track  of copyrighted Indian cinematograph films and (4)  It
	could  collect	fees, royalties and charges  in	 respect  of
	those  films  w.e.f. the date on which the tariff  was	pub-
	lished in the Gazette of India.	 The High Court allowed	 the
	appeal	preferred by the respondents under<a href="/doc/1528325/" id="a_5"> s. 72</a> of the	 Act
	and held: (i) Unless there is a contract to the contrary   a
	composer  who composes a lyric or music for the	 first	time
	for valuable consideration for a cinematograph film does not
	acquire	 any   copyright either in respect of  film  or	 its
	sound  track  which he is capable of assigning.	 (ii)  Under
	proviso (b) to <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_6">section 17</a> of the Act, the owner of the	film
	at whose instance the composition is made becomes the  first
	owner of the copyright in the composition. (iii) The compos-
	er  can claim a copyright in his work only if  there  is  an
	express agreement between him and the owner of the cinemato-
	graph film reserving his copyright.  (iv) Though <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_7">section  18</a>
	of  the Act confers power to make a contract of	 assignment.
	the power can be exercised only when there is an existing or
	future right to be assigned and that in the circumstances of
	the  present case, assignment, if any, of the  copyright  in
	any future work is of no effect.
	     In	 appeal by certificate to this Court, the  appellant
	contended (1) The author (composer) of a literary or musical
	work has copyright which includes. inter alia. the exclusive
	right (a) to perform the work in public and
	207
	      (b)  to  make any cinematograph film or  a  record  in
	respect	 of  the work. (2) That copyright in a	literary  or
	musical work is infringed by any person if without a licence
	granted	 to  him by the owner of the copyright, he  makes  a
	cinematograph  film  in respect of the work or	perform	 the
	work  in public by  exhibiting the cinematograph film.	 (3)
	If  a person desires to exhibit in public   a  cinematograph
	film  containing a musical work,  he has to take  the	per-
	mission not only of the owner of the copyright in the  cine-
	matograph  film but also the permission of the owner of	 the
	copyright in the literary or musical   work which is  incor-
	porated in the cinematograph film, as according to<a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_8"> s. 13(4)</a>
	of  the	 Act,  the copyright in a cinematograph	 film  or  a
	record does not effect	  the separate copyright in any work
	in respect of which or a substantial part  of which the film
	or  as the case may be, the record is made (4).	 The  provi-
	sions  of <a href="/doc/1395679/" id="a_9">section 17(b)</a> of the Act have no application to  a
	literary  or musical work or the separate copyright  therein
	and do not take away the copyright in  a literary or musical
	work  embodied	in  a cinematograph  film.   (5)   The	only
	modes in which the author of a literary work or musical work
	ceases to be  the owner of copyright in the work are (a)  by
	assigning  under<a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_10"> s. 18(b)</a> by relinquishment under<a href="/doc/1614468/" id="a_11"> s. 21</a>	 and
	(c) by the composer composing the work	in the course of his
	employment  under a contract of service with an employer  in
	which  case the employer becomes the owner of the  copyright
	in  the	 musical work.	(6) In the case of an assignment  of
	copyright in future work   and the employment of the  author
	to produce a work under a contract of  service, the question
	of  priorities will be decided according to  the  principles
	"where equities are equal, the first in time shall prevail".
	The  respondent's  contentions were (i) Unless	a  music  is
	notationally  written, printed or graphically reproduced  it
	is  not a musical work within the meaning of  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_12">Copyright	 Act</a>
	and there is no copyright in songs or orchestral pieces sung
	or  played  directly   without its notation  being  written.
	(ii) Since a "cinematograph film" is defined in <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_13">section 2(f)</a>
	of  the	 Act as including the sound track  and	the  "cinema
	tograph"  is  required to be construed to include  any	work
	produced  by  any  process analogous to	 cinematography	 the
	owner  of the cinematograph film is  the first owner of	 the
	copyright  therein  including the right of the	composer  of
	the literary or musical work incorporated in the sound track
	of the film. (iii) In the case of the film in which a  lyric
	(which literally means a short poem  directly expressing the
	poet's	own  thoughts and sentiments  in  instances  failing
	within	the  purview of the expression	"literary  work"  as
	defined	 in <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_14">section 2(0)</a>  of the Act  has been	plagiarised,
	there  will be copyright in the film vesting	in the	pro-
	ducer.	 (iv)  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_15">The  Act</a> confers a separate  copyright  of  a
	cinematograph film as a film, its author under<a href="/doc/1655540/" id="a_16"> s. 2(d)(v)</a> of
	the  Act  being the owner  of the film at the  time  of	 its
	completion.  (v) In the case of a lyric or music incorporat-
	ed  under the sound track of a cinematograph film, since  in
	<a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_17">section	 2(f)</a>  of the Act cinematograph	 film  includes	 its
	sound  track   and   <a href="/doc/130165203/" id="a_18">section  13(1)(b)</a> of  the	Act  confers
	copyright on the cinematograph film and <a href="/doc/71324687/" id="a_19">section	 14(c)</a>	(ii)
	of  the Act confers on the. owner of copyright the right  to
	cause the film in so far as it consists of visual images  to
	be seen in public and in so far	 as it consists of songs  to
	be  heard in public, it is not necessary for the owner	  of
	the  cinematograph  film  to secure the	 permission  of	 the
	composer of  the   lyric or of the music incorporated in the
	sound  track  of a cinematograph film	 for  exhibiting  or
	causing	 the exhibition of the sound portion of the film  in
	public or for causing the records of the sound track of	 the
	film  to be heard in   public.	(vii) It is not	 correct  to
	say that under<a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_20"> s. 17</a> proviso (b) in order that the  producer
	of  the	 cinematograph	film should have  copyright  in	 the
	literary  or musical work incorporated in it, the making  of
	the entire film should be commissioned.	 <a href="/doc/1395679/" id="a_21">Section 17(b)</a>	will
	equally apply if someone is commissioned to make any  compo-
	nent part of a cinematograph film such as a lyric or musical
	 work  i.e. when such component of the film is made  at	 the
	instance  of a film   producer for  valuable  consideration,
	the copyright for such component shall as  well vest in	 the
	producer.  (viii) <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_22">As the Act</a> confers a separate copyright on
	a    cinematograph film as a film the producer can  exercise
	both the rights conferred on him under<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_23"> s. 141(c)(ii)</a> of	 the
	Act and all that <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_24">section 13(4)</a> of the Act (when	 applicable)
	provides is that the rights created by <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_25">section 14(1)(a)</a>	 and
	(b) shall coexist with those created by <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_26">section 14(1)(e)</a> and
	(d) of the Act.
	Dismissing the appeal the Court,
	HELD: (Per Krishna Iyer, J. concurring)
	208
	    (1) Copyright in a cinema film exists in law but <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_27">section
	13(4)</a>  of  the Act preserves the separate  survival  in	 its
	individuality  of a copyright enjoyed by any  work  notwith-
	standing  its confluence in the film.  This  persistence  of
	the  aesthetic	personality  of	 the  intellectual  property
	cannot	cut  down the copyright of the film qua	 film.	 The
	exclusive  right, otherwise, called copyright, in the'	case
	of a musical work extends to all the sub rights spelt out in
	<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_28">section	 14(1)</a>	(a).  A harmonious construction, of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_29"> s.	 14</a>,
	which  is  the	integral yoga of copyright  shows  that	 the
	artiste enjoys his  copyright in the musical _work the	film
	producer    is	 the   master	of   his   combination	  of
	artistic .pieces and the two can. happily co-exist and	need
	not conflict. [223 A-C]
	     (2) The boundaries of composite creations of art  which
	are  at	 once individual and collective may be	viewed	from
	different  angles.   In	 a cosmic perspective,	a  thing  of
	beauty	has no boundary and is humanity's property  but	  in
	the  materialist plane on which artistes thrive private	 and
	exclusive  estate  inert subsists.  The enigmatic  smale  of
	Mona  Lisa is the timeless heritage of	mankind,  but,	till
	liberated  by  the prescribed passage of time,	the  private
	copy right of the human maker says, "hands off. [223 F-G]
	    (3)	 The  film producer has the sole right	to  exercise
	what  is  his entitlement under <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_30">section 14(1)(c)</a>  qua  film.
	But,  he cannot trench on the composer's copyright which  he
	does only if the 'music' is performed or produced  or repro-
	duced separately, in violation of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_31">section 14(1)(a)</a>.  A	film
	may   be caused to be exhibited as a film but the pieces  of
	music cannot be picked out of the sound track and played  in
	the  cinema or the theatre.  To do that is the privilege  of
	the  composer  and that right of his is not drowned  in	 the
	film' copyright except where there is special provision such
	as <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_32">section 17</a>, proviso (c).  Beyond exhibiting the film as a
	cinema	show if the producer plays the songs  separately  to
	attract	 an audience or for other reasons he  infringes	 the
	composer's  copyright, the copyright of the composer or	 the
	<a href="/doc/190834393/" id="a_33">Performing   Act</a>s  Society comes into play, if	a  music  is
	played,	 whether in a restaurant or aeroplane or radio	sta-
	tion or cinema theatre. [223 C-E]
	    (4)	 <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_34">Section  14</a> has in its careful arrangement  of	 the
	right	belonging  each copyright has a certain	 melody	 and
	harmony	 to music which is to loose the sense of  the  same.
	Our  copyright statute protects the composite  cinematograph
	work produced by lay out of heavy money and many talents but
	does  not  extinguish the copyrightable component  parts  in
	toto.	The music which has merged through the sound  track,
	into the motion picture is copyright by the producer but, on
	account	 of  this monopoly, the music  composer's  copyright
	does not perish.  The twin rights can co-exist each  fulfil-
	ing itself in its delectable distinctiveness. [224 A-B]
	Observation:
	    Apart  from	 the  music composed,  the  singer  must  be
	conferred  a   right. Copyrighted music is not	the  soulful
	tune, the superb singing, the glorious voice or the  wonder-
	ful rendering.	It is the melody or harmony reduced to print
	writing or graphic form of musical works.  Author as defined
	in s.2(d) in relation to a musical work is only the composer
	and  <a href="/doc/1454107/" id="a_35">section 16</a> confines copyright to those works which	 are
	recognised  by the Act, which means the composer  alone	 has
	copyright  in a musical work and the singer has	 none.	This
	disentitlement of the musician or group of musical  artistes
	to copyright is un-Indian because the major attraction which
	lends  monetary	 value to a musical performance is  not	 the
	music maker so much as the musician. Perhaps both deserve to
	be recognised by the copyright law, because art in one sense
	depends on the ethos and the aesthetic best of a people	 and
	while  universal  protection of intellectual  and  aesthetic
	property of creators of "works" is an international  obliga-
	tion each country in its law must protect such rights  wher-
	ever originally is contributed. [224 E-H]
	Per Jaswant Singh J.
	    (1)	 The  existing and future right of  music   ........
	composer and lyrics in their respective works as defined  in
	the  Act is capable of assignment subject to the  conditions
	mentioned in <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_36">section 18</a> of the Act as also in <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_37">section
	209</a>
	<a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_38">19</a> of the Act which requires an assignment to be in writing,
	signed by the assigner or by his duly authorised agent. [215
	D-E]
	     (2) The interpretation of clause (f) of <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_39">section 2</a> which
	is  not	 exhaustive leaves no room for doubt  when  read  in
	conjunction with <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_40">section 14(1)(c)(iii)</a>, that the term  cine-
	matograph  film includes a sound track associated  with	 the
	film. [220 D]
	    (3)	 A  harmonious and rational  instead  of  mechanical
	construction of<a href="/doc/1695816/" id="a_41"> s. 34</a>,<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_42"> s. 14(1)(a)(iii)</a> and<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_43"> s.	14(1)(c)(ii)</a>
	will be:
	    (A)	 Once the author of a lyric or a musical work  parts
	with  a portion of his copyright by authorising a film	pro-
	ducer  to make a cinematograph film in respect of  his	work
	and  thereby  to have his work incorporated or	recorded  in
	sound track of a cinematograph film, the latter.acquires  by
	virtue	of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_44">section 14(1)(c)</a> of the Act on completion of	 the
	cinematograph film a copyright	which  gives him the  exclu-
	sive  right,  inter alma, of performing the work  in  public
	that  is,  to  cause the film in so far as  it	consists  of
	visual	images	to  be seen in public and in so	 far  as  it
	consists  of  the acoustic portion including a lyric  or   a
	musical	 work  to be heard in public  without  securing	 any
	further	 permission  of	 the author (composer) of the  lyric
	or a musical work for the performance of the work in public.
	A  distinct copyright in the aforesaid	circumstances  comes
	to  vest in the cinematograph film as a whole which  relates
	both to copying the film and to its performance in public.
	    (B)	 If  an author (composer) of a lyric  or  a  musical
	work   authorises  a cinematograph film producer to  make  a
	cinematograph film of his composition by recording it on the
	sound  track or a cinematograph film, he cannot complain  of
	the  infringement of his copyright if the author (owner)  of
	the cinematograph film causes the lyric or the musical	work
	recorded  on  the sound track  of  the film to be  heard  in
	public	and nothing contained in <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_45">section 13(4)</a> of  the	 Act
	can  operate  to affect the rights acquired  by	 the  author
	(owner)	 of  the film by virtue of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_46">section 14(1)(c)</a>  of	 the
	Act.
	    (C) The composer of a lyric or musical work retains	 the
	right  of performing it in public for profit otherwise	than
	as a part of cinematograph film and he cannot be  restrained
	from  doing so.	 In other words, the author (composer) of  a
	lyric  or  musical work who has authorised  a  cinematograph
	film  producer to make a cinematograph film of his work	 and
	thereby	  permitted   him  to	appropriate  his   work	  by
	incorporating  or  recording  it on the	 sound	track  of  a
	cinematograph film cannot restrain the author (owner) of the
	film  from  causing  the acoustic portion of the film to  be
	performed  or projected or screened in public for profit  or
	from  making any record embodying the recording in any	part
	of  the	 sound track associated with the film  by  utilising
	such  sound track or from communicating or  authorising	 the
	communication  of  the film by radio diffusion,	 as  <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_47">section
	14(1)(c)</a>  of  the  Act expressly permits the  owner  of	 the
	copyright  of a cinematograph film to do all  these  things.
	In such cases the author (owner)  of the cinematograph	film
	cannot	be  said to wrongfully	appropriate  anything  which
	belongs to the composer of the lyric or musical work.
	    Any	 other construction would not only render  the	 ex-
	press	provisions   of clause (f), (m), (y) of	 <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_48">section  2</a>,
	<a href="/doc/130165203/" id="a_49">section 13(1)(b)</a> ,red <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_50">section 14(1)(c)</a> of the Act otiose but
	would also defeat the intention of the legislature which  in
	view of the growing importance of the cinematograph film  as
	a  powerful  media  of expression and  the  highly  complex,
	technical  and scientific process and heavy  capital  outlay
	involved  in  its production has sought to  recognise  as  a
	separate entity and to treat a record embodying the  record-
	ing in any part of the sound track associated with the	film
	by  utilising such sound track as something distinct from  a
	record as ordinarily understood. [220 G-H; 221 A-G]
	    (4)Clauses (d), (v), (f), (m), (v) and (y) of <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_51">section 2</a>,
	<a href="/doc/196539054/" id="a_52">section 13(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_53">14(1)(c)</a>, provisos (b) and (c) to  <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_54">section
	17</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/535461/" id="a_55">section 22</a> and <a href="/doc/423621/" id="a_56">26</a> of the Act  abundantly  make	  it
	clear  that protectable copyright  (comprising a  bundle  of
	exclusive  rights mentioned in <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_57">section 14(1)(c)</a> of  the	 Act
	comes to
	210
	vest in a cinematograph film on its completion which is said
	to  take place when the visual portion and  audible  portion
	are synchronized. [221 H; 222 A]
	  (5)  The rights of music  ........  composer	or  lyricist
	can  be defeated by the producer of a cinematograph film  in
	the manner laid down in proviso (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_58">section 17</a> of
	the  Act.  In both the. cases falling under clauses (b)	 and
	(c)  of	<a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_59"> s. 17</a>, a cinematograph film producer  becomes	the.
	first  owner of the copyright and no copyright	subsists  in
	the composer of the lyric or music so  composed unless there
	is a contract to the contrary between the composer  of	 the
	lyric or music on one hand and the producer of the cinemato-
	graph film on the other. [222 D-F]

<p id="p_9">	    The	 facts	giving rise to the appeal  are:	 The  Indian
	Performing  Right Society Ltd. (hereinafter referred to	 for
	the sake of brevity as 'the IPRS'), the appellant before us,
	was  incorporated in the State of Maharashtra on August	 23,
	1959, as a company limited by guarantee, for the purpose  of
	carrying  on  business in India of issuing or  granting	 li-
	cences for performance in public of all existing and  future
	Indian	Musical works in which copyright subsists in  India.
	The  incorporation of the IPRS was in terms of <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_62">section	2(r)</a>
	of the Copyright  Act,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">	211</span>
	1957 (Act 14 of 1957) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act')
	which was enacted after taking into consideration the Report
	of  the (British) Copyright Committee,1952, the	 suggestions
	of the various Ministries of the Government of India and the
	State  Governments,   the  Indian Universities	and  certain
	interested  industries and associations who were invited  to
	send  their comments on the subjects of copyright. The	IPRS
	has  amongst  its members the composers	 of  musical  works,
	authors	 of  literary and dramatic works  and  artists.	  In
	accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1186979/" id="a_63">section 33</a> of the Act, the
	IPRS  published on September 27, 1969 and November 29,	1969
	in  the 'Statesman' and the Gazette of India respectively  a
	tariff	laying down the fees, charges and royalties that  it
	proposed  to collect for the grant of licences far  perform-
	ance in public of works in respect of which-it claimed to be
	an assignee of copyrights and to have authority to grant the
	aforesaid  licences.  A number of persons including  various
	associations of producers of cinematograph films who claimed
	to  be	the owners of such films including the	sound  track
	thereof	 and  the Cinematograph	 Exhibitors  Association  of
	India filed objections in respect of the aforesaid tariff in
	accordance  with  the provisions of <a href="/doc/1695816/" id="a_64">section 34</a> of-  the	 Act
	repudiating  the claim of the IPRS that it had on behalf  of
	its  members  authority	 to  grant licences for. performance
	in  public of all existing and	future	musical works  which
	are incorporated in the sound track  of	 cinematograph films
	in  which  copyright may subsist in India or  the  right  to
	collect in relation thereto any fees, charges or  royalties.
	The  association  of producers averted inter alia that their
	members engaged	 composers and sound writers under contracts
	of  service  for  composing songs to be	 utilised  in  their
	films;	that the musical works prepared by the composers  of
	lyric  and music under contract of service with	 their	mem-
	bers-producers	of  the	 cinematograph	films--having	been
	utilised and incorporated in the sound track of the cinemat-
	ograph	films produced by the latter, all the  rights  which
	subsisted  in  the composers and their works  including	 the
	right  to perform them in public became the property of	 the
	producers  of the cinematograph films and no copyright	sub-
	sisted	in  the	 composers which they could  assign  to	 and
	become	the basis of the claim of the IPRS under <a href="/doc/1186979/" id="a_65">section  33</a>
	of  the Act; that their members i.e. the producers of  cine-
	matograph  films being the authors and	first owners of	 the
	copyright  in the cinematograph films produced by  them	 had
	the exclusive right inter alia to cause the said films in so
	far  as the same consisted of sounds (which include  musical
	works)	to be heard in public as also the exclusive right to
	make records embodying the sound track of the films produced
	by  them (including any musical work  incorporated  therein)
	and to cause the said records to be beard in public; that in
	the  making of a cinematograph film as contemplated  by	 the
	Act a composer composes a lyric or music under a contract of
	service or for valuable consideration which is substantial a
	music director sets it to tunes and imparts music to it	 and
	a  singer  sings the same but none of them nor	any  one  of
	their aforesaid works can and have any separate	 copyrights;
	that motion picture is the combination of all arts and music
	in  the sound track which cannot be detached from  the	film
	itself;	 that the purpose of making a motion picture is	 not
	only to complete it but also to publicly exhibit it through-
	out the	 world; that having regard to the provisions of	 the
	Act the' copyright in the case of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">	212</span>
	a  cinematograph  film	vests in the owner of  the  film  as
	defined	 in  <a href="/doc/1655540/" id="a_66">section 2(d)</a> (v) of the Act; and  that  in	 the
	premises  any  assignment purporting to have  been  made  in
	favour of the IPRS was void and of no effect and was incapa-
	ble  of	 conferring any rights whatsoever  in  such  musical
	works on the IPRS.
</p><p id="p_10">	    The	 Cinematograph Exhibitors Association of India	also
	filed objections challenging the right of the IPRS to charge
	fees  and royalties in respect of performance in  public  of
	the  musical  works incorporated in the sound track  of	 the
	films.	 Besides  raising  contentions	identical  to  those
	raised	by  various associations of producers  they  averred
	that  copyright in a cinematograph film which vested in	 the
	producers meant copyright in the entirety of the film as  an
	integrated  unit including the musical work incorporated  in
	the  sound  track of the film and the right to	perform	 the
	work  in public; that in accordance with the agreement	with
	the distributors of films the exhibition  of   cinematograph
	film includes the right to play in public the music which is
	an integral part and parcel of the film; that the  producers
	lease  out  copyrights of public performance  of  the  films
	vested in them to the distributors who give those rights  to
	the  exhibitors	 an agreement and that	when   an  exhibitor
	takes  a  licence  for exhibition, it  is  complete  in	 all
	respects  and a third party like the IPRS cannot  claim	 any
	licence fee  from  the exhibitors.
</p><p id="p_11">	    On	the  aforesaid objections being referred to  it	 for
	determination  under  <a href="/doc/1257758/" id="a_67">section 35</a> of the Act,  the  Copyright
	Board expressed the view that in the absence of proof to the
	contrary,  the	composers of lyrics and music  retained	 the
	copyright  in their musical works incorporated in the  sound
	track  of  cinematograph films provided	 such  lyrical	 and
	musical	 works were printed or written and that	 they  could
	assign	the  performing right in public to  the	 IPRS.	 The
	Copyright Board further held that the tariff as published by
	the IPRS was reasonable and the IPRS had the right to  grant
	licences for the  public  performance  of music in the sound
	track of copyrighted Indian cinematograph films and it could
	collect	 fees,	royalties and charges in  respect  of  those
	films  with  effect from the date on which  the	 tariff	 was
	published  in  the Gazette of India.
</p><p id="p_12">	    Aggrieved  by the decision of the Copyright	 Board,	 the
	objectors preferred an appeal under <a href="/doc/1528325/" id="a_68">section 72</a> of the Act to
	the  High  Court which allowed the same holding that  unless
	there is a contract to the contrary, a composer who composes
	a lyric or music for the first time for valuable  considera-
	tion for a cinematograph film does not acquire any copyright
	either	in  respect of film or its sound track which  he  is
	capable of assigning and that under proviso. (b) to  <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_69">section
	17</a> of the Act, the owner of the film at whose instance,	 the
	composition  is made, becomes the first owner of  the  copy-
	right  in   the	 composition.  The High Court  further	held
	that  "the composer can claim a copyright  in his work	only
	if there is an express agreement between him  and  the owner
	of  the	 cinematograph film reserving his  copyright".	 The
	High  Court  also held that "though <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_70">section 18</a>	of  the	 Act
	confers	 power to make a contract of assignment,  the  power
	can be exercised only when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">	213</span>
	there  is  an 'existing or future right to be  assigned	 and
	that  in the circumstances of the present case,	 assignment,
	if  any,  of  the  copyright in any future  work  is  of  no
	effect".   Dissatisfied with this decision, the IPRS  has,as
	already stated, come up in appeal to this Court.
	    The copyright law in our country being fairly complicat-
	ed  because  of the involved language in which some  of	 its
	provisions are	couched and the case being of first  impres-
	sion,  learned counsel for the	parties have tried  hard  to
	help  us in solving the knotty points by  advancing  copious
	and able arguments.  Appearing on behalf of the	  appellant,
	Mr.  Ashok  Sen has urged that the author  (composer)  of  a
	literary or musical work has copyright which includes  inter
	alia  the  exclusive right (a) to perform the work in public
	'and  (b)  to  make any cinematograph film or  a  record  in
	respect	 of  the  work; that copyright	in   a	literary  or
	musical work is infringed by any person if without a licence
	granted	 to  him by the owner of the copyright, he  makes  a
	cinematograph  film in respect of the work or  performs	 the
	work in public by exhibiting the cinematograph film; that if
	a  person desires to exhibit in public a cinematograph	film
	containing  a musical work, he has  to take  the  permission
	not only of the owner of the copyright in the  cinematograph
	film but also the permission of the owner of the   copyright
	in the literary or musical work which is incorporated in the
	cinematograph film, as according to <a href="/doc/883595/" id="a_71">section 1</a>. 3 (4) of	 the
	Act, the copyright in a cinematograph film or a record	does
	not affect the separate copyright in any work i.n respect of
	which or a substantial part of	which,	the film, or as	 the
	case  may  be, the record is made; that	 the  provisions  of
	<a href="/doc/1395679/" id="a_72">section	 17(b)</a> of the Act have no application to a  literary
	or musical work or the separate copyright therein and do not
	take  away the copyright in a literary or musical  work	 em-
	bodied in a cinematograph film; that the only modes in which
	the  author of a literary or musical work ceases to  be	 the
	owner of copyright m the work are (a) by assignment, '(b) by
	relinquishment and (c) by the composer composing the work in
	'the  course of his employment under a contract of   service
	with   an employer in which case, the employer	becomes	 the
	owner of the copyright in the musical work; that in the case
	of an assignment of copyright in future work and the employ-
	ment  of the author to produce	a work under a	contract  of
	service,  the question of priorities  will  be	decided	 ac-
	cording	 to  the principle "where equities  are	 equal,	 the
	first in time shall prevail".

	respondents  6, 7 and 8, and Mr. J.L. Nain, learned  counsel
	for  respondent 19, who followed Mr. Chaudhary have  on	 the
	other  hand submitted that the dispute in the instant  case,
	according  to  the petition of appeal, the judgment  of	 the
	Copyright Board and the judgment of the Calcutta High  Court
	is  confined to the sound track associated with a  cinemato-
	graph  film  (which expression, according  to  Copinger	 and
	Skone James on COPYRIGHT, means "any record of sounds  which
	is incorporated in any print, negative, tape or other  arti-
	cle  on which the film or part of it, in so far as  it	con-
	sists  of visual images, is recorded, or which is issued  by
	the maker

	Of  the film for use in conjunction with such an  article");
	that the contention advanced on behalf of the appellant that
	copyright in a literary or musical work incorporated in	 the
	sound track of a cinematograph film vests in the composer of
	literary or musical work and when the cinematograph film  is
	performed i.e. exhibited in public, the composer is entitled
	to fee or royalty in that  behalf  and	since  the appellant
	is the assignee of the copyright from the composers, it has
	the right to collect the fee or royalty is entirely unfound-
	ed;  that  unlike (the law) in England, in  India  unless  a
	music is notationally written, printed or graphically repro-
	duced,	it  is not musical work within the  meaning  of	 the
	<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_73">Copyright Act</a> and there is no copyright 'in songs or orches-
	tral  pieces  sung or played directly without  its  notation
	being written' that since a 'cinematograph film' is  defined
	in  <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_74">section  2(f)</a> of the 'Act as including the	sound  track
	and  the  'cinematograph'  is required to  be  construed  to
	include any work produced by any process analogous to  cine-
	matography,  the  owner	 of  the cinematograph film  is	 the
	firt  owner of the copyright therein including the right  of
	the composer of the literary or musical work incorporated in
	the sound track of the film; that in the case of the film in
	which a lyric (which literally means a short  poem  directly
	expressing the poet's own thoughts and sentiments in   stan-
	zas  falling within the purview of the expression  "literary
	work"	as   defined in <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_75">section 2(0)</a> of the  Act)  has	been
	plagiarised, there will be copyright in the film vesting  in
	the producer; that the Act confers a separate copyright on a
	cinematograph  film  as	 a film, its  author  under  <a href="/doc/1655540/" id="a_76">section
	2(d)(v)</a>	 of the Act being the owner of the film at the	time
	of  its	 completion; that in the case of a  lyric  or  music
	incorporated  in  the  sound track of a cinematograph  film,
	since  under  <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_77">section 2(f)</a> of the  Act,	 cinematograph	film
	includes  its  sound track and <a href="/doc/130165203/" id="a_78">section 13(1)(b)</a> of  the	 Act
	confers copyright on the  cinematograph	 film  and   <a href="/doc/71324687/" id="a_79">section
	14(c)</a> (ii) of the Act confers on the owner of copyright the.
	right  to cause the film in so far as it consists of  visual
	images	to be  seen  in public and in so far as it  consists
	of songs to be heard in public, it is not necessary for	 the
	owner of the cinematograph film to secure  the permission of
	the  composer of the lyric or of the music  incorporated  in
	the  sound track of a cinematograph film for  exhibiting  or
	causing	 the exhibition of the sound portion of the film  in
	public or for causing the records of the sound track of	 the
	film to be heard in public.  They have further urged that it
	is not correct to say that under <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_80">section 17</a>, proviso (b)  in
	order  that the producer of the	 cinematograph film   should
	have copyright in the literary or musical work	incorporated
	in  it,	  the making of the entire film	 should	 be  commis-
	sioned.	  According to	counsel for respondents	 <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_81">section  17</a>
	proviso (b) will equally  apply	 if someone is	commissioned
	to make any component part of a cinematograph film such as a
	lyric  or musical work i.e. when such component of the	film
	is  made at the instance of a film  producer  for   valuable
	consideration,	the  copyright for such component  shall  as
	well  vest in the producer; that as the Act confers a  sepa-
	rate  copyright on a cinematograph film as a film, the	pro-
	ducer  can exercise both the rights conferred on  him  under
	<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_82">section 14(1)</a>.(c)(ii) of the Act and all that <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_83">section  13(4)</a>

	those  created by <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_85">section 14(1)(c)</a> and (d) of the Act,	e.g.
	under clause (a),  the

	make  a	 cinematograph	film, the licensee  shall  have	 the
	rights	provided in clauses (c) and (d) of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_87">section 14(1)</a>  of
	the Act in respect of the film.
</p><p id="p_14">	    We	have given our earnest consideration to the  submis-
	sions  made by learned counsel for the parties.	 So  far  as
	the  first  part of the question reproduced  above  is	con-
	cerned,	 there	is no dispute between	the  parties.	Both
	sides  are agreed that in view of the provisions of  <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_88">section
	18</a>  of	the  Act, the material portion of  which  lays	down
	that--"(1) the owner of the copyright in an existing work-or
	the prospective owner of the copyright in a future work	 may
	assign to any person the copyright either wholly or partial-
	ly and either generally or subject to limitations and either
	for  the whole term of the copyright or any  part   thereof;
	provided that in the case of the assignment of copyright  in
	any future work, the assignment shall take effect only	when
	the  work comes into existence, (2)where the assignee  of  a
	copyright  becomes  entitled to any right comprised  in	 the
	copyright, the assignee as respects the rights so  assigned,
	and the assignor as respects the rights not assigned,  shall
	be  treated  for the purposes of this Act as  the  owner  of
	copyright  and the provisions of this Act shall have  effect
	accordingly",  the  first  part of the	question  should  be
	answered  in the affirmative.  It is  accordingly held	that
	an existing and future right of music  ......  composer	 and
	lyricist  in their respective 'works' as defined in the	 Act
	is capable of assignment subject to the conditions mentioned
	in  <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_89">section 18</a> of the Act, as also in <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_90">section 19</a> of the	 Act
	which requires an assignment to be in writing, signed by the
	assignor or by his duly authorised agent.
</p><p id="p_15">	    It	is the second part of the question which has been  a
	hot bed	 of controversy between the parties that has got  to
	be  tackled.  The main point for determination in regard  to
	this  part of the question is whether the composer of  lyric
	or  musical work (which in terms of <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_91">section 2(p)</a> of the	 Act
	means  only a notationally written, printed  or	 graphically
	produced  or  reproduced music) retains a copyright  in	 the
	lyric  or musical work if he grants a licence or  permission
	to an author (owner) of a cinematograph film for its  incor-
	poration in the sound track  of	 a cinematograph film.	 For
	a  proper appreciation and determination of the	 contentions
	raised	before us, it is necessary to notice certain  provi-

<p id="p_18">	    The	 interpretation clause (f) of <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_99">section  2</a>  reproduced
	above,	which  is not exhaustive, leaves no room  for  doubt
	when read in conjunction with <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_100">section 14(1)(c)(iii)</a> that the
	term "cinematograph film" includes a sound track  associated
	with the film.	In the light of these provisions, it  cannot
	be  disputed that a "cinematograph film" is  to be taken  to
	include the sounds embodied in a sound track which is  asso-
	ciated with the film.  <a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_101">Section 13</a> recognises  'cinematograph
	film'  as  a distinct and separate class of 'work'  and	 de-
	clares	that  copyright	 shall	subsist	 therein  throughout
	India.	<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_102">Section 14</a> which enumerates the fights that  subsist
	in various classes of works mentioned in <a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_103">section 13</a> provides
	that  copyright in case of a literary or musical work  means
	inter alia (a) the right to perform or cause the performance
	of  the	 work  in public and (b) to make  or  authorise	 the
	making of a cinematograph film or a record in respect of the
	work.  It also provides that copyright in case of  cinemato-
	graph film means. among other rights, the right of  exhibit-
	ing or causing the exhibition m public of the  cinematograph
	film  i.e. of causing the film in so far as it	consists  of
	visual images to be seen in public and in so far it consists
	of sounds to be heard in public. <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_104">Section 13(4)</a> on which	 Mr.
	Ashok  Sen has leaned heavily in support of his	 contentions
	lays  down that the copyright in a cinematograph film  or  a
	record	shall not affect the separate copyright in any	work
	in  respect  of which or a substantial part of	which,	 the
	film,  or as the case may be, the record is made.  Though  a
	conflict  may at first sight seem to exist  between  <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_105">section
	13(4)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_106">section 14(1)</a> (a) (iii) on the one hand and	sec-
	tion  14(1)  (c) (ii) on the other, a close scrutiny  and  a
	harmonious and rational instead of a mechanical construction
	of  the said provisions cannot but lead to the	irresistible
	conclusion that once the author of a lyric or a musical work
	parts with a portion of his copyright by authorising a	film
	producer to make a cinematograph film in respect of his work
	and  thereby to have, his work incorporated or	recorded  on
	the sound track of a cinematograph film, the latter acquires
	by  virtue of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_107">section 14(1)</a>'(e) of the Act on completion  of
	the cinematograph film a copyright which gives
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">	221</span>
	him the exclusive right inter alia of performing the work in
	public	i.e. to cause the film in so far as it	consists  of
	visual	images	to  be seen in public and in so	 far  as  it
	consists  of  the acoustic portion including a	lyric  or  a
	musical	 work  to be heard in public  without  securing	 any
	further permission of the author (composer)  of	 the   lyric
	or   a musical work for the performance of the work in	pub-
	lic.  In other	words, a distinct copyright in the aforesaid
	circumstances comes to	vest in the cinematograph film as  a
	whole which in the words of  British Copyright Committee set
	up  in	1951  relates both to copying the film	and  to	 its
	performance  in public.	 Thus if an author (composer)  of  a
	lyric  or musical work authorises a cinematograph film	pro-
	ducer  to  make a cinematograph film of his  composition  by
	recording it on the sound track of a cinematograph film,  he
	cannot complain of the infringement of his copyright if	 the
	author (owner) of the cinematograph film causes the lyric or
	musical	 work recorded on the sound track of the film to  be
	heard  in public and nothing contained in <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_108">section  13(4)</a>  of
	the  Act  on  which Mr. Ashok Sen has  strongly	 relied	 can
	operate to affect the rights acquired by the author (owner)
	of  the film by virtue of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_109">section 14(1)(c)</a> of the Act.	 The
	composer of a lyric or a musical work, however, retains	 the
	right  of performing it in public for profit otherwise	than
	as  a  part of the cinematograph film and he cannot  be	 re-
	strained  from doing so.  In other words, the author   (com-
	poser)	 of lyric  or musical work  who	 has   authorised  a
	cinematograph film producer to. make  a	 cinematograph	film
	of his	work  and  has	thereby permitted  him to  appropri-
	ate  his   work	 by   incorporating  or	  recording  it	  on
	the  sound track of a cinematograph  film  cannot   restrain
	the   author (owner) of the film from causing  the  acoustic
	portion of the film to be performed or projected or screened
	in public for profit or from making any record embodying the
	recording in any part of the sound track associated with the
	film by utilising such sound track or from communicating  or
	authorising  the communication	of the film by	radio-diffu-
	sion,  as <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_110">section 14(1)(c)</a> of the Act expressly permits	 the
	owner  of the copyright of the cinematograph film to do	 all
	these  things.	In  such cases, the author  (owner)  of	 the
	cinematograph film cannot be said to wrongfully	 appropriate
	anything  which	 belongs to  the composer of  the  lyric  or
	musical work.  Any other construction would not only  render
	the  express provisions of clauses (f), (m), (y) of  <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_111">section
	2</a>,  <a href="/doc/130165203/" id="a_112">section 13(1)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_113">section 14(1)(c)</a> of the Act  otiose
	but  would  also defeat the intention  of  the	Legislature,
	which in view of the growing  importance  of the   cinemato-
	graph  film as	a  powerful media  of expression,  and	 the
	highly	complex	 technical  and scientific process and heavy
	capital	 outlay	 involved in its production, has  sought  to
	recognise  it  as a separate entity and to  treat  a  record
	embodying  the	recording  in any part of  the	sound  track
	associated  with the film by utilising such sound  track  as
	something distinct from	 a record as ordinarily understood.

	bundle of exclusive rights mentioned in <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_120">section 14(1)(c)</a>  of
	the  Act) comes to vest in a cinematograph film on its	com-
	pletion which is said to take place when the visual  portion
	and audible portion are synchronized.
</p><p id="p_21">	    This takes us to the core of the question namely, wheth-
	er the producer of a cinematograph film can defeat the right
	of the composer of music  ....	or lyricst by engaging	him.
	The  key to the solution of this question lies	in  provisos
</p><p id="p_22">	(b) and (c) to <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_121">section 17</a> of the Act reproduced above  which
	put  the  matter beyond doubt.	According to  the  first  of
	these  provisos viz. proviso (b) when a	 cinematograph	film
	producer  commissions a composer of music or a	lyricst	 for
	reward	or valuable consideration for the purpose of  making
	his cinematograph  film, or composing music or lyric  there-
	fore i.e. the sounds for incorporation or absorption in	 the
	sound  track  associated with the  film,  which	 as  already
	indicated, are included in a cinematograph film, he  becomes
	the first owner of the copyright therein 'and no  copyright
	subsists in the composer of the lyric or music	so  composed
	unless	there  is  a contract to the  contrary	between	 the
	composer  of  the  lyric or music on the one  hand  and	 the
	producer of the	 cinematograph film on the other.  The	same
	result	follows	 according to aforesaid proviso (c)  if	 the
	composer  of music or lyric is employed under a contract  of
	service	 or  apprentice.ship to compose the work.   It	 is,
	therefore, crystal clear that the rights of a music composer
	or ....lyricst Can be defeated by the producer of a cinemat-
	ograph film in the manner laid down in provisos (b) and	 (c)
	of  <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_122">section 17</a> of the Act. We are fortified in this view  by
	the  decision in Wallerstein v. Herbert (1867) Vol. 16,	 Law
	Times Reports 453, relied upon by Mr. Sachin Chaudhary where
	it was held that the music composed for reward by the plain-
	tiff  in pursuance of his engagement to give effect to	cer-
	tain  situations  in  the  drama  entitled  "Lady   Andley's
	Secret",  which was to be put on the stage was not an  inde-
	pendent	 composition  but was merely an accessory to  and  a
	Fart and parcel of the drama and the plaintiff did not	have
	any right in the music.
</p><p id="p_23">	For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any  justification
	to  interfere  with the order of  the High   Court.   Conse-
	quently,  the	appeal	fails and is dismissed	but  in	 the
	circumstances of the case without any order as to costs.
	    KRISHNA  IYER,  J.---The judgment just delivered  is  on
	behalf of the Court, which makes this footnote, in a  sense,
	otiose.	  But I do append the abbreviated opinion solely  to
	belight a slightly penumberal area of the law and to voice a
	need  for legislative exploration to protect a category	 now
	left in the cold.
</p><p id="p_24">	    A  cinematograph  is  a felicitous	blend,	a  beautiful
	totality,  a  constellation  of stars, if I  may  use  these
	lovely	imageries to drive home my point, slurring over	 the
	rule  against  mixed metaphor.	Cinema is  more.  than	long
	strips of celluloid, more than miracles in photography, more
	than song, dance and dialogue and indeed, more than dramatic
	story,	exciting  plot, gripping situations  and  marvellous
	acting.	 But it is that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">	223</span>
	ensemble  which	 is the finished  product  of	orchestrated
	performance  by each of the several  participants,  although
	the   components  may, sometimes, in themselves	 be  elegant
	entities.  Copyright in a cinema film exists in law, but <a href="/doc/43316752/" id="a_123"> s.
	13(4)</a>	of the Act preserves the  separate survival, in	 its
	individuality, of a copyright enjoyed by any 'work' notwith-
	standing  its confluence in the film.  This  persistence  of
	the  aesthetic 'personality' of the  intellectual   property
	cannot	cut  down the copyright of the film qua	 film.	 The
	latter right is, as explained earlier in my learned   broth-
	er's  judgment,	 set out indubitably in<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_124"> s. 14(1)(c)</a>.   True,
	the exclusive right, otherwise called copyright, in the case
	of a musical work extends to all the sub-rights spelt out in
	s.  14(1)(a).  A harmonious construction of<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_125"> s. 14</a>, which  is
	the integral yoga of copyrights in creative works, takes  us
	to the soul of the subject.  The artist enjoys his copyright
	in  the musical work, the filmproducer is the master of	 his
	combination  of artistic pieces and the two can happily	 co-
	exist and need not conflict.  What is the modus vivendi ?
	  The  solution is simple.  The film  producer has the	sole
	right to exercise what is his entitlement under<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_126"> s.  14(1)(c)</a>
	qua film, but he cannot trench on I the composer's copyright
	which  he does only if the 'music' is performed or  produced
	or reproduced separately,  in violation of<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_127"> s. 14(1)(a)</a>.	 For
	instance, a film may be caused to be exhibited as a film but
	the pieces of music cannot be picked out of the sound  track
	and  played in the cinema or other theatre.  To do  that  is
	the  privilege of the composer and that right of his is	 not
	crowned in the film copyright except where there is  special
	provision such as in<a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_128"> s. 17</a>, proviso (c).  So, beyond  exhib-
	iting  the film as a cinema show, if the producer plays	 the
	songs separately to attract an audience or for other reason,
	he  infringes  the  composer's copyright.   Anywhere,  in  a
	restaurant or aeroplane or radio station or cinema  theatre,
	if a music is played, there comes into play the copyright of
	the composer or the Performing Arts Society.  These are	 the
	boundaries  of composite creations of art which are at	once
	individual  and	 collective, viewed  from different  angles.
	In 'a cosmic perspective, a thing of beauty has no  boundary
	and  is humanity's property but in the materialist plane  on
	which  artists thrive, private and exclusive estate  in	 art
	subsists.   Man,  the noblest work of the  Infinite  Artist,
	strangely enough, battles for the finite products of his art
	and the secular law, operating on the temporal level, guard-
	ians material works possessing spiritual values.  The  enig-
	matic  small of Mona, Lisa is the timeless heritage of	man-
	kind  but,  till liberated by the  prescribed	passage	  of
	time, the private copyright of the human maker says,  'hands
	off'.
</p><p id="p_25">	 The creative intelligence of man is displayed in  multiform
	ways  of  aesthetic  expression but it	often  happens	that
	economic  systems  so operate that  the	 priceless  divinity
	which  we  call artistic or literary creativity	 in  man  is
	exploited  and	masterS,  whose works  are  invaluable,	 are
	victims of piffling payments.  World opinion in defence	  of
	the human right to intellectual property led to internation-
	al  conventions and municipal laws, commissions,  codes	 and
	organisations,	calculated to protect works of	art.   India
	responded  to this universal need by enacting the  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_129">Copyright
	Act</a>, 1957.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">	224</span>
<p id="p_26">	    Not the recommendations in conventions but provisions in
	municipal laws determine enforceable rightS.  Our  copyright
	statute	 protects the composite cinematograph work  produced
	by  lay-out  of heavy money and many talents  but  does	 not
	extinguish  the copyrightable component parts in toto.	 The
	music	which  has  merged,  through the sound	track,	into
	the  motion picture, is copyrighted by the producer but,  on
	account	 of  this monopoly, the music  composer's  copyright
	does  not perish.  The twin rights can co-exiSt,  each	ful-
	filling	 itself in its delectable distinctiveness.   <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_130">Section
	14</a>  has, in its careful arrangement of the rights  belonging
	to each copyright, has a certain melody and harmony to	miss
	which is to lose the sense of the Scheme.
</p><p id="p_27">	    A  somewhat un-Indian feature we noticed in	 the  Indian
	copyright  Act falls to be mentioned.  Of course, when'	 our
	law  is	 intellectual 'borrowing from  British	reports,  as
	admittedly  it	is, such exoticism  is	possible.   'Musical
	work', as defined in s.2 ( p) reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">			       "(p) musical work means any  combina-
		      tion of melody
			 and harmony or either of them printed,	 re
		      duced  to	 writing  or  otherwise	 graphically
		      produced or reproduced."
</blockquote><p id="p_28">	Therefore,  copyrighted music is not the  soulful tune,	 the
	superb singing, the glorious voice or the wonderful  render-
	ing.  It is the melody or harmony reduced to print,  writing
	or  graphic form.  The Indian music lovers throng to  listen
	and be enthralled or enchanted by the nada brahma, the sweet
	concord	 of  sounds, the rags, the bhava, the lava  and	 the
	sublime	 or  exciting  singing.	 Printed music	is  not	 the
	glamour	 or glory of it, by and large, although the  content
	of  the	 poem  or the lyric or the song	 does  have  appeal.
	Strangely  enough, 'author', as defined in s.2(d), in  rela-
	tion  to  a  musical work, is only the composer	 and <a href="/doc/1454107/" id="a_131"> s.  16</a>
	confies	 'copyright' to those works which are recognised  by
	the  Act.  This means that the composer alone has  copyright
	in  a musical work.  The singer has none.  This	 disentitle-
	ment  of the musician or group of musical artists  to  copy-
	right is un-Indian, because the major attraction which lends
	monetary  value	 to a musical performance is not  the  music
	maker, so much as the musician.	 Perhaps, both deserve to be
	recognised  by the copyright law.  I make  this	 observation
	only because act in one sense, depends on the ethos and	 the
	aesthetic  best of a people; and while universal  protection
	of  intellectual  and  aesthetic  property  of	creators  of
	'works' is an international obligation, each country in	 its
	law  must protect such rights wherever originality  is	con-
	tributed.   So	viewed, apart from the music  composer,	 the
	singer must be conferred a right.  Of course, law-making  is
	the province of Parliament but the Court must communicate to
	the lawmaker such infirmities as exist in the law extant.
