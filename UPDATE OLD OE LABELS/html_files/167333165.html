</pre><p id="p_1">Prathiba M. Singh, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.    The Plaintiff is a company engaged in the business of manufacturing
and marketing a wide range of goods related to eyewear including lenses,
sunglasses, optical frames and related goods. A company by name of M/s.
Oakley Inc. was formed in the year 1975 which had created and coined the
mark 'OAKLEY'. The said word was used as part of the trade mark and as a
trade name in relation to various goods, such as sports gear equipment, used
in bikes and motorcycles, helmets, pads, motorcycle grips, number plates,
elbow guards, chin guards, goggles etc. Oakley Inc. also started using the
letter 'O' on its goggles which became quite well-known.
</p><p id="p_3">2.    The Plaintiff company, which is an eyewear company, purchased the
rights in the 'OAKLEY' brand, by acquiring ownership of Oakley Inc. The
Plaintiff's mark 'OAKLEY' is registered in India in various classes,

 including class 9, 16, 25 and 35.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    The products of the Plaintiff under its various brands thus, include
Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear, Persol, Oliver Peoples, Alain Mikli and
Arnette. Licensed brands include Giorgio Armani, Bulgari, Burberry,
Chanel, Coach, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Paul Smith,
Polo Ralph Lauren, Prada, Stella McCartney and Versace.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    The Plaintiff also has a strong presence in India, and its products are
sold through an Indian subsidiary M/s. Luxottica India Eyewear Pvt. Ltd.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    That the Plaintiff acquired knowledge of Defendant No.1-M/s. Mify
Solution    Private   Limited    running    a   website    under    the    name
"www.kaunsa.com". The Defendant No.2-Mr. Ashish Paliwal is the Director
of Defendant No.1. Defendant No.3-SLS Systems is operating the website
"www.kaunsa.com". In February, 2014, the Plaintiff acquired knowledge of
sale of various OAKLEY branded products on the Defendant's website. It
immediately ordered an "OAKLEY Radar Range US Team Sunglasses Blue
Frame" in the first week of March vide order No. KA/265072/B8UIRW40
and paid a sum of Rs.999/- for the purchase. The product in respect of the
transaction was delivered and it was noticed that the product was not as per
the standards of the Plaintiff and was in fact counterfeit. The suit thereafter,
came to be filed.
</p><p id="p_7">6.    On 25th August, 2014, this Court granted an ad interim ex-parte
injunction in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "10. By way of this ex-parte ad interim
             injunction, the Defendants are restrained by
             themselves or through their representatives/agents
             from manufacturing, marketing, supplying,
             exporting, displaying or advertising or in any


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(COMM) 453/2016                                                   Page 2 of 25</span>
              manner dealing with the trade mark OAKLEY of
             the Plaintiffs or any deceptively or confusingly
             similar trade mark to that of the Plaintiffs
             including on the website www.kaunsa.com."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">7.    The Defendants put in appearance and two separate written statements
were filed. A joint written statement came to be filed by Defendant No.1 and
2, and one by Defendant No.3. The case of Defendant No.1 and 2 was that
the website "www.kaunsa.com" is an intermediary and an online shopping
portal. It does not indulge in any selling of products directly. It merely
provides a platform for sale. The Defendants sought protection under
<a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_1">Section 79</a> of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (hereinafter, '<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">IT Act</a>').
Paragraph 3 to 6 of the same are relevant and is set out herein below: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "3.      That the Defendant No.1 merely provides an
          online shopping portal, www.kaunsa.com, for its users
          to interact, buy and sell goods online. It is pertinent to
          mention here that while operating its website
          Defendant No.1 acts only as a service
          provider/intermediary and does not indulge in any
          manner in selling of the products directly. It is humbly
          submitted that it is the sellers who upload their goods
          on Defendant No.1's portal and in doing so are
          deemed to have accepted the rules/policy, terms and
          conditions of the website which strictly prohibits the
          infringement of trademarks/copyrights. Thus, the
          Defendant No.1 being a service provider/intermediary
          cannot be said to have infringed, if any, Plaintiffs
          trademarks in relation to its goods. That the service
          provider merely provides a platform for trade by
          providing virtual shopping complex, in place of brick
          and mortar shops, where the sellers affiliated to it can
          showcase their products. Thus, the service
          provider/intermediary, by any stretch of imagination,
          cannot be imputed with either knowledge or intention if


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(COMM) 453/2016                                                  Page 3 of 25</span>
           the seller infringes any intellectual property rights and
          that too when such act is not in the notice of the service
          provider/intermediary.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          4.        That the Plaintiff without following the due
          process provided has approached this Hon'ble Court
          for the reliefs sought in the present suit. It is submitted
          that the Parliament does not intend to impose liability
          for secondary liability on intermediaries, which is
          borne out of by the most recent amendments to the
          <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Technology Act</a>, 2000 in 2008, that are
          based on EU Directive on E-Commerce, which inter
          alia provides for a new expanded definition of
          'intermediary' to mean 'any person who on behalf of
          another person receives, stores or transmits that
          record or provides any service with respect to that
          record and includes telecom service providers, network
          service providers, internet service providers, web-
          hosting service providers, search engines, online
          payment sites, online-auction sites, online-market and
          cyber cafes'.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          5.        From the above provisions of the <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_4">Information
          Technology Act</a>, 2000 it is clear that the Defendant
          No.1 qualifies as an 'intermediary' in terms of the new
          definition and falls within the safe harbour provided
          under the new <a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_5">Section 79</a> read with <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_6">Section 2</a> (w.) and
          d Rule 3 (Due Diligence to be observed by
          Intermediary)       of      Information         Technology
          (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">          6.        That the present suit is thus not maintainable
          against Defendant No.1 &amp;2 as by no stretch of
          imagination can Defendant No.1 be said to "use"
          Plaintiff's trademark in the "course of trade" as the
          Defendant No.1 being an intermediary is merely a
          service provider."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">8.    The Defendant Nos. 1&amp; 2 further submitted that it has more than 1400
sellers who upload theirs products on their website www.kaunsa.com, and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(COMM) 453/2016                                                   Page 4 of 25</span>
 upon any IP owner bringing the sale of any counterfeit products to its notice,
it takes immediate action in respect of the same. It is further pleaded that the
website does not have any control, nor does it determine or advise or in any
way involves itself between the contract between the buyer and the seller,
who is selling the products on the platform. The website only being a venue
for meeting and interaction of the seller and the buyer, it does not take the
goods or services into its possession at any point of time. It, thus, cannot be
held to be liable.
</p><p id="p_10">9.    However, paragraph 13 of the written statement clearly shows that the
payments are routed through the online platform. The relevant portion is set
out herein below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             "13. That with regard to the mode of payment.
             Clause 18 (Payments) specifies that payments for
             items on the website can be made either through
             the electronic or through cash on delivery
             transactions, as may be permitted by kaunsa.com
             to the website seller(s) in its sole discretion. It is
             pertinent to mention that www.kaunsa.com only
             processes online payments on merchant's behalf
             while sending the money to merchant after
             deducting its service fees. Thus, once again it is
             amply clear that being the service provider
             www.kaunsa.com only gets its share of service fee
             and is no way charging for or making a profit out
             of the goods in specific that are sold on the
             website. Therefore, it can in no way be held
             responsible for any liability arising out of the
             goods that the seller uploads for sale on the
             website."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">10.   The Defendant Nos. 1 &amp; 2 rely upon the agreement and the terms and
conditions which bind the sellers, called as the user agreement which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(COMM) 453/2016                                                     Page 5 of 25</span>
 requires the seller to vouch for the genuineness of the product. The relevant
part of the said agreement reads as under:
</p><pre id="pre_2">          "13.     DISCLAIMER          OF       WARRANTIES/
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
</pre><p id="p_12">          kaunsa.com - Mify Solutions Private Limited is a
          service provider and do no indulge in selling any
          product directly. It allows sellers to sell their their
          products online on kaunsa.com. Sellers are
          responsible for any Copyright and Trademark
          infringement."
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.   Insofar as Defendant No.3 is concerned, it claims that the platform
provides shipping to Defendant No.1 and 2. It also maintains the website.
Only the seller is accountable for the disputes with the buyer. The relevant
paragraphs of the said written statement are set out herein below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "7. That the answering defendant had not dealt
             with the impugned item/sunglasses. It had been
             dealing in online selling of electronic
             items/accessories vide its own invoice of 'SLS
             Systems' from the web site of D1&amp;2. The goods
             were sold by the answering defendant through its
             invoice. The answering defendant however also
             provided shipping services to the defendant No.
             1&amp;2 for shipping the goods sold by them. The
             subject item was only shipped by the answering
             defendant in sealed condition under good faith and
             has nothing to do with its quality/trade mark.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             8.    That the defendant No. 1&amp;2 own and
             maintain the web site in question and are
             responsible for the sale transaction conducted
             through it. As per the terms &amp; conditions of the
             web site set out by D1 &amp; D2, inter alia the buyer
             and seller can't have any direct interaction. The
             goods intended for sale are displayed by the web
             site with no reference to the seller, hence

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(COMM) 453/2016                                                 Page 6 of 25</span>
              accountable and responsible for all disputes to the
             buyers etc. Be that as it may, the answering
             defendant No.3 consciously never dealt in any item
             infringing the trade mark already registered. The
             plaintiffs' alleged ownership of the trade mark in
             question is denied by D3. The alleged purchase
             challan does not belong to D3 and it had not sold
             the impugned OAKLEY sunglasses."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">12.   The Defendant No.3 claims that it was unaware of the alleged
infringement and that Defendant Nos.1 and 2 have deceptively used the
particulars of Defendant No.3 as a seller. Thus, the Defendant No.3 takes a
defence to safeguard its own position.
</p><p id="p_15">13.   In view of the pleadings raised, the following issues were framed on
2nd August, 2016: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">              "1.     Whether the Plaintiff is the owner and

<p id="p_16"> 14.   Despite repeated opportunities, the Plaintiff did not lead any evidence.
The right to file evidence was closed vide order dated 22nd January, 2018.
On 13th April, 2018, counsels for the Defendants closed their evidence. On
23rd July, 2018, both counsels for the parties submitted that they would like
to make submissions without evidence in the matter, and accordingly
arguments were heard on the basis of pleadings and the documents on
record.
</p><p id="p_17">15.   From a reading of the pleadings of the documents, the following facts
are admitted: -

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">      (ii)    The actual sale was made and the shipping of the products was
              also done.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">      (iii)   Ownership of the Plaintiff's marks are not disputed.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">16.   The invoice is admitted and the Defendant does not seriously dispute
that the product sold was a counterfeit. In paragraph 30 the Plaintiff pleads
that the product delivered was a counterfeit. This is barely denied by the
Defendants who also shift the blame to one another. The Plaintiff having
ordered a product and found it to be counterfeit and having pleaded so and
the defendant having not given any document to show the source of the
product, or try to establish that the product is genuine, the product is taken to
be a counterfeit product. The important question that remains to be
determined is as to whether the online shipping market place
"www.kaunsa.com" is an intermediary or not, and if so to what effect.

 'Christian Louboutin') This Court had the occasion to deal with the role of
intermediaries and their liabilities. The relevant extracts from the said
judgement are set out below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">          "55. E-commerce websites are of different kinds. There
          are several platforms which have transparent privacy
          policies, takedown policies and IPR policies. They also
          have a dedicated unit dealing with complaints of IP
          owners. They also reveal complete details of the sellers
          who are actually placing their wares for sale on the
          platform. However, some e-commerce platforms do not
          have all these features. The sellers' full names are
          unknown, and the sellers, are on a large number of
          occasions located in foreign countries. The website
          does not give the warranty and neither does the seller.
          There are certain platforms which promote their own
          affiliate sellers on their own market place. They are
          however not shown as affiliated companies on their
          platforms. Some platforms also offer enormous logistic
          support such as storage facilities, transportation,
          delivery, guarantees of authenticity and warranties,
          exchange, after sales service, etc. Some platforms raise
          invoices in the name of the service provider. Payments
          are collected by the platforms. There are several online
          market places which simply provide a platform for the
          user to upload his/her information for further
          dissemination. For example, auction websites, where
          one user uploads the photos of his products, and labels
          it with a price, and another user simply accepts to
          purchase it on as is where is basis from the said seller.
          Such a record of that product could be transmitted
          through the website and would constitute receipt,
          storage or transmission. The question is whether in
          these cases the operators of these platforms can
          continue to qualify as intermediaries or not.

respect of taking down of infringing goods upon receiving notice, or reports
in respect of violation of intellectual property rights. The terms and
conditions of the user agreement are extremely vague and in some places are
contradictory in terms. The seller is not depicted in the screenshots.

</p><p id="p_32">29.   Issue no. 6 relating to whether kaunsa.com is an intermediary is
decided first. Applying the tests laid down in Christian Louboutin (supra),
it can be seen that the User Agreement has clauses that contradict each
other. Clause 13 states that the platform is merely a facilitator, but Clause 22
guarantees that the products are authentic. The sellers' details are properly
disclosed. None of the Defendants are taking responsibility for the product
in their pleadings. The due diligence and care required under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_41">Section 79</a> of
the IT Act is clearly not met. It is, accordingly, held that in the facts as set


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(COMM) 453/2016                                                  Page 23 of 25</span>
 out above, "www.kaunsa.com" is not an intermediary entitled to exemption
under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_42">Section 79</a> of the IT Act. As per the provisions of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_43">Section 79</a> of the IT
Act read with the Intermediary guidelines, the platform cannot be treated
purely as an intermediary.
</p><p id="p_33">30.   Issue Nos.1 &amp; 2: Issue Nos 1 and 2 are decided in favour of the
Plaintiff. The Plaintiff is held to be the owner, registered proprietor and
copyright owner of the trade mark OAKLEY. In fact this is not even seriously
disputed by the Defendants, as they state that as soon as the infringement was
brought to their notice, the listings were taken down.
</p><p id="p_34">31.   Issue Nos.3, 4 &amp; 5: In paragraphs 29 and 30, the Plaintiff has made a
categorical assertion that the product was purchased from the Defendant's
website, and the same was examined and found to be counterfeit. In response to
this, Defendant Nos.1 and 2 state that the delivery was made by Defendant
No.3 and so they cannot be imputed with the knowledge of infringement. The
fact that the product was counterfeit was not denied. It is only stated that the
seller is responsible. The Defendant No.3 in its written statement states that it
was only the shipping of the product which was done by it, without any
knowledge of the contents of the parcel received from Defendant No.1 and 2.
Thus the Defendants are shifting the blame among themselves. The invoice
clearly uses the letterhead "www.kaunsa.com", payment has been made to
Defendant Nos.1 and 2, shipping by Defendant No.3, packing of the product
has been done by Defendant Nos.1 and 2. The Defendant Nos.1 and 2 claim
even in the pleadings that they certify the authenticity of the products sold on
their website. The invoice having been admitted by Defendant Nos.1 and 2,
there being no denial that the product was counterfeit, the Defendants are held
to be guilty of infringement of trademark and copyright.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">CS(COMM) 453/2016                                                   Page 24 of 25</span>
 damages, the relief of damages/rendition of accounts is declined. Thus, the suit
is decreed in the following terms against the Defendants:

         sold on its platform, it shall notify the seller and if the seller is unable to
         provide evidence that the product is genuine, it shall take down the
         listing and notify the plaintiff of the same, as per the Intermediary
         Guidelines, 2011;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_96">      d) It shall also seek a guarantee from the sellers that the product has not
         been impaired in any manner and that all warranties and guarantees of
         the Plaintiff are applicable and shall be honoured by the seller. Products
         of any sellers who are unable to provide such a guarantee shall not be
         offered on the Defendant's platform;
