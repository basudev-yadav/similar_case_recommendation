HEADNOTE:
On  different dates prior to April 3, 1958, the	 petitioners
entered into contracts of purchase of copper with 'importers
at Bombay and Calcutta, but before they could take  delivery
from  the importers the Government of India, in exercise  of
its  powers  under<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_3"> s. 3</a> of the	Essential  Commodities	Act,
1955, issued on April 2, 1958, the Non-ferrous Metal Control
Order, 1958.  Clause 3 of the Order provided that no  person
shall  sell  or purchase any non-ferrous metal	at  a  price
which exceeded the amount represented by an addition of 321%
to  its	 landed	 cost, while under cl.	4  no  person  shall
acquire any non-ferrous metal except under and in accordance
with  a	 permit issued in this behalf by the  Controller  in
accordance  with such principles as the	 Central  Government
may from time to time specify.	No such principles, however,
were published in the Gazette or laid before the two  Houses
of Parliament, though certain principles governing the issue
of   permits   by  the	Controller  were  specified   in   a
communication  addressed  by  the Deputy  Secretary  to	 the
Government  of	India  dated April 18, 1958,  to  the  Chief
Industrial Adviser, by virtue of which the Controller  could
issue  permits only to certain manufactures and not  to	 any
dealer.	  On  April 14, 1958, the  petitioners	applied	 for
permits	 to  enable them to take delivery of the  copper  in
respect	 of which they had entered into contracts,  but	 the
applications were refused.  Thereupon, the petitioners filed
a  petition  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Art. 32</a> of	the  Constitution  of  India
challenging the validity of the order refusing the grant  of
the permit and contended, inter alia, (1) that the  fixation
of  the price under cl. 3 of the Non-ferrous  Metal  Control
Order, 1958, which had the effect of driving the dealer	 out
of  business in imported copper and likewise, cl. 4  of	 the
said Order read with the communication dated April 18, 1958,
which  had the effect of completely eliminating the  dealers
from  the  trade  in  imported	copper,	 contravened   Arts.
19(1)(f)  and  19(1)(g) of the Constitution, and  that	such
total  elimination  of the dealer amounting as	it  will  to
prohibition  of any exercise of the right to carry on  trade
or to acquire property
   376
was not a mere restriction on the rights and was outside the
saving provision of cls. (5) and (6) of Art 19, (2) that the
principles  specified in the communication dated  April	 18,
1958,	being  discriminatory  in  nature  as  between	 the
manufacturers and   dealers  in copper, infringed  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Art.	 14</a><a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_6">,
(3)</a>  that  the said principles,	 in any case,  had  no legal
force,	as they were not mentioned in the Non-ferrous  Metal
Control	 Order,	 nor  were they	 notified  in  the  Official
Gazette	 and  laid before both Houses of Parliament  in	 the
manner	laid  down  in sub-ss. (5) and (6) of<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_7"> s.  3</a>  of	 the
Essential Commodities Act.  It was found that the result  of
the  abuse by the importers of the practical monopoly  given
to  them  of  the  copper  market  seriously  affected	 the
interests  of  the  general public in  India,  and  that  to
protect	  these	 interests  of	the  public   the   impugned
legislation  in the form of Non-ferrous Metal Control  Order
and the subsequent specification of principles was made.
Held:(1)  that the word " restriction	      in  Arts.
19(5)  and  19(6)  of the  Constitution	 includes  cases  of
prohibition  "	also; that where a restriction	reaches	 the
stage  of total restraint of rights special care has  to  be
taken by the Court to see that the test of reasonableness is
satisfied  by considering the question in the background  of
the facts and circumstances under which the order was  made,
taking	into account the nature of the evil that was  sought
to be remedied; by such law, the ratio of the harm caused to
individual  citizens by the proposed remedy, the  beneficial
effect reasonably expected to result to the general  public,
and  whether the restraint caused by the law was  more	than
was necessary in the interests of the general public.

by
DAS  GUPTAJ.-The three persons who have filed this  petition
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_15">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution for enforcement of  their
fundamental  rights conferred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_16">Art. 14</a>, <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_17">Art. 19(1)(f)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_18">Art.  19(1)(g)</a>	thereof are dealers in imported	 copper	 and
carry on their business at Jagadhri in the State of  Punjab.
On different dates prior to April 3, 1958, they entered into
contracts of purchase of copper with importers at Bombay and
Calcutta.   Before, however, they could take  delivery	from
the  importers	the Government of India issued on  April  2,
1958, an order called the " Non-ferrous Metal Control Order,
1958 " hereafter referred to as " the order " in exercise of
its powers under s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act	(Act
X  of  1955)-referred to hereafter as " the Act ".  In	this
order  " non-ferrous metal " was defined to mean "  imported
copper, lead, tin and zinc in any of the forms specified  in
the  Schedule  of the order." The Order was  from  the	very
beginning made applicable to imported copper.  The price was
controlled by cl. 3 of the Order which provides in its first
sub-clause that " no person shall sell or offer to sell	 any
non-ferrous  metal  at	a price	 which	exceeds	 the  amount
represented  by an addition of 3 1/2% to its  landed  cost,"
and in its second sub-clause that " no person shall purchase
or offer to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">378</span>
purchase from any person non-ferrous metal at a price higher
than   at   which   it	is  permissible	  for	that   other
person	to  sell  to him under sub-cl.	(i)."  Clause  4  is
designed   to  regulate	 the  acquisition   of	 non-ferrous
metal  by  permit   only  and  provides	 that  "  no  person
shall  acquire	or agree to -acquire any  non-ferrous  metal
except under and in accordance with a permit issued in	this
behalf by the Controller in accordance with such  principles
as  the Central Government may from time to time specify  ".
Clauses	 5  and	 6 of the Order made it	 obligatory  on	 the
importers to notify quantities of non-ferrous metal imported
and  to	 maintain certain books of account, while  the	last
clause,	 i.e..	cl. 7 confers powers on	 the  Controller  to
enter  and search any premises in order to inspect any	book
or  document and to seize any non-ferrous metal	 in  certain
circumstances.	 This Order was published in the Gazette  of
India  on  April 2, 1958.  No principles  specified  by	 the
Central	 Government  in accordance with cl. 4 of  the  Order
were  however  published either on this date  or  any  other
date.	Certain	 principles were however  specified  by	 the
Central	 Government  in	 a communication  addressed  by	 the
Deputy Secretary to the Government of India dated April	 18,
1958,  to the Chief Industrial Adviser to the Government  of
India,	New  Delhi.   The  relevant  portion  of  this	com-
munication is in these words:
</p><p id="p_5">" The following principles shall govern the issue of permits
by the Controller :-
</p><p id="p_6">(1) In respect of the scheduled industries under the Control
of the Development Wing, the Controller will determine the 6
monthly	  requirements	of  actual  users  based  on   their
production in the year 1956;
</p><p id="p_7">(2)  In	 the  case  of	small  scale  industries  the  Chief
Controller of Imports and Exports on the certificate of	 the
State Directors of Industries will inform the Controller  of
the  quantities	 that  the units would be  entitled  to	 and
thereupon the Controller will make such quantities available
to these units from time to time;
</p><p id="p_8">(3)  Tile  Controller  shall normally  release	one  month's
requirements at a time to the consuming units
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">			    379</span>
and  the permit shall be valid for a period of	two  months;
but if heavy imports are reported the Controller shall	have
the discretion to issue stocks in larger quantities."
The position immediately on the issue of the Order  on April
2, 1958, thus was that no person could buy or sell  imported
copper	at a price above the landed Cost plus 31/2%  thereof
and  that no person could acquire or agree to  acquire	such
copper	except under a permit issued by the Controller.	  In
issuing	 such permits the Controller was to be	governed  by
such  principles  as the Central Government  would  specify.
After  the  principles were specified in the letter  of	 the
18th  of  April, the Controller could no  longer  issue	 any
permit to a dealer and could issue permits only to  certain.
manufacturers as indicated in paras.  1 and 2 of the letter.
In  view  of  the  requirement of cl. 4	 of  the  Order	 the
petitioners applied on April 14, 1958, for permits to enable
them to take delivery of the copper in respect of which they
had  entered into contracts with different parties.   Though
no  formal  order  appears  to have  been  passed  on  these
applications,  it is not disputed that the applications	 for
permits	 were  refused and no permits were issued  to  these
petitioners.  The main contention of the petitioners is two-
fold.	First, it is said that cl. 4 of the Order read	with
the  principles	 specified in the letter of the	 18th  April
violates the right conferred on them as citizens of India by
<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_19">Art.  19(1)(f)</a> of the Constitution of India to acquire	pro-
perty  and also the right conferred by <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_20">Article	19(1)(g)</a>  to
carry  on  trade, that these violations are not	 within	 the
saving	 provisions   of  <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_21">Art.	19(5)</a>  and  <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_22">19(6)</a>   of	 the
Constitution  and therefore are void.  Secondly, it is	said
that the fixation of the price at the landed cost plus 31  %
as the maximum also abridge the rights conferred on them  by
Arts.  19(1)(f)	 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution  and	that
this also is not saved by the provisions in Arts. 19(5)	 and
19(6)  and  so are void.  A further contention is  that	 the
principles  specified  being  discriminatory  in  nature  as
between	 the  manufacturers  and  dealers  in  copper	have
resulted in violating the right to equal protection of	laws
to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">380</span>
petitioners and thus infringe the right guranteed by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Art. 14</a>
of the Constitution.  As regards the principles specified in
the letter of the 18th April it wag further  contended	that
as  they  form an integral part of the " Order	"  by  which
alone  the Central Government can regulate the	distribution
and supply of essential commodities under<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_24"> s. 3</a> of the Act it
was  necessary	for  them to be	 notified  in  the  Official
Gazette	 as required by its 5th sub-section and to  be	laid
before both Houses of Parliament as required by its 6th sub-
section	 and as these requirements were not  fulfilled,	 the
principles  have  no  legal force.   Alternatively,  it	 was
contended that if the principles are considered not to	form
part  of  the  order  made by  the  Central  Government	 the
regulation  in	so far as it was by  these  principles,	 was
outside the Act as<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_25"> s. 3</a> empowers the Central, Government  to
provide	 for  regulating or prohibiting the  production	 and
supply	of essential commodities and trade and	commerce  in
essential commodities by an order only and not otherwise.
The  petitioners  pray for an appropriate writ or  order  or
direction  (1)	restraining the respondents,  the  Union  of
India,	the  Chief Industrial Adviser to the  Government  of
India and the Development Officer, Ministry of Industry from
enforcing  cls.	 3 and 4 of the order; (2) to  quashing	 the
order of the Development Officer rejecting the	petitioners'
application  for grant of permit by a direction to  the	 2nd
and  3rd respondents to grant the applications	for  permits
and  (3)  restraining them from granting permits  to  others
than  the petitioners in respect of copper covered by  their
contracts with importers.
</p><p id="p_9">The  application was opposed by the respondents, their	main
contention  being that cls. 3 and 4 of the Order and  the  "
principles  "  specified are laws -which  impose  reasonable
restrictions  on the exercise of rights conferred  by  Arts.
19(1)(f) and 19(1)(g) in the interest of the general public.
While	this   was  the	 main  contention   on	 behalf	  of
the   respondents,  it	was  also  contended  that  as	 the
petitioners   have  not	 challenged  the  validity  of	 the
<a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_26">Essential Commodities Act</a> and have admitted the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">			    381</span>
power of the Central Government to make an order in exercise
of the powers conferred by<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_27"> s. 3</a> of the Act it is not open to
the Court to consider whether the law made by the Government
in  making  the	 nonferrous  metal  control  order  and	  in
specifying the principles under cl. 4 of the order  violates
any of the fundamental rights under the Constitution.  It is
urged  that once it is found that the Government  has  power
under  a valid law to provide for regulating or	 prohibiting
the  production,  supply and distribution  of  an  essential
commodity and trade and commerce therein as soon as it is of
opinion	 that  it  is necessary or expedient so	 to  do	 for
maintaining   or  increasing  supplies	of   the   essential
commodity  or  for securing its equitable  distribution	 and
availability  at fair prices, the order made by them can  be
attacked  only	if it is outside the power  granted  by	 the
section	 or  if it is mala fide.  Malafides  have  not	been
suggested  and we are proceeding on the assumption that	 the
Central	 Government  was  honestly of opinion  that  it	 was
necessary  and	expedient  to make an  order  providing	 for
regulation and prohibition of the supply and distribution of
imported copper and trade and commerce therein.	 So long  as
the Order does not go beyond such provisions, the Order,  it
is  urged, must be held to be good and the consideration  of
any question of infringement of fundamental rights under the
Constitution   is   wholly  beside  the	 point.	   Such	  an
extravagant  argument has merely to be mentioned to  deserve
rejection.   If there was any reason to think that<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_28"> s.  3</a>  of
the  Act  confers  on the Central  Government  power  to  do
anything which is in conflict with the Constitutionary thing
which  violates any of the fundamental rights conferred	 by-
the  Constitution, that fact alone would be  sufficient	 and
unassailable  ground for holding that the section itself  is
void  being ultra vires the Constitution.  When, as in	this
case,  no  challenge is made that<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_29"> s. 3</a> of the Act  is  ultra
vires  the  Constitution, it is on the assumption  that	 the
powers	granted thereby do not violate the Constitution	 and
do  not empower the Central Government to do anything  which
the  Constitution  prohibits.	It is  fair  and  proper  to
presume that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">49</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">382</span>
in  passing this Act the Parliament could not possibly	have
intended the words used by it, viz., " may by order  provide
for  regulating	 or prohibiting the production,	 supply	 and
distribution thereof, and trade and commerce in," to include
a  power to make such provisions even though they may be  in
contravention of the Constitution.  The fact that the  words
" in accordance with the provisions of the articles  of
the  Constitution"  are	 not used in the section  is  of  no
consequence.   Such  words  have to  be	 read  by  necessary
implication  in	 every provision and every law made  by	 the
Parliament  on	any  day after the  Constitution  came	into
force.	 It is clear therefore that when<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_30"> s. 3</a> confers  power
to provide for regulation or prohibition of the	 production,
supply and distribution of any essential commodity it  gives
such  power to make any regulation or prohibition in so	 far
as  such  regulation  and prohibition  do  not	violate	 any
fundamental rights granted by the Constitution of India.
It  is therefore necessary for us to consider,	even  though
mala  fides on the part of the Government are  not  alleged,
whether	 the  law made by the Central Government by  way  of
subordinate legislation, is a law, which though abridging or
taking	away the rights conferred by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_31">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> and	<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_32">(g</a>),
is within the saving provisions of 19(5) and 19(6).  On	 the
face  of  it  cl. 4 of the Order read  with  the  principles
specified in the letter of the 18th April has the effect  of
completely  eliminating	 the  dealers  from  the  trade	  in
imported   copper.   It	 is  also  reasonably	clear	that
independently  of  Cl.	4  read	 with  the  principles,	 the
fixation of the price at which the copper can be bought	 and
sold  at  3  1/2% above the landed cost has  the  effect  of
driving the dealer out of business in imported copper.	 The
statement made on behalf of the Union of India in  paragraph
11  of the counter affidavit that an addition of 3  1/2%  of
the  landed cost was made in fixing the price in para. 3  of
the Order in order to enable the importers to earn a  margin
of  profit  justifies the conclusion that this will  be	 the
minimum price at which the importers will sell.	 Any  dealer
would  have  thus to pay at the rate of landed cost  plus  3
1/2% thereof in getting anY
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">			    383</span>
supply of copper from the importers.  Such dealer is however
prevented from charging from his customer anything more than
the landed cost plus 3 1/2% thereof.  The position therefore
clearly	 is  that  henceforth any  aCtual  consumer  of	 the
commodity would have to get it	direct from the importer and
the  channel  of  distribution	through	 the  dealer   would
disappear.
</p><p id="p_10">In  deciding whether this total elimination of	dealer	from
trade' in imported copper is within the saving provisions of
<a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_33">Art.  19(5)</a>  and <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_34">Art. 19(6)</a> we have first  to  coNsider	 the
question   whether   such  total  elimination  is   a	mere
restriction on the rights under Arts. 19(1)(f) and  19(1)(g)
or goes beyond " restriction."
</p><p id="p_11">On  behalf  of the petitioners it has been  urged  that	 the
prohibition of the exercise of a right must be distinguished
from  restriction on the exercise of a right, and  when	 the
Constitution speaks of laws imposing reasonable restrictions
on  the	 exercise  of rights it does  not  save	 laws  which
prohibit  the exercise of any such right.  It is urged	that
the total elimination of the dealer amounting as it will  to
prohibition  of any exercise of the right to carry on  trade
or  to	acquire	 property would therefore  be  in  any	case
outside the saving provisions of cls. 5 and 6 of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_35">Art. 19.</a>
Certain observations made by Kania, C. J., and S. R. Das, J.
(as he then was) in Gopalan'S Case (1) appear at first sight
to lend support to this argument.  At p. 106 of the  Report,
Kania,	C. J., after pointing out that the  'deprivation  of
personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction  of

Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (1) the constitutionality
of the Central Provinces and Berar Regulation of Manufacture
of   Bidis   (Agricultural  Purposes)  Act,  came   up	 for
consideration,	Mahajan, J., delivering the judgment of	 the
Court, after pointing out that the question was whether	 the
total prohibition of carrying on the business of manufacture
of  bidis  within  the agricultural  season  amounted  to  a
reasonable  restriction of the fundamental rights  mentioned
in  <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_42">Art.  19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, based  his  decision
that  the  impugned  law  did not  come	 within	 the  saving
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_43">Art. 19(6)</a> of the Constitution on  the	view
that the test of reasonableness was not satisfied and not on
a view that " prohibition " went beyond " restriction ".  At
p. 764 of the Report the learned Judge says:
"  The effect of the provisions of the Act, however, has  no
reasonable relation to the object in view but is so  drastic
in  scope that it goes much in excess of that  object.	 Not
only  are  the provisions of the statute in  excess  of	 the
requirements of the case but the language employed prohibits
a  manufacturer	 of bidis from employing any person  in	 his
business,  no matter wherever that person may  be  residing.
In  other  words, a manufacturer of bidis residing  in	this
area  cannot import labour from neighbouring places  in	 the
district  or province or from outside the province.  Such  a
prohibition  on	 the face of it is of  an  arbitrary  nature
inasmuch  as  it has no relation whatsoever  to	 the  object
which the legislation seeks
(1)[1950] S.C.R. 759.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">			    385</span>
<p id="p_16">to  achieve  and as such cannot be said to be  a  reasonable
restriction on the exercise of the right."
The law was struck down because the restriction in this case
amounting to prohibition was not reasonable and not  because
it was a prohibition.
</p><p id="p_17">In Saghir Ahamad's Case (1) and in Chamarbaugwala's  Case(2)
the question whether prohibition of the exercise of a  right
was within the meaning of restrictions on the exercise of  a
right  used  in cl. 6 was raised but the  Court	 decided  to
express no final opinion in the matter and left the question
open.	In  Cooverjee's	 Case (3)  the	Court  extended	 the
provisions of Cl. 6 of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_44">Art. 19</a> to a law which had the effect
of prohibiting the exercise of a right to carry on trade  to
many citizens.	Mahajan, J., delivering the judgment of	 the
Court observed:
</p><p id="p_18">"   In	order  to  determine  the  reasonableness   of	 the
restriction regard must be had to the nature of the business
and the conditions prevailing in that trade.  It is  obvious
that  these factors must differ from trade to trade  and  no
hard and fast rules concerning all trades can be laid  down.
It  can also not be denied that the State has the  power  to
prohibit trades which are illegal or immoral or injurious to
the  health  and welfare of the	 public.   Laws	 prohibiting
trades in noxious or dangerous goods or trafficking in women
cannot	be held to be illegal as enacting a prohibition	 and
not  a	mere regulation.  The nature of	 the  business,	 is,
therefore,    an   important   factor	in   deciding	 the
reasonableness of the restrictions."
</p><p id="p_19">In Madhya Bharat Cotton Association Ltd. (4), the Court	 had
to  consider  the  constitutionality of an  order  which  in
effect prohibited a large section of traders, from  carrying
on their normal trade in forward contracts.  In holding	 the
order to be valid, Bose, J., delivering the judgment of	 the
Court said " Cotton being a commodity essential to the	life
of  the	 community, it is reasonable  to  have	restrictions

circumstances,	extend	to  total prohibition  for  a  time,
of  all normal trading in the commodity."
</p><p id="p_23">It is clear that in these three cases, viz., Chintaman Rao's
Case   (1),   Cooverjee's  Case	 (2)   and   Madhya   Bharat
Cotton	Association Ltd.  Case (3) the Court considered	 the
real  question	to  be whether	the  interference  with	 the
fundamental  right,  was  "  reasonable	 "  or	not  in	 the
interests  of the general public and that if the  answer  to
the question was in the affirmative, the law would be  valid
and  it would be invalid if the test of	 reasonableness	 was
not  passed.  Prohibition was in all these cases treated  as
only a kind of " restriction ". Any other view would, in our
opinion, defeat the intention of the Constitution.
After  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_45">Art. 19(1)</a> has conferred on the citizen	the  several
rights	set out in its seven sub-clauses, action is at	once
taken by the Constitution in cls. 2 to 6 to keep the way  of
social	control	 free  from  unreasonable  impediment.	 The
raison detre of a State being the welfare of the members  of
the   State   by  suitable   legislation   and	 appropriate
administration,	 the  whole purpose of the creation  of	 the
State  would be frustrated if the conferment of these  seven
rights	would  result  in cessation of	legislation  in	 the
extensive  fields  where these seven  rights  operate.	 But
without the saving provisions that would be the exact result
of  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_46">Art.  13</a> of the Constitution.  It was to  guard  against
this  position that the Constitution provided in its cls.  2
to 6 that even in the fields of these rights new laws  might
be made and old laws would operate where this was  necessary
for  general welfare.  Laws imposing reasonable	 restriction
on the exercise of the rights are saved by cl. 2 in  respect
of rights under sub-cl. (a) where the restrictions are "  in
the  interests of the security of the State; " and of  other
matters mentioned therein; by cl. 3 in respect of the rights
conferred by sub-cl. (b) where the restrictions are " in the
interests of the public order; by cls. 4, 5 and 6 in respect
of the rights conferred by sub-cls. (c), (d), (e), (f) &amp; (g)
the restrictions are " in the interest of the general public
"-in  cl. 5 which is in respect of rights conferred by	sub-
cls. (d),
(1) [1950] S.C.R. 759.			(2) [1954] 873. 879.
(3)  A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 634.

<p id="p_24">(e)  &amp;	(f) also where the restrictions are ',for  the	pro-
tection	 of the interests of any scheduled tribe ". But	 for
these  saving  provisions  such laws would  have  been	void
because	 of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_47">Art. 13</a>, which is in these words " All  laws  in
force  in  the territory of India  immediately	  before the
commencement  of  this Constitution, in so far as  they	 are
inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the
extent,	 of such inconsistency be void; (2) The State  shall
not  make  any law which takes away or abridges	 the  rights
conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention  of
this  clause shall, to the extent of the  contravention,  be
void . . . "
</p><p id="p_25">As it was to remedy the harm that would otherwise be  caused
by  the provisions of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_48">Art. 13</a>, that these saving  provisions
were made, it is proper to remember the words of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_49">Art. 13</a>  in
interpreting  the words " reasonable restrictions "  on	 the
exercise of the right as used in cl. (2).  It is  reasonable
to think that the makers of the Constitution considered	 the
word  restriction  " to be sufficiently wide  to  save	laws
inconsistent " with <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_50">Art. 19(1</a>), or " taking away the  rights
"  conferred by the Article, provided this inconsistency  or
taking away was reasonable in the interests of the different
matters	 mentioned  in the clause.  There can  be  no  doubt
therefore  that	 they intended the word " restriction  "  to
include cases of " prohibition " also.	The contention	that
a law prohibiting the exercise of a fundamental right is  in
no  case  saved, cannot therefore be accepted.	 It  is	 un-
doubtedly  correct,  however, that when, as in	the  present
case,  the  restriction	 reaches the  stage  of	 prohibition
special	 care has to be taken by the Court to see  that	 the
test  of  reasonableness  is  satisfied.   The	greater	 the
restriction,  the more the need for strict scrutiny  by	 the
Court.
</p><p id="p_26">In  applying  the test of reasonableness, the Court  has  to
consider  the  question in the background of the  facts	 and
circumstances  under which the order was made,	taking	into
account	 the  nature  of  the evil that	 was  sought  to  be
remedied  by  such  law, the ratio of  the  harm  caused  to
individual   citizens  by  the	proposed  remedy,   to	 the
beneficial effect reasonably expected to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">388</span>
result to the general public.  It will also be necessary  to
consider in that connection whether the restraint caused  by
the law is more than was necessary in the  interests of	 the
general public.
</p><p id="p_27"> The position of the copper trade at the end of March, 1958,
within	two  days of which the impugned order  was  made  is
fairly	clear.	 Copper	 is  so	 largely   required  by	 the
industries  in India for producing various consumer's  goods
and  also sheets and other articles which are needed as	 raw
material in other industries that the position that it is an
essential  commodity  cannot be and has not  been  disputed.
The  quantity  of copper produced in India is  so  small  as
compared with the normal needs of the Industry that for many
years the Industry had to depend on imports from abroad.  It
was  apparently because of the importance of this metal	 for
the industries in India that copper was kept for a long time
in  the	 Open General List and free  import  was  permitted.
When  however the foreign exchange position of	the  country
deteriorated  and  it  was  felt  necessary  in	 the  larger
interests  of  the country to conserve foreign	exchange  as
much  as possible copper was excluded from the Open  General
List from July 1, 1957, and it became necessary to obtain  a
licence before copper could be imported.  During the  period
July  to  September  1957  licences  were  granted  to	both
Established importers of coppers as also to actual users not
being established importers.  During the period October 1957
to   March  1958,  licences  were  granted  to	 established
importers  only.  Whatever the motive of such  exclusion  of
actual	users  might have been, the result  was	 disastrous.
Having	a  practical monopoly of this imported	commodity  a
handful	 of importers was in a position to dictate terms  to
consumers and by March 1958 the price of copper in India per
ton was Rs. 3,477 as against the international price of	 Rs.
2,221.	 It is not disputed that result of the abuse by	 the
importers  of  the practical monopoly given to them  of	 the
copper	market	seriously  affected  the  interests  of	 the
general public in India.  Nor is it disputed that it was  in
an  honest effort to protect these interests of	 the  public
that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">			    389</span>
impugned  legislation  in  the	form  of  Non-ferrous  Metal
Control Order and the subsequent specification of principles
was made.
</p><p id="p_28">The  first evil sought to be remedied by the law being	thus
the  rise in price-which was bound to be reflected    in the
higher	price of the consumers' goods in the  production  of
which copper formed a major ingredient -an order controlling
the  price  would of course be the first  obvious  step	 for
fighting  this evil.  Experience has shown however  that  if
nothing	 else is done it is practically impossible  to	make
the  control of price effective.  The  essential  subsidiary
step therefore was to introduce a system of permits so	that
the  persons acquiring copper could be known.  A  system  of
permits would also be of great help in ensuring that the raw
material  would go to those industries where it	 was  needed
most   and  distributed	 in  such  quantities	to   several
industries  in	different  parts of  the  country  as  would
procure the greatest benefit to the general public.   Clause
3  of  the  Order fixes a pi-ice while cl.  4  introduces  a
system of permits for the acquisition of the material., Some
fixation  of  price, being essential to keep  prices  within
reasonable limits, must therefore be held to be a reasonable
restriction in the interests of the general public.  Was  it
necessary, however, that the prices should be fixed in	such
a manner as to eliminate the dealer completely, as has	been
done in the instant case ?  The introduction of a system  of
permits	 was also clearly necessary in the interests of	 the
general	 public.   Was it necessary however to	specify	 the
principles  that  would drive the dealer  out  of  business?
These  questions  require  careful  consideration,  for	 the
injury	inflicted on the dealer by such elimination is	very
great  and in spite of the presumption of  Constitutionality
that  attaches to every law the Court ought to examine	with
special	 care laws which result, as in the present case,  in
total restraint of rights conferred by the Constitution.
That  middleman's profits increase the price of goods  which
the consumer has to pay is axiomatic.  It is entirely  wrong
to think that the middleman gets his profits for nothing and
one has to remember that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">50</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">390</span>
middleman  by forming the distribution channel	between	 the
producers  and	consumers  relieves the	 procedures  of	 the
burden of storing goods for a length of	     time  and	 the
risk  attendant thereto and relieves the   consumers  of the
trouble and expense of going to the producer who may be	 and
often  is a long distance away.	 It is however in  the	very
nature	of things that the middleman has to charge not	only
as regards the interest on the capital invested by him,	 and
a reasonable remuneration for management but also in respect
of the risks undertaken by him-what the economists call	 the
"  entrepreneur's  risk."  These  charges  often  add  to  a
considerable  sum.  It has therefore been the  endeavour  at
least  in  modern  times for those  responsible	 for  social
control to keep middlemen's activities to the minimum and to
replace	 them  largely	by co-operative	 sale  societies  of
producers   and	 co-operative  purchase	 societies  of	 the
consumers.   While  it	is clear  that	the  middleman	does
perform	 important  services, it is equally clear  that	 the
interests  of  the  public would be best  secured  if  these
services  could be obtained at a price lower than  what	 the
middleman would ordinarily charge.  If the middleman  ceases
to function because of the fixation of price at landed	cost
plus  3 1/2%, the manufacturers who require copper as  their
raw material will have to establish contacts with importers.
This will mean some trouble and inconvenience to them but it
is  reasonable	to  think that the saving  in  the  cost  of
obtaining  the raw material would more than compensate	them
for this.  The lower cost of the raw material is also likely
to  be reflected-in a competitive market-in the lower  price
of the consumer's goods, of which copper is a raw  material,
and thus redound to the benefit of the general public.
It  must  therefore  be held that cl. 3 of  the	 Order	even
though it results in the elimination of the dealer from	 the
trade  is a reasonable restriction in the interests  of	 the
general public.	 Clause 4 read with the principles specified
must  also  be held for the same reason to be  a  reasonable
restriction.
</p><p id="p_29">It  was next urged that these principles are  discriminatory
as between manufacturers and dealers and so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">			    391</span>
violate	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_51">Art.  14</a> of the Constitution.	 Quite	clearly	 the
dealers and manufacturers are by these principles placed  in
different classes and while some manufacturers are  eligible
for  permits dealers are not.  It is equally  clear  however
from  what has already been said about that the	 differentia
which  distinguish  dealers as a  class	 from  manufacturers
placed in the other class have a reasonable connection	with
the  object  of	 the legislation.   There  is  therefore  no
substance  in the contention that the specification  of	 the
principles violates <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_52">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution.
While however cl. 3 of the Order is clearly within the	Act,
the  question  whether	cl. 4 read with	 the  principles  is
within	the Act or not is not free from difficulty.  If	 the
principles had been specified in the Order itself and/or had
been  notified in the Official Gazette and laid before	both
the Houses of Parliament in the manner indicated in  sub-ss.
(5)  and  (6) of<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_53"> s. 3</a> of the Act, the regulation  by  cl.  4
would  have been within the Act.  These principles were	 not
however	 mentioned  in the Order nor were they	notified  or
laid  before  both Houses of Parliament in the	manner	laid
down  in sub-ss. (5) and (6) of<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_54"> s. 3</a>. The regulation  in  so
far  as	 it  is	 by these  principles  is  therefore  not  a
regulation  by	an order under<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_55"> s. 3</a> of the  Act	 but  wholly
outside	 it and so would not come within the  protection  of
the  saving  provisions of cls. 5 and 6 of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_56">Art.	 19</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_30">But  without  the  principles, cl. 4 of	 the  Order  is	 not
effective.   The  system  of permits which  this  clause  is
designed  to introduce can come into existence only  if	 the
permits	 can  be issued; but permits can be issued  only  in
accordance  with  the principles laid down  by	the  Central
Government.   It is not possible to build on the use of	 the
words  " may specify " in cl. 4 an argument that so long  as
no  principles	are  specified	the  Controller	 would	have
authority to issue permits by exercise -of his own  judgment
and discretion.	 The words used in cl . 4 do not permit such
a construction and compel the conclusion that so long as the
principles  are not specified by the Central  Government  no
permit can be issued by the Controller.	 Enforcement of	 the
provision that no person shall acquire or agree
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">392</span>
to  acquire except under a permit, would thus, so  long	  as
the  principles	 are  not specified in	a  legal  manner  as
required  by  sub-ss. (5) and (6) of<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_57"> s. 3</a> of  the  Essential
Commodities  Act,  would  mean	a  total  stoppage  of	 the
Copper trade-not only of the transactions of dealers but  of
any transaction whatever in imported copper.  On the face of
it  this  could	 not  be a  reasonable	restriction  in	 the
interests  of  the  general  public.   There  is  no  escape
therefore from the conclusion that so long as principles are
not specified by the Central Government by an Order notified
in accordance with sub-s. (5) and laid before both Houses of
Parliament  in	accordance  with  sub-s.  6  of	<a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_58"> s.  3</a>	 the
regulation by cl. 4 as it is now ,Worded is not within the -
saying	 provisions  of	 Arts.	19(5)  and  19(6)   of	 the
Constitution,  and  is	void  as  taking  away	the   rights
conferred by Arts. 19(1)(f) and 19(1)(g).
All  that is necessary to make cl. 4 effective is that	some
principles  should be specified, and these notified  in	 the
Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament.  It may be
necessary  from	 time to time to specify new  principles  in
view  of the changed circumstances; these have again  to  be
notified  in  the  Gazette and laid  before  the  Houses  of
Parliament,  in	 order	to be effective.   So  long  as	 new
principles do not come into operation, by being specified by
Government, and thereafter notified in the Gazette and	laid
before	Houses of Parliament, the previous  principles	last
specified, notified in the Gazette and laid before Houses of
Parliament,   will  remain  effective.	 As,  however,	 the
principles  specified in the letter of the 18th	 April	have
not  been notified in the Gazete, nor laid before Houses  of
Parliament, and no principles appear to have been  specified
before	or  after that date, cl. 4 of the order, as  it	 now
stands, must be struck down as void.
</p><p id="p_31">The  petitioners  are therefore entitled to relief  only  in
respect	 of cl. 4 of the order.	 We direct that an order  be
issued	restraining the respondents from enforcing cl. 4  of
