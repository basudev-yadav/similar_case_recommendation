HEADNOTE:
    Clause  (c)	 of sub-s. (3) of s. 10 of  the	 Tamil	Nadu
Buildings  (Lease  and Rent Control) Act,  1960,  enables  a
landlord occupying only a part of a building, whether  resi-
dential	 or  non-residential, to seek eviction of  a  tenant
occupying the whole or any portion of the remaining part  of
the building, notwithstanding anything contained in cl. (a),
for  bona fide requirement of additional accommodation.	 The
first proviso thereto enjoins the Rent Controller to  reject
the application of the landlord under that clause even where
the  need is found to be genuine, if the hardship caused  to
the  tenant  would outweigh the advantage to  the  landlord.
Sub-clause (i) of cl. (a) of s. 10(3) enables eviction	from
residential  building if the landlord or any member  of	 his
family is not occupying a residential building of his own in
the  city,  while sub-cl. (iii) enable	eviction  from	non-
residential  building if the landlord or any member  of	 his
family	is not occupying for purposes of a business  a	non-
residential building in the city. A 'building' is defined in
s. 2(2) to mean any building or hut or part of a building or
hut,  let  or to be let separately for residential  or	non-
residential purposes.
    The respondent-legatees of the landlady, using the first
floor  of the building for residence sought eviction of	 the
appellant-tenant  from	the ground floor used by  him  as  a
godown	for  storing his business wares on the	ground	that
they bona fide required additional accommodation
1174
for  their  residential needs. The  Rein  Controller  upheld
their  claim. The Appellate Authority reversed the  findings
of  the Rent Controller but in revision the High  Court	 re-
stored the order of eviction passed by the Rent Controller.
    In	this Appeal by Special leave it was  contended	that
since  the  ground floor constituted a	building  by  itself
within	the meaning of s. 2(2) of the Act.  the	 respondents
could	seek  eviction	of  the	 appellant  only  under	  s.
10(3)(a)(i) of the Act and not under s. 10(3)(c), that	even
if the respondents were entitled to invoke s. 10(3)(c)	they
could  seek eviction only if they required the ground  floor
for  non-residential purposes and not for  residential	pur-
poses,	that  the factors of relative hardship	between	 the
parties	 weighed  more in favour of the appellant  than	 the
respondents, and that the High Court was in error in  inter-
fering	with the findings of fact rendered by the  Appellate
Authority while exercising its revisional powers under s. 25
of the Act.
Dismissing the Appeal, the Court,
    HELD: 1.1 The ground floor of the building in occupation
of the appellant did not constitute a distinct and  separate
unit.  The respondent-landlords could. therefore seek  evic-
tion under s. 10(3)(c) of the Act.
    1.2 A 'building' has been defined in s. 2(2) of the	 Act
as not only a building or hut but also part of a building or
hut,  let  separately  for  residential	 or  non-residential
purposes,  which could only means that a part of a  building
that  has been let out or that has to be let out  separately
can also be construed as a separate and independent building
without	 reference to the other portion or portions  of	 the
building  where	 it  is not necessary to  treat	 the  entire
building as one whole and inseparable unit. A limitation has
thereby been placed by the Legislature itself, by  providing
that  the  application of the definition is subject  to	 the
contextual  position.  It follows therefrom that  where	 the
context warrants. the entire building being construed as one
integral unit. It would be inappropriate to view the  build-
ing as consisting of several disintegrated units and not  as
one integrated structure.
    1.3 In enacting<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_1"> s. 10(3)(c)</a> the Legislature has intended
that the entire building. irrespective of one portion  being
occupied  by the landlord and the other portion or  portions
being  occupied by a tenant or tenants should be  viewed  as
one whole and integrated unit and not as different entities.
1175
    1.4 There is vast difference between the words "residen-
tial  building"	 and "non-residential building" used  in <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_2"> s.
10(3)(a)(i)</a> and (iii) on the one hand and<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_3"> s. 10(3)(c)</a> on the
other.	While<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_4"> s. 10(3)(a)(i)</a> and (iii) refer to	 a  building
only  as residential or non-residential,<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_5"> s. 10(3)(c)</a>  refers
to a landlord occupying a part of a building, whether  resi-
dential or non-residential. Furthermore,<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_6"> s. 10(3)(c)</a>  states
that a landlord may apply to the Controller for an order  of
eviction being passed against the tenant occupying the whole
or any portion of the remaining part of the building.
    1.5	 TO  import  the expansive definition  of  the	word
"building"  in	s.  2(2) into<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_7"> s. 10(3)(c)</a>  would  result  in
rendering  meaningless the words "part of a building"  occu-
pied  by the landlord and a tenant "occupying the  whole  or
any portion of the remaining part of the building",  leaving
no scope for such a landlord to seek eviction.
    1.6	 The provisions of an Act should be  interpreted  in
such a manner as pot to render any of its provisions  otiose
unless there are compelling reasons for the Court to  resort
to  the extreme contingency. If a portion of a building	 let
out  to	 a tenant is to be treated in all  situations  as  a
separate  and independent building then<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_8"> s. 10(3)(c)</a> will  be
rendered otiose because the landlord can never then ask	 for
additional accommodation since<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_9"> s. 10(3)(a)</a> does not  provide
for eviction of tenants on the ground of additional accommo-
dation for the landlord either for residential or  non-resi-
dential purposes.

2 M.L.J. 515; <a href="/doc/1652484/" id="a_10">Mohammed Jaffar v. Palaniappa Chettiar</a>, [1964]
1  M .L.J. 112 and Cheilaromal v. Accommodation	 Controller,
[1967] 2 M.L.J. 453, approved.
    2.1 It cannot be said that a landlord can seek addition-
al  accommodation  for residence only if the building  is  a
residential one and likewise he can seek additional accommo-
dation for business purposes only if the building is a	non-
residential one.
    2.2 <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_11">Section 10(3)(c)</a> provides for both situations,	viz.
a landlord occupying a part of a building which is  residen-
tial  or  non-residential.  The words used in  it  arc	"any
tenant" and not "a tenant" who can be called upon to  vacate
the  portion in his occupation. Unless the  legislature	 had
intended  that	both classes of tenant i.e.  residential  or
nonresidential, can be asked to vacate by the Rent  Control-
ler  for providing landlord the additional accommodation  it
would not have used the
1176
words  "any"  instead of using the letter "a"  to  denote  a
tenant.	 Further, the words "as the case may be" in cl.	 (0)
only mean "whichever the case may be", i.e. either  residen-
tial or non-residential. They do not restrict the landlord's
right  to  secure additional accommodation  for	 residential
purposes  only in respect of a residential building  and  in
the  case of additional accommodation for business  purposes
only to a non-residential building.
    2.3 <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_12">Section 10(3)(c)</a> stands on a different footing	from
s.  10(3)(a)  (i)  and<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_13"> s.  10(3)(a)(iii)</a>.  The	non-obstante
clause	has been added to cl. (c) to give it  an  overriding
effect over both the restrictions placed by cls. (a)(i)	 and
(a)(iii), viz., landlord seeking eviction of a tenant should
not  be	 occupying a building of his own  and  secondly	 the
nature	of  user of the leased property by the	tenant	must
correspond to the nature of the requirement of the landlord.
Thus, the requirement of additional accommodation under	 cl.
(c) is not a case of a landlord not occupying a	 residential
or  non-residential  building  of his own but a	 case  of  a
landlord  occupying a part of a residential or	non-residen-
tial  building	of his own and putting it to  such  user  as
deemed	fit by him. If it was the intention of the  legisla-
ture that only a tenant occupying a residential portion of a
building  can  be asked to vacate for  providing  additional
residential accommodation to the landlord and corresponding-
ly a tenant occupying a portion of a building for  non-resi-
dential	 purposes alone being asked to vacate for  the	non-
residential  requirements  of the landlord.  it	 would	have
provided specific stipulation to that effect in cl. (c).
    In	the  instant  case. the	 requirement  of  additional
accommodation  pertains to the need of the landlord and	 the
manner of user of the portion of the building already in his
occupation  and consequently the bona fides of his  require-
ment  will  outweigh  all the  restrictions  imposed  by <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_14"> s.
10(3)(a)</a>.
<a href="/doc/718036/" id="a_15">K. Parasuramaiah v. Lakshmamma</a>, (AIR 1965: 220). approved.
    Thirupathi	v. Kanta Rao. [1981] Vol. 1 ILR	 Madras	 128
overruled.
    3.	Once  a landlord is able to satisfy  the  Controller
that he is bona fide in need of additional accommodation for
residential  or nonresidential purposes and that the  advan-
tage  derived by him by an order of eviction  will  outweigh
the hardship caused to the tenant. then he is entitled to an
order of eviction irrespective of any other consideration.
1177
    4.	The  Rent Controller has gone into the	question  of
comparative hardship and rendered a finding in favour or the
respondents.  The Appellate Authority's findings  have	been
vitiated  because of its non advertance to the evidence	 and
application  of	 wrong tests in	 assessing  the	 comparative
hardship  between the parties. The High Court,	was.  there-
fore, entitled to allow the revision.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
    NATARAJAN,	J.  This  appeal by special leave  is  by  a
tenant	against whom an order of eviction passed under	Sec-
tion  10(3)(c) of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease  and	Rent
Control) Act, 1960, hereinafter referred to as the "Act", by
the Rent Controller was restored by the High Court of Madras
after  setting aside the dismissal of the eviction  petition
by the Appellate Authority.
</p><p id="p_5">    The facts are not in controversy and may briefly be	 set
out  as	 under. A one-storeyed building in  Wall  Tax  Road,
Madras was originally owned by one Unnamalai Ammal. She	 was
using  the first floor for her residence and had leased	 out
the  ground  floor to the appellant herein to be used  as  a
godown	for storing his business ware. It is  common  ground
the  appellant's shop is situate in an	adjoining  building.
The  tease was for a period of 10 years with an	 option	 for
renewal	 for  a further period of 5 years.  Unnamalai  Ammal
however refused to renew the lease and filed a suit  against
the  appellant	for eviction on the ground  she	 bona  fide.
required the ground floor also for her residential use.	 The
suit  did not meet with success. Unnamalai Ammal  bequeathed
the  property  to her son-in-law and grand son who  are	 the
respondents herein. As legatees of the premises the respond-
ents  filed  a petition under <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_16">Section 10(3)(c)</a>	of  the	 Act
praying	 for  eviction of the appellant on the	ground	they
bona fide required additional accommodation for their  resi-
dential needs. The Rent Controller upheld their claim, after
finding the relevant factors of bona fide need and com-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">1178</span>
<p id="p_6">parative  hardship in their favour and ordered eviction.  On
appeal	by the appellant, the Appellant	 Authority  reversed
the  findings of the Rent Controller and further  held	that
the  respondent were not entitled to recover  possession  of
non-residential premises for their residential	requirements
and dismissed the petition for eviction. On further revision
to  the High Court by the respondents Remaprasada Rao,	C.J.
set aside the order of the Appellant Authority and  resorted
the  order  of eviction passed by the Rent  Controller.	 The
aggrieved tenant has preferred this appeal.
    The	 judgment under appeal is assailed by the  appellant
on four grounds viz. (1) Since the ground floor	 constitutes
a  building by itself within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1602507/" id="a_17">Section 2(2)</a>  of
the Act, the respondents can seek eviction of the  appellant
only  under  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_18">Section 10(3)(a)(i)</a> of the Act  and  not  under
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_19">Section 10(3)(c)</a>;
</p><p id="p_7">    (2)	 Even  if  the respondents are	entitled  to  invoke
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_20">Section 10(3)(c)</a> they can seek eviction only if they require
the  ground floor for non-residential purposes and  not	 for
residential purposes;
</p><p id="p_8">    (3)	 In any event the factors of relative  hardship	 be-
tween the parties weigh more in favour of the appellant than
the respondent; and
    (4) The High Court was in error in interfering with	 the
findings  of fact rendered by the Appellate Authority  while
exercising  its	 revisional powers under <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_21">Section 25</a>  of	 the
Act.
</p><p id="p_9">    Before  proceeding to examine the merits of the  conten-
tions, it will be relevant to state a few facts. The  ground
floor, though used as a godown, is of a residential  pattern
and  consists of two rooms and a hall besides a kitchen	 and
toilet	rooms. The first floor is being used as their  resi-
dence  by the respondents, the other members of	 the  family
being  the wife and daughter of the second  respondent.	 The
first floor consists of only two rooms and it is the case of
the  respondents that the accommodation in the	first  floor
has  become inadequate for their growing residential  needs.
It is also their case that the first respondent who is	over
65  years of age finds it difficult to climb the  stairs  on
account of his old age and frail health. Their further	plea
is that the water supply to the first floor is inadequate in
spite  of the electric motor and pump set installed  in	 the
ground floor to pump up water. In contrast the appellant  is
said to have a spacious three-storeyed building in Door	 No.
39  adjoining the leased premises and also to  have  another
godown close by.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">1179</span>
<p id="p_10">    One	 of  the contentions of the appellant was  that	 the
eviction proceedings were a continuation of the unsuccessful
attempt by Unnamalai Ammal herself to get the tenant evicted
and, therefore, the eviction petition lacked bona fides. The
High  Court has rejected his contention and in our  opinion,
rightly too, because the respondents who are the legatees of
the building cannot be attributed mala fides because of	 the
earlier	 eviction suit filed by their predecessor in  title.
We  may also dispose of another contention of the  appellant
at  this  juncture itself which had found  favour  with	 the
Appellate Authority. The contention was that with the  death
of  Unnamalai Ammal the family had become smaller and  hence
there  was no need for additional accommodation. This  argu-
ment  overlooks	 the fact that additional  accommodation  is
sought	for  because of the difficulty	experienced  by	 the
first  respondent in climbing the stairs in his old age	 and
the  need for the second respondent's daughter,	 growing  in
years, to have a room all for herself for keeping her  books
and reading at home.
</p><p id="p_11">    We will now proceed to consider the legal contentions of
the appellant in seriatim. The first and foremost contention
was that under the Act the ground floor constitutes a  sepa-
rate building and as such the respondents can seek  recovery
of  possession	of  the	 ground	 floor	only  under  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_22">Section
10(3)(a)(i)</a> and not under <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_23">Section 10(3)(c)</a>. For dealing with
this  contention,  the relevant provisions of the  Act	need
setting out.
</p><p id="p_12">	      <a href="/doc/1602507/" id="a_24">Section  2</a>  which is  the	 definition  Section
	      reads as under:-

	      of  his family is not occupying a	 residential

	      for  an order directing any  tenant  occupying
	      the whole or any portion of the remaining part
	      of the building to put the landlord in posses-
	      sion thereof, it he requires additional accom-
	      modation	for  residential  purposes  or	 for
	      purposes	of a business which he	is  carrying

</p><p id="p_24">	      Provided	that, in the case of an	 application

	      granting it will outweigh the advantage to the
	      landlord:
</p><p id="p_25">	      Provided further that the Controller may	give
	      the  tenant a reasonable time for putting	 the
	      landlord in possession of the building and may
	      extend  such  time so as not to  exceed  three
	      months in the aggregate."
</p><p id="p_26">    It	is no doubt true that under <a href="/doc/1602507/" id="a_27">Section 2(2)</a> a  building
has been. defined as not building or hut but also part of  a
building or hut let separately for residential or  non-resi-
dential purpose. That would, however, only mean that a	part
of  a building which has been let out or which is to be	 let
out separately can also be construed as a separate and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">1181</span>
independent building without reference to the other  portion
or  portions  of the building where it is not  necessary  to
treat the entire building as one Whole and inseparable unit.
A limitation on the definition has been placed by the Legis-
lature	itself	by  providing that the	application  of	 the
definition is subject to the contextual position. Therefore,
it follows that where the context warrants the entire build-
ing being construed as one integral unit, it would be  inap-
propriate  to  view the building as  consisting	 of  several
disintegerated	units and not as one integerated  structure.
Secondly  there is vast difference between the words  "resi-
dential	 building"  and "non-residential building"  used  in
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_28">Section	 10(3)(a)(i)</a> and (iii) on the one hand	and  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_29">Section
10(3)(c)</a>  on the other. While <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_30">Section 10(3)(a)(i)</a> and  (iii)
refer  to a building only as residential or  non-residential
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_31">Section	 10(3)(c)</a> refers to a landlord occupying a pan of  a
building, 'whether residential or non-residential. (Emphasis
supplied).  Further-more,  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_32">Section 10(3)(c)</a>  states  that  a
landlord  may apply to the Controller for an order of  evic-
tion being passed against the tenant "occupying the whole or
any portion of the remaining pan of the building"  (Emphasis
supplied). If as contended by the appellant each portion  of
a building let out separately should always be construed  as
an  independent unit by itself then there is no scope for  a
landlord  occupying "a part of a building" seeking  eviction
of  a  tenant  "occupying the whole or any  portion  of	 the
remaining  part of the building". It is, therefore,  obvious
that in so far as <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_33">Section 10(3)(c)</a> is concerned the Legisla-
ture has intended that the entire building, irrespective  of
one  portion  being occupied by the landlord and  the  other
portion	 or portions being occupied by a tenant	 or  tenants
should be viewed as one whole and integrated unit and not as
different  entities. To import the expansive  definition  of
the  word "building" in <a href="/doc/1602507/" id="a_34">Section 2(2)</a> into  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_35">section  10(3)(c)</a>
would  result in rendering meaningless the words "part of  a
building"  occupied by the landlord and a tenant  "occupying
the whole or any portion of the remaining part of the build-
ing". The third factor militating against the contention  of
the appellant is that if a portion of a building let out  to
a  tenant is to be treated in all situations as	 a  separate
and  independent  building  then <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_36">Section  10(3)(c)</a>  will  be
rendered otiose because the landlord can never then ask	 for
additional  accommodation  since <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_37">Section 10(3)(a)</a>  does	 not
provide for eviction of tenants on the ground of  additional
accommodation  for  the landlord either for  residential  or
non-residential	 purposes.  It	is a well  settled  rule  of
interpretation	of statutes that the provisions of  the	 Act
should be interpreted in such a manner as not to render	 any
of its provisions otiose unless there are compelling reasons
for the Court to resort to that extreme contingency.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">1182</span>
<p id="p_27">    Yet	 another noteworthy feature to be borne in  mind  is
that  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_38">Section 10(3)(c)</a> is governed by two provisos which  is
not the case when eviction orders are made under any of	 the
sub-clauses  of <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_39">Section 10(3)(a)</a>. The first proviso  enjoins
the Controller to reject the application of a landlord under
Section.  10(3)(c) for additional accommodation, even  where
the  need  of the landlord is found to be  genuine,  if	 the
hardship  caused to the tenant by an order of eviction	will
outweigh  the advantage to the landlord by the	said  order.
The  second  proviso  empowers the Controller  to  give	 the
tenant	a reasonable time not exceeding three months in	 the
aggregate  to vacate the portion in his occupation  and	 put
the  landlord  in possession thereof. Obviously	 the  second
proviso	 has  been  made to facilitate the  tenant  to	find
alternate   residential	 or  non-residential   accommodation
elsewhere,  since the landlord who is already in  possession
of a portion of the building can put up with the hardship of
inadequate accommodation for a period of three months at the
most.
</p><p id="p_28">    The	 above	analytical  consideration  of  the  relevant
provisions  bring out clearly the fallacy contained  in	 and
the  untenability  of the contention that the  ground  floor
occupied  by the appellant is a distinct and  separate	unit
and  as such the respondents cannot seek his eviction  under
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_40">Section 10(3)(c)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_29">    This aspect of the matter has been considered in varying
degrees	 in the following decisions and interpreted  in	 ac-
cordance  with	our  conclusion;  vide	Saraswathi  Sriraman
v.P.C.R.  Chetty's Charities, [1972] 2 M.L.J. 515;  <a href="/doc/1652484/" id="a_41">Mohammed
Jarfar	v.  Palaniappa	Chettiar</a>, [1964] 1  M.L.J.  112	 and
<a href="/doc/262050/" id="a_42">Chellammal v. Accommodation Controller</a>, [1967] 2 M.L.J. 453.
Even  the  Division Bench ruling relied on  by	Mr.  Sampath
concedes this position and has observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "Therefore,  if  the context in  a  particular
	      provision	 requires  that	 the  word  building
	      should not be understood as defined in <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_43">Section
	      22</a>, certainly it is open to the Court to	give
	      the normal, natural and ordinary meaning which
	      it  is capable of and for that purpose, it  is
	      not necessary to rely upon any decision. (vide
	      page 153 of the report)."</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">    Taking  up now for consideration the second	 contention,
there  were conflicting decisions in the Madras	 High  Court
and  this  led to a reference of the case in  Thirupathi  v.
Kanta Rao, [1981] Vol. 1 ILR Madras 128 to a Division Bench.
While  the  Division Bench has taken one  view.	 a  Division
Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">1183</span>
taken  a contrary view on the identical issue. It is  perti-
nent to state here that the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh
Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction Control) Act are in pari
tnetria	 with the provisions of the Madras Act in so far  as
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_44">Sections  10(3)(a)</a> and (c) are concerned. The  conflict	 was
with  reference	 to the interpretation of  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_45">Section  10(3)(c)</a>
viz.  whether a landlord occupying a part of a building	 for
residential  purposes  is  entitled to seek  eviction  of  a
tenant	occupying the whole or any portion of the  remaining
part  of the building for non-residential purposes  for	 his
(landlord's)  residential use and vice versa. While  it	 was
held  in  <a href="/doc/291571/" id="a_46">Govindan v. Rajagopal Nadar</a>, [1968] 2	 M.L.J.	 315
that a landlord can seek eviction of a tenant under  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_47">Section
10(3)(c)</a>  for  additional residential purposes only  if	 the
tenant	also is putting the building to residential use	 and
likewise  a landlord can seek additional  accommodation	 for
business  purposes  only if the tenant is also	putting	 the
building to non-residential use, it was held to the contrary
in Premchand Motichand v. Hatneed Sultan, [1958] 1 M.L.J. 32
(S.N.); <a href="/doc/929839/" id="a_48">P.I. Kurian v. Government of Tamil Nadu</a>, 85 L.W. 364
and   Saraswathi  Sriraman  v.	P.C.R.	Chetty's   Charities
(supra).  The latter view was taken by Ismail, J., also,  as
he  then was, in an unreported case viz. Rangaswami  Reddiar
v. Minor N. Jayaraj (C.R.P. No. 2380 of 1977).	Subsequently
in  the	 referred  case, the Division  Bench  consisting  of
Ismail, C.J. and Rathnam J. rendered judgment in  Thirupathi
v.  Kanta Rao, (supra). (Ismail, C.J., changing his  earlier
view) holding that a landlord will be entitled under <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_49">Section
10(3)(c)</a>  to seek additional accommodation  for	 residential
purposes only if it is a residential building in the occupa-
tion Of a tenant and likewise a landlord can seek additional
accommodation  for  non-residential  purposes  only  if	 the
building is a non-residential one.
</p><p id="p_31">    The	 Division Bench has further taken the view that	 the
non  obstante clause is only to entitle a landlord  to	seek
eviction  even	when he is in possession of a portion  of  a
building .belonging to him and nothing more.
    In a later decision <a href="/doc/202143/" id="a_50">G.N. Rajaram v. Mukunthu N. Venkata</a>-
rama  Iyer.  MLJ 1985(2) 173 the Division Bench	 ruling	 has
been followed and eviction was ordered of a tenant occupying
a room in the ground floor of a residential building for his
business purposes. On the other hand a Division Bench of the
Andhra Pradesh High Court in <a href="/doc/718036/" id="a_51">K. Parasuramaiah v. Lakshmamma</a>,
AIR  1965  220	has held that if a  landlord  satisfies	 the
Controller  that  he wants additional accommodation  in	 the
same  building	for his residential or	non-residential	 re-
quirements then notwithstanding the user to which the tenant
was putting the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">1184</span>
leased	portion.  the  landord is entitled to  an  order  of
eviction so that he can re-adjust the additional  accommoda-
tion in the manner convenient to him and it is not necessary
that the additional accommodation sought for should be	used
by  the landlord for the same purpose for which	 the  tenant
sought	to  be	evicted was using it. In the  words  of	 the
Division Bench:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "Clause (c) makes it twice clear that a  land-
	      lord who occupies a part of a building, wheth-
	      er  residential or nonresidential can ask	 for
	      eviction of a tenant occupying another portion
	      whatever	may  be	 his  requirements,  whether
	      residential or non-residential".
</blockquote><p id="p_32">For holding so, the Andhra Pradesh High Court has taken	 the
words  "notwithstanding	 anything in clause (a)"  as  having
over  riding  effect over both the conditions laid  down  in
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_52">Section 10(3)(a)</a> and (iii) viz. a landlord (1) not having  a
building  of his own for residential or nonresidential	pur-
poses;	and (2) seeking the eviction of a tenant from  resi-
dential	 premises  only for residential	 purposes;  and	 (3)
seeking	 eviction of a tenant from non-residential  premises
only for nonresidential purposes.
</p><p id="p_33">   We  will now examine for ourselves the interpretation  to
be given to <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_53">Section 10(3)(c)</a>. In so doing we will first	 see
the  legislative intent behind <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_54">Section 10(3)(c)</a> before	con-
sidering the thrust given by nonobstante clause in it. Since
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_55">Section	 10(3)(c)</a> provides for both situations viz. a  land-
lord occupying a part of a building which is residential  or
non-residential, the sub-clause can be read separately so as
to have reference exclusively to a residential building or a
non-residential	 building.  In	Thirupathy  v.	Kanta	Rao,
(supra)	 the learned Judges have noticed this  position	 and
set out <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_56">Section 10(3)(c)</a> distinctively. But in so doing they
have  restricted the relief of additional  accommodation  to
the landlord for residential purposes to residential  build-
ings  alone and the relief of additional  accommodation	 for
business  purposes  to nonresidential  buildings  alone	 and
therein	 the error has crept in. In our view. this  restric-
tion is not envisaged by <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_57">Section 10(3)(c)</a>. The proper way of
distinctively viewing the Section should be as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "A landlord who is occupying only a part of  a
	      residential   building   may   notwithstanding
	      anything contained in clause (a), apply to the
	      Controller  for an order directing any  tenant
	      occupying	 the  whole or any  portion  of	 the
	      remaining	 part  of the building	to  put	 the
	      landlord in possession
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">	      1185</span>
	      thereof. if he requires additional  accommoda-
	      tion for residential purposes or for  purposes
	      of a business which he is carrying on, as	 the
	      case may be."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      "A landlord who is occupying only a part of  a
	      non-residential  building may  notwithstanding
	      anything contained in clause (a), apply to the
	      Controller  for an order directing any  tenant
	      occupying	 the  whole or any  portion  of	 the
	      remaining	 part  of the building	to  put	 the
	      landlord in possession thereof, if he requires
	      additional   accommodation   for	 residential
	      purposes	or for purposes of a business  which
	      he is carrying on, as the case may be."</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">    If	clause (3) is construed in this manner there can  be
no scope for a contention that a landlord cab seek addition-
al  accommodation  for residence only if the building  is  a
residential one and likewise he can seek additional accommo-
dation for business purposes only if the building is a	non-
residential one.
</p><p id="p_35">    There are several reasons which persuade us to take this
view.  In  the first place it has to be noted  that  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_58">Section
10(3)(c)</a>   stands  on  a  different  footing  from   <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_59">Section
10(3)(a)(i)</a> and <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_60">Section 10(3)(a)(iii)</a>. It is not a case of a
landlord  not  occupying a  residential	 or  non-residential
building  of  his own but a case of a landlord	occupying  a
part of a residential or non-residential building of his own
and putting it to such user as deemed fit by him. Since	 the
requirement  of additional accommodation by the landlord  is
with reference to the manner of his user of that part of the
building which is in his occupation it is the nature of that
requirement  that should prevail over the manner of user  of
the tenant of the portion leased out to him. In other words,
the  additional accommodation is for extending the  user  of
the  building by the landlord to the leased portion for	 the
same  purpose for which the portion not leased out is  being
put to. Such being the case which the landlord is  genuinely
in need of additional accommodation for residential or	non-
residential  requirements,  as the case may be,	 he  can  be
given relief only it the tenant occupying the other  portion
of the building is asked to vacate. If it is to be held that
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_61">Section	 10(3)(c)</a> can be invoked only if the nature  of	 the
requirement  of the landlord and the nature of user  of	 the
leased portion by the tenant coalesce then the landlord will
be  left without any remedy when the nature of his need	 and
the  nature of the user of the leased portion by the  tenant
do not tally. Take for example, a case where a landlord	 has
got  grown-up sons and daughters or there is a	married	 son
and growing daughters or there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">1186</span>
are old parents who cannot climb stairs etc. If the landlord
is  to be refused additional accommodation  for	 residential
purposes  merely  because the tenant is making	use  of	 the
leased	portion	 for nonresidential  purposes  the  landlord
would  be  placed in an awful predicament. Similarly.  if  a
landlord bona fide requires additional accommodation for his
business and his business would suffer serious detriment  if
he  cannot secure additional accommodation, it	would  cause
great  hardship and gave injustice to the landlord if he  is
to  be	denied accommodation merely because  the  tenant  is
making	use of the leased portion for residential  purposes.
It is, therefore, that the Legislature has provided  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_62">Section
10(3)(c)</a>  in its present form so that a landlord  bona	fide
requiring additional accommodation is not confronted with  a
permanently  irremediable  situation. In  its  anxiety	that
<a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_63">Section 10(3)(c)</a> should fully serve the purpose for which it
has  been  enacted the Legislature has also  added  the	 non
obstante  clause.  Having regard to the	 object	 of  <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_64">Section
10(3)(c)</a>  and the terms in which it is worded there is	war-
rant  and  justification for holding that the  non  obstante
clause has been provided to have overriding effect over both
the  restrictions  placed by <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_65">Section 10(3)(a)(i)</a>  and  (iii)
viz.  landlord	seeking eviction of a tenant should  not  be
occupying  a building of his own and secondly the nature  of
user of the leased property by the tenant must correspond to
the nature of the requirement of the landlord.
    In	construing <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_66">Section 10(3)(c)</a> it is pertinent to	note
that the words used are "any tenant" and not "a tenant"	 who
can be called upon to vacate the portion in his	 occupation.
The word "any" has the following meaning:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      "Some; one out of many; an indefinite  number.
	      One  indiscriminately  of	 whatever  kind	  or
	      quantity."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">			Word "any" has a diversity of  mean-
	      ing  and may be employed	to  indicate   "all"
	      or   "every"  as well as "some" or  "one"	 and
	      its  meaning in a given statute  depends	upon
	      the  context  and the subject  matter  of	 the
	      statute.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">			It   is	  often	  synonymous	with
	      "either", "every" or "all". Its generality may
	      be  restricted by context; (Black's  Law	Dic-
	      tionary; Fifth Edition).</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">    Unless the legislature had intended that both classes of
tenants	 can be asked to vacate by the Rent  Controller	 for
providing the. landlord additional accommodation. be it	 for
residential or non-residential
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">1187</span>
purposes.  it would not have used the word "any" instead  of
using the letter "a" to denote a tenant.
</p><p id="p_37">    Thirdly  it	 is  significant to note that  there  is  no
reference  in  clause (c) to the nature of the user  of	 the
tenant	occupying  the leased portion of the  building	viz.
whether	 he  is using it for residential  or  nonresidential
purposes.  If it was the intention of the  legislature	that
only a tenant occupying a residential portion of a  building
can be asked to vacate for providing additional	 residential
accommodation  to the landlord and correspondingly a  tenant
occupying  a portion of a building for non-residential	pur-
poses  alone  being asked to vacate for	 the  nonresidential
requirements  of  the landlord, the legislature	 would	have
provided specific stipulations to that effect in clause (c).
On that ground also it must be construed that clause (c) has
been  provided.	 in order to enable a landlord to  seek	 the
eviction of any tenant occupying the whole or any portion of
the  remaining part of the building for residential or	non-
residential purposes for satisfying the additional needs  of
the  landlord irrespective of whether the need is for  resi-
dential or business purposes.
</p><p id="p_38">    The	 words "as the case may be" in sub clause  (c)	have
been  construed	 by the Division Bench of  the	Madras	High
Court  to  mean that they restrict the landlord's  right  to
secure	additional  accommodation for  residential  purposes
only in respect of a residential building and in the case of
additional  accommodation  for business purpose	 only  to  a
non-residential	 building.  We are of the view that  in	 the
context	 of sub-clause (c). the words "as the case  may	 be"
would  only  mean "whichever the case may  be"	i.e.  either
residential or non-residential.
</p><p id="p_39">    To	sum up, the requirement of additional  accommodation
pertains to the need of the landlord and the manner of	user
of the portion of the building already in his occupation and
consequently the bona fides of his requirement will outweigh
all the restrictions imposed by <a href="/doc/95541/" id="a_67">Section 10(3)(a)</a> i.e. nature
of the building. nature of user of the leased portion by the
tenant	etc.  Even  so, the Legislature has  taken  care  to
safeguard the interests of the tenant by means of the provi-
sos  to the sub-clause. The first proviso enjoins  the	Con-
troller	 to  balance the interests of the landlord  and	 the
tenant and to refuse eviction if the hardship caused to	 the
tenant	will  outweight	 the advantage to  the	landlord  by
reason	of  the	 evicton. The second  proviso  empowers	 the
Controller  to	grant  adequate time to the  tenant  upto  a
maximum	 of three months to vacate the building	 and  secure
accommodation elsewhere. It. there.fore. follows that once a
landlord is able to satisfy the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">1188</span>
Controller that he is bona fide in need of additional accom-
modation  for  residential or non-residential  purposes	 and
that  the advantage derived by him by an order	of  eviction
will outweigh the hardship caused to the tenant, then he  is
entitled  to an order of eviction irrespective of any  other
consideration.
</p><p id="p_40">    In	the light of our conclusion we approve the ratio  in
<a href="/doc/671994/" id="a_68">K.  Prasuramaiah v. Lakshmamma</a>, (supra) and  disapprove	 the
ratio in Thirupathy v. Kanta Rao. (supra).
    The third and fourth question posed for consideration do
not  present  any difficulty. The Rent Controller  has	gone
into  the  question of comparative hardship and	 rendered  a
finding	 in  favour of the respondents. The High  Court	 has
observed  that the Appellate Authority. while reversing	 the
order.	has  failed to take due note of	 relevant  materials
placed	by the respondents. The High Court  has,  therefore,
held  that  the	 Appellate Authority's	findings  have	been
vitiated  because of its non-advertance to the evidence	 and
the apparent errors noticed in its assessment of the compar-
ative  hardship between the parties. In so far as  the	High
Court interfering with the findings of the Appellate Author-
ity is concerned, the High Court has justified its action by
pointing  out  that Appellate Authority	 had  applied  wrong
tests  and  had also failed to give effect  to	unchallenged
findings  of the Rent Controller and hence the order of	 the
Appellate  Authority  suffered from manifest errors  in	 the
exercise of its jurisdiction. The High Court was, therefore.
entitled  to allow the revision and consequently  the  third
and fourth contentions also fail.
</p><p id="p_41">    In the result we find no merit in the appeal and accord-
ingly it will stand dismissed. Mr. Sampath, learned  counsel
for  the appellant made a request that in the event  of	 the
appeal being dismissed, the appellant should be given suffi-
ciently	 long  time to secure another godown and  shift	 his
stock of goods to that place. Mr. Padmanabhan learned  coun-
sel for the respondents very fairly stated that the respond-
ents  are  agreeable  to give time  to	the  appellant	till
31.12.87 to vacate the leased portion. Accordingly we  order
that  in spite of the dismissal of the appeal the  appellant
will  have  time till 31.12.87 to vacate  the  ground  floor
premises  in his occupation and deliver peaceful and  vacant
possession to the respondents subject however to the  appel-
lant  filing  an  under-taking in the usual  terms  in	this
behalf within 4 weeks from today failing which the  respond-
ents will be entitled to recover possession of the  building
forthwith. The parties will bear their respective costs.
