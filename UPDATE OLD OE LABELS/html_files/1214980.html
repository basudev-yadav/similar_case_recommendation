<p id="p_30">13.It   was   contended   by   Shri   K.K.   Venugopal,   learned   senior 



   counsel   appearing   for   the   appellants   that   the   original 



   KUZALR   Act,   1960   excluded   private   forests   [<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_11">Section   6(1)</a> 



   (4)],   since   the   vesting   of   private   forests   in   the   State   would 



   not be by way of agrarian reform. It was further contended 



   that the provision for agrarian reforms, therefore, should be 



   a   part   of   the   Act,   but,   in   the   present   case,   the   private 



   forests   so   acquired   under   Section   4A   of   the   KUZALR   Act 



   becomes the property of the State which is untenable.

<p id="p_31">14.It was further argued that in any event, under Section 4A 



   of   the   KUZALR   Act,   it   is   only   the   provisions   of   Chapter-II 



   and Chapter-V which shall apply to forests land while Rule 



   41   occurs   in   Chapter   IV   and   has   no   application   to   the

  forests   covered   by   <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_12">Section   4A</a>,   and   hence   Rule   41   will   not 



  apply  to forests  acquired  under  Section 4A of the  KUZALR 



  Act.   Further,   if   <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_13">Article   31A</a>   of   the   Constitution   has   no 



  application,   then   the   law   has   to   be   tested   against   the 



  Constitution   as   it   stood   on   the   date   of   its   enactment,   i.e. 



  the   <a href="/doc/562880/" id="a_14">U.P.   Amendment   Act</a>,   1978   bringing   forth   amendment 



  to KUZALR Act has to stand the test of Articles 14, 19 and 



  21   of   the   Constitution.   It   was   further   contended   that   the 



  said   <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_15">Amendment   Act</a>   would   be   invalid   since   the   mere 



  transfer   of   the   private   forests   to   the   State   would   by   itself 



  not be a public purpose and, furthermore, non-grant /total 



  absence   of   compensation   to   the   appellants,   while   granting 



  full   compensation   to   other   owners   of   private   forests   who

<p id="p_43">         It   is   true   that   Section   4A   of   KUZALR   Act,   1960,   as

  amended   by   the   <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_24">UP   Amendment   Act</a>   1978,   provides   that 



  Chapter   II   and   Chapter   V   of   the   KUZALR   Act  would   apply 



  mutatis   mutandis  and   Rule   41   of   the   KUZALR   Rules   is 



  relatable to Chapter IV of the KUZALR Act.     However, the 



  necessary consequence of Section 4A of the KUZALR Act is 



  that the forest land vests in the State and all that Rule 41 



  of   the   KUZALR   Rules   does   is   to   provide   how   the   lands 



  vested in the State including forest and non-forest land is to 



  be dealt with.   Thus, Rule 41 of the KUZALR Rules clearly 



  applies   to   forest   lands   as   it   has   been   specifically   so 



  mentioned in the said Rules as well which are vested in the 



  State   under   Section   4A   of   the   KUZALR   Act   and   therefore 



  have   become   the   land/property   of   the   State,   which   would 



  be managed by the Goan Sabha.

<p id="p_55">28.It   is   trite   law   that   the   plea   of   repugnancy   would   be 



   attracted   only   if   both   the   legislations   fall   under   the 



   Concurrent   List   of   the   Seventh   Schedule   of   the

   State   law   passed   in  respect  of  a  subject  matter   comprised 



   in List III i.e. the Concurrent List of the Seventh  Schedule 



   of   the   Constitution   would   be   invalid   if   its   provisions   are 



   repugnant   to   a   law   passed   on   the   same   subject   by   the 



   Parliament and that too only in a situation if both the laws 



   i.e. one made by the State legislature and another made by 



   the   Parliament   cannot   exist   together.     In   other   words,   the 



   question   of   repugnancy   under   <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_41">Article   254</a>   of   the

   completely   inconsistent   with   each   other   or   when   the 



   provisions   of   both   laws   are   absolutely   irreconcilable   with 



   each other and it is impossible without disturbing the other 



   provision, or conflicting interpretations resulted into, when 



   both   the   statutes   covering   the   same   field   are   applied   to   a 



   given   set   of   facts.       That   is   to   say,   in   simple   words, 



   repugnancy between the two statutes would arise if there is 



   a   direct   conflict   between   the   two   provisions   and   the   law 



   made   by   the   Parliament   and   the   law   made   by   the   State

   issue   of   repugnancy   between   the   law   passed   by   the 



   Parliament   and   of   State   legislature   are   raised,   it   becomes 



   quite   necessary   to   examine   as   to   whether   the   two 



   legislations   cover   or   relate   to   the   same   subject   matter   or 



   different.

  substance   of   such   enactment   on   a   scrutiny   of   the   Act   in

  land becomes the property of the State Government and is 



  dealt with like land, which is acquired under Section 4A of 



  KUZALR Act. This emerges from a reading of Rule 41 of the 



  KUZALR   Rules   itself.   Further,   the   acquisition   under   the 



  KUZALR   Act   is   a   case   of   "taking"   upon   payment   of   an 



  amount, which is not intended to be the market price of the 



  rights acquired. On the other hand, the power of acquisition

  Forests   Act   1927  mainly   deals   with   the   management,

  produce.   The  Indian   Forests   Act   1927  also   incidentally 



  provides for and empowers the State Government to acquire 



  any land which might be required to give effect to any of the 



  purposes   of   the   Act,   in   which   case   such   land   could   be 



  acquired   by   issuing   a   notification   under   Section   4   of   the

  there is a twin requirement, which is to be fulfilled: firstly, 



  there has to be a "repugnancy" between a Central and <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_59">State 



  Act</a>; and secondly, the Presidential assent has to be held as 



  being   non-existent.   The   test   for   determining   such 



  repugnancy is indeed to find out the dominant intention of 



  the both legislations and whether such dominant intentions 



  of   both   the   legislations   are   alike   or   different.   To   put   it 



  simply, a provision in one legislation in order to give effect 



  to   its   dominant   purpose   may   incidentally   be   on   the   same 



  subject as covered by the provision of the other legislation, 



  but such partial or incidental coverage of the same area in 



  a different context  and to achieve  a different purpose does 



  not attract the doctrine of repugnancy. In nutshell, in order 



  to attract the doctrine of repugnancy, both the legislations 



  must be substantially on the same subject.

  field.   This   has   to   be   examined   by   a   reference   to   the 



  doctrine  of pith  and substance.  In the  instant case,  the 



  KUZALR   Act   deals   with   agrarian   reforms   and   in   the 



  context deals with the private forests, this vests with the 



  State   and   would   therefore   be   managed   by   the   Goan 



  Sabha. <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_66">The Indian Forest Act</a>, 1927 which is the existing 



  Central law, has nothing to do with agrarian reforms but 



  deals  with forest  policy and management,  and therefore 



  is in a different field. Further, there is no direct conflict 



  or collision, as the  <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_67">Indian Forest Act</a>, 1927  only gives an 



  enabling   power   to   the   government   to   acquire   forests   in 



  accordance   with   the   provisions   of   the  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_68">Land   Acquisition

  provision first, as to what would happen in the case 
  of   conflict   between   a   Central   and   State   law   with 
  regard   to   the   subjects   enumerated   in   the 
  Concurrent   List,   and   secondly,   for   resolving   such 
  conflict.   <a href="/doc/344383/" id="a_72">Article   254(1)</a>   enunciates   the   normal   rule 
  that in the event of a conflict between a Union and a

  over the latter.  Clause (1) lays down that if a State 
  law relating to a concurrent subject is `repugnant' to 
  a Union law relating to that subject, then, whether 
  the Union law is prior or later in time, the Union law 
  will prevail and the State law shall, to the extent of 
  such   repugnancy,   be   void.   To   the   general   rule   laid

         which   has   been   reserved   for   his   consideration,   it 
         will   prevail   notwithstanding   its   repugnancy   to   an 
         earlier   law   of   the   Union,   both   laws   dealing   with   a 
         concurrent subject. In such a case, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_73">Central Act</a>, 
         will   give   way   to   the   <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_74">State   Act</a>   only   to   the   extent   of 
         inconsistency   between   the   two,   and   no   more.   In 
         short,   the   result   of   obtaining   the   assent   of   the 
         President to a <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_75">State Act</a> which is inconsistent with a 
         previous Union law relating to a concurrent subject 
         would be that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_76">State Act</a> will prevail in that State 
         and   override   the   provisions   of   the   <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_77">Central   Act</a>   in 
         their   applicability   to   that   State   only.   The 
         predominance   of   the   State   law   may   however   be 
         taken   away   if   Parliament   legislates   under   the 
         proviso   to   clause   (2).   The   proviso   to   <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_78">Article   254(2)</a> 
         empowers the Union Parliament to repeal or amend 
         a   repugnant   State   law,   either   directly,   or   by   itself 
         enacting   a   law   repugnant   to   the   State   law   with 
         respect   to   the   `same   matter'.   Even   though   the 
         subsequent   law   made   by   Parliament   does   not 
         expressly   repeal   a   State   law,   even   then,   the   State 
         law will become void as soon as the subsequent law 
         of Parliament creating repugnancy is made. A State 
         law   would   be   repugnant   to   the   Union   law   when 
         there   is   direct   conflict   between   the   two   laws.   Such 
         repugnancy may also arise where both laws operate 
         in the same field and the two cannot possibly stand 
         together:   <a href="/doc/345466/" id="a_79">See   Zaverbhai   Amaidas   v.   State   of

  question   of   repugnancy   between   the   parliamentary 

  legislation and the State legislation could arise in the 

  following two ways: (SCC p. 220)

  "12.   ...   First,   where   the   legislations,   though   enacted 

  with   respect   to   matters   in   their   allotted   sphere, 

  overlap   and   conflict.   Second,   where   the   two 

  legislations   are   with   respect   to   matters   in   the 

  Concurrent   List   and   there   is   a   conflict.   In   both   the 

  situations,               parliamentary            legislation         will 

  predominate,   in   the   first,   by   virtue   of   the   non 

  obstante   clause   in   <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_88">Article   246(1</a>),   in   the   second,   by

  deals   with   a   situation   where   the   State   legislation 

  having been reserved and having obtained President's 

  assent,   prevails   in   that   State;                this   again   is 

  subject   to   the   proviso   that   Parliament   can   again 

  bring   a   legislation   to   override   even   such   State

  both   the   legislations   are   relatable   to   List-III   of   the 



  Seventh   Schedule   of   the   Constitution,   the   test   for 



  repugnancy   is   whether   the   two   legislations   "exercise 



  their   power   over   the   same   subject   matter..."   and 



  secondly whether the law of Parliament was intended "to 



  be exhaustive to cover the  entire  field".      The answer to

  both   these   questions   in   the   instant   case   is   in   the 



  negative, as the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_91">Indian Forest Act</a> 1927 deals with the law 



  relating   to   forest   transit,   forest  levy   and  forest  produce, 



  whereas   the   KUZALR   Act   deals   with   the   land   and 



  agrarian reforms.
</p>



<p id="p_98">46.In   respect   of   the   Concurrent   List   under   Seventh 



  Schedule   to   the   Constitution,   by   definition   both   the 



  legislatures viz. the Parliament and the State legislatures 



  are   competent   to   enact   a   law.       Thus,   the   only   way   in 



  which   the   doctrine   of   pith   and   substance   can   and   is 



  utilised in determining the question of repugnancy is to 



  find   out   whether   in   pith   and   substance   the   two   laws 



  operate and relate to the same matter or not.     This can 



  be   either   in   the   context   of   the   same   Entry   in   List   III   or 



  different Entries in List III of the Seventh Schedule of the 



  Constitution. In other words, what has to be examined is 



  whether   the   two   Acts   deal   with   the   same   field   in   the 



  sense   of   the   same   subject   matter   or   deal   with   different 



  matters.

<p id="p_100">  Repugnancy arises in the Australian Constitution, which

<p id="p_101">48.In the Australian cases, the concept of Repugnancy has

  two   laws   cannot   co-exist   together.   To   put   it   differently,

       provisions   enacted   by   Parliament   and   the   State 

       Legislature   cannot   unitedly   stand   and   the   State 

       law will have to make way for the Union law. Once 

       it  is   proved   and  established   that   the   State   law   is 

       repugnant   to   the   Union  law,  the   State   law   would 

       become void but only to the extent of repugnancy. 

       At   the   same   time   it   is   to   be   noted   that   mere 

       possibility   of   repugnancy   will   not   make   a   State

<p id="p_118">   14. The line of reasoning of our learned Brother, 

Chinnappa Reddy, affords a satisfactory solution to

reservation  of  any  kind.  The  pith  and   substance   of 

the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_109">Punjab Act</a> of 1953 is "Land" which falls under 

Entry   18   of   List   II   (State   List)   of   the   Seventh 

Schedule   to   the   Constitution.   That   Entry   reads 

thus:
</p>
<p id="p_119">   "18.   Land,   that   is   to   say,   rights   in   or   over   land, 

land  tenures  including  the  relation of  landlord and 

tenant,   and   the   collection   of   rents;   transfer   and 

alienation   of   agricultural   land;   land   improvement 

and agricultural loans; colonisation."
</p>
<p id="p_120">Our learned Brother has extracted a passage from a 

decision   of   a   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   in 

<a href="/doc/1308921/" id="a_110">Ranjit Singh v. State of Punjab3</a> which took the view 

that since,  the  <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_111">Punjab Act</a> of 1953  is  a  measure of 

agrarian   reform,   it   would   receive   the   protection   of 

<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_112">Article   31-A.</a>   It   may   be   recalled   that   the   Act   had 

received  the   assent   of   the   President   as  required   by 

the   first   proviso   to   that   article.   The   power   of   the 

State   Legislature   to   pass   laws   on   matters 

enumerated in the State List is exclusive by reason 

of   the   provision   contained   in   <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_113">Article   246(3).</a>   In   a 

nutshell,   the   position   is   that   the   Parliament   has 

passed a law on a matter which falls under Entry 41 

of   the   Concurrent   List,   while   the   State   Legislature 

has passed a law which falls under Entry 18 of the 

State List. The law passed by the State Legislature, 

being a measure of agrarian reform, is conducive to 

the welfare of the community and there is no reason 

why   that   law   should   not   have   effect   in   its   full 

amplitude.   By   this   process,   the   Village   Panchayats 

will   be   able   to   meet   the   needs   of   the   village

         <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_114">Punjab   Act</a>   of   1953   would   prevail   in   the   State   of

         the   Constitution   is   not   a   matter   of   idle   formality. 

         The   President   has,   at   least,   to   be   apprised   of   the 

         reason   why   his   assent   is   sought   if,  there   is   any  

         special   reason   for   doing   so.  If   the   assent   is   sought

         Thus   it   is   clear   that   this   Court   did   not   intend   to 

         hold   that   it   is   necessary   that   in   every   case   the 

         assent   of   the   President   in   specific   terms   had   to   be 

         sought   and   given   for   special   reasons   in   respect   of 

         each   enactment   or   provision   or   provisions.   On   the 

         other hand, the observation clearly indicates that if 

         the   assent   is   sought   and   given   in   general   terms   it 

         would  be   effective   for   all  purposes.   In  other   words, 

         this Court observed that the assent sought for and 

         given   by   the   President   in   general   terms   could   be 

         effective   for   all   purposes   unless   specific   assent   is

that the acquisition and requisitioning of property will be for a 



public   use   and   for   compensation   and   whenever   a   person   is

the Court can always examine the legality and validity of the

respect of KUZALR Act, the same U.P. Legislature which had 



the   example   of   <a href="/doc/119269058/" id="a_160">Section   39(1)(e)</a>   deliberately   dropped   the 



second   sub-clause   and   limited   the   compensation   only   to   the 



average annual income of the last 20 years. From this it was 



argued that where there is no annual income, there would be 



no compensation.

<p id="p_152">66.       It  had   been   further   argued   that  since   the   expression 



"average   annual   income"   under   <a href="/doc/119269058/" id="a_161">Section   39(1)</a>   (e)   (i)   has

income and not an estimate, therefore, if the forest land is not 



earning any income, then in the statutory formula set out in 



KUZALR Act, it would not be entitled to any compensation.

<p id="p_153">67.       The   Government   is   empowered   to   acquire   land   by 



exercising   its   various   statutory   powers.   Acquisition   of   land 



and   thereby   deprivation   of   property   is   possible   and 



permissible   in   accordance   with   the   statutory   framework 



enacted.   Acquisition   is   also   permissible   upon   exercise   of 



police power of the State. It is also possible and permissible to 



acquire   such   land   by   exercising   the   power   vested   under   the 



<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_163">Land   Acquisition   Act</a>.   <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_164">This   Act</a>   mandates   acquisition   of   land 



for public purpose or public use, which expression is defined 



in the Act itself. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_165">This Act</a> also empowers acquisition of land for 



use   of   companies   also   in   the   manner   and   mode   clearly

specifically enumerated in Section 40 of the Land Acquisition

Act. But, in case of both the aforesaid  manner of acquisition 



of land, the Act envisages payment of compensation for such 



acquisition   of   land   and   deprivation   of   property,   which   is 



reasonable and just.

<p id="p_154">68.       <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_166">Article   31(2)</a>   of   the   Constitution   has   since   been 



repealed by the Constitution (44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_167">Amendment) Act</a> 1978. It is 



to be noted that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_168">Article 300A</a> was inserted by the Constitution 



(44th  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_169">Amendment)   Act</a>,   1978   by   practically   reinserting   <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_170">Article 



31(1)</a>   of   the   Constitution.   Therefore,   right   to   property   is   no 



longer   a   fundamental   right   but   a   right   envisaged   and 



conferred by the Constitution and that also by retaining only 



<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_171">Article   31(1)</a>   of   the   Constitution   and   specifically   deleting 



<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_172">Article 31(2</a>), as it stood.  In view of the aforesaid position the 



entire   concept   to   right   to   property   has   to   be   viewed   with   a 



different   mindset   than   the   mindset   which   was   prevalent 



during   the   period   when   the   concept   of   eminent   domain   was 



the embodied provision of fundamental rights.   But even now 



as   provided   under   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_173">Article   300A</a>   of  the   Constitution  the   State 



can proceed to acquire land for specified use but by enacting 



a   law   through   State   legislature   or   by   Parliament   and   in   the 



manner   having   force   of   law.     When   the   State   exercises   the 



power   of   acquisition   of   a   private   property   thereby   depriving 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                Page 46 of 52</span>


the private person of the property, provision is generally made 



in the statute to pay compensation to be fixed or determined 



according to the criteria laid down in the statute itself. It must 



be   understood   in   this   context   that   the  acquisition   of   the 



property by the State in furtherance of the Directive Principles 



of State Policy was to distribute the material resources of the 



community   including   acquisition   and   taking   possession   of 



private   property   for   public   purpose.   It   does   not   require 



payment   of   market   value   or   indemnification   to   the   owner   of 



the property expropriated. Payment of market value in lieu of 



acquired   property   is   not   a   condition   precedent   or   sine   qua 



non   for   acquisition.   It   must   be   clearly   understood   that   the 



acquisition   and   payment   of   amount   are   part   of   the   same 



scheme   and   they   cannot   be   separated.   It   is   true   that   the 



adequacy of compensation cannot be questioned in a court of 



law,   but   at   the   same   time   the   compensation   cannot   be 



illusory. 
</p>



<p id="p_155">69.       Further, it  is  to  be clearly understood  that the  stand 



taken   by   the   State   that   the   right,   title   or   interests   of   a 



hissedar      could   be   acquired   without   payment   of   any 



compensation,   as   in   the   present   case,   is   contrary   to   the 



express   provisions   of   KUZALR   Act   itself.     <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_174">Section   12</a>   of   the 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                               Page 47 of 52</span>


KUZALR   Act,   1960   states   that   every  hissedar  whose   rights, 



title or interest are acquired under <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_175">Section 4</a>, shall be entitled 



to receive and be paid compensation.   Further, Section 4A of 



the KUZALR Act makes it clear that the provisions of Chapter 



II   (Acquisition   and   Modifications   of   existing   rights   in   Land), 



including <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_176">Section 12</a>, shall apply  mutatis mutandis  to a forest 



land as they apply to a khaikhari land.   Further, the intention 



of   the   legislature   to   pay   compensation   is   abundantly   clear 



from   the   fact   that   <a href="/doc/50607108/" id="a_177">Section   19</a>   itself   prescribes   that   the 



compensation payable to a hissedar under <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_178">Section 12</a> shall, in 



the   case   of   private   forest,   be   eight   times   the   amount   of 



average annual income from such forest. In the instant case, 



income also includes possible income in case of persons who 



have   not   exploited   the   forest   and   have   rather   preserved   it. 
</p>


<p id="p_156">Otherwise,   it   would   amount   to   giving   a   licence   to 



owners/persons   to   exploit   forests   and   get   huge   return   of 



income and not to maintain and preserve it. The same cannot 



be   said   to   be   the   intention   of   the   legislature   in   enacting   the 



aforesaid   KUZALR   Act.   In   fact,   the   persons   who   are 



maintaining   the   forest   and   preserving   it   for   future   and 



posterity cannot be penalised by giving nil compensation only 



because of the reason that they were in fact chose to maintain

the forest instead of exploiting it. 
</p>



<p id="p_157">70.       We are of the considered view that the decision of this 



Court   in  Ganga  Devi  (supra)   is   not   applicable   in   the   present 



case   in   as   much   as   this   Court   in  Ganga   Devi  (supra)   never 



dealt   with   a   situation   of   unexploited   forest   and   the 



interpretation of actual income was done in the peculiar facts 



and   circumstances   of   the   said   case.   The   said   case   does   not 



deal   with   a   situation   where   there   could   be   such   income 



possible   to   be   derived   because   it   was   unexploited   but   there 



could  be   no income  derived  immediately   even   if  it  is   used  or 



exploited.   Therefore,   the   said   case   is   clearly   distinguishable 



on facts. A distinction and difference has been drawn between 



the   concept   of   `no   compensation'   and   the   concept   of   `nil 



compensation'.  As mandated by <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_179">Article 300A</a>, a person can be 



deprived   of   his   property   but   in   a   just,   fair   and   reasonable 



manner.     In   an   appropriate   case   the   Court   may   find   `nil 



compensation'   also   justified   and   fair   if   it   is   found   that   the 



State   has   undertaken   to   take   over   the   liability   and   also   has 



assured   to   compensate   in   a   just   and   fair   manner.     But   the 



situation   would   be   totally   different   if   it   is   a   case   of   `no 



compensation' at all. As already held `a law seeking to acquire 



private   property   for   public   purpose   cannot   say   that   `no 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                Page 49 of 52</span>


compensation'   would   be   paid.     The   present   case   is   a  case   of 



payment of `no compensation' at all.  In the case at hand, the 



forest land which was vested on the State by operation of law 



cannot  be   said   to   be   non-productive   or  unproductive   by   any 



stretch of imagination. The property in question was definitely 



a   productive   asset.   That   being   so,   the   criteria   to   determine 



possible  income on  the  date  of  vesting   would  be  to  ascertain 



such   compensation   paid   to   similarly   situated   owners   of 



neighboring   forests   on   the   date   of   vesting.   Even   otherwise, 



revenue authority can always make an estimation of possible 



income on the date of vesting if the property in question had 



been   exploited   by   the   appellants   and   then   calculate 



compensation on the basis thereof in terms of <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_180">Sections 18(1)</a> 



(cc) and 19(1) (b) of KUZALR Act. We therefore find sufficient 



force   in   the   argument   of   the   counsel   for   the   appellants   that 



awarding   no   compensation   attracts   the   vice   of   illegal 



deprivation   of   property   even   in   the   light   of   the   provisions   of 



the Act and therefore amenable to writ jurisdiction.
</p>



<p id="p_158">71.       That being so, the omission of the <a href="/doc/119269058/" id="a_181">Section 39(1)</a> (e) (ii) 



of   the   UPZALR   Act   1950   as   amended   in   1978   is   of   no 



consequence   since   the   UPZALR   Act   leaves   no   choice   to   the 



State   other   than   to   pay   compensation   for   the   private   forests

<p id="p_159">72.       In   view   of   the   above,   the   present   appeal   is   partly 



allowed   while   upholding   the   validity   of   the   Act   and 



particularly   <a href="/doc/37693258/" id="a_182">Sections   4A</a>,   <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_183">18(1)</a>   (cc)   and   19   (1)   (b)   of   the 



KUZALR   Act,   we   direct   the   second   respondent,   i.e.   Assistant 



Collector   to   determine   and   award   compensation   to   the 



appellants   by   following  a  reasonable   and  intelligible   criterion 



evolved on the aforesaid guidelines provided and in light of the 



aforesaid   law   enunciated   by   this   Court   hereinabove.   The 



appellants   will   also   be   entitled   to   interest   @   six   percent   per 



annum   on   the   compensation   amount   from   the   date   of 



dispossession till the date of payment provided possession of 



the   forest   was   handed   and   taken   over   formally   by   the 



Respondent physically and provided the appellant  was totally 



deprived   of   physical   possession   of   the   forest.     However,   we 



would   like   to   clarify   that   in   case   the   physical/actual 



possession has not been handed over by the appellants to the 



State   government   or   has   been   handed   over   at   some 



subsequent  date i.e.  after the date of vesting, the interest  on 



the   compensation   amount   would   be   payable   only   from   the 



date of actual handover/physical possession of the property in 



question   and   not   from   the   date   of   vesting.   In   terms   of   the
