HEADNOTE:
     The appellant  company carries  on business  as valuers
and surveyors  undertaking inspection  of quality, weighment
analysis, sampling  of merchandise and commodities, cargoes,
industrial  products,	machinery,  textiles   etc.  It	 has
established a  reputation and  goodwill in  its business  by
developing  its	 own  techniques  for  quality	testing	 and
control and  possess trade  secrets in	the  form  of  these
techniques and clientele. It has its head office at Calcutta
and a  branch at  New Delhi  and employs  various persons as
managers and  in other capacities in Calcutta; New Delhi and
other places.
     On March  27, 1971,  the respondent was employed by the
appellant company  as the  Branch Manager  of its  New Delhi
office on  terms and  conditions contained  in the letter of
appointment issued  to him  on the same date. Clause (10) of
the terms and conditions of employment placed the respondent
under a	 post service  restraint that he shall not serve any
other competitive  firm nor  carry on business on his own in
similar line  as that of the appellant company for two years
at the	place of his last posting. On November 24, 1978, the
appellant company  terminated the respondent's services with
effect	from   December	 27,  1978.  Thereafter,  respondent
started his  own  business  under  the	name  and  style  of
"Superintendence and  Surveillance Inspectorate of India" at
E-22 South  Extension New  Delhi on  lines identical with or
substantially similar  to that	of the appellant company. On
April 19,  1979 the  appellant company brought a suit in the
Delhi High Court on its original side, claiming Rs. 55,000/-
as damages  on account	of the	breach of  negative covenant
contained in  clause  (10);  and  for  permanent  injunction
restraining the	 respondent by himself, his servants, agents
or otherwise,  from carrying  on the  said business  or	 any
other business	on lines  similar to  that of  the appellant
company or  associating or  representing any  competitors of
the appellant  company before  the expiry  of two years from
December 27,  1978. After  filing  the	suit  the  appellant
company sought	an ad interim injunction by way of enforcing
the aforesaid  negative covenant  and a	 Single Judge of the
Delhi High  Court initially granted an ad interim injunction
on April 29, 1979 which was confirmed by him on May 25, 1979
after hearing  the respondent.	On appeal by the respondent,
the Division  Bench of	the High  Court reversed the interim
order and hence the appeal by certificate.
     Dismissing the appeal, the Court
1279
^
     HELD: (Per	 Tulzapurkar J.,  on behalf  of Untwalia, J.
and himself).
     1. Assuming  that the  negative covenant  contained  in
clause (10) of the service agreement is valid and not hit by
<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_4">section 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act, it is not enforceable
against the  respondent at  the instance  of  the  appellant
company. The appellant company should have taken care to use
appropriate language,  while incorporating  such restrictive
covenant so  as	 to  include  every  case  of  cessation  of
employment arising  from any  reason whatsoever and not used
the expression	"leave", which normally is synonymous to the
expression "quit" and indicates voluntary act on the part of
the employee. [1285 F, 1287 A, B-C]
     (2) The  word "leave"  has various	 shades	 of  meaning
depending upon	the context or intent with which it is used.
According to  the plain	 grammatical meaning  that  word  in
relation to  an employee  would	 normally  be  construed  as
meaning voluntary  leaving of  the service  by him and would
not include  a case  where he  is discharged or dismissed or
his services are terminated by his employer. Ordinarily, the
word connotes voluntary action.
[1286-D]
     (3) In  the instant  case, having regard to the context
in which  the expression  leave occurs in clause (10) of the
service agreement  and reading	it alongwith  all the  other
terms of  agreement, it	 is clear  that the word "leave" was
intended by  the parties  to  refer  to	 a  case  where	 the
employee voluntarily  left the services of his own. [1286 G-
H, 1287 A]
     Murray v.	Close, 32  Law Times  Old series p. 89; held
inapplicable to Indian Law.
     Muesling v. International Rly. Co., 147 N.Y.S. 177, 178
85 Misc 309; quoted with approval.
     Per Sen J.:
     1.	 Agreements   of  service,   containing	 a  negative
covenant preventing  the employee from working elsewhere are
not void under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_5">section 27</a> of the Contract Act, on the ground
that they  are in  restraint of	 trade. Such  agreements are
enforceable, the reason being that the doctrine of restraint
of trade  never applies during the continuance of a contract
of employment and applies only when the contract comes to an
end. While  during  the	 period	 of  employment	 the  Courts
undoubtedly would  not grant  any specific  performance of a
contract of personal service, nevertheless <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_6">Section 57</a> of the
Specific Relief	 Act clearly  provides for  the grant  of an
injunction to  restrain the breach of such a covenant, as it
is not in restraint of, but in furtherance of trade.
[1289 C-E]
     2. There  is a  clear distinction between a restriction
in a  contract of  employment which  is operative during the
period of  employment and  one which is to operate after the
termination  of	  employment.  Mere  existence	of  negative
covenant in a service agreement does not make it void on the
ground that it was in restraint of trade and contrary to the
<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_7">Contract Act</a>.  The restriction contained in clause 10 of the
agreement in  this case is clearly in restraint of trade and
therefore illegal  under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_8">section  27</a> of the Contract Act. It
is not	seeking to  enforce the negative covenant during the
term  of   employment  of   the	 respondent  but  after	 the
termination of his services. [1289 F-G, 1290 F-G, 1291 C-D]

     <a href="/doc/452434/" id="a_9">Niranjan  Shankar	Golikari  v.  Century  Spinning	 and
Manufacturing Co., Ltd</a>., [1967] 2 SCR 378, distinguished.
     3. When  a	 rule  of  English  law	 receives  statutory
recognition by the Indian Legislature, it is the language of
the Act	 which determines  the scope,  uninfluenced  by	 the
manner	in   which  the	 anologous  provision  comes  to  be
construed narrowly  or otherwise  modified in order to bring
the construction  within the  scope and	 limitations of	 the
rule governing	the English doctrine of trade. [1291 H, 1292
A]
     Satyavrata Ghosh  v. Kurmee Ram Bangor, [1954] SCR 310,
followed.
     4. A  contract which  has for its object a restraint of
trade  is,   prima  facie  void.  The  question	 whether  an
agreement is  void under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_10">section 27</a> must be decided upon the
wording of  that section. There is nothing in the wording of
<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_11">section 27</a> to suggest that the principle stated therein does
not apply when the restraint is for a limited period only or
is confined  to a  particular area.  Such matters of partial
restriction have  effect only  when the fact fall within the
exception to the section. <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_12">Section 27</a> of the Contracts Act is
general in  terms, and	declares all agreements in restraint
void  pro  tanto,  except  in  the  case  specified  in	 the
application  and   unless  a   particular  contract  can  be
distinctly brought  within Exception  I there  is no  escape
from the  prohibition. Here the agreement in question is not
a "good	 will of business", type of contract, and, therefore
does not  fall within the exception. If the agreement on the
part of the respondent puts a restraint even though partial,
it was void, and, therefore, the contract must be treated as
one which cannot be enforced. [1292 E-H, 1293 A, F-G]
     Madhub Chander v. Raj Coomar Dass, (1874) Bom.L.R. 76 @
85-86; approved.
     5. A  contract in	restraint of trade is one by which a
party restricts	 his future  liberty to	 carry on his trade,
business or  profession in such manner and with such persons
as he chooses. A contract of this class is prima facie void,
but it	becomes binding	 upon proof  that the restriction is
justifiable in	the circumstances  as being  reasonable from
the point  of view of the parties themselves and also of the
community. Under  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_13">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act the onus is
upon the covenanter. [1292 H, 1293 A, &amp; 1294 D-E]
     6. A  law does  not cease to be operative because it is
an anachronism	or because  it is  antiquated or because the
reason why  it originally  became the law could be no reason
for the	 introduction of  such a  law at  the present times.
Neither the test of reasonableness nor the principle of that
the restraint being partial was reasonable are applicable to
a case governed by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_14">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act, unless it
falls within  Exception I.  Under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_15">Section 27</a> of the Contract
Act, a	service covenant  extended beyond the termination of
the service is void. [1299 A-C]
     Nordenfelt v. Maxim. Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co.
Ltd. L.R.  [1894] A.C.	535; Mason v. Provident Clothing and
Supply Co.  Ltd., L.R.	[1930] A.C. 724; Herbert Morris Ltd.
v. Saxelby; discussed.
     7. On a true construction of clause 10 of the agreement
the negative  convenant not  serve elsewhere or enter into a
competitive business does not, arise
1281
when the  employee  does  not  leave  the  services  but  is
dismissed from	service. Wrongful dismissal is a repudiation
of contract  of service	 which relieves	 the employee of the
restrictive covenant. [1299 <a href="/doc/954013/" id="a_16">E-F]
     General Billposting  Co. v.  Atkinson, L.	R</a>. [1909] AC
118; referred to.
     8. The  word 'leave'  has	various	 shades	 of  meaning
depending upon	the context of intent with which it is used.
According to the plain meaning, the word 'leave' in relation
to an  employee,  should  be  construed	 to  mean  where  he
"voluntarily" leaves  i.e. of  his own volition and does not
include a  case of  dismissal. The  word 'leave'  appears to
connote voluntary  action, and	is synonymous  with the word
'quit'. It does not refer to the expulsion of an employee by
the act	 of his employer without his consent and against his
remonstrance. That  is a  meaning in consonance with justice
and fair play.
[1299 H, 1300 A-B]
     9. Restrictions  on competitions  during the  period of
service are  normally valid and indeed may be implied by law
by virtue  of the  servant's duty of fidelity. In such cases
the restriction	 is generally  reasonable, having  regard to
the interest  of the  employer and  does not cause any undue
hardship to  the employee, who will receive a wage or salary
for the	 period in  question. But  if  the  covenant  is  to
operate after  the termination of services, or is too widely
worded, the Court may refuse to enforce it. [1300 C-D]
     10. It  is well  established that	employee's covenants
should be  carefully scrutinised because there is inequality
of  bargaining	 power	between	  the  parties;	  indeed  no
bargaining power may occur because the employee is presented
with a standard form of contract to accept or reject. At the
time of	 the agreement,	 the employee  may have given little
thought to  the restriction  because of	 his eagerness for a
job; such contracts "tempt improvident persons, for the sake
of present  gain, to deprive themselves of the power to make
future	acquisitions  and  expose  them	 to  imposition	 and
oppression". [1300 E-F]
     11.  The  Courts  view  with  disfavour  a	 restrictive
covenant by  an employee not to engage in a business similar
to or  competitive with	 that  of  the	employer  after	 the
termination  of	  his  contract	  of  employment   since   a
restrictive covenant  ancillary to  a contract of employment
is likely  to affect  the employee's  means or	procuring  a
livelihood for himself and his family. [1301 B-C]
     12. The  true rule	 of  construction  is  that  when  a
covenant or  agreement is impeached on the ground that it is
in restraint  of trade,	 the duty  of the Court is, first to
interpret the covenant or agreement itself, and to ascertain
according to  the ordinary rules of construction what is the
fair meaning  of the  parties. If  there is  an ambiguity it
must receive  a narrower  construction than  the wider.	 The
restraint may  not be  greater than necessary to protect the
employer, nor  unduly harsh  and oppressive to the employee.
Even if	 the word  'leave' contained  in clause	 10  of	 the
agreement is  susceptible of  another construction  as being
operative  on  termination,  however,  accomplished  of	 the
service e.g.  by  dismissal  without  notice,  would  having
regard to  the provisions of <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_17">section 27</a> of the Contract Act,
1972, try  to preserve the Government in clause 10 by giving
to it a restrictive meaning, as implying volition i.e. where
the employee resigns or voluntarily leaves the services. The
restriction being  too wide;  and violative of <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_18">section 27</a> of
the  Contract	Act,  must   be	 subjected   to	 a  narrower
construction. [1301 C-G]

Respondent.
</p><p id="p_5">     The following Judgments were delivered
     TULZAPURKAR, J.  This appeal  at the  instance  of	 the
appellant company  (original plaintiff)	 is directed against
an interlocutory  order passed	by the	High Court in F.A.O.
(O.S.) 86  of 1979 refusing to grant temporary injunction in
a suit	which is  still pending.  Principally it  raises two
substantial   questions:    (a)	  whether   a	post-service
restrictive covenant  in restraint  of trade as contained in
cl. (10)  of the  service agreement  between the  parties is
void under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_19"> s. 27</a>  of the  Indian Contract  Act	 ?  and	 (b)
whether the  said restrictive  covenant, assuming  it to  be
valid, is  on its  terms enforceable  at the instance of the
appellant company against the respondent ?
</p><p id="p_6">     On March  21, 1980	 we  dismissed	the  appeal  at	 the
conclusion of the hearing and it was stated that our reasons
will follow.  We now  proceed to  give our  reasons for	 the
dismissal.
</p><p id="p_7">     Briefly stated  the  facts	 are  these.  The  appellant
company	 carries  on  business	as  valuers  and  surveyors,
undertaking  inspection	 of  quality,  weighment,  analysis,
sampling of merchandise and commodities, cargoes, industrial
products, machinery,  textiles, etc.  It has  estabilshed  a
reputation and	goodwill in  its business  by developing its
own techniques for quality testing and control and possesses
trade secrets in the form of these techniques and clientele.
It has its head office at Calcutta and a branch at New Delhi
and  employs  various  persons	as  managers  and  in  other
capacities in Calcutta, New Delhi and other places. On March
27, 1971  the  respondent  was	employed  by  the  appellant
company as  the Branch	Manager of  its New  Delhi office on
terms and  conditions contained in the letter of appointment
issued to him on the same date. Clause (10) of the terms and
conditions of employment placed the respondent under a post-
service	 restraint   that  he  shall  not  serve  any  other
competitive firm nor carry on business on his own in similar
line as	 that of  the appellant company for two years at the
place of  his last posting. Since it is vital we set out the
said clause which ran thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "10. That  you will  not be  permitted to join any
     firm of  our competitors  or run a business of your own
     in similar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">1283</span>
     lines directly  and/or indirectly,	 for a period of two
     years at the place of your last posting after you leave
     the company."</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">     On November  24, 1978  the appellant company terminated
the respondent's  services with	 effect	 from  December	 27,
1978. Thereafter  the respondent  started his  own  business
under  the   name  and	 style	 of   "Superintendence	 and
Surveillance  Inspectorate   of	 India"	  at   B-22,   South
Extension,  New	  Delhi	  on   lines   identical   with	  or
substantially similar  to that	of the appellant company. On
April 19,  1979 the  appellant company brought a suit in the
Delhi High  Court on its Original Side claiming Rs. 55,000/-
as damages  on	account	 of  the  breach  of  the  aforesaid
negative covenant  contained in	 cl. (10)  and for permanent
injunction  restraining	  the  respondent  by  himself,	 his
servants, agents  or otherwise,	 from carrying	on the	said
business or  any other	business on lines similar to that of
the appellant  company or  associating or  representing	 any
competitors of	the appellant  company before  the expiry of
two years  from December 27, 1978. After filing the suit the
appellant company  sought an  interim injunction  by way  of
enforcing the aforesaid negative covenant and a Single Judge
of the	Delhi High  Court initially  granted an	 ad  interim
injunction on  April 29,  1979 which was confirmed by him on
May 25,	 1979 after  hearing  the  respondent.	The  learned
Single Judge took the view that the negative covenant, being
in partial restraint of trade, was reasonable inasmuch as it
was limited both in point of time (two years) as well as the
area of	 operation (New	 Delhi which  was his  last posting)
and, therefore, was not hit by<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_20"> s. 27</a> of the Contract Act. He
also  took   the  view	 that  the   negative  covenant	 was
enforceable as	the expression	"leave" in  cl. (10) was not
confined to  voluntarily  leaving  of  the  service  by	 the
respondent but was wide enough to include termination of his
services  by   the  appellant  company.	 On  appeal  by	 the
respondent, a  Division Bench of the High Court reversed the
order of  the learned  Single Judge  on both  the points and
that is	 how the two questions indicated at the commencement
of this judgment arise for our determination in this appeal.
</p><p id="p_9">     Since in  our view	 the  appeal  is  capable  of  being
disposed of  on the  second point we think it unnecessary to
decide or  express our	opinion on  the first question which
was hotly  and ably  debated at the bar by counsel on either
side but  we will  indicate briefly the rival lines on which
the arguments  proceeded. On  the one  hand counsel  for the
respondent tried  to support  the view of the Division Bench
by pointing  out that  in India	 the law  on the subject was
codified by statute which was exhaustive and on the topic of
agreements in  restraint of  trade and	exceptions  in	that
behalf the Indian Courts cannot invoke or derive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">1284</span>
assistance from	 the English  Common Law  and the exceptions
developed thereto  by English  decisions from  time to time,
that<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_21"> s.	 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act was absolute in terms
in that	 it did	 not make any distinction between partial or
general restraints and that unless a case was covered by the
Exception provided  thereunder	every  restraint  of  trade,
whether partial or general would be void under that section.
In this	 behalf reliance was placed on a number of decisions
of  various  High  Courts  commencing  from  the  celebrated
decision of  Sir Richard  Couch, C.J.  in Madhub  Chunder v.
Rajcoomar  Doss(1)  where <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_22"> s.  27</a>  was	interpreted  in	 the
aforesaid manner. Counsel urged that a distinction between a
negative covenant  operative during the period of employment
and one	 that is  operative during  post-service period	 has
been well  recognised and  that all post-service restrictive
covenants were	prima facie  void, that	 the only exceptions
were those  given in  the statute  and that  the  exceptions
developed by the English case law could not be invoked here.
According to him the test of reasonableness had been wrongly
adopted by  the learned	 Single Judge.	He pointed  out that
accepting the  interpretation placed on<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_23"> s. 27</a> by High Courts
even the  Law Commission has recommended a change in that by
suitable  legislation.	He  further  pointed  out  that	 the
Division Bench has gone a step further and after considering
whether the  instant case would fall within those exceptions
developed by  English  case  Law  has  come  to	 a  negative
conclusion against the appellant company.
</p><p id="p_10">     On the  other hand	 counsel for  the appellant  company
contended that	the interpretation  of<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_24"> s.  27</a>  as  given  by
various High  Courts including	Sir Richard Couch's decision
in Madhub  Chunder's  case  (supra)  has  not  been  so	 far
considered by  this Court and it requires to be examined and
considered by  this Court  especially  in  view	 of  certain
observations  made   by	 this	Court  in  Niranjan  Shankar
Golikari's (2)	case  which  warrant  such  reconsideration.
Though it was a case dealing with negative covenant that was
operative during  the employment  period counsel pointed out
that entire case law Indian as well as English was discussed
and this Court at page 389 of the report observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  "The	result	of  the	 above	discussion  is	that
     considerations  against   restrictive   covenants	 are
     different in  cases where	the restriction	 is to apply
     during the period after the termination of the contract
     than those	 in cases  where it is to operate during the
     period of the contract."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">1285</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">		      Tulzapurkar, J.)
According to  counsel the  very fact  that  this  Court	 has
observed that  considerations qua  post-service restrictions
are different  from those that are to be considered in cases
of restrictions	 during the employment suggests that perhaps
a rigorous  test of reasonableness may have to be adopted in
the former cases but there would be cases where post-service
restrictions,  if   reasonable,	 even	after  applying	 the
rigorous tests	may be	valid as  not falling under<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_25"> s. 27</a> of
the Act,  it was,  therefore, not  correct to  say that	 all
post-service restrictions  were void. His precise contention
was that even a post-service restrictive covenant, if it was
reasonable, qualified  or limited in operation both in point
of time	 and area,  as was the case here, does not amount to
any restraint  of trade	 at all	 within the meaning of<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_26"> s. 27</a>
and such  restrictive covenant	could be  justified as being
necessary and essential to protect the employer's interests,
his trade  secrets and his trade connections and, therefore,
valid. As  regards the argument based on codified exception,
counsel pointed	 out, that  even the  case of  a restrictive
covenant operative  during the	period of employment between
master and servant had not been provided for as an exception
below<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_27"> s.  27</a> but even so such restrictive covenant was never
regarded as  amounting to  restraint of	 trade under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_28"> s.  27</a>
mainly because	it was	always regarded	 as  reasonable	 and
necessary to  protect the  employer's interests, which shows
that the  statutory exceptions	were not exhaustive. Lastly,
counsel urged  that the	 Law Commission's  recommendation on
which reliance	was placed  by respondent's counsel would be
inconsequential because it proceeds on the acceptance of the
interpretation placed on<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_29"> s. 27</a> by various High Courts and he
is  seeking   to  get	that  interpretation   examined	 and
considered by this Court.</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">     However, as  we have  said above,	we do not propose to
discuss or  decide the	aforesaid question  inasmuch as this
appeal can  be disposed	 of by	deciding the second question
that has been raised before us and for that purpose we shall
proceed	 on   the  assumption  that  the  negative  covenant
contained in  cl. (10) of the service agreement is valid and
not hit	 by<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_30"> s.	27</a> of  the Contract  Act.  The	question  is
whether the  said  restrictive	covenant  is  on  its  terms
enforceable against  the respondent  at the  instance of the
appellant company.
</p><p id="p_12">     We	 have	already	 quoted	  the  restrictive  covenant
contained in cl. (10). In terms the clause provides that the
restriction  contained	therein	 will  come  into  operation
"after you  (respondent) leave	the company".  Admittedly in
the instant  case the respondent had not on his own left the
company but  his services  were terminated  by the appellant
company by a notice dated November 24, 1978 with effect from
December 27, 1978. The question is whether the phrase "after
you
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">1286</span>
leave the  company" means  the leaving	of  service  by	 the
respondent voluntarily	or would  include even	the case  of
termination of	his services  by the  appellant company. The
Division Bench of the High Court has taken the view that the
word "leave"  does not include termination of service by the
employer. Counsel  for the  appellant company contended that
the word  "leave" occurring  in the  phrase "after you leave
the company"  would be	wide enough  to include all cases of
cessation of  service whether  brought	about  by  voluntary
quitting on  the part  of the employee or termination of his
services by  the employer  and in  that behalf	reliance was
placed upon  an English decision in Murray v. Clese where it
was held  that an  agreement restricting competition with an
employer "after	 leaving his  service" would be operative on
the termination,  however accomplished, of the service, e.g.
by a  dismissal without	 notice.  (vide:  Stroud's  Judicial
Dictionary, 4th	 Edn., Vol. 3, page 1508, Item 13, under the
word 'leaving').
</p><p id="p_13">     In our  view, the	word "leave"  has various  shades of
meaning depending  upon the  context or intent with which it
is used.  According to	the plain  grammatical meaning	that
word in	 relation to an employee would normally be construed
as meaning voluntary leaving of the service by him and would
not include  a case  where he  is discharged or dismissed or
his services  are terminated by his employer. Ordinarily the
word "leave" appears to connote voluntary action. In Words &amp;
Phrases Permanent  Edition Vol. 24 at page 499 the following
statement of law based on an American decision occurs:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  "An application for the employment of a street car
     conductor provided that in the event of his leaving the
     services for  any reasons	whatever within	 six months,
     the money	paid to him for work under instruction while
     on trial  should be deducted from such moneys as should
     be due  from the  company on the date of his "leaving".
     Held, that	 the word "leaving" meant to quit or depart,
     implying volition	on the	part of	 the person leaving,
     and limited  the forfeiture of the instruction wages to
     a case  where plaintiff  left defendant's employ of his
     own volition,  nor was such instruction effected by the
     words,  "for   any	 reason	  whatsoever."	Muesling  v.
     International Ry.	Co., 147  N.Y.S. 177,  178, 85 Misc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     309.
</blockquote><p id="p_14">In our	view having  regard to	the  context  in  which	 the
expression  "leave"  occurs  in	 cl.  (10)  of	the  service
agreement and  reading it  alongwith all  the other terms of
employment it seems to us clear that in the instant case the
word "leave"  was intended by the parties to refer only to a
case where the employee has voluntarily left the services
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">1287</span>
of the	appellant company  of his  own, and  since here	 the
respondent's  services	were  terminated  by  the  appellant
company the restrictive covenant contained in cl. (10) would
be inapplicable	 and, therefore, not enforceable against the
respondent at the instance of the appellant company. Counsel
for the	 appellant company urged that our construction would
lead to	 putting a premium upon an dishonest employee who by
his own misdemeanour and misbehaviour may invite termination
of his	services. All  that we can say is that the appellant
company should	have taken  care to use appropriate language
while incorporating  such  restrictive	covenant  so  as  to
include every  case of	cessation of employment arising from
any reason  whatsoever and  not used the expression "leave,"
which normally	is synonymous  to the  expression "quit" and
indicates voluntary act on the part of the employee.
</p><p id="p_15">     In the  result the appeal is dismissed with no order as
to costs.
</p><p id="p_16">     SEN, J.  I regret	that my	 learned brethren propose to
express no opinion on the question on which, in my view, the
appeal turns.  The question  is whether	 a negative covenant
which  restricts  the  right  of  the  employee,  after	 the
conclusion of the term of service, or the termination of the
employment for	other reasons,	to engage  in  any  business
similar to  or competitive  with that of the employer, is in
restraint of  trade and, therefore, void under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_31">section 27</a> of
the Contract  Act, 1972. I have no doubt in my mind that the
appeal cannot be decided without deciding this question.
</p><p id="p_17">     This appeal on certificate from a judgment of the Delhi
High court,  relates to	 a covenant  in restraint  of  trade
contained in  an agreement between the appellant company and
the respondent	in circumstances  which we will explain. The
appellant  company   carries  on  the  business	 of  valuer,
surveyor,  inspection	of  quality,   weighment,  analysis,
sampling of merchandise and commodities, cargoes, industrial
products, machinery,  textiles, etc.  It has its head office
at Calcutta  with a  branch at	New Delhi. On or about March
27,1971, the  respondent who  is a  surveyor and  valuer was
employed by  the appellant  as the Branch Manager of its New
Delhi office.  One  of	the  terms  and	 conditions  of	 the
employment was that the respondent would not serve elsewhere
or enter  into any  business for  a period  of 2 years after
leaving the  service. The  term is contained in clause 10 of
the agreement which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	  10. That  you will  not be  permitted to  join any
     firm of  our competitors  or run a business of your own
     in similarity  as directly	 and/or	 indirectly,  for  a
     period of two years at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">1288</span>
     place of your last posting after you leave the Company.</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">     The appellant terminated the services of the respondent
by its	letter	dated  December	 27,  1978.  Thereafter	 the
respondent started  a business of his own under the name and
style of  "Superintendence and	Surveillance Inspectorate of
India"	at   E-22,  South  Extension,  New  Delhi  on  lines
identical with	and substantially  similar to  that  of	 the
appellant. On April 19, 1979, the appellant commenced a suit
in the	Delhi High  Court in  its original side claiming Rs.
55,000/- as damages on account of breach of the covenant and
for permanent  injunction  to  restrain	 the  respondent  by
himself, his  servants or  agents or otherwise from carrying
on the	said business or any other business on lines similar
to that	 of the appellant or associating or representing any
Competitors of	the appellant before the expiry of two years
from December 27, 1978.
</p><p id="p_19">     A Single  Judge of	 the Delhi  High Court	adopting the
test of	 reasonableness, held  that under  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_32">section 27</a> of the
Contract Act to determine whether the agreement is void, one
has to	see whether  the restraint  is reasonable; and if so
the  negative  covenant	 can  be  enforced  as	enjoined  by
illustrations (c)  and (d)  to <a href="/doc/168819/" id="a_33">section	57</a> of  the  specific
Relief Act, 1963. He held that Clause 10 of the agreement is
not  unreasonable,   because  the   area  of   restraint  is
restricted to  New Delhi,  the place  of last posting of the
respondent and	is not	unlimited, being limited to a period
of two	years from  the date he left the service. He went on
to say	that negative  covenant in  a contract of employment
has always  been enforced, if it is in the protection of the
employer, and  referred	 to  <a href="/doc/452434/" id="a_34">Niranjan  Shankar	Golikari  v.
Century Spinning  and Mfg.  Co. Ltd</a>. [1967] 2 S.C.R. p. 378.
He further  held that the negative covenant was operative as
the word  "leave" in  clause 10	 was wide  enough to include
termination of	service. He, accordingly, by his order dated
May  25,   1979,  made	the  earlier  ex  parte	 ad  interim
injunction granted  by him  on April  24, 1979	absolute but
restricted its	operation to  New Delhi	 and for  the period
ending 27th  December, 1980  or till  the decision  of suit,
whichever is earlier.
</p><p id="p_20">     On appeal	by the	respondent, a  Division Bench of the
High Court  reversed the  order of  the learned Single Judge
holding that  negative covenant	 operating beyond the period
of employment was in restraint of trade and, therefore, void
under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_35">section 27</a> of the Contract Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">1289</span>
<p id="p_21">     Four questions  arise in this appeal: 1. Whether Clause
10 of  the agreement  was in  restraint of trade; and if so,
being partial  was valid  and enforceable being reasonable?;
</p><p id="p_22">2. Whether according to the test of reasonableness laid down
by Lord	 Macnaghten in Nordenfelt v. Hakim Nordenfelt Guns &amp;
Ammunition  Co.	  Ltd.,(1)  an	injunction  to	enforce	 the
negative covenent can be granted under illustrations (c) and
</p><p id="p_23">(d) to	<a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_36">section 57</a> of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, despite
<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_37">section 27</a>  of the  Contract Act,  1872 ? 3. Whether, and to
what extent,  the provisions  of <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_38">Section  27</a> of the Contract
Act are	 subject to  the common law doctrine of restraint of
trade ?	 4. Whether  the word  "leave" in  Clause 10  of the
agreement between  the parties	makes the  negative covenant
operative  only	  when	a  servant  voluntarily	 leaves	 his
employment, or, applies even in a case of termination of his
services by  an order  of dismissal  or termination  of	 his
services?
</p><p id="p_24">     Agreements of  service, containing	 a negative covenant
preventing the	employee from  working elsewhere  during the
term covered by the agreement, are not void under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_39">section 27</a>
of the	Contract  Act,	on  the	 ground	 that  they  are  in
restraint of  trade. Such  agreements are  enforceable.	 The
reason is  obvious. The doctrine of restraint of trade never
applies during	the continuance of a contract of employment;
it applies  only when  the contract  comes to  an end. While
during the  period of  employment,  the	 Courts	 undoubtedly
would not  grant any  specific performance  of a contract of
personal service,  nevertheless; <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_40">Section  57</a> of the Specific
Relief Act  clearly provides  for the grant of an injunction
to restrain  the breach	 of such  a covenant as it is not in
restraint of, but in furtherance of trade.
</p><p id="p_25">     In Niranjan  Shankar Golikari's case, supra, this Court
drew a	distinction between  a restriction  in a contract of
employment  which   is	operative   during  the	  period  of
employment and one which is to operate after the termination
of employment.	After referring	 to  certain  English  cases
where such distinction had been drawn, the Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	  "A similar  distinction has also been drawn by the
     Courts in India and a restraint by which a person binds
     himself during  the term  of his  agreement directly or
     indirectly not  to take service with any other employer
     or be  engaged by a third party has been held not to be
     void and not against <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_41">section 27</a> of the Contract Act."</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">1290</span>
<p id="p_26">     It referred  to  with  approval  the  decision  in	 <a href="/doc/1966237/" id="a_42">The
Brahmaputra Tea	 Co. Ltd.  v. Scarth,  I.L.R</a>. (1885) 11 Cal,
545, where  the condition  under which	the  covenantee	 was
partially restrained  from competing  after the	 term of his
engagement with	 his former employer, was held to be bad but
the condition  by which	 he bound himself during the term of
his agreement,	not, directly or indirectly, to compete with
his employer was held good, and observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  "At page 550 of the report the Court observed that
     an agreement of service by which a person binds himself
     during the	 term of  the agreement	 not to take service
     with any one else, or directly, or indirectly take part
     in, promote  or did  any business in direct competition
     with that of his employer was not hit by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_43">section 27</a>."
</blockquote><p id="p_27">The Court further observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  "An agreement	 to serve a person exclusively for a
     definite  term   is  a  lawful  agreement,	 and  it  is
     difficult to  see how  that can  be unlawful  which  is
     essential to its fulfillment, and to the due protection
     of the  interests of  the employer, while the agreement
     is in force."</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">     The Court also approved of the several Indian decisions
where an  agreement of	service contained  both	 a  positive
covenant viz.  that the employee shall devote his whole-time
attention to  the  service  of	the  employers	and  also  a
negative  covenant  preventing	the  employee  from  working
elsewhere during  the term  of the  agreement, and  the High
Courts have  enforced such  a negative	covenant during	 the
term of	 employment having  regard to  illustrations (c) and
</p><p id="p_29">(d) to	<a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_44">section 57</a>  of the  Specific Relief  Act  which,  in
terms,	recognised  such  contracts  and  the  existence  of
negative covenants  therein, and  stated that the contention
that the  existence of such a negative covenant in a service
agreement made	the agreement void on the ground that it was
in restraint  of trade	and contrary  to <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_45">section  27</a> of	 the
Contract Act had no validity.
</p><p id="p_30">     In conclusion, the Court observed:
</p><p id="p_31">	  "The	result	of  the	 above	discussion  is	that
     considerations  against   restrictive   covenants	 are
     different in  cases where	the restriction	 is to apply
     during the period after the termination of the contract
     than those	 in cases  where it is to operate during the
     period of the contract. Negative
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">1291</span>
     covenants operative  during the  period of the contract
     of employment  when the  employee is bound to serve his
     employer exclusively  are	generally  not	regarded  as
     restraint of  trade and  therefore do  not	 fall  under
     <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_46">section 27</a>	 of the	 Contract Act.	A negative  covenant
     that the  employee would  not engage himself in a trade
     or business  or would  not get  himself employed by any
     other master  for whom  he	 would	perform	 similar  or
     substantially  similar   duties  is   not	therefore  a
     restraint of  trade unless the contract as aforesaid is
     unconscionable or	excessively harsh or unreasonable or
     one sided."
</p><p id="p_32">					 (Emphasis supplied)
     The decision  in Niranjan Shankar Golikari's case supra
is therefore  of little	 assistance to	the appellant. It is
not seeking to enforce the negative covenant during the term
of employment of the respondent but after the termination of
his services.  The restriction contained in Clause 10 of the
agreement is obviously in restraint of trade and, therefore,
illegal and  unenforceable under  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_47">section 27</a> of the Contract
Act.
</p><p id="p_33">     In support	 of the	 appeal,  learned  counsel  for	 the
appellant has, in substance, advanced a two-fold contention.
It is  submitted, firstly,  upon the  common law doctrine of
restraint of  trade that though the covenant is in restraint
of trade, it satisfies the 'test of reasonableness', as laid
down by	 Lord Macnaghten  in Nordenfelt	 v. Maxim Nordenfelt
Guns &amp;	Ammunition  Co.	 Ltd.,	supra,	and  is,  therefore,
enforceable despite  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_48">section 27</a>	 of the	 Contract Act, 1872,
and, secondly,	that the  word "leave"	in Clause  10 of the
agreement is wide enough to make the covenant operative even
on the	termination of	employment i.e. it includes the case
of dismissal. I am afraid, the contentions are wholly devoid
of substance.
</p><p id="p_34">     <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_49">While the	Contract Act</a>, 1872, does not profess to be a
complete code dealing with the law relating to contracts, we
emphasise that to the extent the Act deals with a particular
subject, it  is exhaustive  upon the  same  and	 it  is	 not
permissible to	import the principles of English Law de hors
the statutory  provision, unless the statute is such that it
cannot be understood without the aid of the English Law. The
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_50">Section 27</a>  of the  Act were lifted from Hom.
David D.  Field's Draft Code for New York based upon the old
English doctrine  of restraint	of trade,  as prevailing  in
ancient times. When a rule of English law receives statutory
recognition by the Indian Legislature, it is the language of
the Act	 which determines  the scope,  uninfluenced  by	 the
manner	in   which  the	 anologous  provision  comes  to  be
construed narrowly,  or, otherwise  modified,  in  order  to
bring the construction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">1292</span>
within the  scope and  limitations of the rule governing the
English doctrine of restraint of trade.
</p><p id="p_35">     It has  often been pointed out by the Privy Council and
this Court  that where there is positive enactment of Indian
Legislature the	 proper course is to examine the language of
the statute and to ascertain its proper meaning uninfluenced
by any	consideration derived from the previous state of the
law or	the English  law upon  which it	 may be	 founded. In
Satyavrata Ghosh  v. Kurmee  Ram Bangor,  [1954] S.C.R. 310,
Mukherjee J.  while dealing with the doctrine of frustration
of contract  observed that  the Courts	in India  are to  be
strictly governed  by the  provisions of  <a href="/doc/648614/" id="a_51">Section 56</a>  of the
Contract Act  and not  to be  influenced by  the  prevailing
concepts of  the English  Law,	as  it	has  passed  through
various stages	of development	since the  enactment of	 the
<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_52">Contract Act</a>  and the  principles enunciated  in the various
decided cases are not easy to reconcile. What he says of the
doctrine of  frustration under	s. 56 of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_53">Contract Act</a> is
equally true  of the  doctrine of  restraint of	 trade under
<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_54">section 27</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_36">     Now, so  far as  the present case is concerned, the law
is to be found in <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_55">section 27</a> of the Contract Act 1872, which
reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "27. Agreement  in restraint	of trade  void-Every
     agreement	by   which  any	  one  is   restrained	from
     exercising a  lawful profession,  trade or	 business of
     any kind is to that extent void.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  Exception:  One   who	 sells	the  goodwill  of  a
     business may  agree with  the  buyer  to  refrain	from
     carrying on  a similar business, within specified local
     limits, so	 long as  the  buyer  or  any  other  person
     deriving title  to the  goodwill from him, carries on a
     like business therein, provided that such limits appear
     to the Court reasonable, regard being had to the nature
     of the business."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">The section is general in terms, and declares all agreements
in restraint void pro tanto, except in the case specified in
the exception.
</p><p id="p_38">     The question whether an agreement is void under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_56">section
27</a> must	 be decided  upon the wording of that section. There
is nothing  in the wording of <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_57">section 27</a> to suggest that the
principle stated  therein does	not apply when the restraint
is for	a limited period only or is confined to a particular
area. Such  matters of	partial restriction have effect only
when the fact fall within the exception to the section.
</p><p id="p_39">     A contract,  which has  for its  object a	restraint of
trade, is  prima facie, void. <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_58">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act
is general in terms and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">1293</span>
unless a  particular  contract	can  be	 distinctly  brought
within Exception  1 there is no escape from the prohibition.
We have	 nothing to do with the policy of such a law. All we
have to	 do is to take the words of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_59">Contract Act</a> and put
upon the  meaning which	 they appear  plainly to  bear. This
view of	 the section was expressed by Sir Richard Couch C.J.
in celebrated  judgment in  Madhub Chunder v. Rajcoomar Doss
[1874] Beng  L. R.  76 at pp. 85-86 laying down that whether
the  restraint	 was  general  or  partial,  unqualified  or
qualified, if  it was in the nature of a restraint of trade,
it was void.
</p><p id="p_40">     The observations  of Sir Richard Couch, C.J., in Madhub
Chunder v.  Rajcoomar Doss,  supra, which  have	 become	 the
locus classicus were these:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "The words  'restraint from  exercising  a  lawful
     profession, trade	or business' do not mean an absolute
     restriction, and  are intended  to apply  to a  partial
     restriction, a  restriction limited  to some particular
     place, otherwise  the first  exception would  have been
     unnecessary." Moreover,  "in the  following section (s.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     28) the  legislative authority when it intends to speak
     of an  absolute restraint	and not	 a partial  one, has
     introduced the  word 'absolutely'....  The use  of this
     word in <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_60"> s. 28</a>  supports the  view that in<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_61"> s. 27</a> it was
     intended to  prevent not  merely a total restraint from
     carrying on  trade or  business but  a partial  one. We
     have nothing  to do  with the policy of such a law. All
     we have to do is to take the words of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_62">Contract Act</a>,
     and put upon them the meaning which they appear plainly
     to bear."</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">     The test laid down by Sir Richard Couch, C.J. in Madhub
Chunder v. Rajcoomar Doss, supra, has stood the test of time
and has	 invariably been  followed by all the High Courts in
India.
</p><p id="p_42">     The  agreement  in	 question  is  not  a  'goodwill  of
business' type	of contract  and, therefore,  does not	fall
within the  exception. If  the agreement  on the part of the
respondent puts	 a restraint  even though  partial,  it	 was
void, and,  therefore, the  contract must  be treated as one
which cannot be enforced.
</p><p id="p_43">     It is, however, argued that the test of the validity of
a restraint, whether general or partial, is dependent on its
reasonableness. It is pointed out that the distinction drawn
by Lord	 Macclesfield in  Mitchel v.  Reynolds (1711) 1 PMas
161 between  general and  partial restraint,  was removed by
the House  of Lords  in Nordenfelt  v. Maxim Nordenfelt Guns
and Ammunition Co. (supra). According to the judgment of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">1294</span>
Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt's case, the validity in either
case  was   reasonableness  with   reference  to  particular
circumstances. It  is urged  that all covenants in restraint
of trade partial as well as general are prima facie void and
they cannot  be enforced, according to the test laid down by
Lord Macnaghten	 in Nordenfelt's  case and  accepted by	 the
House of Lords in Mason v. Provident Clothing and Supply Co.
Ltd.,  L.R.   [1930]  A.C.   724,   unless   the   test	  of
reasonableness is  testified. It is also urged that while an
employer  is   not  entitled   to  protect  himself  against
competition per	 se on	the part  of an	 employee after	 the
employment has	ceased, he  is entitled to protection of his
proprietory interest  viz. his	trade secrets, if any, and a
business connection.
</p><p id="p_44">     The test of reasonableness which now governs the common
law doctrine of restraint of trade has been stated in Chitty
on Contracts, 23rd Edn., Vol. I. p. 867:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	  "While  all	restraint  of  trade  to  which	 the
     doctrine applied  are prima  facie unenforceable,	all,
     whether  partial	or  total,   are   enforceable,	  if
     reasonable."</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">     A contract	 in restraint  of trade	 is one	 by which  a
party restricts	 his future  liberty to	 carry on his trade,
business or  profession in such manner and with such persons
as he chooses. A contract of this class is prima facie void,
but is	becomes binding	 upon proof  that the restriction is
justifiable in	the circumstances  as being  reasonable from
the point  of view of the parties themselves and also of the
community.
</p><p id="p_46">     In Elizabethan  days, all	agreements in  restraint  of
trade, whether	general or restrictive to a particular area,
were held  to be  bad; but  a distinction  came to  be taken
between covenant  in general  restraint of  trade, and those
where the restraints were only partial.
</p><p id="p_47">     According to  the test laid down by Parker, C.J. (later
Earl of	 Macclesfield) in  Mitchel v.  Reynolds, supra,	 the
general restraint  was one which covered an indefinite area,
and was,  as a	rule held  bad while a partial restraint was
valid if  reasonable, the  onus being upon the covenanter to
show it to be unreasonable.
</p><p id="p_48">     There is  no higher  authority upon  this subject	than
Tindal, C.J., who had to do much with moulding of the law on
this subject  and bringing it into harmony with the needs of
the changing  times. In Mornen v. Graves [1831] 7 Bing. 735,
Tindal, C.J. said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  "The law  upon this  subject	(i.e.  restraint  of
     trade) has	 been laid  down with  so much authority and
     precision by  Parker, C.J.,  in giving  the judgment of
     the Court of B.R. (King's Bench) in the case of Mitchel
     v. Reynolds  which has  been the  leading case  on	 the
     subject from that time to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">1295</span>
     the present, that little more remains than to apply the
     principle of  that case  to the  present. Now  the rule
     laid down	by the court in that case is 'that voluntary
     restraints, by  agreement between	the parties, if they
     amount to	a general  restraint of	 trading  by  either
     party, are void, whether with or without consideration,
     but particular  restraints of  trading, if	 made upon a
     good and  adequate consideration,	so as to be a proper
     and useful	 contract, that is, so as it is a reasonable
     restraint only, are good."
</blockquote><p id="p_49">Later on he goes on to observe:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	  "Parker, C.J.,  says,: a  restraint to  carry on a
     trade throughout  the kingdom must be void; a restraint
     to carry it on within a particular place is good, which
     are rather	 instances and	examples than  limits of the
     application of  the rule,	which can  only be  at least
     what is  a reasonable  restraint with  reference to the
     particular cases."
</blockquote><p id="p_50">By decrees,  the common	 law doctrine of restraint of trade,
has been  progressively expanded  and the  legal  principles
applied and  developed so  as to  suit the exigencies of the
times,	with   the  growth  of	trade  and  commerce,  rapid
industrialisation and improved means of communication.
</p><p id="p_51">     In Nordenfelt v. Maxim Nordenfelt Guns &amp; Ammunition Co.
Ltd., (supra),	Lord Macnaghton held that the only true test
in all	cases, whether	of partial or general restraint, was
the test  proposed by  Tindal, C.J.:  What is  a  reasonable
restraint with	reference to  a particular case ? Thereby he
denied	that   general	and  partial  restraints  fall	into
distinct categories.  A partial restraint in his opinion was
not prima  facie valid.	 It was	 on the	 same footing  as  a
general restraint  i.e. prima  facie  void,  but  valid,  if
reasonable.
</p><p id="p_52">     In Mason  v. Provident  Clothing and  Supply Co.  Ltd.,
supra, the  House  of  Lords  held  that  Lord	Macnaghton's
proposition was	 a correct  statement of the modern law. The
House of  Lords in  this  case	developed  the	law  in	 two
respects: First,  it held that all covenants in restraint of
trade, partial as well as general, prima facie void and that
they cannot be enforced unless the test of reasonableness as
propounded by  Lord Macnaghton	is satisfied.  Secondly,  it
made a	sharp distinction,  stressed as	 long ago as 1869 by
James, L.J.,  in Leather  Cloth Co. v. Lorsont [1869] L.R. 9
Eq. 345,  between contracts of service and contracts for the
sale of a business.
</p><p id="p_53">     In Herbert	 Morris Ltd. v. Saxelby, supra, the House of
Lords  held  that  a  master  cannot  protect  himself	from
competition by an ex-servant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">1296</span>
or his	new  employer.	He  cannot  stipulate  freedom	from
competition. But  he can  protect his  trade secrets  or his
confidential information.
</p><p id="p_54">     The 'test	of reasonableness'  evolved  in	 common	 law
after the decision of Lord Macnaghton, in Nordenfelt's case,
supra, and  re-affirmed by  the two  decisions in  Mason  v.
Provident Clothing &amp; Supply Co. Ltd. and Herbert Morris Ltd.
v. Sexelby,  supra, is	that such covenants are prima facie,
void and the onus rests upon the covenante to prove that the
restraint  is	reasonable.  In	  Nordenfelt's	case,	Lord
Macnaghton also adverted to the distinction between covenant
entered by  the seller	of the	business on the one hand and
the covenant by the employee on the other.
</p><p id="p_55">     Framers of	 section 833  of Field's  Draft Code for New
York  designed	some  hundred  and  twenty-five	 years	ago,
expressed the  intention to  replace the  common law stating
that "contracts	 in restraint  of trade have been allowed by
modern decisions  to a	very  dangerous	 extent",  and	they
proceeded  to	draft  the  provision  with  the  deliberate
intention of  narrowing the  law. The  provision  was  never
applied to  New York,  but found  its way  into the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_63">Contract
Act</a>, 1872  as <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_64">section  27</a>. Several  sections of	 the Field's
Code were  enacted in  the Act. The Code was anathema to Sir
Frederick Pollock  who in his preface to Pollock and Mulla's
<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_65">Indian Contract	 Act</a>, p.  5, described	the Code as the evil
genius of the Act, the worst principles of codification ever
produced, and  advocated that  'whenever the Act was revised
every thing taken from the Code should be struck out'.
</p><p id="p_56">     It must  be remembered  that the test of reasonableness
comes from  the judgment  of Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt's
case in	 the House  of Lords in 1894. In 1862, however, when
the Field  provision was drafted, it was not easy to foresee
that the  common law  would shortly  discard the distinction
drawn by  Lord Macclesfield  in Mitchel v. Reynolds in 1711,
between general	 and partial restraints. A general restraint
was one	 which covered	an indefinite  area, and  was, as  a
rule, held  bad, while	a partial  restraint was  valid,  if
reasonable. the onus being upon the covenantor to show it to
be unreasonable.  This was  a mere  rule of  thumb, but	 was
stubbornly adhered  to by as great a common lawyer as Bowen,
L.J., as late as 1893, when the Nordenfelt's case was in the
Court of Appeals: L.R. [1893] 1 Ch. D. 630.
</p><p id="p_57">     Be that  as it may, in Field's draft, as early as 1862,
are clearly  expressed two principles that govern the modern
common law  today, but were unknown to it at that stage, and
were  not   unequivocally  stated  until  1916,	 first	that
restrictive covenants  are prima facie invalid, and secondly
between master	and servant  covenants on  the one  hand and
vendor and  purchaser covenants	 on the	 other, there  is  a
great gulf
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">1297</span>
fixed. The onus of proving reasonableness under Exception 1,
was placed  on the  covenantee, while  the common law at the
time placed it upon the covenanter to show unreasonableness.
</p><p id="p_58">     Sir Frederick  Pollock's criticism	 of the	 substantive
part of <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_66">section 27</a> was that it laid down too rigid a rule of
invalidity, not	 merely for  general but  also	for  partial
restraints, and of the exceptions that they were too narrow,
being based  upon an  idea of  the common law, now outmoded,
that a	restraint must	be confined within local limits. His
views on  the main body of the section may be illustrated by
two quotations:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	  "The law  of India....is tied down by the language
     of the  section  to  the  principle,  now	exploded  in
     England, of  a hard and fast rule qualified by strictly
     limited exceptions..."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	  "To escape  the prohibition,	it is  not enough to
     show that	the restraint  created by  an  agreement  is
     partial, and general."</blockquote>
<p id="p_59">     Two passages  from his comments on Exception 1 may also
be cited:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	  "The extension  of modern  commerce and  means  of
     communication has	displaced the  old doctrine that the
     operation of  agreements of  this kind must be confined
     within a  definite neighbourhood.	But the Anglo Indian
     law has  stereotyped that	doctrine in  a narrower form
     than even the old authorities would justify."
	  "Meanwhile the  common law  has, on  the contrary,
     been widening the old fixed rules as to limits of space
     have been	broken down,  and  the	court  has  only  to
     consider in  every	 case  of  a  restrictive  agreement
     whether the  restriction is 'reasonable in reference to
     the interests  of the  parties concerned  reasonable in
     reference to the interests of the public."</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">     Reverting to  the judgment	 of  Sir  Richard  Couch  in
Madhub Chunder	v. Rajcoomar  Doss, supra, we find that that
eminent Judge  held that <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_67">section 27</a> of the Contract Act does
away  with   the  distinction	observed  in  English  cases
following upon	Mitchel v.  Reynolds, supra, between partial
and total  restraints of  trade,  and  makes  all  contracts
falling within	the terms  of section void, unless they fall
within the  exceptions. As already stated, that decision has
always been followed.
</p><p id="p_61">     In Shaikh	Kalu v.	 Ram Saran  Bhagat, [1908] 13 C.W.N.
388 Mukherjee  and Carnduff,  JJ, referred to the history of
the legislation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">1298</span>
on the	subject and  observed that  the framers	 of the	 Act
deliberately reproduced Section 833 of Field's Code with the
full knowledge	that the  effect would be to lay down a rule
much narrower  than what  was recognised  at the time by the
common law,  while the rules of the common law, on the other
hand, had  since been considerably widened and developed, on
entirely new  lines. They  held that  the wider construction
put upon  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_68">section 27</a>  by Sir Richard Couch in Madhub Chundur
v. Raj	Coomar Doss,  supra, is	 plainly  justified  by	 the
language used,	and that  the selection	 had  abolished	 the
distinction between  partial and  total restraints  of trade
and said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	  "The result  is that	the rule as embodied in sec.
     27 of  the	 <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_69">Indian	 Contract  Act</a>	presents  an  almost
     startling dissimilarity to the most modern phase of the
     English rule on the subject.
</blockquote><p id="p_62">They went on to observe:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  "As observed, however, by Sir Richard Couch in the
     case to  which we	have referred, we have nothing to do
     with  the	 policy	 of   the  law,	  specially  as	 the
     Legislature has deliberately left the provision in sec.
     27, in  its original  form, though	 other provisions of
     the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_70">Contract  Act</a> have  from time to time been amended.
     The interference  would be	 almost	 irresistible  under
     these  circumstances,  that  the  Courts  have  rightly
     ascertained  the  intention  of  the  legislature.	 The
     silence  of   the	Legislature   in  a   case  of	this
     description  is   almost  as  emphatic  as	 an  express
     recognition  of   the  construction   which  has	been
     judicially put upon the statute during many years past.
     In	 this	view  of   the	matter,	  if  we  adopt	 the
     construction of  sec. 27  of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_71">Indian Contract Act</a> as
     first suggested  by Sir  Richard Couch and subsequently
     affirmed in  the cases  to which  we have	referred,  a
     construction  which   is  consistent   with  the  plain
     language of  the section,	the agreement  in this	case
     must be pronounced to be void."</blockquote>
<p id="p_63">		    (Emphasis supplied)
     The Law  Commission,  in  its  Thirteenth	Report,	 has
recommended that  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_72">Section 27</a>  of the  Act should be suitably
amended to  allow such	restrictions and  all  contracts  in
restraint of  trade, general or partial, as were reasonable,
in the	interest of  the parties  as well  as of the public.
That, however  involves a  question of	policy and that is a
matter for Parliament to decide. The duty of the Court is to
interpret the section according to its plain language.
</p><p id="p_64">     The question  for consideration  is  whether,  assuming
that the  wider construction  placed by Sir Richard Couch in
Madhub Chundur v.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">1299</span>
<p id="p_65">Raj Coomar Doss, supra, to have been the law, at the time of
enactment, it  has since  become obsolete.  A law  does	 not
cease to  be operative	because	 it  is	 an  anachronism  or
because it  is antiquated  or  because	the  reason  why  it
originally became  the law,  would  be	no  reason  for	 the
introduction of such a law at the present time.
</p><p id="p_66">     Neither the test of reasonableness nor the principle of
that  the   restraint  being   partial	was  reasonable	 are
applicable to  a case governed by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_73">Section 27</a> of the Contract
Act, unless it falls within Exception 1. We, therefore, feel
that no	 useful purpose	 will be  served in  discussing	 the
several English Decisions cited at the Bar.
</p><p id="p_67">     Under  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_74">Section  27</a>	 of  the  Contract  Act,  a  service
covenant extended  beyond the  termination of the service is
void. Not  a single  Indian Decision has been brought to our
notice where  an injunction  has  been	granted	 against  an
employee after the termination of his employment.
</p><p id="p_68">     There remains  the question whether the word 'leave' in
clause 10  of the  agreement is	 wide  enough  to  make	 the
negative  covenant   operative	 on   the   termination	  of
employment. We	may for	 convenience of reference, reproduce
that covenant below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  "10. that  you shall	not be permitted to join any
     firm of  our competitors or run business of your own in
     similarity as  directly and/or  indirectly for a period
     of 2  years at the place of your last posting after you
     leave the Company."</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">     On a  true construction  of clause 10 of the agreement,
the negative covenant not to serve elsewhere or enter into a
competitive business  does not,	 in my	view, arise when the
employee does  not leave  the services but is dismissed from
service. Wrongful  dismissal is	 repudiation of	 contract of
service which  relieved	 the  employee	of  the	 restrictive
covenant <a href="/doc/1170917/" id="a_75">General  Billposting v.  Atkinson L.R</a>.	 [1909] A.C.
</p><p id="p_70">116.
     It is,  however, urged  that the  word 'leave' must, in
the context  in which  it appears,  be construed  to mean as
operative on the termination of employment. Our attention is
drawn to  Stroud's Judicial  Dictionary, 4th  Edn., Vol. II,
Pr. 13	p. 1503.  There is  reference to  Mars v.  Close, 32
L.T.O.S. 89.  An agreement  restricting competition  with an
employer  "after   leaving  his	 service"  was	held  to  be
operative on  the termination, however, accomplished, of the
service, e.g. by a dismissal without notice.
</p><p id="p_71">     The  word	 'leave'  has	various	 shades	 of  meaning
depending upon	the context or intent with which it is used.
According to the plain meaning, the word 'leave' in relation
to an employee, should be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">1300</span>
construed to  mean where he "voluntarily" leaves i.e. of his
own volition  and does	not include a case of dismissal. The
word 'leave'  appears to  connect voluntary  action, and  is
synonymous with	 the word  'quit'. It  does not refer to the
expulsion of  an employee by the act of his employer without
his consent  and against his remonstrance. That is a meaning
in consonance  with justice  and fair  play. It	 is also the
ordinary plain	meaning of  the	 word  'leave'.	 In  shorter
Oxford English	Dictionary, 3rd	 Ed. Vol.  X, page 1192, the
following meaning is given-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "to depart  from; quit;  relinquish, to  quit	 the
     service of a person."</blockquote>
<p id="p_72">     The drafting  of a	 negative covenant  in a contract of
employment is  often a	matter of  great difficulty.  In the
employment cases  so far discussed, the issue has been as to
the validity  of the covenant operating after the end of the
period of  service. Restrictions  on competition during that
period are  normally valid, and indeed may be implied by law
by virtue  of the  servant's duty of fidelity. In such cases
the restriction	 is generally  reasonable, having  regard to
the interest  of the  employer, and does not cause any undue
hardship to  the employee, who will receive a wage or salary
for the	 period in  question. But  if  the  covenant  is  to
operate after  the termination of services, or is too widely
worded, the Court may refuse to enforce it.
</p><p id="p_73">     It is  well settled  that employees covenants should be
carefully  scrutinised	 because  there	  is  inequality  of
bargaining power  between the  parties; indeed no bargaining
power may  occur because  the employee	is presented  with a
standard form  of contract  to accept or reject. At the time
of the agreement, the employee may have given little thought
to the	restriction because of his eagerness for a job; such
contracts  "tempt  improvident	persons,  for  the  sake  of
present gain,  to deprive  themselves of  the power  to make
future acquisitions,  and  expose  them	 to  imposition	 and
oppression."
</p><p id="p_74">     There exists a difference in the nature of the interest
sought to  be protected	 in the case of an employee and of a
purchaser and,	therefore, as  a positive  rule of  law, the
extent of  restraint permissible in the two types of case is
different. The	essential line	of distinction	is that	 the
purchaser is entitled to protect himself against competition
on the	part of	 his  vendor,  while  the  employer  is	 not
entitled to  protection against mere competition on the part
of his	servant. In addition thereto, a restrictive covenant
ancillary to  a contract  of employment	 is likely to affect
the employee's	means or  procuring a livelihood for himself
and his	 family to  a greater  degree than that of a seller,
who usually  receive ample consideration for the sale of the
goodwill of his business.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">1301</span>
<p id="p_75">     The distinction  rests upon a substantial basis, since,
in the	former class  of contracts  we deal with the sale of
commodities, and in the latter class with the performance of
personal service-altogether  different in substance; and the
social and economic implications are vastly different.
</p><p id="p_76">     The  Courts,   therefore,	 view	with   disfavour   a
restrictive covenant  by an  employee not  to  engage  in  a
business similar to or competitive with that of the employer
after the termination of his contract of employment.
</p><p id="p_77">     The true  rule of	construction is that when a covenant
or agreement  is impeached  on the  ground  that  it  is  in
restraint of  trade, the  duty of  the Court  is,  first  to
interpret the covenant or agreement itself, and to ascertain
according to  the ordinary rules of construction what is the
fair meaning  of the  parties. If  there is  an ambiguity it
must receive  a narrower  construction than  the  wider.  <a href="/doc/719134/" id="a_76">In
Mills v. Dunham, L.R</a>. [1891] 1 Ch. 576, Kay, LJ. observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  "If  there  is  any  ambiguity  in  a	 stipulation
     between employer and employee imposing a restriction on
     the  latter,   it	ought	to  receive   the   narrower
     construction rather  than the  wider-the employed ought
     to have  the benefit  of the  doubt. It  would  not  be
     following out  that principle  correctly  to  give	 the
     stipulation a  wide  construction	so  as	to  make  it
     illegal  and  thus	 set  the  employed  free  from	 all
     restraint. It  is also  a settled canon of construction
     that where	 a clause  is ambiguous a construction which
     will make it valid is to be preferred to one which will
     make it void."</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">     The restraint  may not  be greater	 than  necessary  to
protect the employer, nor unduly harsh and oppressive to the
employee. I  would, therefore, for my part, even if the word
'leave'	 contained   in	 clause	  10  of  the  agreement  is
susceptible of	another construction  as being	operative on
termination, however,  accomplished of	the service  e.g. by
dismissal  without  notice,  would,  having  regard  to	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_77">Section 27</a>  of the Contract Act, 1872, try to
preserve the  covenant in  clause  10  by  giving  to  it  a
restrictive meaning,  as implying  volition i.e.  where	 the
employee resigns  or voluntarily  leaves the  services.	 The
restriction being  too wide,  and violative of <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_78">section 27</a> of
the  Contract	Act,  must   be	 subjected   to	 a  narrower
construction.
</p><p id="p_79">     In the  result, the  appeal must  fail and is dismissed
but there shall be no order as to costs.
