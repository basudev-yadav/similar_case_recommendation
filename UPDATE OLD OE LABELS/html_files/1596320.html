<p id="p_1">           Heard learned counsel for the parties.

           This appeal by special leave has been filed against

the order dated 10th July, 2003 of the National Consumer

Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short 'NCDRC')

whereby the appeal filed by the respondent herein has been

allowed and the order of the Consumer Disputes Redressal

Commission Union Territory, Chandigarh has been set aside.

</p><p id="p_2">           It appears that there was a fire on 13-14th February,

1999 at 10.00 p.m. in the godown of the appellant at Ambala.

For   claiming   compensation,     the     appellant      filed    a   claim

petition    before   the    Consumer       Commission      of    the   Union

Territory, Chandigarh constituted under <a href="/doc/1749394/" id="a_1">Section 17</a> of the

Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter for short 'the

Act').     The   said   claim   petition    filed    by    the    appellant

herein was allowed by the Consumer Commission of the Union

Territory, Chandigarh.          On appeal, the NCDRC allowed the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                   2</span>

appeal    of       the   respondent           herein         on   the       ground    that    the

Consumer       Commission         at    Chandigarh           had       no    jurisdiction      to

entertain and adjudicate the complaint.                                We are in agreement

with the view taken by the NCDRC.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              In our opinion, no part of the cause of action arose

at   Chandigarh.            It    is        well       settled      that      the    expression

'cause of action' means that bundle of facts which gives

rise     to    a    right        or    liability.                 In    the    present       case

admittedly the fire broke out in the godown of the appellant

at Ambala.          The insurance policy was also taken at Ambala

and the       claim for          compensation was                 also made         at Ambala.

Thus no part of the cause of action arose in Chandigarh.

</p><p id="p_4">              One of us      (Hon'ble Mr. Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly)

while a Judge of the Calcutta High Court in the case of IFB

Automotive Seating and System Ltd. and Others Vs. Union of

India AIR 2003 Calcutta, 80 has dealt with the question as

to the meaning of the expression 'cause of action'. Placing

reliance on a decision of this Court in the case of Union of

India Vs. Adani Exports Ltd. AIR 2002 SC 126, in para 40 of

the said judgment it has been observed as under :-



</p><p id="p_5">         "In Adani Exports (AIR 2002 SC 126) (supra) the
         learned         Judges        in    para       13    set      out    the    facts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>

pleaded by the petitioner to give rise to cause
of action conferring territorial jurisdiction on
the Court at Ahmedabad.               One of the facts pleaded
is that non-granting and denial utilization of
the    credit      in    the   pass    book       will    affect       the
business of the respondents at Ahmedabad.                             This
fact is not pleaded in the case in hand.
</p><p id="p_6">            Even then the learned Judges held that
those facts are not sufficient to furnish a cause
of    action     as     they   are    not    connected         with    the
relief sought for by the respondents.
</p><p id="p_7">            Here        also   the    relief       is    against       the
orders of approval and this High Court has no
territorial        jurisdiction        to    grant      that    relief.
Therefore, the communication to the effect that
the petitioners' representation against orders of
approval is rejected is of no consequence.
</p><p id="p_8">            The Supreme Court, further dealing the
concept     of    Aritcle      226(2)       and    relying      on     the
decision of ONGC (1994 AIR SCW 3287), explained
the concept of cause of action in para 17 at page
130    of   the       report    and    the     relevant        extracts
wherefrom are excerpted below :
</p><p id="p_9">"It is clear from the above judgment that each
and    every     fact     pleaded      by    the    respondents         in
their application does not ipso facto lead to the
conclusion that those facts give rise to a cause
of     action         within     the        Court's       territorial
jurisdiction unless those facts pleaded are such
which have a nexus or relevance with the lis that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>

       is involved in the case.                   Facts which have no
       bearing with the lis or the dispute involved in
       the case, do not give rise to a cause of action
       so as to confer territorial jurisdiction                    on the
       Court concerned.
</p><p id="p_10">                    The learned Judges also held in para 18
       as follows :
</p><p id="p_11">                    "The non-granting and denial of credit in
       the passbook having an ultimate effect, if any,
       on the business of the respondents at Ahmedabad
       would not also, in our opinion, give rise to any
       such cause of action to a Court at Ahmedabad to
       adjudicate on the actions complained against the
       appellants."
</p><p id="p_12">            We respectfully agree with the view taken by the

Calcutta     High   Court   in    the       aforesaid   decision    of      IFB

Automotive Seating(supra).          Hence, in our opinion, no part

of   the    cause   of   action    in       the   present   case    arose   at

Chandigarh.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            Learned counsel for the appellant then invited our

attention to the amendment brought about in <a href="/doc/96766741/" id="a_2">Section 17(2)</a> of

the Act in the year 2003.          The Amended <a href="/doc/96766741/" id="a_3">Section 17(2)</a> of the

Act reads as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "(2) A complaint shall be instituted in a State

                 permission of the State Commission is given
                 or the opposite parties who do not reside or
                 carry on business or have a branch office or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           The    aforesaid           amendment             came       into      force        w.e.f.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">15.3.2003 whereas the complaint in the present case has been

filed in the year 2000 and the cause of action arose in

1999. Hence, in our opinion, the amended section will have

no application to the case at hand.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           Moreover,          even        if     it     had          application,         in       our

opinion,    that       will    not        help      the         case   of     the      appellant.

Learned     counsel       for        the       appellant             submitted          that       the

respondent-insurance            company               has        a     branch          office       at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>

Chandigarh and hence under the amended <a href="/doc/96766741/" id="a_4">Section 17(2)</a> the

complaint could have been filed in Chandigarh.                    We regret,

we cannot agree with the learned counsel for the appellant.

In our opinion, an interpretation has to be given to the

amended <a href="/doc/96766741/" id="a_5">Section 17(2)</a> (b) of the Act, which does not lead to

an absurd consequence.           If the contention of the learned

counsel for the appellant is accepted, it will mean that

even if a cause of action has arisen in Ambala, then too the

complainant can file a claim petition even in Tamil Nadu or

Gauhati or anywhere in India where a branch office of the

insurance company is situated.            We cannot agree with this

contention.    It will lead to absurd consequences and lead to

bench   hunting.     In    our    opinion,      the    expression    'branch

office' in the amended <a href="/doc/96766741/" id="a_6">Section 17(2)</a> would mean the branch

office where the cause of action has arisen.                No doubt this

would   be   departing    from   the    plain    and    literal     words   of

<a href="/doc/61548993/" id="a_7">Section 17(2)(b)</a> of the Act but such departure is sometimes

necessary (as it is in this case) to avoid absurdity. [vide

G.P. Singh's Principles of Statutory Interpretation, Ninth

Edition, 2004 P. 79]

         In the present case, since the cause of action arose

at Ambala, the State Consumer Redressal Commission, Haryana

alone will have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.

any   reason   to   interfere   with   the   impugned   order   of   the

to the costs.
