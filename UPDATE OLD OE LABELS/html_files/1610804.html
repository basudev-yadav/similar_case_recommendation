Civil Appeal No.2462 OF 2008
(Arising out of SLP (Civil) No.15619 of 2005)
Hatti Gold Mines Company Ltd.			. Appellant (s)
Vs.
</p><p id="p_3">Vinay Heavy Equipments				.. Respondent (s)

	I respectfully agree with the judgment proposed by learned Brother 
Panchal, J. Having regard to the importance of the issue, I am adding a few 
of my own reasons.
</p><p id="p_4">2.	Two questions of law arise for our consideration :
</p><p id="p_5">(i)	Whether Limitation Act, 1963 is inapplicable to a proceeding in a 
court, under the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 ? 
</p><p id="p_6">(ii)	Even if <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_2">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 is applicable, whether applicability of 
<a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_3">section 14</a> of the said Act is excluded to proceedings under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_4">section 34(1)</a> of 
the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_5">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 ?
</p>
<p id="p_7">Re : Question No.(i) :
</p>
<p id="p_8">3.	Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the Arbitration and 
<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_6">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (AC Act for short) is a self-contained Code relating 
to arbitration and all matters incidental thereto including limitation. He 
submitted  that section 34(3) of AC Act prescribes the period of limitation 
for an application for setting aside the arbitral award, when such period can 
be extended and the limit to which it could be extended. Section 43 of the 
AC Act makes the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_7">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 ('<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_8">Limitation Act</a>' 
for short) applicable only to proceedings in arbitration and not to 
proceedings in court. Therefore, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_9">Limitation Act</a> are 
inapplicable to proceedings in a court under the AC Act.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.	To decide this question, reference to the relevant provisions of the AC 
Act and <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_10">Limitation Act</a> is necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_10">4.1)	Part I of AC Act relates to arbitration. It contemplates a party 
approaching a court in three circumstances :
</p><p id="p_11">(a)	for grant of interim measures under <a href="/doc/268914/" id="a_11">section 9</a>; 
</p>
<p id="p_12">(b)	for setting aside an arbitral award, under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_12">section 34(1)</a>; and

</p><p id="p_13">(c)	for filing appeals under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_13">section 37</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_14">As <a href="/doc/268914/" id="a_14">section 9</a> deals with applications for interim measures, the question of 
limitation does not arise. In regard to applications for setting aside an  award 
under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_15">section 34</a>, sub-section (3) thereof prescribes a 
limitation of three months, different from the period of one month prescribed 
in the Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_16">Limitation Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_17">Section 37</a> does not prescribe any 
period of Limitation for filing appeals. <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_18">If Limitation Act</a> is inapplicable to 
court proceedings under AC Act, there will be no limitation for filing 
appeals under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_19">section 37</a>. <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_20">If Limitation Act</a> is applicable, the period of 
Limitation for appeals filed under section 37 of AC Act will be governed by 
<a href="/doc/436447/" id="a_21">Article 116</a> of the Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_22">Limitation Act</a>.   
</p>	
<p id="p_15">4.2)	Section 43 of the AC Act, relates to limitation and it is extracted 
below : 
</p>
<p id="p_16">"43. Limitation. - (1) <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_23">The Limitation Act</a>, 1963 (36 of 1963), shall apply to 
arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in Court. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">(2)	For the purposes of this section and the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_24">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 (36 
of 1963), an arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date 
referred in <a href="/doc/1772105/" id="a_25">section 21</a>. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">(3)	Where an arbitration agreement to submit future disputes to 
arbitration provides that any claim to which the agreement applies shall be 
barred unless some step to commence arbitral proceedings is taken within 
a time fixed by the agreement, and a dispute arises to which the agreement 
applies, the Court, if it is of opinion that in the circumstances of the case 
undue hardship would otherwise be caused, and notwithstanding that the 
time so fixed has expired, may on such terms, if any, as the justice of the 
case may require, extend the time for such period as it thinks proper. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">(4)	Where the court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the 
period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the 
order of the Court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by 
the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_26">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 (36 of 1963), for the commencement of the 
proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the dispute so 
submitted." 
</p>
<p id="p_20">	<a href="/doc/103447/" id="a_27">Section 2(1)(e)</a> of the Act defines 'Court' as follows : 
"2(1)(e). 'Court' means the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in 
a district, and includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original 
civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the 
subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of 
a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such 
principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes."
</p>
<p id="p_21">4.3)	Let me next refer to the relevant provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_28">Limitation Act</a>. <a href="/doc/880040/" id="a_29">Section 
3</a> of the Limitation Act provides for the bar of limitation. It provides that 
subject to the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_30">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_31">24</a> (inclusive), every suit 
instituted, appeal preferred, and application made after the prescribed period 
shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence. 
'Prescribed period' means that period of limitation computed in accordance 
with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_32">Limitation Act</a>. 'Period of limitation' means the 
period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by the 
Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_33">Limitation Act</a> (vide <a href="/doc/809615/" id="a_34">section 2(j)</a> of the said Act). <a href="/doc/372189/" id="a_35">Section 29</a> 
of Limitation Act relates to savings. Sub-section (2) thereof which is 
relevant is extracted below :
</p>
<p id="p_22">"29(2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or 
application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by 
the Schedule, the provisions of <a href="/doc/880040/" id="a_36">Section 3</a> shall apply as if such period were 
the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purposes of determining 
any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by 
any special or local law, the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_37">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_38">24</a> 
(inclusive) shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they 
are not expressly excluded by such special or local law."
</p>
<p id="p_23">4.4)	<a href="/doc/436447/" id="a_39">Article 116</a> of the Schedule prescribes the period of limitation for 
appeals to High Court (90 days) and appeals to any other court (30 days) 
under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It is now well settled that the 
words 'appeals under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908' occurring in  
<a href="/doc/436447/" id="a_40">Article 116</a> refer not only to appeals preferred under Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908, but also to appeals, where the procedure for filing of such 
appeals and powers of the court for dealing with such appeals are governed 
by Code of Civil Procedure (See decision of the Constitution Bench in 
<a href="/doc/195129/" id="a_41">Vidyacharan Shukla v. Khubchand Baghel</a> - AIR 1964 SC 1099). <a href="/doc/710990/" id="a_42">Article 
119 (b)</a> of the Schedule prescribes the period of limitation for filing an 
application (under <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_43">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940), for setting aside an award, as 
thirty days from the date of service of notice of filing of the award. 
</p>
<p id="p_24">5.	AC Act is no doubt, a special law, consolidating and amending the 
law relating to arbitration and matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto. AC Act does not prescribe the period of limitation, for various 
proceedings under that Act, except where it intends to prescribe a period 
different from what is prescribed in the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_44">Limitation Act</a>. On the other hand, 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_45">Section 43</a> makes the provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_46">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 applicable to 
proceedings - both in court and in arbitration - under the AC Act. There is 
also no express exclusion of application of any provision of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_47">Limitation 
Act</a> to proceedings under AC Act, but there are some specific departures 
from the general provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_48">Limitation Act</a>, as for example, the proviso to 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_49">section 34(3)</a> and sub-sections (2) to (4) of section 43 of the AC Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">6.	Where the Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_50">Limitation Act</a> prescribes a period of 
limitation for appeals or applications to any court, and the special or local 
law provides for filing of appeals and applications to the court, but does not 
prescribe any period of limitation in regard to such appeals or applications, 
the period of limitation prescribed in the Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_51">Limitation Act</a> will 
apply to such appeals or applications and consequently the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_52">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_53">24</a> will also apply. Where the special or local law prescribes for 
any appeal or application, a period of limitation different from the period 
prescribed by the Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_54">Limitation Act</a>, then the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_55">section 29(2)</a> will be attracted. In that event, the provisions of <a href="/doc/880040/" id="a_56">section 3</a> of 
Limitation Act will apply, as if the period of limitation prescribed under the 
special law was the period prescribed by the Schedule to <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_57">Limitation Act</a>, and 
for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for the 
appeal or application by the special law, the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_58">sections 
4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_59">24</a> will apply to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by 
such special law. The object of <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_60">section 29(2)</a> is to ensure that the principles 
contained in <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_61">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_62">24</a> of Limitation Act apply to suits, appeals and 
applications filed in a court under special or local laws also, even if it 
prescribes a period of limitation different from what is prescribed in the 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_63">Limitation Act</a>, except to the extent of express exclusion of the application 
of any or all of those provisions. 
</p>
<p id="p_26">7.	It may be noticed at this juncture that the Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_64">Limitation 
Act</a> prescribes the period of limitation only to proceedings in courts and not 
to any proceeding before a Tribunal or quasi-judicial authority. 
Consequently <a href="/doc/880040/" id="a_65">section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_66">section 29(2)</a> of Limitation Act will not apply to 
proceedings before Tribunal. This means that the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_67">Limitation Act</a> will not 
apply to appeals or applications before Tribunals, unless expressly provided. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">8.	Learned counsel for the appellant contended that section 43 of the AC 
Act makes applicable the provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_68">Limitation Act</a> only to arbitrations, 
thereby expressing an intent to exclude the application to any proceedings 
relating to arbitration in a court. The contention of appellant ignores and 
overlooks <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_69">section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act and section 43(1) of the AC 
Act. Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_70">section 43</a> of the Act provides that the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_71">Limitation Act</a> 
shall apply to Arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. The purpose 
of section 43 of AC Act is not to make <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_72">Limitation Act</a> inapplicable to 
proceedings before court, but on the other hand, make <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_73">Limitation Act</a> 
applicable to arbitrations. As already noticed, the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_74">Limitation Act</a> applies 
only to proceedings in court, and but for the express provision in <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_75">section 43</a>, 
the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_76">Limitation Act</a> would not have applied to arbitration, as Arbitrators are 
Private Tribunals and not courts. Section 43 of the AC Act, apart from 
making the provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_77">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 applicable to arbitrations, 
reiterates that <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_78">Limitation Act</a> applies to proceedings in court.  Therefore, the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_79">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 apply to all proceedings under the AC 
Act, both in court and in arbitration, except to the extent expressly excluded 
by the provisions of the AC Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">Re : Question No.(ii) :
</p>
<p id="p_29">9.	The learned counsel for the appellant next contended that even if 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_80">Limitation Act</a> applied, <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_81">section 14</a> is excluded by reason of the proviso to 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_82">section 34(3)</a> and at best, prosecution before a wrong forum can be 
considered as a sufficient cause for explaining the delay, in which event 
condonation cannot be for a period in excess of 30 days. He submitted that 
sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_83">section 34</a> prescribes the period of limitation for an 
application to set aside an award as three months, and the proviso thereto 
provides for extension of such period of limitation, by a period not 
exceeding one month. He pointed out that the object of the AC Act is to 
expedite arbitration proceedings with minimal judicial intervention as is 
evident from <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_84">Section 5</a> of that Act. He further submitted that the legislature, 
while incorporating a provision for extension of time for an application 
under section 34(1) of AC Act, on sufficient cause being shown, did not 
choose to incorporate any provision for excluding the time spent before a 
wrong court, and therefore, <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_85">section 14</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 is 
inapplicable; and even if the principle underlying <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_86">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation 
Act is held to be applicable, as a sufficient cause for extension of               
the   period   of    limitation,  the   extension    on    that   ground   can    be 
only for a period not exceeding thirty days as provided in the proviso to sub-
section (3) of section 34 of the AC Act.  In support of the aforesaid 
contentions, reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in 
<a href="/doc/819178/" id="a_87">Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. v. Parson Tools and Plants, Kanpur</a>  [1975 
(3) SCR 743], <a href="/doc/487135/" id="a_88">Union of India vs. Popular Construction Co</a>. [2001 (8) SCC 
470] and <a href="/doc/558636/" id="a_89">Fairgrowth Investments Ltd vs. Custodian</a> [2004 (11) SCC 472]. 
The appellant also contended that the decision rendered by two Judges 
Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1330198/" id="a_90">State of Goa vs. Western Builders</a> [2006 (6) SCC 
239] holding that <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_91">section 14</a> of Limitation Act applied to applications under 
section 34 of the AC Act was not good law as it failed to notice the earlier 
decision of a larger Bench in Parson Tools and failed to follow Popular 
Construction. 
</p>
 
<p id="p_30">10.	The respondents, on the other hand, contended that having regard to 
<a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_92">section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act, provisions of <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_93">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_94">24</a> of that Act 
would apply for determining the period of limitation prescribed for an 
application under any special law, unless expressly excluded by such special 
law. The AC Act, which is a special law, prescribes a period of limitation for 
an application to set aside an award, different from what was prescribed 
under the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_95">Limitation Act</a>. It also excludes application of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_96">section 5</a> of the 
Limitation Act to an application under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_97">section 34(1)</a>, by making an express 
provision in the proviso to <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_98">section 34(3)</a>, for extension of period of 
limitation. <a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_99">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/885718/" id="a_100">6</a> to <a href="/doc/769768/" id="a_101">24</a> of the Limitation Act would however 
apply to an application under section 34(1) of the AC Act, as they are not 
excluded. Respondents also contended that the question is squarely covered 
by the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1330198/" id="a_102">State of Goa v. Western Builders</a> [2006 (6) 
SCC 239]. They submitted that the decisions in Popular Construction 
(supra) and Fairgrowth (supra) are inapplicable, as they deal with <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_103">section 5</a> 
and not <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_104">section 14</a> of the Limitation Act. They also contended that the 
decision in Parson Tools did not relate to a proceeding before a court, but a 
proceeding before a Tribunal. 
</p>

<p id="p_31">11.	Section 34 of AC Act relates to applications for setting aside an 
arbitral award. Sub-section (1) provides that recourse to a court against an 
arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such an 
award in accordance with sub-sections (2) and (3). Sub-<a href="/doc/103447/" id="a_105">section 2</a> contains 
the grounds on which an arbitral award can be set aside. Sub-section (3) 
which is relevant is extracted below :
</p>
<p id="p_32">"34(3). An application for setting aside may not be made after three 
months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that 
application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made 
under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_106">section 33</a>, from the date on which that request had been disposed of 
by the arbitral tribunal:
</p>
<p id="p_33">Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by 
sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of 
three months it may entertain the application within a further period of 
thirty days, but not thereafter."
</p>
<p id="p_34">11.1)	<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_107">Section 5</a> of Limitation Act, providing for extension of prescribed 
period in certain cases, reads thus: 
</p>
<p id="p_35">"5.:  Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of 
the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be 
admitted after the prescribed period, if the appellant or the applicant 
satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal 
or making the application within such period."
</p>
<p id="p_36">xxxxx

11.2)	<a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_108">Section 14</a> of Limitation Act relates to exclusion of time of 
proceeding bona fide in court without jurisdiction. Sub-section (2) thereof 
relevant for our purpose is extracted below :
</p>
<p id="p_37">"14(2) In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time 
during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due diligence 
another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal 
or revision, against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, 
where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from 
defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain 
it."
</p>
<p id="p_38">12.	Sub-section (3) of section 34 of the AC Act prescribes the period of 
limitation for filing an application for setting aside an award as three months 
from the date on which the applicant has received the arbitral award. The 
proviso thereto vests in the court, discretion to extend the period of 
limitation by a further period not exceeding thirty days if the court is 
satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause for not making 
the application within three months. The use of the words "but not 
thereafter" in the proviso makes it clear that even if a sufficient cause is 
made out for a longer extension, the extension cannot be beyond thirty days. 
The purpose of proviso to section 34(3) of AC Act is similar to that of 
<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_109">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act which also relates to extension of the period 
of limitation prescribed for any application or appeal. It vests a discretion in 
a court to extend the prescribed period of limitation if the applicant satisfies 
the court that he had sufficient cause for not making the application within 
the prescribed period. <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_110">Section 5</a> of Limitation Act does not place any outer 
limit in regard to the period of extension, whereas the proviso to sub-<a href="/doc/880040/" id="a_111">section 
3</a> of section 34 of the AC Act places a limit on the period of extension of the 
period of limitation. Thus the proviso to sub-section 34(3) of the AC Act is 
also a provision relating to extension of period of limitation, but differs from 
<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_112">section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, in regard to period of extension, and has the 
effect of excluding <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_113">section 5</a> alone of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_114">Limitation Act</a>.
</p> 
<p id="p_39">14.	On the other hand, <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_115">Section 14</a> contained in Part III of Limitation Act 
does not relate to extension of the period of limitation, but relates to 
exclusion of certain period while computing the period of limitation. Neither 
sub-section (3) of section 34 of the AC Act nor any other provision of the 
AC Act exclude the applicability of <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_116">section 14</a> of the Limitation Act to 
applications under section 34(1) of the AC Act. Nor will the proviso to 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_117">section 34(3)</a> exclude the application of <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_118">section 14</a>, as <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_119">section 14</a> is not a 
provision for extension of period of limitation, but for exclusion of certain 
period while computing the period of limitation.   Having regard to <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_120">section 
29(2)</a> of Limitation Act, <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_121">section 14</a> of that Act will be  applicable to an 
application under section 34(1) of the AC Act. Even when there is cause to 
apply <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_122">section 14</a>, the limitation period continues to be three months and not 
more, but in computing the limitation period of three months for the 
application under section 34(1) of the AC Act, the time during which the 
applicant was prosecuting such application before the wrong court is 
excluded, provided the proceeding in the wrong court was prosecuted bona 
fide, with due diligence. Western Builders therefore lays down the correct 
legal position.

<p id="p_40">15.	Reliance placed by the appellant on the decision of three Judges of 
this Court in Parson Tools (supra) is totally misplaced. That decision related 
to section 10(3B) of the U P Sales Tax Act, 1958 which provided a 
limitation period of one year for invoking the revisional jurisdiction and 
further provided that the revising authority may on sufficient cause being 
shown, entertain an application within a further period of six months. The 
appellant contended that section 10(3B) of the U.P.Sales Tax Act considered 
in Parsons Tools is similar to proviso to section 34(3) of the AC Act and 
therefore the following observations in Parson Tools,  with reference to 
section 10(3B) of U.P.Sales Tax Act, making <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_123">section 14(2)</a> of the Limitation 
Act inapplicable to a revision under section 10(3B) of U.P.Sales Tax Act, 
would also make <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_124">section 14(2)</a> inapplicable, to an application under section 
34(1) of the AC Act : 
</p>
<p id="p_41">"Three features of the scheme of the above provision are noteworthy. The 
first is the no limitation has been prescribed for the suo motu exercise of 
its jurisdiction by the Revising Authority. The second is that the period of 
one year prescribed as limitation for filing an application for revision by 
the aggrieved party is unusually long.  The third is that the Revising 
Authority has no discretion to extend this period beyond a further period 
of six months, even on sufficient cause shown. As rightly pointed out in 
the minority judgment of the High Court, pendency of proceedings of the 
nature contemplated by <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_125">section 14(2)</a> of the Limitation Act, may amount to 
a sufficient cause for condoning the delay and extending the limitation for 
filing a revision application, but<a href="/doc/541605/" id="a_126"> s. 10</a> (3-B) of the Sales-tax Act, gives no 
jurisdiction to the Revising Authority to extend the limitation, even in such 
a case, for a further period of more than six months."
</p>
<p id="p_42">"we are of the opinion that the object, the scheme and language of 
s.10 of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_127">Sales-Tax Act</a> do not permit the invocation of s.14(2) of the 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_128">Limitation Act</a>, either, in terms, or, in principle, for excluding the time 
spent in prosecuting proceedings for setting aside the dismissal of appeals 
in default, from computation of the period of limitation prescribed for 
filing a revision under the Sales-tax. "
</p><p id="p_43">[Emphasis supplied]


The said observations have to be read and understood with reference to the 
issue that was being considered in that case. In  Parson Tools, this court did 
not hold that <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_129">section 14(2)</a> was excluded by reason of the wording of <a href="/doc/915880/" id="a_130">section 
10(3B)</a> of the Sales Tax Act. This Court  was considering an appeal against 
the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court. Two Judges of the 
High Court had held that the time spent in prosecuting the application for 
setting aside the order of dismissal of appeals in default, could be excluded 
when computing the period of limitation for filing a revision under <a href="/doc/541605/" id="a_131">section 
10</a> of the said Act, by application of the principle underlying <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_132">section 14(2)</a> of 
the Limitation Act. The minority view of the third Judge was that the 
revisional authority under section 10 of the U P Sales Tax Act did not act as 
a court but only as a Revenue Tribunal and therefore the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_133">Limitation Act</a> did 
not apply to the proceedings before such Tribunal, and consequently neither 
<a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_134">section 29(2)</a> nor <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_135">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act applied. The decision of 
the Full Bench was challenged by the Commissioner of Sales Tax before this 
Court, contending that the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_136">Limitation Act</a> did not apply to tribunals, and 
<a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_137">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act was excluded in principle or by analogy. 
This Court upheld the view that <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_138">Limitation Act</a> did not apply to Tribunals, 
and that as the Revisional Authority under <a href="/doc/915880/" id="a_139">section 10</a> of UP Sales Tax Act 
was a Tribunal and not a court, <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_140">Limitation Act</a> was inapplicable. This Court 
further held that the period of pendency of proceedings before the wrong 
forum could not be excluded while computing the period of limitation by 
applying <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_141">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act. This Court however held that by 
applying the principle underlying <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_142">section 14(2)</a>, the period of pendency 
before the wrong forum may be considered  as a 'sufficient cause' for 
condoning the delay, but then having regard to <a href="/doc/541605/" id="a_143">section 10(3B)</a>, the extension 
on that ground could not  extend beyond six months. The observation that 
pendency of proceedings of the nature contemplated by <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_144">section 14(2)</a> of the 
Limitation Act, may amount to a sufficient cause for condoning the delay 
and extending the limitation and such extension cannot be for a period in 
excess of the ceiling period prescribed, are in the light of its finding that 
<a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_145">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act was inapplicable to revisions under section 
10(3B) of U.P.Sales Tax Act. These observations cannot be interpreted as 
laying down a proposition that even where <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_146">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act in 
terms applied and the period spent before wrong forum could therefore be 
excluded while computing the period of limitation, the pendency before the 
wrong forum should be considered only as a sufficient cause for extension of 
period of limitation and therefore, subjected to the ceiling relating to the 
extension of the period of limitation. As we are concerned with a proceeding 
before a court to which <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_147">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act applies, the decision 
in Parson Tools which related to a proceeding before a tribunal to which 
<a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_148">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act did not apply, has no application.

<p id="p_44">15.	The decision in Popular Construction is also of no assistance. That 
decision makes it clear that AC Act, 1996 being a special law, and <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_149">section 
34</a> thereof prescribing a period of limitation different from that prescribed 
under the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_150">Limitation Act</a> and providing a ceiling on the period by which the 
period of limitation could be extended, the corresponding provisions in the 
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_151">Limitation Act</a> prescribing the period of limitation for filing an application 
for setting aside an award [<a href="/doc/710990/" id="a_152">Article 119(b)</a> of the Schedule to <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_153">Limitation Act</a>] 
and for extending the period of limitation for sufficient cause (<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_154">section 5</a> of 
the Limitation Act), were inapplicable. It did not relate to applicability of 
<a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_155">section 14(2)</a> of Limitation Act. Nor did this Court consider the applicability 
of <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_156">section 14(2)</a>. Therefore, the decision in Popular Construction will not 
apply. Fairgrowth merely reiterates the principle in Popular Construction in 
regard to the exclusion of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_157">section 5</a> of Limitation Act, as is evident from the 
following observations :
</p>
<p id="p_45">" the general rule as far as special and local Acts are concerned is that 
the specified provisions including <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_158">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act will 
apply provided the special or local Act provides a period of limitation 
different from that prescribed under the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_159">Limitation Act</a>. There is an 
additional requirement viz. that the special local Act does not expressly 
exclude the application of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_160">Limitation Act</a>."
</p>

<p id="p_46">Therefore it has to be held that <a href="/doc/642645/" id="a_161">section 14(2)</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 is 
applicable to proceedings under section 34(1) of the AC Act.
