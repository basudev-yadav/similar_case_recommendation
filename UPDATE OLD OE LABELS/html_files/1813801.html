Prefatory Note of the Three Acts
(A)  THE TERRORIST AFFECTED AREAS (SPECIAL COURTS) ACT, 1984
(ACT 61 OF 1984)
</p><p id="p_5">4.   The  above Act 61 of 1984, applicable to the  whole  of
India  except  the State of Jammu and Kashmir  received	 the
assent	of  the	 President  on	August	31,  1984  replacing
Ordinance  No. 9 of 1984 promulgated on July 14,  1984,	 the
object	of  which  is to provide for  the  speedy  trial  of
certain offenses in terrorist affected areas and for matters
connected  therewith.  <a href="/doc/869743/" id="a_10">Section 2(1)</a> of this Act defines	 the
expression "terrorist affected area" as an area declared  as
a "terrorist affected area" under <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_11">Section 3</a> which  provision
empowers  the Central Government by notification to  declare
any area to be "terrorist affected area" and constitute such
area  into a single judicial zone or into as  many  judicial
zones  as  it  may  deem fit provided  in  its	opinion	 the
offenses of the nature specified in the Schedule appended to
that  Act are being committed in any area by  terrorists  on
such  a scale and in such a manner that it is expedient	 for
the purpose of coping with such terrorists to have  recourse
to the provisions of the Act.  The notification issued under
<a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_12">Section 3(1)</a> in respect of an area should specify the period
during which the area shall for the purpose of this Act be a
"terrorist   affected	area".	 As  per  <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_13">Section   3(2)</a>   a
notification  under  <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_14">Section  3(1)</a> in  respect	of  an	area
specifying  the period during which the area shall  for	 the
purpose of this Act, be a terrorist affected area, and where
the Central Government is of the opinion that the terrorists
had been committing in that area from the date earlier	than
the  date  of  issue of the notification,  offenses  of	 the
nature specified in the Schedule on such a scale and in such
a  manner  that	 it  is expedient  to  commence	 the  period
specified  in the notification from such earlier  date,	 the
period specified in the notification may commence from	that
date subject to the proviso thereto.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_15">This   Act</a>	 contains  21  sections	 relating   to	 the
establishment	of   special  courts,	their	composition,
jurisdiction and appointment of judges and provision for  an
appeal	as a matter of right from any judgment, sentence  or
order (not being an interlocutory order) of a special  court
to the Supreme Court both on facts and law.

under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">  the Indian Penal Code</a> of which 23 are  bailable	were
specified, the Legislature by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_18">Amendment Act</a> 45 of  1985,
published  in the Gazette of India, dated August  26,  1985,

1982 and deleted the rest from the original schedule.
</p><p id="p_8">7.   It	 has been brought to our notice by Mr K.T.S.  Tulsi,
the  learned Additional Solicitor General that	the  Central
Government established judicial zones in Jullundur, Patiala,
Ferozepur and Chandigarh but abolished them by	Notification
Nos.   S.O.  692,  S.O. 693, S.O. 694  and  S.O.  695  dated
September 25, 1985 and transferred the cases pending  before
those courts to ordinary courts.  Two additional courts were
constituted  by	 the  Government  of  India  for  trial	  of
hijacking cases and Golden Temple case at Ajmer and  Jodhpur
but  these two courts were also abolished by the  Government
vide  Notification Nos.	 S.O. 655(E) and S.O.  722(E)  dated
August	24,  1990  and	September  28,	1993   respectively.
However, this Act is not repealed, but is in operation.
(B)  THE  TERRORIST AND DISRUPTIVE  ACTIVITIES	(PREVENTION)
ACT, 1985 (ACT 31 OF 1985)
</p><p id="p_9">8.   <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_25">This Act</a> which received the assent of the President  on
May  23,  1985 and was published in the	 Gazette  of  India,
Extra.,	 Part II, <a href="/doc/470025/" id="a_26">Section 1</a>, dated May 23, 1985,  came	into
force on May 24, 1985 in whole of India for a period of	 two
years.	Though originally the proviso to sub-section (2)  to
<a href="/doc/470025/" id="a_27">Section	 1</a> was added reading, "Provided so much of this	 Act
as relates to terrorist acts shall not apply to the State of
Jammu  and Kashmir", this proviso was omitted by Act  46  of
1985.	The provisions of this Act were made  applicable  to
the  State  of Jammu and Kashmir w.e.f. June 5,	 1985.	 The
preamble  of  this Act read that the special  provisions  of
this  Act were made "for the prevention of, and	 for  coping
with,  terrorist and disruptive activities and	for  matters
connected  therewith or incidental thereto".  The  Statement
of Objects and Reasons of this Act read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "Prefatory  Note	Statement of  Objects  and
	      Reasons.-	 Terrorists  had been  indulging  in
	      wanton killings, arson, looting of properties'
	      and other heinous crimes mostly in Punjab	 and
	      Chandigarh.   Since  the 10th May,  1985,	 the
	      terrorists  have expanded their activities  to
	      other  parts  of	the  country,  i.e.   Delhi,
	      Haryana,	Uttar  Pradesh and  Rajasthan  as  a
	      result  of which several innocent	 lives	have
	      been lost and many suffered serious  injuries.
	      In  planting of explosive devices	 in  trains,
	      buses   and  public  places,  the	 object	  to
	      terrorise,  to  create fear and panic  in	 the
	      minds  of	 citizens and  to  disrupt  communal
	      peace  and  harmony  is  clearly	discernible.
	      This  is	a new and overt phase  of  terrorism
	      which requires to be taken serious note of and
	      dealt with effectively and expeditiously.	 The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">	      617</span>
	      alarming increase in disruptive activities  is
	      also a matter of serious concern."

</p><p id="p_12">(C)  THE  TERRORIST AND DISRUPTIVE  ACTIVITIES	(PREVENTION)
ACT,   1987 (ACT 28 OF 1987)
</p><p id="p_13">11.  Act 28 of 1987 was enacted as Act 31 of 1985 was due to
expire	on May 23, 1987 and as it was felt that in order  to
combat	and  cope with terrorist and  disruptive  activities
effectively, it was not only necessary to continue the	said
law  but  also	to strengthen it further.   Since  both	 the
Houses	of  Parliament	were  not  in  session	and  it	 was
necessary   to	 take  immediate   action,   the   President
promulgated   the   Terrorist  and   Disruptive	  Activities
(Prevention)  Ordinance,  1987 (2 of 1987) on May  23,	1987
which  came into force w.e.f. May 24, 1987.   However,	this
Act  repealing	the Ordinance, received the  assent  of	 the
President of India on September 3, 1987 and was published in
the  Gazette  of India, Extra., Part II,  <a href="/doc/470025/" id="a_42">Section  1</a>,  dated
September 3, 1987.  The scheme of Act 31 of 1985 and Act  28
of 1987 as reflected from their preambles is the same.	 The
scheme of the special provisions of these two Acts  were/are
"for  the prevention of, and for coping with, terrorist	 and
disruptive activities and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto".
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">618</span>
<p id="p_14">12.  As per sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/470025/" id="a_43">Section 1</a>, <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_44">Sections 5</a>, <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_45">15</a>, <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_46">21</a>
and <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_47">22</a> came into force at once and the remaining  provisions
of this Act were deemed to have come into force on 24th	 day
of  May	 1987.	According to sub-section (4) of	 <a href="/doc/470025/" id="a_48">Section  1</a>,
this  Act was to remain in force for a period of  two  years
from  May  24,	1987 but subsequently  sub-section  (4)	 was
amended	 by virtue of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_49">Amendment Act</a> 16 of  1989  whereby
for  the  words	 "two years", the words	 "four	years"	were
substituted and the validity of this Act was extended for  a
further	 period of two years.  Resultantly, the Act  was  to
expire on May 23, 1991.	 Thereafter as it was felt that	 the
Act should continue, the President promulgated an  Ordinance
whereby	 for  the  words  "four	 years",  "six	years"	were
substituted  in sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/470025/" id="a_50">Section 1</a>.  Subsequently,
this Ordinance was repealed by Act 35 of 1991 thus extending
the  life  of the Act 28 of 1987 to six years.	<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_51">As  the	 Act</a>
even  by the extended period of six years was to  expire  on
May  23,  1993,	 another  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_52">Amendment Act</a>	 43  of	 1993  which
received  the  assent  of President on	May  22,  1993,	 was
enacted	 extending  the	 life of the  Act  for	eight  years
instead of six years.
</p><p id="p_15">13.  Incidentally,  it may be stated that  some	 insertions,
substitutions and omissions to some of the sections of	this
Act  have been made.  <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_53">This Act</a> contains 30 sections  grouped
under  four  parts i.e. Part 1 (<a href="/doc/470025/" id="a_54">Sections 1</a> and <a href="/doc/34705/" id="a_55">2</a>),  Part  11

(<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_60">Sections  20</a>  to  <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_61">30</a>).	  Part 11  of  the  Act	 deals	with
punishment for, and measures for coping with terrorists	 and
disruptive activities.	Part III deals with constitution  of
Designated  Courts,  their  jurisdiction,  powers,  and	 the
procedure  to be adopted.  It also provides  provisions	 for
appeal to the Supreme Court both on facts and law as in	 the
case of other Acts.  The provisions under Part IV under	 the
heading	 "Miscellaneous" deal with the modified	 application
of  certain  provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62">	 of  the  Code</a>,	 presumption  as  to
offenses  under <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_63">Section 3</a>, identification of accused,  power

Singh,	Ujjal  Singh, Mohan Pandey  all appearing  for	the
petitioners/appellants	made  the  most	 virulent  fusillade
against the    constitutional  validity of all the  Acts  in
general	 and  the  various  provisions	of  those  Acts	  in
particular  mainly on the grounds that (1) that the  Central
Legislature  has  no  legislative competence  to  enact	 the
legislations,  and  (2) these impugned Acts or some  of	 the
provisions  of	these  Acts  are  in  contravention  of	  or
ostensibly  in	violation of any of the	 fundamental  rights
specified  in  Part  III  of  the  Constitution;  they	also
triggered  off a volley of attacks against the	validity  of
the  provisions	 of these Acts/on some other  grounds  also.
According  to them, these Acts and the	provisions  thereto,
which are in utter disregard and breach of humanitarian	 law
and  universal human rights, not only lack impartiality	 but
also  fail the basic test of justice and fairness which	 are
well established and recognised principles of law.
</p><p id="p_18">16.  After  critically	analysing  a  number  of  penal	 and
procedural   provisions	  relating  to	issue	of   arrest,
investigation, bail, mode and methodology of trial, right of
the accused during the trial etc. etc., the learned  counsel
have  strenuously articulated that these Acts with which  we
are  confronted,  are Draconian, ugly,	vicious	 and  highly
reprehensible, the brutality of which cannot and should	 not
be minimised or ignored though this Court is not called upon
to condone the penalised conduct of the real terrorists	 and
disruptionists.	 Then they made a scathing attack  seriously
contending  that  the police by abusing and  misusing  their
arbitrary and uncanalised power under the impugned Acts	 are
doing  a  'witch-hunt'	against	 the  innocent	people	 and
suspects  stigmatizing them as potential criminals and	hunt
them all the time and overreact and thereby unleash a  reign
of  terror  as an institutionalised  terror  perpetrated  by
Nazis on Jews.
</p><p id="p_19">17.  The  above	 challenges have been countervailed  by	 the
learned	 Additional  Solicitor	General,  Mr  K.T.S.   Tulsi
assisted by Mr R.S. Suri appearing for the State of  Punjab,
the  learned  Additional Solicitor General, Mr	Altaf  Ahmed
assisted  by  Ms A. Subhashini appearing for  the  Union  of
India,	Mr  V.R.  Reddy, the  learned  Additional  Solicitor
General	  assisted  by	Mr  K.V.  Venkataraman	and  Mr	  1.
Subramaniam  for the State of Tamil Nadu, Mr  S.K.  Dholakia
for  the State of Gujarat and Mr N.M. Ghatate for the  State
of  U.P. contending that all the veiled attacks	 challenging
the  validity  of the Acts and the  provisions	thereto	 are
mainly due to the unjustifiable hostility and sentiments and
souring	 of respect for those Acts.  According to them,	 the
events	of the past and the continuous long term threats  of
terrorism  and	disruption unleashed by a team	of  seasoned
criminals  by  spreading their wings  and  sharpening  their
claws have forced the legislature to respond to this  menace
without	 sacrificing the national values and to	 combat	 the
terrorism by extending and expanding the legal powers of the
State and taking steps/measures in a legalised way and	that
the outcome of such response is the enactment of these	Acts
after a prolonged debate in both Houses of Parliament as the
Legislature has felt that the ordinary criminal laws   both
penal and procedural  are quite inadequate to meet the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">620</span>
challenges especially when the incidents of terrorists'	 and
disruptionists'	 activities have  increased  astronomically.
It  has	 been  submitted  that it  was	only  in  the  above
background,  the Parliament in its wisdom thought  that	 the
enactment of these Acts (TADA) is the only solution for	 all
the ills, besetting the nation and accordingly enacted these
Acts under challenge in order to put down the terrorism	 and
the   impending	  danger  in  a	 legalised  manner   and   a
comprehensive survey of the anatomy of the entire Acts and a
dispassionate  examination of them would  unmistakably	show
that  these  Acts  cannot  be  said  to	 be,  in  any	way,
contravening   any   of	 the  fundamental  rights   of	 our
Constitution   or   suffering  from  lack   of	 legislative
competence.
</p><p id="p_20">18.  Supplementing  the above submission, it has  been	very
seriously  contended by Mr K.T.S. Tulsi that the  terrorists
are  resorting	to a mix of  specific  terrorist  operations
including  armed  attacks  in  a  very	cruel,	unusual	 and
inhumane  manner  for a variety of reasons,  some  of  which
being  (1) to instill (a) a sense of fear  and	helplessness
among civilians either to alienate them from the  Government
duly  established  or  to  make	 them  lose  faith  in	 the
Government's  ability  to  protect  them,  (b)	a  sense  of
impotence  among government officials or to intimidate	them
as  a means of neutralizing their active opposition  to	 the
terrorists groups; (2) to undermine the national economy  by
discouraging foreign investment, dissuading foreign tourists
from  visiting	the country and spurring capital  flight  by
domestic  investors; and (3) to provoke	 harsh	governmental
reprisals to gain sympathy of the population or to create an
international  incident to publicise their  political  cause
and  so	 on.   He  further states  that	 all  their  violent
activities  are	 designed to get maximum media	coverage  of
their  demands including political demands and of  publicity
and  that many times the targets or the victims of the	most
inhumane  physical attacks are the innocent persons  whether
they are individuals or group of persons.
</p><p id="p_21">19.  Notwithstanding   the  merits  and	 demerits   of	 the
submissions   and   counter-submissions,   irrefutably	 the
talented  lawyers and learned Additional Solicitors  General
using  their  formidable legal	skill,	extensive  scholarly
knowledge and vast and rich practical experience in criminal
proceedings  and trials analysed the various  provisions  of
the  Acts  under separate heads in the light  of  the  well-
recognised   principles	 of  criminal	jurisprudence	with
reference  to  human rights, but sometimes  with  occasional
outbursts  and	caustic	 exchanges.   In  support  of  their
respective   contentions  advanced  during  their   expanded
arguments,  they cited a long line of decisions of not	only
this  Court  and the High Courts of this  country  but	also
foreign decisions and legislations.
</p><p id="p_22">20.  Before   we  make	an  in-depth  examination   of	 the
challenges  canvassed  which are manifestly  and  pristinely
legal,	with regard to the impugned Acts and some  of  their
provisions with a comprehensive and exclusive survey, it has
become	inevitable  for	 us to give a brief  sketch  of	 the
historical background and the circumstances which forced the
legislature to enact these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">621</span>
laws, as gathered from the parliamentary debates,  Statement
of Objects and
Reasons and prefatory notes of the impugned Acts, etc., etc.
</p><p id="p_23">21.   From  the	 recent past, in many parts  of	 the  world,
terrorism  and disruption are spearheading for one reason or
another and resultantly great leaders have been assassinated
by  suicide  bombers and many dastardly	 murders  have	been
committed.  Deplorably, determined youths lured by  hardcore
criminals  and underground extremists and attracted  by	 the
ideology  of terrorism are indulging in	 committing  serious
crimes	against	 the  humanity.	 In  spite  of	the  drastic
actions	  taken	  and  intense	vigilance   activated,	 the
terrorists  and	 militants  do not  desist  from  triggering
lawlessness  if it suits their purpose.	 In short, they	 are
waging	a  domestic  war against the  sovereignty  of  their
respective  nations or against a race or community in  order
to create an embryonic imbalance and nervous disorder in the
society	 either	 on being stimulated or	 instigated  by	 the
national, transnational or    international	   hard-core
criminals  or secessionists etc.  Resultantly, the  security
and  integrity of the countries concerned are at  peril	 and
the  law and order in many countries is disrupted.   To	 say
differently, the logic of the cult of the bullet is hovering
the  globe  completely robbing off the reasons	and  rhymes.
Therefore, every country has now felt the need to strengthen
vigilance  against  the spurt in the  illegal  and  criminal
activities of the   militants  and  terrorists so  that	 the
danger	to its sovereignty is averted and the  community  is
protected.
</p><p id="p_24">22.   Thus,  terrorism	and  disruptive	 activities  are   a
worldwide   phenomenon	and  India  is	not  an	  exception.
Unfortunately in the recent past this country has fallen  in
the  firm  grip	 of spiraling terrorists'  violence  and  is
caught	between the deadly pangs of  disruptive	 activities.
As seen from the    Objects  and  Reasons of the Act  31  of
1985,  "Terrorists  had been indulging in  wanton  killings,
arson, looting of properties and other heinous crimes mostly
in  Punjab  and Chandigarh" and then  slowly  they  expanded
their  activities to other parts of the country i.e.  Delhi,
Haryana,   U.P.	 and  Rajasthan.   At  present	 they	have
outstretched  their activities by spreading their wings	 far
and wide almost bringing the major part of the country under
the   extreme  violence	 and  terrorism	 by  letting   loose
unprecedented  and  unprovoked	repression  and	  disruption
unmindful  of the security of the nation,  personal  liberty
and right, inclusive of the right to live with human dignity
of the innocent citizens of this country and destroying	 the
image of many glitzy cities like Chandigarh, Srinagar, Delhi
and Bombay by strangulating the normal life of the citizens.
Apart from many skirmishes in	   various   parts  of	 the
country, there were countless serious and horrendous  events
engulfing many cities with blood-bath, firing, looting,	 mad
killing even without sparing women and children and reducing
those  areas into a graveyard, which brutal atrocities	have
rocked and shocked the whole nation.
</p><p id="p_25">23.   Everyday,	 there	are jarring  pieces  of	 information
through electronic	 and print media that many innocent,
defenseless    people	particularly   poor,	politicians,
statesmen,  government	officials,  police  officials,	army
personnel  inclusive  of  the  jawans  belonging  to  Border
Security Force have been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">622</span>
mercilessly gunned down.  No one can deny these stark  facts
and  naked  truth  by  adopting	 an  ostrich  like  attitude
completely  ignoring the impending danger.  Whatever may  be
the reasons, indeed there is none to deny that.
</p><p id="p_26">24.  The  speeches made by the then Home Minister, the	then
Minister  of  State  for Home Affairs and  many	 Members  of
Parliament   during   the  debates  at	the  time   of	 the
introduction of the Act of 1987 and at the subsequent  stage
of   its  extension  and  modification,	 would	unfold	 the
magnitude  and seriousness of the terrorist  and  disruptive
activities  and	 their consequent dangerous  impact  on	 the
security of the nation.
</p><p id="p_27">25.  On April 8, 1988, the then Home Minister in his  speech
before the Lok Sabha stated thus:
</p><p id="p_28">	      "As  I  told  in	the  beginning,	 the  forces
			    working  to destabilize the country	 are  bein
g
	      encouraged  from outside as well as inside  of
	      the  country ... According to the	 information
	      received,	 it appears that its master mind  is
	      somewhere else and it is also inside."
</p><p id="p_29">26.  The  then	Minister of State for Home Affairs  gave  an
extensive  speech with regard to the commission	 of  heinous
crimes	on a large scale not only threatening  the  security
and  territorial integrity of the nation but also  extremely
affecting  the	normal life of the people and  stressed	 the
importance  of	the enactment of law providing	the  special
procedure and speedy trial of those offenses.
</p><p id="p_30">27.  One of the Members of Parliament (Shri Kamal Chaudhary)
expressing his view during the discussion on the Bill on the
Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act,	1987
stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	       ... Punjab is burning.  The legend goes	that
	      in the rivers of Punjab milk used to flow	 but
	      they  are now drenched with blood.   There  is
	      hatred   all  over.   What  is  a	  democratic
	      solution	for Punjab. ... How many  women	 are
	      beating  their breasts every night?   We	feel
	      the pinch only when our near and dear ones get
	      killed."
</blockquote><p id="p_31">Yet  another  Member of Parliament  (Shri  Anoopchand  Shah)
speaking on the Bill presented before the House said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "Today terrorism has not remained confined  to
	      Punjab  only.  It has rather spread  to  every
	      corner  of  the country.	The  same  terrorism
	      which exists in Punjab is making its  presence
	      felt in Delhi and Maharashtra also......
</blockquote><p id="p_32">Another	 Member	 of  Parliament (Shri  Jagan  Nath  Kaushal)
taking part in the debate on the Act of 1987 spoke thus: .
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "...  The Hon.  Members know that we  are	 not
	      dealing  with normal peaceful times.   We	 are
	      dealing	with  extraordinary   times.	Shri
	      Satyendra Narayan Singh has said that not only
	      for  Punjab  but do something for	 Bihar	also
	      because  in the garb of political	 party	etc.
	      greater terrorism is prevailing there also."
</blockquote><p id="p_33">28.  We feel that it is not necessary to swell this judgment
by  reproducing	 the entire speeches made by the  then	Home
Minister, the Minister of State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">623</span>
for  Home  Affairs  and some Members of	 Parliament  on	 the
atrocities committed by terrorists and disruptionists and on
the  necessity	of bringing the Acts (TADA)  to	 effectively
prevent	 the consequent violence.  But suffice to  give	 the
compelling reasons as shown in the Statements of Objects and
Reasons	 for  enacting	the Acts of  1985  and	Objects	 and
Reasons for enacting the Acts of 1985 and 1987 which are  to
the  effect that the terrorists and disruptionists by  their
expanded activities have created dreadful fear and panic  in
the  minds of the citizens and disrupted communal peace	 and
harmony; that their activities are on an escalation in	many
parts of the country; that it has been felt that in order to
combat	and  cope with such activities effectively,  it	 had
become necessary to take appropriate legal steps effectively
and  expeditiously  so that the alarming increase  of  these
activities  which are a matter of serious concern, could  be
prevented and severely dealt with.
</p><p id="p_34">29.  The  totality  of the speeches made by  the  Ministers,
Members	 of  the  Parliament  during  the  debates  in	 the
Parliament,  the  Statement  of	 Objects  and  Reasons,	 the
submissions  made  by  the  learned  Additional	  Solicitors
General converge to the following conclusions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      (1)   From   mid-eighties,   the	  prevailing
	      conditions  have	been  surcharged  with	 the
	      terrorism	 and  disruption  posing  a  serious
	      threat  to  the sovereignty and  integrity  of
	      India  as well as creating panic and sense  of
	      insecurity in the minds of the people.   Added
	      to that the brutality of terrorism let  loose,
	      by the secessionists and anti-nationals in the
	      highly  vulnerable area of  Indian  territory,
	      (prejudicial  to	the defence  of	 India),  is
	      causing  grave concern even about the  chances
	      of  survival  of	the  democratic	 polity	 and
	      process;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      (2)   there were also continuous commission of
	      heinous	offenses  such	as   gruesome	mass
	      killings	 of  defenseless   innocent   people
	      including	 women,	 children  and	 bystanders,
	      disturbing   the	 peace,	  tranquility	 and
	      security;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	      (3)   the existing ordinary criminal laws	 are
	      found  to be inadequate to sternly  deal	with
	      such activities perpetrated on humanity.
</blockquote><p id="p_35">30.  It was only in the above prevailing circumstances,	 the
Legislature  has  been compelled to bring forth	 these	Acts
(TADA)	to prevent and deal with the peril of  the  erupting
terrorism and the consequent potential disorder among others
disrupting  the law and order and to sternly deal with	many
groups lurking beneath the murky surface, aiding,  abetting,
nourishing and fomenting terrorism besides giving  financial
support	 and supplying sophisticated automatic	lethal	arms
and  ammunitions both from inside and outside of India.	  It
may  not  be out of place to mention that the facts  of	 the
cases appealed against and set out in the writ petitions and
SLP, if accepted in their entirety, reveal the multiple acts
of  violence  let  loose; and the  acts	 of  savage  revenge
perpetrated  against  individuals, group of persons  or	 any
particular  community  or  religious  sects  show  that	 the
violent threat which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">624</span>
has manifested itself is not evidently going to vanish	with
such  inexplicable  suddenness as would seem  to  have	been
visually presumed.
</p><p id="p_36">31.  In	 this  context, a question may arise as	 to  whether
judges	can take notice of matters of common  knowledge	 and
authenticated report.  This question has been examined by  a
Full  Bench  of	 the High Court of  Punjab  and	 Haryana  in
<a href="/doc/1555169/" id="a_66">Sukhdev	  Singh	 v.  Union  Territory,	Chandigarh</a>'.	M.M.
Punchhi,  J.  (as  he then was) speaking  for  the  majority
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	      "I   know	 that  in  order  to   sustain	 the
	      presumption   of	 constitutionality   of	   a
	      legislative  measure, the court can take	into
	      consideration  matters  of  common  knowledge,
	      matters  of common report, the history of	 the
	      times  and  also assume every state  of  facts
	      which can be conceived existing at the time of
	      the legislation."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">32.  To	 redress  all the multiple dimensions  of  crimes
whether	 of  national  or  transnational  or   international
committed by individual or group of criminals, is of  course
a  very difficult task because the crimes and  criminals  do
not  respect  frontiers and the field of  operation  of	 the
activities of the criminals know no territorial limits.
</p><p id="p_38">33.  The  Parliament, evidently, taking note of the  gravity
of   terrorism	committed  by  terrorists  either  with	  an
intention to overawe the Government as by law established or
to strike terror in the people or any section of the  people
or  to	alienate any section of the people or  to  adversely
affect the harmony amongst different sections of the  people
and the consequent widespread apparent danger to the nation,
has  felt the need of not only continuing but  also  further
strengthening the provisions of TADA Act (Act 31 of 1985) in
order  to cope with the menace of terrorism, enacted Act  28
of  1987  bringing  drastic  changes  with  regard  to	 the
admissibility  of  confessions	made  to  police   officials
prescribing   special  procedures  and	 providing   consign
punishments  etc., leave apart the question with  regard  to
the  validity  of  these  provisions to	 be  tested  on	 the
touchstone of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_39">34.  Keeping  in  view the above historical  background,  we
shall  unbiasedly  and	without	 any  preconceived   notion,
examine	 the various legal problems presented  inclusive  of
the  constitutional  validity of the three  Acts  (TADA)  in
general and of the various provisions in particular of those
Acts on the touchstone of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_40">35.  While so testing the vires of these Acts, we shall also
scrupulously  analyse the various penal and  the  procedural
provisions embodied in those Acts relating to the issues  of
definition  of certain terms, arrest,  investigation,  bail,
mode  of trial, jurisdiction of the Designated	Courts,	 the
permissible legal rights of the accused guaranteed under the
Constitution, etc., etc. in the light of the  constitutional
provisions  as well as the legal provisions of the  existing
procedural  law	 with the spectrum of experience so  far  we
have gained in the field of implementation of these impugned
Acts.

	      Legislation begins where Evil begins.
</p><p id="p_43">	      The function of the Judiciary begins when	 the
	      function of the Legislature ends,
because	 the  law is, what the judges say it  is  since	 the
power to interpret the law vests in the judges.
</p><p id="p_44">36.  Law  is made not to be broken but to be obeyed and	 the
respect for law is not retained by demonstration of strength
but   by   better  appreciation	 of  the   reasons,   better
understanding  of  its reality and implicit  obedience.	  It
goes without saying that the achievements of law in the past
are   considerable,  its  protection  in  the	present	  is
imperative and its potential for the future is immense.	  It
is very unfortunate that on account of lack of respect, lack
of understanding, lack of effectiveness, lack of vision	 and
lack  of proper application in the present day affairs,	 law
sometimes falls in crisis.
</p><p id="p_45">37.  Where all traditional law enforcement institutions	 are
under suspicious scrutiny, only rational application of	 the
functions  of  law  and	 a  thorough  understanding  of	 its
complexities  and limitations can protect the integrity	 and
survival of legal order.
</p><p id="p_46">38.  But it is certainly true that the problem has  received
a  new	intensity  and a new range as the  law	extends	 and
variegates the range of its concerns and application and  as
the interests and modes of articulation of those ministering
to the law become more and more specialised and technical.
</p><p id="p_47">39.  Needless  to stress that the life of man in  a  society
would  be  a  continuing disaster  if  not  regulated.	 The
principal means for such regulation is the law which  serves
as  the	 measure  of  a	 society's  balance  of	 order	 and
compassion and instrument of social welfare rooted in  human
rights, liberty and dignity.
</p><p id="p_48">40.  Emphasising the importance and potentiality of the law,
Lord Chancellor Sankey once remarked:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	      "Amidst the cross currents and shifting  sands
	      of public life the law is like a	 great	 ark
	      upon  which  a  man may set his  foot  and  be
	      safe."
</blockquote><p id="p_49">41.  C.G.  Weeramantry	in The Law in Crisis   Bridges	of
Understanding emphasising the importance of 'Rule of Law' in
achieving social interest has stated thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	      "The protections the citizens enjoy under	 the
	      Rule  of	Law are the quintessence  of  twenty
	      centuries	 of  human  struggle.	It  is	 not
	      commonly	realised  how easily  these  may  be
	      lost.   There is no known method of  retaining
	      them but eternal vigilance.  There is no known
	      authority to which this duty can be  delegated
	      but  the community itself.  There is no  known
	      means   of  stimulating  this  vigilance	 but
	      education	  of   the  community	towards	  an
	      enlightened interest in its legal system,	 its
	      achievements and its problems."
</blockquote><p id="p_50">42.  Harking  back to the Acts with which we are  concerned,
Act  31	 of  1985 and Act 28 of 1987 have  been	 enacted  by
Parliament as a piece of emergency legislation for a certain
length of time which period has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">626</span>
extended periodically by the Parliament on revision and they
have been extended to the whole of India and made applicable
to  citizens of India even outside India, to persons in	 the
service	 of  the Government, wherever they may	be;  and  to
persons on ships and aircraft registered in India,  wherever
they may be.
</p><p id="p_51">43.  With the above brief introduction, we shall now proceed
to deal with the submissions made by the learned counsel for
the  parties with reference to the main	 questions,  firstly
whether the Acts suffer from lack of legislative  competence
and  secondly,	whether the Acts or any	 of  the  provisions
thereof	 contravene any fundamental right specified in	Part
III of the Constitution, as well as other cognate questions.
</p><p id="p_52">44.  It	 has  been seriously contended by Mr  Balwant  Singh
Malik,	Senior Counsel that Act 28 of 1987 (TADA)  is  ultra
vires since the Central Legislature, namely, the Parliament,
lacked	legislative competence under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_67">Article 246</a>  read	with
the topics of legislation enumerated in List I (Union  List)
and  List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh	Schedule  to
the  Constitution,  to	enact  the TADA	 Act  and  that	 the
subject-matter of the impugned Acts in fact fell within	 the
legislative  field  assigned to the States under  Entry	  of
List II (State List), namely, 'Public Order' which is a most
comprehensive  term  with widest import	 encompassing  every
activity   which  leads	 to  violence  or  disturbs   public
tranquility.
</p><p id="p_53">45.  According to him, the subject-matter of the Act  (TADA)
is not referable to any of the matters enumerated in List  I
of  the Seventh Schedule and the presumptive attempt of	 the
Union  of  India to rely upon Entry 1 of List  III  for	 the
competency  of the Parliament to enact the TADA	 Act  cannot
find favour.  Entry I of List III reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	      "Criminal law, including all matters  included
	      in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_68">  the Indian Penal Code</a> at the	commencement
	      of  this Constitution but	 excluding  offenses
	      against  laws  with  respect  to	any  of	 the
	      matters  specified  in List I or List  II	 and
	      excluding	 the use of naval, military  or	 air
	      forces or any other armed forces of the  Union
	      in aid of the civil power."
</blockquote><p id="p_54">46.  According	to  him, the above entry is left  with	only
'offenses against laws' with respect to matters specified in
subsequent entries of the Concurrent List.  As the TADA	 Act
cannot	be  held to be referable to any other topic  in	 the
Concurrent List, its subject-matter could not, on that basis
be  held  to fall under Entry  of that list.   It  has	been
further submitted that the contents of the heading 'Criminal
law'  in Entry 1 of List III are derivative in'	 nature	 and
carry  no  meaning  of their own because  the  criminal	 law
comprising  'offenses against laws' are with respect to	 the
matters	 in the three lists.  He continued to urge that	 the
subject-matter	of  the	 TADA  Act  which  deals  with	 the
'security  of  the  State'  and	 'public  safety'  involving
violence  even of the highest degree tending to cause  grave
public	disorder is plainly covered under Entry	 of List  II
and  that  the individual States under Entry 64 of  List  II
alone  are competent to legislate with respect	to  offenses
against public order.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">627</span>
<p id="p_55">47. After drawing our attention to some of the laws  enacted
by  various  States with respect to  maintenance  of  public
order, such as-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	      (1)   Assam Disturbed Areas Act (19 of 1955);
	      (2)   The Punjab Security of State Act, 1949;
	      (3)   The	 Bihar Maintenance of  Public  Order
	      Act, 1949;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      (4)   The	 West Bengal (Prevention of  Violent

	      VIII of San 2005;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	      (7)   The Maharashtra Prevention of  Dangerous
	      Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers and	Drug
	      Offenders Act, 198 1;</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">	      (8)   The	 Karnataka Prevention  of  Dangerous
	      Activities  of  Bootleggers,  Drug  Offenders,
	      Goondas,	Gamblers, Immoral Traffic  and	Slum
	      Grabbers Act, 1985
it  has been said that all those laws fall within the  ambit
of  'public  order'  appearing in Entry	  of  List  II.	  Mr
Balwant Singh Malik, in support of his contention, cited the
following    decisions	 declaring   competency	   of	 the
Provinces/States of the Federation/Union to make laws  under
'public	 order':  (1)  <a href="/doc/1394213/" id="a_69">Lakhi Naravan  Das  v.	Province  of
Bihar2</a>,	 (2)  <a href="/doc/456839/" id="a_70">Romesh Thappar v. State</a> of MadraS3,  (3)	<a href="/doc/1308071/" id="a_71">Rev.
Stainislaus  v. State of M.P</a>.4 and (4) Ashok Kumar Dixit  v.
State of U. P. 5
</p><p id="p_57">48.  Though,  according	 to him, the individual	 States	 are
legislatively  competent to provide for the  maintenance  of
public	order by creating new offenses and by  taking  other
measures  within the States, if a situation with  regard  to
the maintenance of public order concerns more than one State
or the country as a whole, then it may be necessary for	 the
Parliament to step in under Articles 249, 250 and 252 of the
Constitution  (which  provisions  have,	 however,  not	been
relied	upon when enacting the TADA Act) and enact the	law.
However,  this will not justify giving any other meaning  to

List II, namely, 'Public order' read with Entry 64 and Entry
65 of that list.
</p><p id="p_58">49.  Elaborating some of the entries of List II, it has been
urged that the legislative power of the State to enact	laws
under 'Public order' is contained in Entry I of List II	 and
the  power of the State to create the  police  investigating
agency	 is under Entry 2 of List II and  the  legislative
power  to vest jurisdiction and confer powers on  courts  to
try such State offenses calls under Entry 65 of List II	 and
that  a combined reading of the excluding clause of Entry  I
of  List III and Entry 93 of List I and Entry 64 of List  II
completely exempts offenses relating to 'Public order'	from
the heading, Criminal law' under Entry I of List III.

with  List  I and List III of the Seventh  Schedule  to	 the
Constitution in regard to creating offenses, under Entry  93

</p><p id="p_60">51.  Supplementing  the above arguments, Mr Ram	 Jethmalani,
Senior	Counsel	 advanced the other facet  of  the  argument
stating	 that this Act (28 of 1987) in 'pith and  substance'
relates	 to  'Public order' as reflected from  its  preamble
itself	declaring  the	Act to be an  Act  to  make  special
provisions  for	 the  prevention  of  and  for	coping	with
terrorist   and	 disruptive  activities	 and   for   matters
connected  therewith or incidental thereto.  The  'pith	 and
substance'  of the Act, according to him, is in <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_72">Sections  3</a>,
<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_73">4</a>,  <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_74">5</a>  and <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_75">6</a> to which the rest of the  sections	 are  merely
incidental  to	or necessary for the implementation  of	 the
paramount  purpose of the statute and that if the 'pith	 and
substance'  of	the legislation is covered by  a  particular
entry, any incidental encroachment on some other entry	does
not change the character of the Act.  The amendments brought
under  Act  28	of  1987  creating  special  courts   called
Designated  Courts, prescribing new procedure and  inserting
some provisions with regard to the admission of evidence  in
trials	before	the Designated Courts,	would  justify	that
these  amendments fall within Entry 2 and Entry 12  of	List
III  whilst the Act remains as one failing under Entry I  of
List II.

information  is	 not  to be disclosed  in  public  interest,
unmistakably unfolds that the secessionists' forces  working
to  destabilize the sovereignty of India and  its  integrity
are  being encouraged by the neighboring countries and	that
there are many training camps on the borders of India  where
training is imparted to militants and terrorists not only in
the use of sophisticated and heavy weapons including  rocket
launchers,  machine  guns, mines, explosives  and  wireless,
communications but also to indulge in illicit trafficking of
narcotic   drugs,   and	  psychotropic	 substances    which
unassailable  facts  are a matter of  common  knowledge	 and
which  can  be taken into consideration by way	of  judicial
notice.	  Many	countries across the borders,  according  to
him,  are  supplying  deadly arms and  ammunitions  and	 are
providing sanctuary to the extremist elements as a base	 for
their training and doctrination.
</p><p id="p_64">55.  In	  view	 of  the  above	 outrageous   and   volcanic
circumstances and situations, in pith and substance, the Act
is  not related to 'Public order' falling under Entry  1  of
List II but relates to the 'Defence of India' falling  under
Entry  1, as well as Entries 2 and 2-A of List I  read	with
Entries 1 and 2 of List III.
</p><p id="p_65">56.  According	to  Mr Tulsi, the submissions of  the  other
side that the subject of the impugned Act falls under  Entry
1  of  List  II, namely, 'Public  order'  is  incorrect	 and
fallacious.
</p><p id="p_66">57.  We shall now carefully examine the submissions made  by
the  respective	 parties  in the light	of  the	 import	 and
intendment  of the Acts under challenge and find out  as  to
whether	 this  Act (TADA) falls under Entry 1  of  List	 II,
namely,	 'Public order' or under Entry 1 of List I,  namely,
'Defence  of India' as well as Entries 2 and 2-A of  List  I
read   with  Entries  I	 (Criminal  law)  and  2   (Criminal
procedure)  of	List  III.  But before we do  so,  we  would
briefly	 take note of the constitutional scheme relating  to
distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the
States.
</p><p id="p_67">58.  Under  clause  (1)	 of  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_81">Article  246</a>,   notwithstanding
anything in clauses (2)	 and   (3)  of	the  said   article,
Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect  to
any  of the 97 subjects enumerated in List I of the  Seventh
Schedule.   Under clause (3) of the said article, the  State
Legislatures have exclusive powers to make laws with respect
to 66 items enumerated in List II. The powers in respect  of
the 47 items enumerated in List III are concurrent i.e. both
Parliament  and	 the Legislature of any	 State,	 subject  to
clause	(1) have power to make laws.  With regard to  a	 law
made in respect of matters enumerated in the Concurrent List
provision   has	 been  made  in	 <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_82">Article  254</a>  which   gives
overriding  effect to a law made by Parliament in the  event
of  there being any repugnancy between the said law and	 the
law  made  by the Legislature of a State and the  State	 law
would  prevail	over a law made by Parliament only  if	such
State  law was enacted after the law made by Parliament	 and
has  received the assent of the President.  While  examining
the question of legislative competence of Parliament to make
a law, the proper
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">630</span>
approach  is to determine whether the subject-matter of	 the
legislation falls in the State List which Parliament  cannot
enter.
</p><p id="p_68">59.  If the law does not fall in the State List,  Parliament
would  have  the legislative competence to pass the  law  by
virtue	of the residuary powers under <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_83">Article 248</a> read	with
Entry 97 of the Union List and it would not be necessary  to
go into the question whether it falls under any entry in the
Union  List  or Concurrent List [See (i) <a href="/doc/1235907/" id="a_84">Union of  India  v.
H.S.  Dhillon10</a> (SCC at pp. 799, 803; SCR at pp. 61 and	 67-
</p><p id="p_69">68),  (ii) <a href="/doc/312939/" id="a_85">S.P. Mittal v. Union of India</a>' 1 (SCC at  p.	 82,
paras  70 and 72; SCR at pp. 769-770), and (iii)  <a href="/doc/570928/" id="a_86">Khandelwal
Metal  and Engg.  Works v. Union of India12</a> SCC at  p.	641,
para  42].  It is, therefore, necessary to  examine  whether
the Act falls within the ambit of Entry 1 read with Entry 64
of  the State List as contended by the learned	counsel	 for
the  petitioners.   But	 before	 we do	so  we	may  briefly
indicate the principles that are applied for construing	 the
entries	 in the legislative lists.  It has been	 laid.	down
that  the  entries  must not be construed in  a	 narrow	 and
pedantic  sense and that widest amplitude must be  given  to
the  language  of these entries.  Sometimes the	 entries  in
different lists or the same list may be found to overlap  or
to be in direct conflict with each other.  In that event  it
is  the	 duty of the court to find out its true	 intent	 and
purpose	 and  to examine the particular legislation  in	 its
'pith and substance' to determine whether it fits in one  or
other of the lists. [See : Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd.  v.
State of U.p.13 (SCC at pp. 150-51, para 67; SCR at p. 673);
<a href="/doc/1907642/" id="a_87">India  Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N</a>. 14 (SCC at p.  22,	para
18; SCR at p. 705)].
</p><p id="p_70">60.  This  doctrine of 'pith and substance' is applied	when
the legislative competence of a legislature with regard to a
particular  enactment  is challenged with reference  to	 the
entries	 in  the various lists i.e. a law dealing  with	 the
subject in one list is also touching on a subject in another
list.	In  such a case, what has to be ascertained  is	 the
pith  and substance of the enactment.  On a scrutiny of	 the
Act  in	 question,  if found, that  the	 legislation  is  in
substance  one	on  a matter  assigned	to  the	 legislature
enacting that statute, then that Act as a whole must be held
to  be valid notwithstanding any incidental  trenching	upon
matters	 beyond its competence i.e. on a matter included  in
the  list  belonging  to  the  other  legislature.   To	 say
differently,  incidental  encroachment	is  not	  altogether
forbidden.

Subrahmanyan Chettiar v. Muttuswami Goundan15 to the effect:
(IA at p. 43)
	      "It  must inevitably happen from time to	time
	      that  legislation	 though purporting  to	deal
	      with a subject in one list, touches also	upon
	      a	 subject in another list, and the  different
	      provisions of the enactment may be so  closely
	      intertwined that blind adherence to a strictly
	      verbal interpretation would result in a  large
	      number  of  statutes  being  declared  invalid
	      because  the  Legislature	 enacting  them	 may
	      appear  to  have	legislated  in	a  forbidden
	      sphere.  Hence the rule which has been evolved
	      by   the	Judicial  Committee,   whereby	 the
	      impugned statute is examined to ascertain	 its
	      pith  and	 substance or its  true	 nature	 and
	      character	 for  the  purpose  of	 determining
	      whether  it  is legislation  with	 respect  to
	      matters in this list or in that."
</p><p id="p_72">Thereafter, their Lordship of the Privy Council held: (IA at
p. 43)
	      "Subjects must still overlap and where they do
	      the  question must be asked what in  pith	 and
	      substance	 is the effect of the  enactment  of
	      which  complaint is made and in what  list  is
	      its true nature and character to be found.  If
	      these  questions	could  not  be	asked,	much
	      beneficent  legislation  would be	 stifled  at
	      birth,  and many of the subjects entrusted  to
	      Provincial Legislation could never effectively
	      be dealt with.
</p><p id="p_73">	      Thirdly,	the  extent of the invasion  by	 the
	      Provinces	 into  subjects	 enumerated  in	 the
	      Federal  List has to be considered.  No  doubt
	      it  is  an  important matter,  not,  as  their
	      Lordships	 think, because the validity  of  an
	      Act   can	 be  determined	 by   discriminating
	      between  degrees	of  invasion,  but  for	 the
			    purpose  of	 determining what is the  pith	an
d
	      substance of the impugned Act.  Its provisions
	      may  advance so far into federal territory  as
	      to show that its true nature is not  concerned
	      with  provincial matters, but the question  is
	      not,  has it trespassed more or less,  but  is
	      the trespass, whatever it be, such as to	show
	      that  the pith and substance of  the  impugned
	      Act is not money-lending but promissory  notes
	      or  banking? Once that question is  determined
	      the Act falls on one or the other side of	 the
	      line  and	 can  be seen as  valid	 or  invalid
	      according to its true content."

observation:

</p><p id="p_84">69.  The   above  view	gets  strengthened  from  the	very
definition  of the expression 'terrorist act' as defined  in
<a href="/doc/869743/" id="a_96">Section 2(1)(h)</a> of the Act 28 of 1987 stating that the	said
expression  "has the meaning assigned to it  in	 sub-section
(1) of <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_97">Section 3</a>" according to which the intention to commit
any offence or offenses specified therein should be for	 one
or more clearly defined objectives as expressly mentioned in
<a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_98">Section 3(1)</a> reading:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	      "3.  (1)	Whoever with intent to	overawe	 the

defined under <a href="/doc/869743/" id="a_99">Section 2(1)(d)</a> has the meaning assigned to it
in  <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_100">Section 4</a>. <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_101">Section 4(1)</a> prescribes only the	 quantum  of
punishment  for disruptive activities.	<a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_102">Section	 4(2)</a>  gives
the meaning of that expression thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	      "4.  (2) For the purposes of sub-section	(1),

	      any claim to determine whether a part of India
	      will remain within the Union."
</blockquote><p id="p_86">71.  The  above definitions, would themselves make it  clear
that  the expression "Terrorist and  Disruptive	 Activities"
deployed  in  the preamble of the Act (28 of  1987   TADA)
contemplates  the  commission of any  specified	 offence  or
offenses  with a specific intention one of which  being	 "to
overawe the Government as by law established" [vide  <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_103">Section
3(1)</a>] and "any action taken, whether by act or by speech  or
through	 any other media or in any other manner	 whatsoever,
which questions, disrupts or is intended to disrupt, whether
directly  or  indirectly, the  sovereignty  and	 territorial
integrity  of India; or which is intended to bring about  or
supports any claim, whether directly or indirectly, for	 the
cession of any part of India or the secession of any part of
India from the Union". [Vide <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_104">Section 4(2)</a>.]
</p><p id="p_87">72.  Therefore,	 the submission made by Mr  Jethmalani	that
the preamble of the Act gives a clue that the terrorist	 and
disruptive activities only mean a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">635</span>
virulent   form	 of  the  disruption  of  public  order	  is
inconceivable and unacceptable.
</p><p id="p_88">73.  In	 our  view, the impugned legislation does  not	fall
under Entry 1 of List II, namely, 'Public order'.  No  other
Entry  of  List	 II has been  invoked.	 The  impugned	Act,
therefore,  falls  within  the	legislative  competence	  of
Parliament in view of <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_105">Article 248</a> read with Entry 97 of List
I and it is not necessary to consider whether it falls under
any of the entries in List I or List III.  We are,  however,
of  the opinion that the impugned Act could fall within	 the
ambit of Entry 1 of List I, namely, 'Defence of India'.
</p><p id="p_89">74.  Mr	  Hardev  Singh	 in  his  written   arguments	also
challenged  the	 vires	of Act 61 of 1984  on  many  grounds
(about	which we shall deal separately while  examining	 the
various	 provisions  of	 TADA Act, one of  which  being	 the
legislative competence).  The learned counsel has questioned
the.legal competence of the impugned Act on the same line of
arguments as advanced by Mr Balwant Singh Malik.  In support
of his contention, he cited <a href="/doc/1733535/" id="a_106">Ram Manohar Lohia (Dr) v.  State
of  Biharl9</a>  wherein  this Court  while	 dealing  with	Rule
30(1)(b)  of the Defence of India Rules, 1962 had  explained
the  difference between 'public order', 'law and order'	 and
'security of India'.
</p><p id="p_90">75.  <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_107">In	 Act</a> 61 of 1984, the expression 'terrorist  affected

declared  as  a	 terrorist affected area  under	 <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_109">Section  3</a>.

follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	      "2.  (1)(h)  'terrorist' means  a	 person	 who
	      indulges	in wanton killing of persons  or  in
	      violence	or in the disruption of services  or

	      integrity of India."
</blockquote><p id="p_92">77.  The  above	 definition also requires more or  less	 the
intention  as  required	 under Section	3(1)  of  TADA	Act,
namely,	 Act 28 of 1987, and also the motive for  commission
of the terrorist acts is akin to that of <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_112">Section 4</a> of
19  (1966) 1 SCR 709: AIR 1966 SC 740: 1966 Cri LJ 608
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">636</span>
the  TADA  Act of 1987, i.e., one of the  motives  being  to
endanger the sovereignty and integrity of India.  In  short,
the  definition	 of  the  expressions  'terrorist  act'	 and
'disruptive  activity' under <a href="/doc/869743/" id="a_113">Section 2(1)(h)</a> and (d) of	 Act
28 of 1987 (TADA) respectively are conjointly brought  under
the  definition	 of the word 'terrorist act' in	 Act  61  of
1984.	Therefore,  the Act of 1984 also cannot be  said  to
have  contemplated only 'Public order' but envisages a	more
grave situation threatening the sovereignty and integrity of
India.
</p><p id="p_93">78.  For  all  the reasons stated above, we  hold  that	 the
contention  that the Acts 61 of 1984, 31 of 1985 and  28  of
1987 are ultra vires on the ground of suffering from lack of
legislative  competence	 and  as such the  entire  Acts	 are
liable to be struck down, is to be rejected and	 accordingly
that contention is rejected as devoid of any merit.
</p><p id="p_94">79.  The next spinal issue arises for our deepest probe, and
scrutiny  is whether the impugned Acts in general or any  of
the  provisions thereof in particular contravene  any  other
fundamental right specified in Part III of the Constitution.
All  the  learned counsel who have challenged the  vires  of
these  Acts and the provisions thereof have  advanced  their
legal arguments both topic-wise as well as with reference to
the individual provisions of the Acts.
</p><p id="p_95">80.  To begin with their polemics, it was with reference  to
the proposition of speedy trial which is the main  objective
of these Acts under challenge.	It was the submission of the
learned	 counsel that though the professed object of Act  61
of  1984 <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_114">(Special Courts Act</a>) and of TADA Acts (Acts  31  of
1985  and 28 of 1987) is for speedy trial of  the  scheduled
offenses  committed  within  the  <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_115">Terrorist  Affected  Areas
(Special  Courts)  Act</a>,	 1984 and of  the  offenses  falling
within	the  definition of "terrorist act"  and	 "disruptive
activity"  under the TADA Acts, in reality these  Acts	make
not only a drastic departure from the prevalent procedure in
respect of the trial of similar offenses in regular  courts,
but  also serious inroads in the substantive rights in	many
respects causing irreparable erosion of the independence  of
judiciary  and totally undermining both	 the  constitutional
precepts  and lex scripta (statute law).  According to	them
the  procedural provisions of those Acts under the guise  of
speedy trial violate the venerated basic principles of	fair
trial,	held dear all along, namely, that every person	will
be  presumed  innocent	till  his  guilt  is  proved  beyond
reasonable doubt, "according to the procedure established by
law".
</p><p id="p_96">81.  The procedure prescribed under these Acts does not meet
the requirements implicit in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_116">Article 21</a> of the	Constitution
because the said procedure is the antithesis of a just, fair
and  reasonable	 procedure.  Under the	guise  of  providing
speedy	trial not only the procedural safeguards  have	been
completely denied to the accused who are subjected to  trial
by Special Courts under 1984 Act or by the Designated Courts
under	the  TADA  Acts,  but  also  the  Acts	 have	been
substantially  altered	to  the prejudice  of  the  accused.
Therefore, the procedure prescribed by the Acts which  falls
foul  of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_117">Article 21</a> should be held to be arbitrary,  unfair,
oppressive  or	unreasonable.	In  support  of	 the   above
argument, they drew our attention to <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_118">Maneka Gandhi
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">637</span>
v.Union	 of  India21</a> wherein it has been held that  any	 law
which deprives a person of his life and liberty must be just
and reasonable.	 To borrow the words of Krishna Iyer, J.  in
that case (SCC p. 338, para 85) " 'procedure' in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_119">Article   21</a>
means fair, not formal procedure.  'Law' is reasonable	law,
not any enacted	    piece."
</p><p id="p_97">82.  The  preamble  of	<a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_120">Terrorist  Affected  Areas  (Special
Courts)	 Act</a>, 1984 (61 of 1984) reads that it is "<a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_121">An Act</a>  to
provide	 for  the  speedy  trial  of  certain  offenses	  in
terrorist   affected   areas  and  for	 matters   connected
therewith".   The  object of the preamble is  manifested  in
<a href="/doc/1326800/" id="a_122">Sections  3(1)</a>	and  <a href="/doc/1881149/" id="a_123">4(1)</a> of that Act  reading	 "For  the
purpose of providing for speedy trial of scheduled  offenses
committed  in  a judicial zone, the Central  Government	 may
establish,  by	notification, a Special	 Court......  Though
there  is  no  explicit manifestation  of  such	 expression,
'speedy trial' found either in the preamble or in any of the
provisions  of	the TADA Acts as in the	 <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_124">Terrorist  Affected
Areas  (Special Courts) Act</a>, 1984, the scope and  intendment
of  the various	 provisions of these TADA  Acts	 perceivably
convey that the TADA Acts also	   contemplate speedy  trial
of cases. In fact, the 'Statement of Objects and  Reasons'
of Act 31 of 1985 reading, "This is a new and overt phase of
terrorism  which  requires to be taken serious note  of	 and
dealt with     effectively and expeditiously" makes it clear
that the constitution of      Designated Courts was for	 the
speedy and expeditious trial of offenses under the  impugned
legislation.
</p><p id="p_98">     83.  Now let us examine the principle of  speedy  trial
underlying in Act 28	 of 1987 (TADA). The constitution of
one or more Designated Courts either	by    the    Central
Government  or the State Government by notification  in	 the
Official  Gazette for notified area/areas to  try  specified
cases or class or group	 of cases (vide <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_125">Section 9</a> of Act  28
of 1987); the procedure prescribed for disposal of cases  by
making	every offence punishable under the Act or  any	rule
made  thereunder  to  be a  cognizable	offence	 within	 the
meaning	 of clause (c) of <a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_126">Section 2</a> of the Code of  Criminal
Procedure  (vide  <a href="/doc/1695447/" id="a_127">Section  20</a>);	 the  dispensation  of	 the
committal proceedings [vide <a href="/doc/1619015/" id="a_128">Section 14(1)</a><a href="/doc/414351/" id="a_129">1</a>; the	 vesting  of
jurisdiction  on the Designated Courts to try  all  offenses
under the      Act  by giving precedence over the  trial  of
any  other case against the accused in any other court	(not
being a Designated Court) notwithstanding anything contained
in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_130">  the	 Code</a>  or  any other  law  (vide  <a href="/doc/273044/" id="a_131">Section  17</a>);	 the
conferment of  power   on  Designated  Courts  to  try	 the
offenses triable by them punishable with imprisonment for  a
term  not exceeding 3 years or with fine or with both  in  a
summary	 way in accordance with the procedure prescribed  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_132">

be  by applying the provisions of <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_135">Sections 263</a> to <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_136">265</a>  [vide

on  the	 Designated Courts for the purpose of trial  of	 any
offence	  [vide	 <a href="/doc/97606/" id="a_138">Section 14(3)</a>]	 and  the  empowerment	of
authority on the Designated Courts to proceed with the trial
even in the absence of accused or pleader for the

<a href="/doc/978585/" id="a_139">Section 14(5)</a>]; the right of appeal straight to the  Supreme
Court as a matter of right against any judgment, sentence or
order not being an interlocutory order [vide <a href="/doc/1326445/" id="a_140">Section  19(1)</a>]
etc.  all postulate the concept of speedy trial in  spirit
under TADA Acts.
</p><p id="p_99">Speedy Trial
</p><p id="p_100">84.  The  right	 to a speedy trial is a	 derivation  from  a
provision  of  Magna Carta.  This principle  has  also	been
incorporated into the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776
and from there into the Sixth Amendment of the	Constitution
of  United States of America which reads, "In  all  criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a  speedy
and public trial......	 It  may  be pointed  out,  in	this
connection, that there is a <a href="/doc/1726510/" id="a_141">Federal Act</a> of 1974	  called
'Speedy	 Trial	Act' establishing a set of  time-limits	 for
carrying  out	the   major   events,	e.g.,	information,
indictment,  arraignment,  in the  prosecution	of  criminal
cases.	See Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edn. p. 1400.
</p><p id="p_101">85.  The  right to a speedy trial is not only  an  important
safeguard to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration,  to
minimise anxiety and concern accompanying the accusation and
to  limit  the possibility of impairing the  ability  of  an
accused	 to  defend  himself but also there  is	 a  societal
interest  in providing a speedy trial.	This right has	been
actuated in the recent past and the courts have laid down  a
series	of  decisions opening up new vistas  of	 fundamental
rights.	 In fact, lot of cases are coming before the  courts
for quashing of proceedings on the ground of inordinate	 and
undue  delay stating that the invocation of this right	even
need not await formal indictment or charge.
</p><p id="p_102">86.  The concept of speedy trial is read into <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_142">Article 21</a>  as
an  essential  part  of the fundamental right  to  life	 and
liberty	 guaranteed  and preserved under  our  Constitution.
The  right to speedy trial begins with the actual  restraint
imposed by arrest and consequent incarceration and continues
at all stages, namely, the stage of investigation,  inquiry,
trial,	appeal and revision so that any	 possible  prejudice
that may result from impermissible and avoidable delay	from
the   time  of	the  commission	 of  the  offence  till	  it
consummates  into  a  finality, can  be	 averted.   In	this
context,  it may be noted that the constitutional  guarantee
of speedy trial is properly reflected in <a href="/doc/1645292/" id="a_143">Section 309</a> of	 the
Code of Criminal Procedure.
</p><p id="p_103">87.  This Court in Hussainara Khatoon (1) v. Home Secretary,
State of Bihar22    while  dealing  with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_144">Article 21</a>  of	 the

balancing approach by taking note of the possible prejudices
and disadvantages to be suffered by the accused by avoidable
delay  and  to determine whether the accused in	 a  criminal
proceeding  has been deprived of his right of having  speedy
trial  with unreasonable delay which could be identified  by
the factors  (1) length of delay, (2) the justification for
the  delay,  (3)  the accused's assertion of  his  right  to
speedy	trial,	and (4) prejudice caused to the	 accused  by
such delay.  However, the fact of delay is dependent on	 the
circumstances  of each case because reasons for	 delay	will
vary,  such  as	 delay in investigation on  account  of	 the
widespread  ramification of crimes and its designed  network
either nationally or internationally, the deliberate absence
of witness or witnesses, crowded dockets on the file of	 the
court etc.
</p><p id="p_111">93.  When the issue under debate is examined in the light of
the above briefly enunciated principle of speedy trial,	 the
said  principle,  expressly contemplated  in  the  <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_155">Terrorist
Affected  Areas (Special Courts) Act</a>, 1984 (61 of 1984)	 and
manifested in the two TADA Acts under various provisions  as
pointed	  out  supra,  is  evidently  incorporated  as	 the
essential   feature  of	 those	Acts.	There  can   be	  no
controversy or difference of opinion in invoking the  speedy
trial  of cases under the impugned Acts but the question  is
whether	 the  procedure	 prescribed  violates  any  of	 the
fundamental rights of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_112">94.  Yet  another argument qua the just and fair trial	read
into  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_156">Article 21</a> has been submitted firstly contending	when
there is no proclamation of emergency in operation and	when
all  the  fundamental rights conferred by Part	III  of	 the
Constitution  are  available for enforcement, the  right  to
have  a	 fair  trial cannot be whittled	 down  or  militated
against; and secondly even when a proclamation of  emergency
is  in operation, the President under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_157">Article 359(1)</a> of	 the
Constitution of India can by order declare that the right to
move any court for the enforcement of the fundamental rights
conferred  by Part III and all the proceedings in any  court
for  the enforcement of such rights, shall remain  suspended
during the period of emergency but, not the rights conferred
by Articles 20 and 21.	To put in nutshell, the	 enforcement
of the fundamental rights conferred under Articles 20 and 21
of  the	 Constitution  can be exercised	 and  enforced	even
during	emergency.   To better understand,  the	 legislative
history	 with regard to the exemption of Articles 20 and  21
from   operation  even	during	emergency  may	be   briefly
recapitulated.
</p><p id="p_113">95.  Prior  to	the enactment of  the  Constitution  (Forty-
fourth	<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_158">Amendment) Act</a>, 1978 which came into  force,  w.e.f.
June  20,,  1979,  all	the rights  conferred  by  Part	 III
including  the	rights	under Articles 20 and  21  could  be
suspended during emergency.  But the exemption was given  by
the  above  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_159">Amendment Act</a> for the reasons spelt out  in	 the
'Statement  of	Object	and  Reasons'  of  the	Forty-fourth
Amendment, which read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	      "Statement  of  Objects and  Reasons.-  Recent
	      experience  has  shown  that  the	 fundamental
	      rights,  including those of life and  liberty,
	      granted  to citizens by the  Constitution	 are
	      capable  of  being taken away by	a  transient
	      majority.	  It  is,  therefore,  necessary  to
	      provide adequate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">	      641</span>
	      safeguards  against the recurrence of  such  a
	      contingency   in the future and to  ensure  to
	      the  people themselves an effective  voice  in
	      determining the form of government under which
	      they are to live.	 This is one of the  primary
	      objects of this Bill.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	      As  a further check against the misuse of	 the
	      Emergency	 provisions and to put the right  to
	      life and liberty on a secure footing, it would
	      be  provided  that the power  to	suspend	 the
	      right to move the court for the enforcement of
	      a	 fundamental  right cannot be  exercised  in
	      respect  of the fundamental right to life	 and
	      liberty."
</blockquote><p id="p_114">To achieve the above objects, the Parliament by Forty-fourth
Amendment  Act,	 1978  substituted  the	 words	"the  rights
conferred by Part III (except Articles 20 and 21)" in clause
(1)  and  (1-A)	 of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_160">Article 359</a> for the	 words	"the  rights
conferred by Part III".
</p><p id="p_115">96.  Undeniably,  when the three Acts under  challenge	were
enacted,  there	 was  no  emergency.   Therefore,  all	 the
fundamental rights under Part III since the enactment of the
Act  of 1984 continued to be enforceable rights.  But it  is
not the contention of the parties that the Acts impugned  or
any Act similar to them should not be enacted in the absence
of proclamation of emergency.  Needless to emphasise that it
is for Parliament to enact any law without infringing any of
the   provisions   of  the  Constitution  and	within	 its
legislative  competence	 depending upon the  need  for	such
enactment.
</p><p id="p_116">97.  Now  we shall examine the key questions   (1)  whether
the procedure prescribed under the Acts of 1984 and 1987  is
the  antithesis of the just, fair and reasonable  procedure;
(2)  whether the procedural safeguards to which the  accused
is entitled to, have been completely denied to the prejudice
and  disadvantage of the accused; (3) whether the  Acts	 are
tyrannical and despotical in character and discriminatory in
application;  and (4) whether the provisions of	 these	Acts
are  violative	of  the fundamental  rights  embodied  under
Articles 14, 19 and 2 1.
</p><p id="p_117">98.  We	 shall now give a close scrutiny to all those  above
complicated questions of unrivaled complexity debated before
us  which  caused  considerable anxiety	 to  the  Court	 for
reaching  a satisfactory conclusion, under different  topics
with  reference	 to the various provisions of  the  Acts  by
carefully scanning through the legal submissions  eloquently
articulated  by	 both sides, and decide as  to	whether	 the
provisions under challenge have to read them down or to read
anything into them.
</p><p id="p_118">Definition of the word "Abet"
</p><p id="p_119">99.  It has been seriously contended that the definition  of
the  word 'abet' in <a href="/doc/1168396/" id="a_161">Section 2(1)(a)</a> of 1987 Act	 is  without
any  clarity  and  is  an instance  of	the  first  kind  of
unfairness  and	 also blissfully vague creating a  state  of
tyranny	 and this imprecise definition helps  even  innocent
persons who are totally free from any moral blameworthiness,
to  be	arrested, detained and prosecuted.   It	 is  further
stated that the word 'abet' is adequately defined in <a href="/doc/1667403/" id="a_162">Section
107</a>  of the Indian Penal Code to meet every legitimate	need
and purpose of criminal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">642</span>
law, and that the definition of the word as given in the Act
which  smacks of arbitrariness is an instance of  the  first
kind  of  unfairness within the dictum laid down  in  Maneka
Gandhi21 and deserves to be struck down as being violative of
Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_120">100.	  The	 learned   Additional	Solicitor    General
countering the above arguments	   stated that the  expanded
definition  of 'abet' is to fulfill the objects of  the	 Act
during	 the  period  when  the	 terrorists  activities	  on
escalated  scale continue unabated in any notified area	 and
in such disturbed times it is difficult for the	 prosecution
to  prove  'mens  rea'	or  'intention'	 while	proving	 the
physical   facts.   In	continuation  he  stated  that	 the
submission that the definition is vague, is unfounded as the
said definition is merely inclusive and illustrative and the
very  nature of things could not have been  exhaustive.	  He
listed	a  number  of  various provisions  of  a  number  of
enactments  wherein the proof of the element of mens rea  is
excluded, namely, (1) <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_163">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/151999671/" id="a_164">16</a> of the Prevention of

</p><p id="p_132">109. The   learned  counsel  who  critically  attacked	 the

subjected to the prescribed minimum sentence of five  years,
and, therefore, in order to remedy the patent deficiency  or

should be injected and read into it.

convicted  under <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_182">Section 9(a)</a> of the Opium Act, 1878 on	 the
allegations that the appellant was found in possession of  a
parcel	which was on opening found to contain  opium,  held:
(SCC p. 378, para 20)
	      "Knowledge  is an essential ingredient of	 the
	      offence as the word possess' connotes, in	 the
	      context	of   <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_183">Section  9</a>,   possession	with
	      knowledge.   The	legislature could  not	have
	      intended to make mere physical custody without
	      knowledge	 an  offence.	A  conviction  under
	      <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_184">Section 9(a)</a> would involve some stigma and  it
	      is  only	proper	then  to  presume  that	 the
	      legislature  intended that possession must  be
	      conscious possession."
</p><p id="p_134">111.	  On  the strength of the dictum, laid down  in	 the
above  decision,  they	submitted  that	 'mens	rea'  is  an
essential  element  in every offence and in the	 absence  of
proof  'mens rea' none can be mulcted with  any	 criminality
especially in cases where deterrent sentence is called for.
</p><p id="p_135">112. In	 support of their submission that the definition  is
very  vague, our attention was drawn to a passage  from	 the

this  is that the legislature, under certain situations	 and
circumstances,	in its wisdom may think it so important,  in
order  to prevent a particular act from being committed,  to
forbid or rule out the element of mens rea as a	 constituent
part of a crime or of adequate proof of intention or  actual
knowledge.  However, unless a statute either expressly or by
necessary implication rules out 'mens rea' in cases of	this
kind,  the  element  of 'mens rea' must	 be  read  into	 the
provisions  of	the statute.  The question is not  what	 the
word  means  but whether there are  sufficient	grounds	 for
infer-ring  that  the  Parliament intended  to	exclude	 the
general	 rule  that  mens rea is an  essential	element	 for
bringing any person under the definition of 'abet'.

is  generally  necessary  to  go behind	 the  words  of	 the

be  imported into the definition.  See (1) Brand  v.  Wood44

</p><p id="p_143">118.  But  Subba Rao, J. dissented and held thus :  (SCR  p.
</p><p id="p_144">139)
	      "...  the	 mere  fact that  the  object  of  a
	      statute is to promote welfare activities or to
	      eradicate grave social evils is in itself	 not
	      decisive	of the question whether the  element
	      of   guilty   mind  is   excluded	  from	 the
	      ingredients  of  the  offence.   It  is	also
	      necessary	 to  enquire whether  a	 statute  by
	      putting a person under strict liability  helps
	      him to assist the State in the enforcement  of
	      the  law : can he do anything to	promote	 the
	      observance of the law?  Mens rea by  necessary
	      implication  can	be excluded from  a  statute
	      only  where  it is absolutely clear  that	 the
	      implementation  of  the object  of  a  statute
	      would otherwise be defeated and its  exclusion
	      enables  those put under strict  liability  by
	      their act or omission to assist the  promotion
	      of the law.  The nature of mens rea that	will
	      be  implied in a statute creating	 an  offence
	      depends  upon  the object of the Act  and	 the
	      provisions thereof."
</p><p id="p_145">119.	  Thereafter,  a similar question arose in  Nathulal
v. State of M.p.34 as regards the  exclusion of the  element
of mens rea in the absence of any  specific  provision	  of
exclusion.  Subba Rao, J. reiterated his earlier stand taken
M.H. George36 and observed thus : (AIR p. 45)
	      "Mens  rea  is an essential  ingredient  of  a
	      criminal	offence.   Doubtless a	statute	 may
	      exclude  the element of mens rea, but it is  a
	      sound rule of construction adopted in  England
	      and  also	 accepted  in India  to	 construe  a
			    statutory  provision  creating  an	offence	 i
n
	      conformity  with	the common law	rather	than
	      against it unless the statute expressly or  by
	      necessary implication excluded mens rea.	 The
	      mere fact that the object of the statute is to
	      promote  welfare activities or to eradicate  a
	      grave social evil is by itself not decisive of
	      the  question  whether the element  of  guilty
	      mind  is excluded from the ingredients  of  an
	      offence.	 Mens rea by  necessary	 implication
	      may  be excluded from a statute only where  it
	      is absolutely clear that the implementation of
	      the  object of the statute would otherwise  be
	      defeated."

</p><p id="p_147">120. In	 this  connection,  we	would  also  like  to	make
reference  to  a judgment of Bombay High Court in  <a href="/doc/263264/" id="a_197">State  v.
Abdul  Aziz49</a>  wherein a Division Bench while  dealing	with
Section	 5  of the Imports and Exports (Control)  Act,	1947
under which the respondent (accused) was prosecuted has held
thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	      "<a href="/doc/256400/" id="a_198">Section 5</a> of the Act of 1947 by itself  makes
	      no  reference  to mens rea.  Abetment  of	 the
	      contravention of the order is coupled together
	      with   contravention   itself  in	  the	same
	      provision.  It must, therefore, be treated  as
	      standing	on the same footing.  In  our  view,
	      therefore, the offence of abetment also  would
	      not require any kind of mens rea."
	      The  above observation would be tantamount  to
	      saying that "when no mens rea is essential  in
	      the substantive offence, the same is also	 not
	      necessary in the abetment thereof'.
</blockquote><p id="p_148">121. We	 shall	now go into the question as to	whether	 the
legislature   has  imported  the  essential  ingredient	  of
criminal  offence,  i.e.,  'mens  rea'	in  the	 substantive
offenses of the Act of 1987.
</p><p id="p_149">122. True,  the provisions of the TADA Acts are framed	with
very stringent provisions,  of course, 'for  the  prevention
of, and for coping with,  terrorist	and	  disruptive
activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto".  The question may be whether effectiveness of this
instrument  would be entirely frustrated if the	 element  of
mens  rea or the element of actual knowledge on the part  of
the offender is to be injected or read into the definition.
</p><p id="p_150">123. Generally,	 it  is	 one  of  essential  principles	  of
criminal jurisprudence that a crime is not committed if	 the
mind  of  a person doing the act in question,  is  innocent.
Therefore,  to constitute a crime, the intent and  act	must
both concur.
</p><p id="p_151">124. In	 the backdrop of the above legal position, we  shall
deal  with the submissions made by the learned counsel	with
reference  to the substantive offence or offences  specified
under the main Act itself.
</p><p id="p_152">125. <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_199">In	 the  Act</a> of 1984, the word 'abet' is  not  defined.
But  the  definition  of the word 'terrorist'  in  that	 Act
requires the person indulging in the act of terrorism to  be
shown  to  have committed the terrorist act with a  view  of
committing any of the offences enumerated under clauses	 (i)
to  (iv)  of the definition of the  word  'terrorist'  given
under <a href="/doc/1848935/" id="a_200">Section 2(1)(h)</a>.	The scheduled offences i.e. <a href="/doc/1661760/" id="a_201">Sections

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">648</span>
the offence of criminal conspiracy or attempt to commit,  or
abetment of, an offence specified in this Schedule shall  be
deemed to be a schedule offence.
</p><p id="p_153">126. <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_207">Under  the	 Act</a> of 1985 also, the word  'abet'  is	 not
defined.   Nonetheless	<a href="/doc/1357123/" id="a_208">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/815983/" id="a_209">4</a> of this  Act  which
deal  with  punishments	 for  the  substantive	offences  of
terrorism  and disruption respectively make the abetment  of
both  the substantive offences also as penal offences.	 The
definition of the word 'abet' is given for the first time in
the Act of 1987 (TADA).
</p><p id="p_154">127. <a href="/doc/1326800/" id="a_210">Section 3(1)</a> which gives the meaning of the  expression
'terrorist' specifically requires the intention on the	part
of  the	 offender committing a	terrorist  act.	  Similarly,
<a href="/doc/1451604/" id="a_211">Section	 4(2)(i)</a>  and  (ii) also requires  that	 the  person
committing  the	 disruptive  act should	 be  shown  to	have
intended to do that act.  The provisions of <a href="/doc/1357123/" id="a_212">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/815983/" id="a_213">4</a>
of  the 1985 and 1987 Acts are identical.  Thus, it is	very
clear that the substantive offences require intention on the
part  of  the  person committing the terrorist	act  or	 the
disruptive act.	 The abetment of the commission of these two
offences  comes under <a href="/doc/1357123/" id="a_214">Sections 3(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1881149/" id="a_215">4(1)</a> of the  Act  of
1987.  The word 'abets' does also appear under <a href="/doc/246657/" id="a_216">Section	6(2)</a>
which deals with 'enhanced penalties'.
</p><p id="p_155">128. Therefore,	 when the substantive provisions of the	 Act
expressly  require the intention as an essential  ingredient
to constitute an offence, can it be said that the ingredient
of  intention should be excluded on the part of the  abettor
who  abets those substantive offences.	In other words,	 can
it  be	said that the abettor has  abetted  the	 substantive
offence without any guilty mind (mens rea) or without actual
knowledge  as  to  what	 would be  the	consequence  of	 his
designed act.
</p><p id="p_156">129. Now turning to the definition in question, clauses (ii)
and  (iii)  need not require any exposition since  both	 the
clauses themselves are selfexplanatory.	 As rightly  pointed
out, the definition of the word, 'abet' as given in  <a href="/doc/1118395/" id="a_217">Section
2(1)(i)</a> is with wide flexibility rather than with meticulous
specificity.   Therefore, we have to explore  its  allowable
meaning so that there may not be any uncertainty  inevitably
leading any person to much difficulty in understanding	acts
prohibited by law so that he may act accordingly.
</p><p id="p_157">130. It	 is the basic principle of legal jurisprudence	that
an  enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions	 are
not  clearly defined.  Vague laws offend  several  important
values.	 It is insisted or emphasised that laws should	give
the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity
to know what is prohibited, so that he may act	accordingly.
Vague  laws  may  trap the innocent by	not  providing	fair
warning.   Such a law impermissibly delegates  basic  policy
matters to policemen and also judges for resolution on an ad
hoc  and  subjective basis, with the  attendant	 dangers  of
arbitrary and discriminatory application.  More so uncertain
and  undefined	words deployed inevitably lead	citizens  to
"steer	far  wider  of the unlawful zone  ...  than  if	 the
boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked".
</p><p id="p_158">131. Let  us  examine clause (i) of <a href="/doc/1168396/" id="a_218">Section  2(1)(a)</a>.	This
section	 is shown to be blissfully and	impermissibly  vague
and  imprecise.	  As  rightly pointed  out  by	the  learned
counsel, even an innocent person who ingenuously and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">649</span>
undefiledly   communicates   or	  associates   without	 any
knowledge or having no reason to believe or suspect that the
person or class of persons with whom he has communicated  or
associated is engaged in assisting in any manner  terrorists
or disruptionists, can be arrested and prosecuted by abusing
or  misusing  or misapplying this definition.	In  ultimate
consummation of the proceedings, perhaps that guiltless	 and
innoxious innocent person may also be convicted.
</p><p id="p_159">132. The  counter  submission  made  by	 learned  Additional
Solicitor General justifying the exclusion of 'mens rea'  or
intention  or  knowledge  on  the part	of  the	 person	 who
communicates or associates with any person who is engaged in
assisting in any manner terrorists or disruptionists  cannot
be  countenanced  in view of the fact that  the	 substantive
offences require by express provisions the intention on	 the
part  of  the  abettor.	 The decisions relied  upon  by	 him
cannot	be  of	any  assistance	 to  support  his  plea	 for
exclusion  of  intention  in view  of  the  various  factors
inclusive  of  the  requirement of  the	 intention  for	 the
substantive offences.
</p><p id="p_160">133. Therefore, in order to remove the anomaly in the  vague
and  imprecise	definition of the word, 'abet', we  for	 the
above mentioned reasons, are of the view that the person who
is indicted of communicating or associating with any  person
or  class  of  persons who is engaged in  assisting  in	 any
manner terrorists or disruptionists should be shown to	have
actual	knowledge  or  to have reason to  believe  that	 the
person	or class of persons with whom he is charged to	have
communicated  or associated is engaged in assisting  in	 any
manner the terrorists and disruptionists.
</p><p id="p_161">134. To	  encapsulate,	 for  the  discussion	above,	 the
expressions  'communication' and 'association'	deployed  in
the  definition	 should	 be  qualified so  as  to  save	 the
definition, in the sense that "actual knowledge or reason to
believe" on the part of a person to be roped in with the aid
of that definition should be read into it instead of reading
it  down and clause (i) of the definition 2(1)(a) should  be
read  as meaning "the communication or association with	 any
person	or  class of persons with the  actual  knowledge  or
having	reason	to  believe that such  person  or  class  of
persons is engaged in assisting in any manner terrorists  or
disruptionists"	 so  that  the object and  purpose  of	that
clause may not otherwise be defeated and frustrated.

</p><p id="p_187">142. True,  the offenses arising out of the acts  enumerated
in  <a href="/doc/1357123/" id="a_244">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/815983/" id="a_245">4</a> may be similar to the offenses  falling
under  the  ordinary penal laws.  In  other  words,  various
offenses   arising  out	 of  the  terrorist  or	  disruptive
activities  may overlap some of the offenses covered by	 the
other  ordinary penal laws.  It is not in dispute  that	 the
above provisions which define the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">653</span>
expressions  'terrorist	 act'  and  'disruptive	 activities'
provide	  severe  punishment  and  also	 prescribe   minimum
sentence for some acts constituting offenses falling  within
the  two provisions.  <a href="/doc/246657/" id="a_246">Section 6</a> of the Act of 1987  provides
'Enhanced penalties' for a person who with intent to aid any
terrorist or disruptionist, contravenes any provision of, or

may   extend  to  imprisonment	for  life  and	with   fine,
notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts or the  rules
made under the respective Acts.
</p><p id="p_188">143. <a href="/doc/246657/" id="a_251">Section 6(2)</a> reads:

</blockquote><p id="p_189">144. Part  III	of the Act creates a special  machinery	 for
trying	the terrorists and disruptionists charged  with	 the
commission   of	  any  offence	under	the   Act,   namely,
constitution of Designated Courts, its jurisdiction,  power,
of  trial  with respect to other offenses  and	to  transfer
cases to regular courts, procedure to be followed etc.
</p><p id="p_190">145. As	 we have indicated above, the Act tends to  be	very
harsh  and drastic containing the stringent  provisions	 and
provides  minimum  punishments and to  some  other  offenses
enhanced penalties also.  The provisions prescribing special
procedures  aiming  at speedy disposal of  cases,  departing
from the procedures prescribed under the ordinary procedural
law  are  evidently  for  the  reasons	that  the  prevalent
ordinary  procedural law was found to be inadequate and	 not
sufficiently effective to deal with the offenders  indulging
in  terrorist and disruptive activities, secondly  that	 the
incensed  offenses are arising out of the activities of	 the
terrorists and disruptionists which disrupt or are  intended
to disrupt even the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
India or which may bring about or support any claim for	 the
cession of any part of India or the secession of any part of
India from the Union, and which create terror and a sense of
insecurity  in	the  minds  of	the  people.   Further	 the
Legislature  being  aware of the aggravated  nature  of	 the
offenses  have brought this drastic change in the  procedure
under this law so that the object of the legislation may not
be defeated and nullified.
</p><p id="p_191">146. As	 pointed out by Ahmadi, J. in <a href="/doc/905055/" id="a_252">Niranjan	Singh  Karam
Singh  Punjabi	v. Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya52</a>  the  statutes
which  impose a term of imprisonment for a  criminal  action
under that law must be strictly construed.
52  (1990) 4 SCC 76: 1991 SCC (Cri) 47
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">654</span>
In  fact, this Court in <a href="/doc/912700/" id="a_253">Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon v.  State
of Gujarat53</a> has observed as under: (SCC p. 284, para 15)
	      "<a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_254">The Act</a> is an extreme measure to be  resorted
	      to when the police cannot tackle the situation
	      under the ordinary penal law.  The  intendment
	      is to provide special machinery to combat	 the
	      growing menace of terrorism in different parts
	      of the country."
</p><p id="p_192">147.   Agreeing	 with the above view in	  Usmanbhai  case53,
Ahmadi, J. in Niranjan case52 stated thus:  (SCC p. 86, para
</p><p id="p_193">8)
	      "While  invoking a criminal statute,  such  as
	      the Act, the prosecution is duty bound to show
	      from the record of the case and the  documents
	      collected in the course of investigation	that
	      facts    emerging	  therefrom   prima    facie
	      constitute an offence within the letter of the
	      law.   When  a  statute  provides	 special  or
	      enhanced	 punishments  as  compared  to	 the
	      punishments  prescribed for  similar  offenses
	      under the ordinary penal laws of the  country,
	      a	 higher responsibility and duty is  cast  on
	      the  Judges  to make sure there  exists  prima
	      facie  evidence  for  supporting	the   charge
	      leveled by the prosecution.  Therefore, when a
	      law   visits  a  person  with  serious   penal
	      consequences  extra  care	 must  be  taken  to
	      ensure that those whom the legislature did not
	      intend  to be covered by the express  language
	      of the statute are not roped in by  stretching
	      the  language of the law.	 But that  does	 not
	      mean that the judicial officer called upon  to
	      decide  whether  or not a case for  framing  a
	      charge under the Act is made out should  adopt
	      a negative attitude.  He should frame a charge
	      if  the  prosecution shows that  the  material
	      placed  on record and the documents relied  on
	      give rise to a strong suspicion of the accused
	      having  committed	 the crime  alleged  against
	      him."
</p><p id="p_194">148.	  Therefore, having regard to the object and purpose
of the Act of 1987 as	 reflected from the preamble and the
Statement of Objects and Reasons   of	 the	Act,	 the
submission made questioning the legality and efficaciousness
of  <a href="/doc/1357123/" id="a_255">Sections  3</a> and <a href="/doc/815983/" id="a_256">4</a> on the grounds (1) and  (2)  mentioned
above  cannot be countenanced.	So far as the ground (3)  is
concerned  since we intend to deal with the  principle	laid
down  in  Anwar Ali50 with reference to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_257">Article	 14</a>  of	 the
Constitution  while  dealing  with issues of  the  class  or
classes	 of offences and 'test of equality' before  law,  in
the  later part of this judgment in detail, for the  present
we may say that the validity of these two provisions  cannot
be challenged under the third ground also as we do not	find
any  discrimination  in	 view  of  the	separate   machinery
provided  for  the  trial of the cases	under  this  Act  to
achieve the object of it.
</p><p id="p_195"><a href="/doc/208613/" id="a_258">Section 8</a> of 1987 Act
</p><p id="p_196">149. Mr V.M. Tarkunde attacks this provision which  provides
for  forfeiture of property of certain persons convicted  by
the  Designated Court of any offence punishable	 under	this
Act  or	 any  rule made	 thereunder,  contending  that	this
section is violative of Articles 21 and 14 on the grounds
53   (1988) 2 SCC 271 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 318
52   (1990) 4 SCC 76: 1991 SCC (Cri) 47
50   1952 SCR 284: AIR 1952 SC 75 : 1952 Cri LJ 5 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">655</span>
that  (1)  no  guidelines have been provided  for  when	 the
property  of  a	 convicted person should or  should  not  be
forfeited;  and (2) forfeiture to Government 'free from	 all
encumbrances'	may  amount  in	 many  cases  to   unmerited
punishment  of third parties who have no concern  whatsoever
with the offence with which the person under this  provision
has  been convicted and who have got interest  by  advancing
money on the security of the forfeited property.
</p><p id="p_197">150. This  argument  is resisted by the	 learned  Additional
Solicitor  General contending that <a href="/doc/208613/" id="a_259">Section 8</a> only vests	 the
property  or  interest of the 'terrorist' in the  State	 and
does  not  forfeit the third party's interest and  that	 the
third  party  can  always enforce  its	rights	against	 the
'terrorists'  in  respect of its interest in  the  forfeited
property according to law notwithstanding the forfeiture.
</p><p id="p_198">151. <a href="/doc/180812/" id="a_260">Section  8(1)</a> of the Act gives discretionary  power  to
the  Designated	 Court	while  awarding	 any  punishment  on
conviction  of	an offence under the Act or  any  rule	made
thereunder, to pass an order in writing, declaring that	 any
property whether movable or immovable or both, specified  in
the  order  belonging to the convicted person,	shall  stand
forfeited to the Government free from all encumbrances.
</p><p id="p_199">152. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/208613/" id="a_261">Section 8</a> states that it is open  to
the Designated Court trying an accused for any offence under
the  Act  or  any  rule made thereunder	 to  pass  an  order
attaching  all	or any of the properties  belonging  to	 the
accused during the period of his trial and in case the trial
ends in conviction, the property will stand forfeited to the
Government free from all encumbrances.
</p><p id="p_200">153. Sub-section  (3)(a),  (b) and (c) of  <a href="/doc/208613/" id="a_262">Section  8</a>  gives
discretionary  authority to the Designated Court  to  attach
the property of an absconding accused and also the power  to
the Designated Court to apply <a href="/doc/886456/" id="a_263">Sections 83</a> to <a href="/doc/82192/" id="a_264">85</a> of the	Code
of   Criminal  Procedure  to  such  attachment	as  if	 the
attachment was made under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_265"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure.
</p><p id="p_201">154. <a href="/doc/1530896/" id="a_266">Section  82</a>  of  the Code deals  with  proclamation  of
persons	 absconding.   <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_267">Section 83</a> deals with  attachment  of
property  of persons absconding.  <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_268">Section 84</a> deals with	 the
claims	and  objections to attachment.	Sub-section  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_269">Section	 84</a> envisages that if any claim is preferred to,  or
objection  made to the attachment of, any property  attached
under  <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_270">Section 83</a>, within six months from the date  of	such
attachment,  by any person other than the proclaimed  person
on the ground that the claimant or objector has an  interest
in  such  property and that such interest is not  liable  to
attachment under <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_271">Section 83</a>, the claim or objection shall be
inquired into, and may be allowed in whole or in part.
</p><p id="p_202">155. We	 are not very much concerned about sub-sections	 (3)
and (4) of Section 8 of the TADA Act but only with regard to
sub-sections (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/208613/" id="a_272">Section 8</a>.
</p><p id="p_203">156. The  discretionary power given to the Designated  Court
under  <a href="/doc/180812/" id="a_273">Section 8(1)</a> and (2) is to be exercised under  strict
contingencies,	namely	that (1) there must be an  order  of
forfeiture and that order must be in writing; (2)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">656</span>
the property either movable or immovable or both must belong
to the accused convicted of any offence of TADA Act or	rule
thereunder;  (3)  the property should be  specified  in	 the
order; (4) even though attachment can be made under  <a href="/doc/512599/" id="a_274">Section
8(2)</a>  during  the trial of the case, the forfeiture  can  be
ordered only in case of conviction and not otherwise.
</p><p id="p_204">157. The  very	fact  that the order should  be	 in  writing
implies that the Designated Court must give reasons for such
an  order  even	 though the section  does  not	specifically
require	 the Designated Court to record its reasons  for  so
doing,	because	 the  word 'order'  even  according  to	 the
lexicon meaning is that it is a decision or direction either
interlocutory  or preliminary or final by the  court  trying
the  offence.	Secondly, under <a href="/doc/619404/" id="a_275">Section 19</a> of  the  Act,  an
appeal	lies  straight to the Supreme Court as a  matter  of
right  from any order not being interlocutory order both  on
facts and law.
</p><p id="p_205">For  the above reasons, this contention fails. <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_276">Section 9</a>  of
Act of 1987
</p><p id="p_206">158. The  validity  of this section, which  deals  with	 the
constitution of one or more Designated Courts for such	area
or  areas,  or	for such case or class	or  group  of  cases
specified   in	the  notification  issued  by  the   Central
Government or a State Government, is assailed firstly on the
ground	that  it is violative of Entry 65, List	 II  of	 the
Seventh	 Schedule  and	Articles 233, 234  and	235  of	 the
Constitution, and secondly that sub-section (7) of <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_277">Section 9</a>
is  opposed  to	 the principle of fair	trial  enshrined  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_278">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_207">159. We	 shall now deal with the first contention.  We	have
elaborately  discussed about the legislative  competence  of
the  Parliament	 in legislating this law  and  rendered	 our
finding	 that the Parliament is competent to enact  the	 law
(TADA)	under  residuary  power under  <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_279">Article	248</a>  of	 the
Constitution read with Entry 97 of List I as well as Entry 1
of List I, namely, 'Defence of India' but not under Entry  1
of  List  II, namely, 'Public order'.  Entry 95	 of  List  I
reads  "Jurisdiction  and powers of all courts,	 except	 the
Supreme	 Court, with respect to any of the matters  in	this
List;......
</p><p id="p_208">160. As we have now found this impugned Act is enacted under
Entry 1 of List I, the constitution of the Designated Courts
by the Central Government cannot be said to be in  violation
of  Entry 65 of List II which empower the State	 Legislature
to constitute the courts.  Under <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_280">Section 9</a> of the Act,	both
the  Central  Government  and  the  State  Governments	 are
authorised  to constitute Designated Courts by	notification
under  sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_281">Section 9</a>. It is made	 clear	that
the  courts  constituted by the	 Central  Government  either
before	or after the issue of the notification	constituting
the  Designated	 Courts by the State Government	 shall	have
jurisdiction  to try any offence committed in that  area  or
areas  and  the Designated Courts constituted by  the  State
Government  shall  not	have any  jurisdiction	to  try	 any
offence committed in that area or areas.
</p><p id="p_209">161. In	 addition, sub-section (3) of the  impugned  section
states that where any question arises as to the jurisdiction
of  any Designated Court, the decision taken by the  Central
Government in that regard will be final.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">657</span>
<p id="p_210">162. For  the foregoing discussion, we see no  substance  in
the contention that <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_282">Section 9</a> is violative of Entry 65, List
II of the Seventh Schedule and Articles 233, 234 and 235  of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_211">163. Now let us proceed to consider the second attack on the
validity of sub-section (7) of <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_283">Section 9</a>.
</p><p id="p_212">164. Under  <a href="/doc/1694368/" id="a_284">Section 9(1)</a>, the Central Government or a  State
Government may constitute one or more Designated Courts	 for
such  area or areas, or for such case or class or  group  of
cases as may be specified in the notification.	 Sub-section
(2)  of	 the  section deals with  the  jurisdiction  of	 the
Designated  Court constituted by the Central Government	 and
the  preferential  jurisdiction	 of  the  Designated   Court
constituted  by	 the Central Government qua  the  Designated
Court  constituted by a State Government.   Sub-section	 (3)
deals  with  the  decision  to	be  taken  by  the   Central
Government  in	case of any question of	 dispute  whatsoever
with  regard to the jurisdiction of any Designated Court  as
earlier pointed out.  Sub-sections (4) and (5) speak of	 the
appointment  of	 Judges to the Designated Court	 while	sub-
section	 (6) speaks of the qualification of the Judge to  be
appointed.
</p><p id="p_213">165. Sub-section  (7)  of  <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_285">Section 9</a>  which  speaks  of	 the
continuance of the service of the Judge is challenged on the
ground that the continuance of a Judge of a Designated Court
even  after  attainment of the age of  superannuation  is  a
regressive  provision  because a Judge who is  permitted  to
hold  the office, hitherto held, after	superannuation	will
not  be having his judicial independence; but on  the  other
hand  his,  holding  the  office  on  the  pleasure  of	 the
executive,  will  be subversive since there  is	 nothing  to
prevent	 the executive from terminating his  appointment  as
and  when it likes.  This legal sanction of  continuance  in
the  service,  according to the learned	 counsel,  will	 not
serve  the  purpose of just and fair trial and it  would  be
violating  the	principle  enshrined  in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_286">Article  21.</a>	 For
sustaining  the	 above submission, reliance  was  placed  on
Special Courts Bill, 1978, In re54.
</p><p id="p_214">166. In that case, reference was made by the President under
<a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_287">Article 143(1)</a> of the Constitution for consideration of	 the
question whether the Special Courts Bill, 1978 or any of its
provisions  if	enacted would be  constitutionally  invalid.
Clause	(7) of the Bill provided that a Special Court  shall
be presided over by a sitting Judge of a High Court in India
or  a  person who has held the office as a Judge in  a	High
Court  in India and nominated by the Central  Government  in
consultation  with  the Chief Justice of India. (As  we	 are
concerned  only	 with the question of the continuance  of  a
Judge  holding	the  office even on  attaining	the  age  of
superannuation,	 we  are  not  concerned  about	 the   other
provisions or clauses of the Special Courts Bill.)
</p><p id="p_215">167. Chandrachud,  C.J. speaking for the  majority  answered
this question holding thus: (SCC p. 435, para 96)
	      "We are, therefore, of the opinion that clause
	      (7)  of  the Bill violates <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_288">Article 21</a>  of	 the
	      Constitution  to the extent that a person	 who
	      has held
	      54    (1979) 1 SCC 380: (1979) 2 SCR 476
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">	      658</span>
	      office  as  a Judge of the High Court  can  be
	      appointed	 to  preside over a  Special  Court,
	      merely in consultation with the Chief  Justice
	      of India."
</p><p id="p_216">On carefully going through the decision, we are of the	view
that the observation of this Court with reference to  clause
(7) of the Special Courts Bill cannot be strictly applied to
the situation of the continuance of a Judge of a  Designated
Court under <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_289">Section 9(7)</a> for the reason that the person	 who
was   to   be  nominated  by  the  Central   Government	  in
consultation  with the Chief Justice of India  under  clause
(7) of the Special Courts Bill was a person who had held the
office	as  a Judge of the High Court, that is	to  say	 the
appointment  was after the retirement.	But in	the  present
Act,  the Judge is permitted to continue the  same  judicial
service as a Judge or Additional Judge, as the case may	 be,
on  the attainment of superannuation.  In other	 words.	 the
Judge  on the attainment of the age of	superannuation	does
not retire.
</p><p id="p_217">168. Therefore,	 we  see  no force  in	the  above  argument
challenging  the constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_290">Section 9(7)</a>  by
availing  the observation in Special Courts Bill,  In  re54.
However,   we  would  like  to	suggest	 that  the   Central
Government   and  the  State  Government  at  the  time	  of
appointing a Judge or an Additional Judge to the  Designated
Court with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the	High
Court concerned should keep in mind that the Judge designate
has  sufficient tenure of service even at the initial  stage
of  appointment, so that no one may entertain any  grievance
for  continuance  of service of a Judge	 of  the  Designated
Court  after  attainment of superannuation.   Hence  <a href="/doc/447813/" id="a_291">Section
9(7)</a> does not offend any constitutional provision.
<a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_292">Section 11(2)</a> of 1987Act
</p><p id="p_218">169. A	serious	 argument has been advanced  in	 respect  of
<a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_293">Section 11(2)</a> of the 1987 Act (TADA) which provides for	 the
transfer of any case pending before one Designated Court  in
a  State to any other Designated Court within that State  or
to any other Designated Court in any other State.
</p><p id="p_219">170. According	to Mr V.M. Tarkunde, unless it is read	into
<a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_294">Section	 11(2)</a>	that  a transfer will  be  made	 only  after
hearing the accused, the provision would be contrary to	 the
rule of natural justice and <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_295">Section 11(2)</a> would be violative
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_296">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  He further contends that
an  order, giving concurrence under <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_297">Section 11(2)</a> should  be
held  to  be  judicial	in character.	In  support  of	 his
argument,  he  relied upon the decision in <a href="/doc/639803/" id="a_298">A.K.	 Kraipak  v.
Union  of India55</a> and stated that the principle	 of  natural
justice,  the purpose of which is to prevent miscarriage  of
justice,  applies  not only to judicial	 and  quasi-judicial
order but also to administrative order.	 Reference was	also
made to (1) K. (H.) (An Infant), In re56 (LR at p. 630), and
(2) <a href="/doc/1455346/" id="a_299">State of Orissa v. Dr (Miss) Binapani Dei57</a>.</p>
<p id="p_220">54   (1979) 1 SCC 380: (1979) 2 SCR 476

56   (1967) 2 QB 617 : (1967) 1 All ER 226
57    (1967) 2 SCR 625 : AIR 1967 SC 1269
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">659</span>
</p><p id="p_221">171. During  the course of the argument, Mr Tarkunde  stated
that even if, on consent of the accused, the concurrence  is
given,	it  would  be a quasijudicial  order  and  that	 the
authority  to  transfer	 a case by way	of  a  motion  under
<a href="/doc/664789/" id="a_300">Section 406</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure vested on	 the
Supreme	 Court	is not taken away by the provision  of	this
Act.   He  asserted  that the accused  should  be  given  an
opportunity  for  making his objection, if any,	 before	 any
order  is  passed.  He further stated that  when  cases	 are
transferred  en masse from one Designated Court	 to  another
Designated Court, he will not have any objection, but if the
concurrence  is sought to be obtained in an individual or  a
particular  case,  then the person, to be affected  by	such
transfer  must	be afforded an opportunity of  being  heard;
that if the Government seeks the concurrence to transfer  on
the  request  of  the accused, then there  may	not  be	 any
necessity  of  issuing	notice to the accused  and  that  it
depends	 upon  the  exigencies	of  every  particular  case.
Lastly Mr Tarkunde in support of his plea drew our attention
to paragraph 34 of the judgment rendered by a Full Bench  of
the  Punjab  &amp; Haryana High Court in <a href="/doc/1076942/" id="a_301">Bimal  Kaur  Khalsa  v.
Union  of India58</a> (AIR at p. 102) wherein it is stated	that
the  "learned counsel for the Union of India, conceded	that
the  accused  would be entitled to have his say	 before	 the
Chief  Justice of India before the latter gives his  consent
to the transfer of the case".
</p><p id="p_222">172. Mr	 Hardev Singh also made his submission in  the	same
line  Challenging  the constitutional  validity	 of  <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_302">Section
11(2)</a>.
</p><p id="p_223">173. In opposition the learned Additional Solicitor  General
argued that since the provision presupposes the existence of
a notification with regard to any area having been  declared
as  'terrorist	affected  area' or 'disturbed  area'  it  is
imperative  that  fair	trial within  that  area  would	 not
normally  be feasible and that, therefore,  the	 Legislature
having	regard	to such prevailing explosive  situation	 has
provided  for a liberal procedure for transfer of  cases  so
that  a	 fair  and  just  trial	 is  held  in  an  uncharged
atmosphere.   However, he Legislature has  incorporated	 the
safeguard of obtaining the concurrence of the Chief  Justice
of India as a condition precedent to such transfers and	 hat
when  such  a safeguard is incorporated, it cannot  be	said
that  a transfer without hearing the accused is bad in	law.
He  has	 urged	that the Parliament is	fully  empowered  to
exclude the invocation of the rule of natural justice  under
certain	 extraordinary circumstances, having regard  to	 the
fact  that  the entertainment of any  objection	 would	only
frustrate the proceeding and paralyse the meaningful purpose
of the provision.  Reliance was placed by he learned ASG  on
Tulsiram  Patel59  in which D.P. Madon, J. speaking  for  he
majority  of the Constitution Bench has observed thus:	(SCC
p. 479, para 101)
	      "[I]t  is well established that where a  right
	      to  a  prior notice and an opportunity  to  be
	      heard before an order is passed would obstruct
	      the taking of prompt action, such a right	 can
	      be excluded.  This right can also

	      scheme  of the relevant  statutory  provisions
	      warrant  its  exclusion;	nor  can  the	audi

	      administrative  process or where the need	 for
	      promptitude or the urgency of taking action so
	      demands."
</p><p id="p_224">In  addition, he drew our attention to the decisions in	 (1)
<a href="/doc/347856/" id="a_304">Satya Vir Singh v. Union</a> of India6O, and (2) <a href="/doc/98853113/" id="a_305">C.B. Gautam  v.

</p><p id="p_225">174. Coming  to	 the  other aspect of  the  argument  of  Mr
Tarkunde  with	reference  to <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_306">Section 406</a> of  the  Code	 the
learned Additional Solicitor General relied upon Section  25
of  TADA Act which deals with the overriding effect  of	 the
provisions of the Act notwithstanding anything	inconsistent
therewith  contained in any other enactment other  than	 the
TADA  Act.  He further stated that the dictum laid  down  in
A.K. Kraipak55 is not at all applicable to the present	case
because	 that was the case where the hearing of the  accused
was  excluded  by the Act either expressly or  by  necessary
implication.
</p><p id="p_226">175. The  above	 controversial	debate	involves   important
questions  namely (1) what is the nature of the	 order,	 the
Chief  Justice of India passes on the motion moved  in	that

opportunity  of being heard before the concurrence is  given

</p><p id="p_229">178. Sub-section  (3)  of <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_309">Section 11</a>  requires	the  Central
Government  to specify a Designated Court outside the  State
by  issuing a notification in the Official Gazette with	 the

</p><p id="p_230">179. The  authority  to give concurrence is vested  upon  an
independent  judicial authority who is none other  than	 the
head  of  judiciary in India, namely, the Chief	 Justice  of
India as a persona designate.  The vesting of this power  in
the Chief Justice of India is evidently with the purpose  of
making	it known that the Central Government is not  seeking
to  obtain the concurrence either with a motivation of	bias
or  mala  fide	or on being  influenced	 by  any  extraneous
consideration,	but on a reasonable and	 justifiable  ground
taking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">662</span>
into  consideration the prerequisite  essential	 conditions,
those being  (1) that the situation prevailing in the State
from  which  a	case under <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_310">Section 11(2)</a>  is  sought  to  be
transferred to some other Designated Court is not  conducive

in  the	 interests  of justice.	 Under	sub-section  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/49110319/" id="a_311">Section	 11</a> the Central Government is empowered to seek	 the
concurrence   of  Chief	 Justice  of  India  to	 specify   a

</p><p id="p_231">180. No doubt, it is true that there are specific provisions
already	 in vogue under the Constitution and  some  statutes
for transfer of cases and appeals from one court subordinate
to the transferring court to another court.
</p><p id="p_232">181. Under <a href="/doc/333273/" id="a_312">Article 139-A</a> of the Constitution of India either
the  Attorney  General of India or a party to any  case	 can
move  the  Supreme Court on an application for	transfer  of
certain	 cases as contemplated in that article.	 Of  course,
the  Supreme Court also on its own motion may  withdraw	 the
case  or  cases pending before the High Court  or  the	High
Courts and dispose of all the cases itself.
</p><p id="p_233">182. For transfer of criminal cases under <a href="/doc/664789/" id="a_313">Section 406</a> of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, the Attorney General of India or
a  party  interested  may move an application by  way  of  a
motion	(unlike	 <a href="/doc/940928/" id="a_314">Section 407</a> of the Code) accompanied  by  a
supporting affidavit or affirmation before the Supreme Court
to transfer cases and appeals from one High Court to another
High Court or from a criminal court subordinate to one	High
Court  to  another  criminal  court  of	 equal	or  superior
jurisdiction subordinate to another High Court.
</p><p id="p_234">183. Under  Section 24 of the Code of Civil  Procedure,	 the
High Court and the District Court are given general power of
transfer and withdrawal of cases either on an application of
any of the parties after issuing notice and hearing them  or
on  their  own	motion.	 Section 25 of	the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure  empowers the Supreme Court to transfer any  suit,
appeal	and  other proceedings from a High  Court  or  civil
court  in one State to a High Court or other civil court  in
any  other  State on the application of a  party  and  after
issuing notice and hearing them.
</p><p id="p_235">184. The  new  Section	25  of	the  Civil  Procedure	Code
substituted  by an <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_315">Amendment Act</a>, 104 of 1976  provides	 for
the  transfer  to  the	Supreme	 Court	the  existing  power

the Supreme Court such wide powers of transfer as it has  in
criminal  cases under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_316">Section 406</a> of the Code.	<a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_317">Section	 25</a>,

provision  in  <a href="/doc/333273/" id="a_319">Article	139-A</a> of  the  Constitution  and  in
<a href="/doc/664789/" id="a_320">Section 406</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the  effect
that  the  Supreme  Court before passing any  order  on	 the
application made or moved for transfer of

cases  should issue notice and hear the parties as  required
under Sections 24 and 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure,  on
the  principle of 'audi alteram partem', notice is given  to
the party/parties who are likely to be affected by any final
order.	But the question of issuing a notice and hearing the
parties may not arise if the order is passed by the  Supreme
Court suo motu.
</p><p id="p_236">185. Harking back to <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_321">Section 11(2)</a> and (3) of TADA Act,	 the
concurrence  of	 the Chief Justice is sought  for  when	 the
exigencies  of the situation prevailing in the State is	 not
conducive to a fair, impartial or speedy trial.	 The reasons
for seeking such concurrence, of course, will be  manifested
in the motion moved by the law officers.  The Chief  Justice
of India, while discharging his statutory function passes  a
statutory  order  and gives or refuses	the  concurrence  on
drawing	  his  requisite  subjective  satisfaction  on	 the
materials placed before him in the motion.
</p><p id="p_237">186. It	 may  be  added, in this context  that	the  Central
Government  cannot transfer any case under <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_322">Section 11(2)</a>  or
issue  a notification under <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_323">Section 11(3)</a> in case the  Chief
Justice	  refuses   to	give  the   concurrence.    To	 say
differently, to pass an order either under <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_324">Section 11(2)</a>  or
11(3)  the  concurrence of the Chief Justice is a  sine	 qua
non.  But at the same time one should be alive to the  legal
position that the mere according of concurrence by itself is
not an order of transfer but it only facilitates the Central
Government  to	pass  an order under  either  of  the  above
provisions.  In other words, the obtaining of concurrence of
the  Chief  Justice  of	 India	is  one	 of  the   specified
conditions to be fulfilled or complied with before any order
either	under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of  <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_325">Section
11</a>  is passed by the Central Government.  The  according  of
the  concurrence  though  imperative  does  not	 compel	 the
Government  to pass any order if, for any other	 intervening
causes,	 the  Central Government even  after  obtaining	 the
concurrence   decides	that  there  is	 no   necessity	  of
transferring  any case.	 In that situation  the	 concurrence
will   have   no  effect.   Therefore,	the   according	  of
concurrence  which is a condition precedent for passing	 the
transfer  order by the Government is only a statutory  order
and not a judicial order because there is no adjudication of
any  'lis' and determination of any issue.  Hence the  final
order  passed  by  the Government may be  open	to  judicial
review	but  not the concurrence accorded which	 is  only  a
statutory  condition  to  be satisfied	before	passing	 the
transfer order by the Central Government.

V.  Cain62.  In that case, the appellant was charged for  an

of  the case and to decide whether any, and, if	 he  thought
fit,  which of the provisions of the Act could	properly  be
pursued	 against the defendant who had been  charged  before
the  Magistrate with one such offence.	See also Gouriet  v.

</p><p id="p_240">188. The  contention  of  Mr Tarkunde is  that	the  accused
concerned  who	is likely to be affected by  such  transfer,
should be given an opportunity of making his  representation
in  compliance with the principle of natural justice by	 the
Chief Justice of India before be gives his concurrence.
</p><p id="p_241">189. The learned Additional Solicitor General contended that
the Parliament is fully empowered to exclude the application
of the rule of 'audi alteram partem' when the nature of	 the
action	to be taken, the object and purpose as well  as	 the
scheme of the relevant statutory provisions are likely to be
paralysed or frustrated.  According to him, the	 concurrence
of the Chief Justice of India is sought to be obtained	only
having regard to the exigencies of the situation  prevailing
in  a State which are not conducive to a fair, impartial  or
speedy trial.
</p><p id="p_242">190. As	 we have repeatedly pointed out, the concurrence  by
the  Chief Justice of India under <a href="/doc/633251/" id="a_328">Section 11(2)</a> and  (3)  is
given  or denied in the discharge of his statutory  function
on  drawing  the requisite subjective  satisfaction  on	 the
reasons	 given in the motion or any material  placed  before
him explaining the exigencies of the situation prevailing in
the  State which has necessitated the Central Government  to
obtain	 the  concurrence  and	then  transfer	 the   case.
Therefore,  we	feel that notwithstanding the power  of	 the
Parliament  to	exclude	 the application of  rule  of  'audi
alteram partem' in exceptional circumstances, it may be open
to the Chief Justice of India in an appropriate case to have
the view of the accused.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">665</span>
</p><p id="p_246">193.	  Mr  Ram Jethmalani made a scathing attack on	this
provision  contending that this provision is  atrocious	 and
totally	 subversive  of	 any   civilized  trial	 system	 and
overrides  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_332">Sections  25</a>	 and  <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_333">26</a> of  the  Evidence  Act	 and

According to him when the existing Codes of Law which have a
life  history of more than a century proceed on the  footing
that  police confessions are untrustworthy, a fortiori,	 the
confessions  recorded  on mechanical devices  are  certainly
inferior  to  confessions recorded by  Magistrates  in	open
courts with all the   precautions prescribed by the statute,
High Court rules and judicial decisions.  There will be many
infirmities  in	 such  recording  of  confessions  such	  as
selective  recordings, tampering, tailoring and editing	 and
the confessions so recorded on mechanical devices are not as
reliable as written confessions and signed by the makers  of
those	confessions.   Therefore,  he  contends	 that	this
provision  should be held to be unjust and unreasonable	 and
bad   in  law  under  both  Articles  14  and  21   of	 the
Constitution.	In  this connection, he	 made  reference  to
<a href="/doc/376833/" id="a_336">Section	 21(1)(c)</a>  as per which a confession made by  a	 co-
accused	 that  the  accused has committed  the	offence,  if
proved, a presumption shall be drawn by the Designated Court
that  the  accused  has committed such	offence	 unless	 the
contrary  is  proved.	This provision,	 according  to	him,
totally subverts <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_337">Section 30</a> of the Evidence Act and that the
confession  by the co-accused is not evidence as defined  in
the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_338">Evidence  Act</a>.   Two decisions were  cited	 by  him  to
strengthen  his submission, firstly, <a href="/doc/299175/" id="a_339">Bhuboni Sahu v.  King64</a>
wherein	  the  Privy  Council  after  having  approved	 the
observation of Reilly, J. in Periyaswami Mooppan, Re65	(ILR
at  p. 77) that Al where there is evidence against  the	 co-
accused sufficient, if believed, to support his	 conviction,
then  the kind of confession described in <a href="/doc/206811/" id="a_340">Section 30</a> may  be
thrown into the scale as an additional reason for  believing
that  evidence"	 has held that "... a confession  of  a	 co-
accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type.  It	does
not   indeed  come  within  the	 definition  of	  'evidence'
contained  in  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_341">Section	3</a> of the Evidence Act.	 It  is	 not
required  to  be given on oath, nor in the presence  of	 the

</p><p id="p_251">198.   The learned Additional Solicitor General strains	 his
every  nerve  to overthrow the above  argument	articulating
that  the  constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/1189372/" id="a_357">Section 15</a>  is  to  be
determined on the basis of the competence of the  Parliament
to  vary the procedure which is just and fair in  the  facts
and  circumstances of the situation with which	the  statute
tends to grapple and not  on the touchstone of the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_358">Evidence
Act</a>.  This section, according to him, contains a significant
safeguard  by vesting the power of recording  confession  in
superior  police officer in order to prevent any  misuse  or
abuse  which  safeguard has been approved by this  Court  in
Gurbachan Singh v. State of Bombay75 (SCR at p. 743) wherein
it has been held that a law which contains an  extraordinary
procedure can be made to meet the exceptional  circumstances
otherwise  the	purpose	 and  object of	 the  Act  would  be
defeated.
</p><p id="p_252">199.  Coming  to the intrinsic value to be attached  to	 the
evidence, it has    been   said	 by   Additional   Solicitor
General	 that this section does not lay down  the  probative
value of the confession nor does it indicate that conviction
can  be	 based	on  confession alone made  before  a  police
officer. He continues to state	that the probative value  of
the  confessions  is left to the court to be  determined  in
each  case on its own facts and circumstances. Then he	drew
our  attention	to certain provisions in  various  statutes
empowering  the	 officers  specified therein  to  secure  or
arrest	the  offenders and to record  statements  from	them
which  statements are held to be admissible in	evidence  in
criminal   proceeding	as   against   them   by    judicial
pronouncements of the	 various High Courts and this Court.
Those being  (1) <a href="/doc/328541/" id="a_359">Section 12</a> of the     Railway	 Protection

</p><p id="p_262">204.   Before  proceeding  further, we may  point  out	that
<a href="/doc/1786141/" id="a_371">Section 21(1)(c)</a> in respect of which some argument has	been
advanced  is  omitted  along with <a href="/doc/1786141/" id="a_372">Section  21(1)(d)</a>  by	 the
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_373">Amendment Act</a> 43 of 1993.
</p><p id="p_263">205. In	 our Constitution as well as procedural law and	 law
of  Evidence,  there are certain guarantees  protecting	 the
right  and liberty of a person in a criminal proceeding	 and
safeguards  in	making	use of any statement  made  by	him.
<a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_374">Article	 20(3)</a> of the Constitution declares that "No  person
accused of     any  offence  shall  be	compelled  to  be  a
witness against himself'.
</p><p id="p_264">206. <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_375">Article   20(3)</a>  of  our  Constitution   embodies	 the
principle   of	protection  against  compulsion	  of   self-
incrimination which is one of the fundamental canons of	 the
British System of Criminal Jurisprudence and which has	been
adopted	 by  the  American System and  incorporated  in	 the
<a href="/doc/1726510/" id="a_376">Federal	 Act</a>s.	The Fifth Amendment of the  Constitution  of
the  United States of America provides, "No person shall  be
held  to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous  crime,
unless	on  a  presentment or indictment of  a	Grand  Jury,
except	in  cases arising... nor shall be compelled  in	 any
criminal case to be a witness against himself......
</p><p id="p_265">207. The  above	 principle is recognised  to  a	 substantial
extent	in  the criminal administration of  justice  in	 our
country	 by  incorporating various    statutory	 provisions.
One of the components of the guarantee contained in  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_377">Article
20(3)</a> of the Constitution is that it is a protection against
compulsion  resulting in the accused of any  offence  giving
evidence against himself.  There are a number of outstanding
decisions  of  this Court in explaining	 the  intendment  of
<a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_378">Article	 20(3).</a>	  We  feel that it  would  suffice  if	mere

Code</a>  of Criminal Procedure, <a href="/doc/357596/" id="a_386">Section 161</a> empowers  a  police
officer making an investigation to examine orally any person
supposed  to be acquainted with the facts and  circumstances
of the case and to reduce into writing any statement made to
him  in the course of such examination.	 <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_387">Section  162</a>  which
speaks of the use of the statement so recorded, states	that
no  statement recorded by a police officer, if reduced	into

statement shall not be used for any purpose save as provided
in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_388"> the Code</a> and the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_389">Evidence Act</a>.  The ban

confessional  or otherwise, made to a police officer by	 any
person	whether	 accused  or not during the  course  of	 the
investigation  under  Chapter  XII of  the  Code.   But	 the
statement  given  by an accused can be used  in	 the  manner
provided  by  <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_391">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act  in  case	 the
accused	 examines  himself as a witness for the	 defence  by
availing <a href="/doc/1637773/" id="a_392">Section 315(1)</a> of the Code corresponding to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_393">Section

disproof  of  the  charges made against him  or	 any  person
charged together with him at the same trial.
</p><p id="p_268">209. There  is	a  clear  embargo  in  making  use  of	this
statement  of  an accused given to a  police  officer  under
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_394">Section	 25</a>  of	 the Evidence Act, according  to  which,  no
confession  made  to  a police officer shall  be  proved  as

according  to which no confession made by any person  whilst
he  is in custody of a police officer, unless it is made  in
the  immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved  as
against	 such  person.	The only exception  is	given  under
<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_396">Section 27</a> which serves as a proviso to <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_397">Section 26</a>.  <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_398">Section
27</a>  contemplates  that only so much of	information  whether
amounts	 to confession or not, as relates distinctly to	 the
fact thereby discovered, in consequence of that	 information
received  from	a  person accused of any  offence  while  in
custody of the police can be proved as against the accused.
</p><p id="p_269">210. In the context of the matter under discussion, two more
provisions also may be referred to  namely <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_399">Sections 24</a>	and
<a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_400">30</a> of the Evidence Act and <a href="/doc/78014276/" id="a_401">Section 164</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_270">211. <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_402">Section  24</a>  of the Evidence Act  makes  a	 confession,
caused to be made before any authority by an accused by	 any
inducement,  threat  or promise, irrelevant  in	 a  criminal
proceeding.  <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_403">Section 30</a> of the Evidence Act is to the effect
that if a confession made by one or more persons,  affecting
himself	 and some others jointly tried for the same  offence
is  proved,  the  court may  take  into	 consideration	such
confession  as	against such other persons as  well  as	 the
maker  of  the confession.  The explanation to	the  section
reads  that "offence" as used in this section  includes	 the
abetment of, or attempt to commit, the offence.
</p><p id="p_271">212. <a href="/doc/78014276/" id="a_404">Section  164</a>  of  the  Code  speaks  of  recording	  of
confessions and statements by Magistrates specified in	that
section	  by  complying	 with  the  legal  formalities	 and
observing the statutory conditions including the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">671</span>
appendage  of a Certificate by the Magistrate recording	 the
confession  as	contemplated under sub-sections (2)  to	 (6)
thereof.
</p><p id="p_272">213. Though in the old Code, there was a specific embargo on
a police officer recording any statement or confession	made
to  him	 in the course of an investigation embodied  in	 the
main  sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_405">Section 164</a> itself, in the  present
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_406">Code  the</a> legal bar is now brought by a separate proviso  to
subsection (1) of <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_407">Section 164</a> which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">	      "Provided that no confession shall be recorded
	      by  a  police officer on whom any power  of  a
	      Magistrate  has been conferred under  any	 law
	      for the time being in force."
</blockquote><p id="p_273">This  is  a new provision but conveys the  same	 meaning  as
embodied  in the main sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_408">Section 164</a> of	 the
old Code.
</p><p id="p_274">214. Thus, an accused or a person accused of any offence  is
protected  by the constitutional provisions as well  as	 the
statutory   provisions	 to  the  extent   that	  no   self-
incriminating  statement  made by an accused to	 the  police
officer	 while he is in custody, could be used against	such
maker.	 The submission of the Additional Solicitor  General
that  while  a confession by an accused before	a  specified
officer	 either	 under the <a href="/doc/1352182/" id="a_409">Railway Protection Force  Act</a>  or
<a href="/doc/38107498/" id="a_410">Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act</a> or <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_411">Customs Act</a> or
<a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_412">Foreign	 Exchange  Regulation Act</a> is  made  admissible,	 the
special	 procedure  prescribed	under  this  Act  making   a
confession of a person indicted under the TADA Act given  to
a  police  officer  admissible	cannot	be  questioned,	  is
misnomer  because  all	the officials  empowered  to  record
statements under those special Acts are not police  officers
as per the judicial pronouncements of this Court as well the
High Courts which principle holds the field till date.	 See
(1)  <a href="/doc/637970/" id="a_413">State  of	U.P. v. Durga</a>  Prasad8O,  (2)  <a href="/doc/832781/" id="a_414">Balkishan  A.

it  is	not necessary to cite any more decisions  and  swell
this judgment.
</p><p id="p_275">215. The  above	 constitutional	 and  statutory	  procedural
guarantees  and	 safeguards  are  in  consonance  with	 the
expression,  "according	 to procedure  established  by	law"
enshrined  in  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_417">Article 21</a> of the Constitution  within  which
fold the principle of just and fair trial is read into.
</p><p id="p_276">216. The  procedure contemplated by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_418">Article 21</a> is  that	 the
procedure must be "right, just and fair" and not  arbitrary,
fanciful  or  oppressive.  In order that  the  procedure  is
right, just and fair, it should conform to the principle  of
natural justice, that is, "fair play in action".

</p><p id="p_277">217. If	 the procedural law is oppressive and  violates	 the
principle of just and fair trial offending <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_420">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution  and  is  discriminatory  violating  the  equal
protection of laws offending <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_421">Article 14</a> of the Constitution,
then  Section  15  of  TADA  Act  is  to  be  struck   down.
Therefore, it has become inevitably essential to examine the
classification of 'offenders' and 'offenses' so as to enable
us  in deciding whether <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_422">Section 15</a> is violative of  Articles
14 and 21 of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_278">218. The  principle  of	 legislative  classification  is  an
accepted  principle  where under persons may  be  classified
into  groups and such groups may differently be	 treated  if
there	is  a  reasonable  basis  for  such  difference	  or
distinction.   The  rule  of  differentiation  is  that	  in
enacting  laws differentiating between different persons  or
things	in different circumstances which government one	 set
of  persons or objects such laws may not necessarily be	 the
same as those governing another set of persons or objects so
that the question of unequal treatment does not really arise
between	  persons  governed  by	 different  conditions	 and
different set of circumstances.
</p><p id="p_279">219. The limit of valid classification must not be arbitrary
but scientific and rational.  It must always rest upon	some
real and substantial distinction bearing reasonable and just
relation to the needs in respect of which the classification
is made.
</p><p id="p_280">220. Coming to the distinction made in TADA Act grouping the
terrorists  and	 disruptionists	 as  a	separate  class	  of
offenders from ordinary criminals under the normal laws	 and
the  classification  of	 the  offences	under  TADA  Act  as
aggravated form of crimes distinguishable from the  ordinary
crimes	have to be tested and determined as to whether	this
distinction  and  classification are  reasonable  and  valid
within the term of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_423">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  In order
to  consider  the question as to the reasonableness  of	 the
distinction and classification, it is necessary to take into
account	   the	 objective   for   such	  distinction	 and
classification	which  of  course  need	 not  be  made	with
mathematical  precision.  Suffice, if there is little or  no
difference  between  the persons and the things	 which	have
been grouped together and those left out of the groups,	 the
classification	cannot be said to be a reasonable  one.	  In
making the classification, various factors have to be  taken
into  consideration  and  examined  as	to  whether  such  a
distinction   or  classification  justifies  the   different
treatment and whether they subserve the object sought to  be
achieved.
</p><p id="p_281">221. There is a catena of outstanding judgments on the above
principle  of  law and it is not necessary to refer  to	 all
those decisions except to make mention of a few, namely, (1)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">673</span>
</p><p id="p_283">222. As	 pointed out supra, the persons who are to be  tried
for offences specified under the provisions of TADA Act	 are
a distinct class of persons and the procedure prescribed for
trying	them  for  the aggravated  and	incensed  nature  of
offences are under different classification  distinguishable
from the ordinary criminals and procedure.  This distinction
and  classification  of	 grouping of  the  accused  and	 the
offences  to  be  tried	 under	TADA  are  to  achieve	 the
meaningful  purpose and object of the Act as reflected	from
the  preamble  as  well as the	'Statement  of	Objects	 and
Reasons'  about which we have elaborately dealt with in	 the
preceding part of this judgment.
</p><p id="p_284">223. We have already disposed of the question with regard to
the  competence	 of  the Parliament and	 have  held  in	 the

the legislative competence to enact this law  namely   the
TADA  Act  and	the <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_426">Special Courts Act</a> of  1984.   When	 the
validity  of  this  section  is	 scrutinised  in  the  above
background, we can safely hold that the procedure prescribed
under  this  Act  cannot be said to be	unjust,	 unfair	 and
oppressive,   offending	  Articles   14	 and   21   of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_285">224. The  learned Additional Solicitor General by  giving  a
comparative  chart  of	the provisions of TADA	and  of	 the
Northern  Ireland  Emergency Provision Act of  1978  wherein
there are various provisions akin to some of the  provisions
of  TADA including the mode of trial of	 scheduled  offences
specified thereunder in a more stringent manner and the onus
of  proof  in  relation to  offences  corresponding  to	 the
provisions  of TADA Acts and relating to presumption  as  to
offences  under	 <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_427">Section  3</a> and so on,	contended  that	 the
procedure   prescribed	under  this  Act  for	trying	 the
commission   of	 heinous  crimes  cannot  be  said   to	  be
discriminatory.	 He also made reference to the Prevention of
Terrorism  (Temporary  Provision) Act, 1984  (UK)  and	some
other	Acts  enacted  in  India  which	 are  now   repealed
prescribing   special	procedure   and	  providing   severe
punishments.

them.
</p><p id="p_292">230.	  In  Asbury Hospital v. Cass County94 it  has	been

enshrined therein.

the case of <a href="/doc/4354/" id="a_440">Chiranjit Lal v. Union of India85</a> has laid	down
seven propositions as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">	      "1. The presumption is always in favour of the
	      constitutionality	 of an enactment,  since  it
	      must   be	  assumed   that   the	 legislature
	      understands  and	correctly  appreciates	 the
	      needs  of	 its own people, that its  laws	 are
	      directed	 to   problems	made   manifest	  by
	      experience  and its discriminations are  based
	      on adequate grounds.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">	      2.    The	 presumption  may  be  rebutted	  in
	      certain  cases by showing that on the face  of
	      the statute, there is no classification at all
	      and  no difference peculiar to any  individual
	      or  class	 and  not applicable  to  any  other
	      individual or class, and yet the law hits only
	      a particular individual or class.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">	      3.    The principle of equality does not	mean
	      that every law must have universal application
	      for  all	persons	 who  are  not	by   nature,
	      attainment   or  circumstances  in  the	same
	      position	and the varying needs  of  different
	      classes  of  persons often  require  separate,
	      treatment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_75">	      4.    The	 principle does not take  away	from
	      the State the power of classifying persons for
	      legitimate purposes.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_76">	      5.    Every  classification is in some  degree
	      likely  to produce some inequality,  and	mere
	      production of inequality is not enough.

	      protection  on  the  ground  that	 it  has  no
	      application to other persons.</blockquote>
<p id="p_299">	      7.    While   reasonable	 classification	  is
			    permissible, such classification must be  base
d
	      upon  some  real and  substantial	 distinction
	      bearing a reasonable and just relation to	 the

expressed his view thus:
</p><p id="p_306">50   1952 SCR 284: AIR 1952 SC 75: 1952 Cri LJ 5 10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">677</span>
	      "The  present statute suggests  no  reasonable
	      basis or classification, either in respect  of
	      offences or in respect of cases.	It has	laid
	      down no yardstick or measure for the  grouping
	      either  of persons or of cases or of  offences
	      by   which  measure  these  groups  could	  be
	      distinguished  from those who are outside	 the
	      purview of the <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_454">Special Act</a>.  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_455">The Act</a> has	left
	      this   matter  entirely  to  the	 unregulated
	      discretion  of the  provincial  Government....
	      Even  if	it be said that the statute  on	 the
	      face  of it is not discretionary, it is so  in
	      its effect and operation inasmuch as it  vests
	      in   the	executive   Government	 unregulated
	      official	discretion and therefore has  to  be
	      adjudged unconstitutional."
</p><p id="p_307">241. Mukherjea, J. in his separate judgment has said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_81">	      "But   when   the	 statute  itself   makes   a
	      discrimination	without	  any	proper	  or
	      reasonable   basis,  the	statute	  would	  be
	      invalidated  for	being in conflict  with	 the
	      equal  protection clause, and the question  as
	      to  how  it  is actually worked  out  may	 not
	      necessarily    be	  a   material	 fact	 for
	      consideration.  As I have said already, in the
	      present case the discrimination arises on	 the
	      terms  of	 the Act itself.  The fact  that  it
	      gives   unrestrained   power  to	 the   State
	      Government  to select in any way it likes	 the
	      particular  cases or offences which should  go
	      to  a Special Tribunal and withdraw  in  such
	      cases   the  protection  which   the   accused
	      normally	enjoy under the criminal law of	 the
	      country, is on the face of it discriminatory."
</blockquote><p id="p_308">242. The 'ratio decidendi' of this decision was that <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_456">Section
5</a> did not classify  or lay down any basis for classification
of the cases which may be  directed	to  be tried by	 the
Special Court, but left it to the uncontrolled discretion of
the  State Government to direct any cases which it liked  to
be tried by the Special Court.
</p><p id="p_309">243. The  above decision, in our view, cannot be availed  of
for  striking  down  Section  15 of  TADA  Act	because	 the
classification of 'offenders' and ,offences' to be tried  by
the  Designated Court under the TADA Act or by	the  Special
Courts under the Act of 1984, are not left to the  arbitrary
and  uncontrolled discretion of the Central  Government	 but
the  Act itself has made a delineated classification of	 the
offenders  as terrorists and disruptionists in the TADA	 Act
and  the  terrorists under the <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_457">Special Courts Act</a>,  1984  as
well as the classification of offences under both the Acts.
</p><p id="p_310">244. Therefore, the complaint of incorporation of  invidious
discrimination	in the Act has to be turned down.  All	that
the  court has to see is whether the power is used  for	 any
extraneous purpose i.e. to say not for achieving the  object
for  which the power is granted and whether the	 Act  (TADA)
has  been made on grounds which are not germane or  relevant
to  the	 policy and purpose of this Act and  whether  it  is
discriminatory so as to offend <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_458">Article 14.</a>   In		 our
considered opinion, the classifications have rational  nexus
with  the object sought to be achieved by the TADA Acts	 and
<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_459">Special Courts Act</a> and	 consequently there is no  violation
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_460">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">678</span>
<p id="p_311">245. The next question is whether the procedure in recording
the confession is just and fair.
</p><p id="p_312">246. The  counsel  were severely critical of  the  mode	 and
method	of  obtaining a confession from an  accused  person.
According  to  them, the oppressive behavior  and  excessive
naked  abuse and misuse of power by the police in  extorting
confession  by	compelling the accused to  speak  under	 the
untold	pain by using third degree methods  with  diabolical
barbarity in utter violation of human rights, cannot be lost
sight  of or consigned to oblivion and the courts would	 not
be justified by showing a volte-face and turning a blind eye
to  the above reality and drawing a legal  presumption	that
the confession might have been obtained by a police  officer
not  lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police in  terms
of  <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_461">Section  15(1)</a>  only  in  accordance  with	the  legally
permissible  procedure.	 They castigated the conduct of	 the
police	officers  in  whisking away the	 accused  either  on
arrest or on obtaining custody from the court to an  unknown
destination   or   unannounced	 premises   for	   custodial
interrogation in order to get compulsory  self-incriminating
statement as a source of proof to be produced before a court
of law.
</p><p id="p_313">247. This  Court on several occasions has awarded  exemplary
compensation  to  the  victims at the hands  of	 the  police
officials   which   can	 be  testified	by   a	 series	  of
pronouncements of this Court.
</p><p id="p_314">248. As we have repeatedly pointed out supra, if it is shown
to the court that a confession has been extorted by  illegal
means such as inducement, threat or promise as	contemplated
under  <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_462">Section	24</a> of the Evidence Act the  confession	thus
obtained from an accused person would become irrelevant	 and
cannot	be  used  in a criminal proceeding  as	against	 the
maker.	It may be recalled that <a href="/doc/2858386/" id="a_463">Sections 330</a> and <a href="/doc/1135572/" id="a_464">331</a> of	 the
Indian Penal Code provide punishment to one who	 voluntarily
causes	hurt or grievous hurt as the case may be  to  extort
the  confession	 or any information which may  lead  to	 the
detection of an offence or misconduct.
</p><p id="p_315">249. Thus   the	 Constitution  as  well	 as  the   statutory
procedural  law and law of Evidence condemn the	 conduct  of
any official in extorting a confession or information  under
compulsion by using any third degree methods.
</p><p id="p_316">250. In this connection, we would like to reproduce the view
of  the	 National Police Commission (Fourth  Report   June
1980) with regard to the admissibility of confession made to
a  police  officer as evidence, which is  to  the  following
effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_82">	      "27.  33 ... This total ban on the entry of  a
	      confessional  statement recorded by  a  police
	      officer into the area of judicial	 proceedings
	      has placed the police at a great	disadvantage
	      as  compared  to	several	 other	 enforcement
	      agencies who also handle investigational	work
			    leading   to   prosecution	in   court.    Thi
s
	      provision	 in'  the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_465">Evidence  Act</a>  which	 was
	      enacted  in 1872 bears relevance to  the	then
	      situation in which the police were practically
	      the  only enforcement agency available to	 the
	      Government and they had acquired notoriety for
	      the  adoption  of	 several  gross	 malpractice
	      involving	 torture and other pressure  tactics
	      of an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">	      679</span>
	      extreme  nature  to  obtain  confessions	from
	      accused  persons.	  More than 100	 years	have
	      rolled  by since then.  We are aware that	 the
	      police   are  still  not	totally	 free	from
	      adopting	  questionable	  practices    while
	      interrogating accused persons, but one  cannot
	      possibly	deny that the greater vigilance	 now
	      exercised by the public and the press, growing
	      awareness	 of citizens about their  individual
	      rights   under   the   law   and	  increasing
	      earnestness  and	commitment  of	the   senior
	      levels  of command in the police structure  to
	      put  down such malpractice have all tended  to
	      reduce the prevalence of such practices in the
	      police  to  a lesser  degree  than  before....
	      After  a careful consideration of all  aspects
	      of this much debated question we feel that the
	      stage  has arrived now for us to take a  small
	      positive step towards removing this stigma  on
	      the   police  and	 make  it  possible  for   a
	      confession  made	before a police	 officer  to
	      enter the area of judicial proceedings, if not
	      as   substantive	evidence,  at  least  as   a
	      document	  that	 could	 be    taken	into
	      consideration  by	 the  court  to	 aid  it  in
	      inquiry  or  trial in the same manner  as	 now
	      provided	in  regard  to	case  diaries  under
	      <a href="/doc/643569/" id="a_466">Section  172(2)</a> CrPC and the confession  of  a
	      co-accused  under <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_467">Section 30</a> of  the  Evidence
	      Act.   We	 are  also of  the  view  that	this
	      approach to the evidentiary admissibility	 and
	      value  of	 a confession made before  a  police
	      officer  should apply not only to	 the  police
	      but to all persons in authority before whom  a
	      confession  may be made.	<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_468">If the Evidence	 Act</a>
	      reflects	this  approach to confessions  as  a
	      class,  it  would largely remove	the  present
	      feeling  of  the police that  they  have	been
	      unjustly discriminated against in law."
</blockquote><p id="p_317">251.	  Whatever   may  be  said  for	 and   against	 the
submission with regard to the admissibility of a  confession
made  before  a police officer, we cannot avoid	 but  saying
that  we  with the years of experience both at the Bar	and
on the Bench  have frequently dealt with cases of  atrocity
and brutality practiced by some overzealous police  officers
resorting  to inhuman, barbaric, archaic and drastic  method
of  treating  the  suspects  in	 their	anxiety	 to  collect
evidence  by  hook or by crook and wrenching a	decision  in
their  favour.	 We remorsefully like to state that  on	 few
occasions even custodial deaths caused during  interrogation
are brought to our notice.  We are very much distressed	 and
deeply concerned about the oppressive behavior and the	most
degrading  and	despicable practice adopted by some  of	 the
police	 officers  even	 though	 no  general  and   sweeping
condemnation can be made.
</p><p id="p_318">252.	  In   this   connection,  we  feel  it	  would	  be
appropriate  to	 extract  the views  expressed	by  National
Judicial  Commission  (Fourth Report)  discountenancing	 the
conduct of police in practicing the third degree methods:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_83">	      "Nothing is so dehumanising as the conduct  of
	      police in practicing torture of any kind on  a
	      person in their custody.	Police image in	 the
	      estimate	of the public has badly suffered  by
	      the  prevalence  of this practice	 in  varying
	      degrees  over  several years.   We  note	with
	      concern  the inclination of even some  of	 the
	      supervisory ranks to countenance the  practice
	      in a bid to achieve quick results by short-cut
	      methods.	 Even  well  meaning  officers	 are
	      sometimes drawn towards third degree methods
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">	      680</span>
	      because	 of   the   expectation	  of	some
	      complainants  in	individual  cases  that	 the
	      suspects named by them should be questioned by
	      the police with some kind of pressure......
</blockquote><p id="p_319">253. Though  we at the first impression thought	 of  sharing
the  view of the learned counsel that it would be  dangerous
to  make  a statement given to a police	 officer  admissible
(notwithstanding the legal position making the confession of
an  accused  before the police admissible in  some  advanced
countries  like	 United Kingdom, United States	of  America,
Australia  and	Canada etc.)  having regard  to	 the  legal
competence of the legislature to make the law prescribing  a
different  mode of proof, the meaningful purpose and  object
of  the legislation, the gravity of terrorism  unleashed  by
the  terrorists and disruptionists endangering not only	 the
sovereignty and integrity of the country but also the normal
life of the citizens, and the reluctance of even the victims
as  well  as the public in coming forward, at  the  risk  of
their  life,  to  give evidence	  hold	that  the  impugned
section	 cannot	 be said to be suffering from  any  vice  of
unconstitutionality.  In fact, if the exigencies of  certain
situations   warrant   such  a	legislation   then   it	  is
constitutionally  permissible  as  ruled  in  a	 number	  of
decisions  of this Court, provided none of  the	 fundamental
rights under Chapter III of the Constitution is infringed.
</p><p id="p_320">254. In	 view  of the legal position  vesting  authority  on
higher	police	officer to record  the	confession  hitherto
enjoyed by the judicial officer in the normal procedure,  we
state  that there should be no breach of procedure  and	 the
accepted  norms	 of recording the  confession  which  should
reflect	 only  the true and voluntary  statement  and  there
should be no room for hyper criticism that the authority has
obtained  an  invented	confession  as	a  source  of  proof
irrespective  of the truth and creditability as it could  be
ironically put that when a Judge remarked, "Am I not to hear
the truth", the prosecution giving a startling answer,	"No,
Your Lordship is to hear only the evidence".
</p><p id="p_321">255. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_469">As	 the Act</a> now stands after its  amendment  consequent
upon the deletion of <a href="/doc/1786141/" id="a_470">Section 21(1)(c)</a>, a confession made  by
a  person before a police officer can be made admissible  in
the trial of such person not only as against the person	 but
also against the co-accused, abettor or conspirator provided
that  the co-accused, abettor or conspirator is charged	 and
tried  in the same case together with the  accused,  namely,
the  maker  of the confession.	The present position  is  in
conformity with <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_471">Section 30</a> of the Evidence Act.
</p><p id="p_322">256. Under <a href="/doc/1786141/" id="a_472">Section 21(1)(d)</a>, in a prosecution for an offence
under subsection (1) of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_473">Section 3</a>, if it is. proved that the
accused	 had made a confession of the offence to any  person
other  than  a police officer, the  Designated	Court  could
raise  a  presumption that the accused	had  committed	such
offence	 unless the contrary is proved.	 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_474">By Act</a> 43 of  1993,
clause	(d)  of	 <a href="/doc/1786141/" id="a_475">Section 21(1)</a> has now	been  omitted.	 The
resultant  position is that no presumption can be raised  by
the  Designated	 Court against the accused  as	to  offenses
under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_476">Section 3</a> on the basis of <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_477">Section 21</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">681</span>
<p id="p_323">257. As	 per  <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_478">Section  15(1)</a>, a	 confession  can  either  be
reduced	 into writing or recorded on any  mechanical  device
like  cassettes, tapes or sound tracks from which sounds  or
images	can  be reproduced.  As rightly pointed out  by	 the
learned	  counsel  since  the  recording  of   evidence	  on
mechanical  device  can	 be  tampered,	tailored,  tinkered,
edited and erased etc., we strongly feel that there must  be
some severe safeguards which should be scrupulously observed
while recording a confession under <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_479">Section 15(1)</a> so that the
possibility  of	 extorting  any	 false	confession  can	  be
prevented to some appreciable extent.
</p><p id="p_324">258. Sub-section  (2)  of  <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_480">Section 15</a>  enjoins	a  statutory
obligation  on the part of the police officer recording	 the
confession to explain to the person making it that he is not
bound  to make a confession and to give a statutory  warning
that if he does so it may be used as evidence against him.
</p><p id="p_325">259. Rule 15 of the TADA Rules imposes certain conditions on
the police officer with regard to the mode of recording	 the
confession  and	 requires  the	police	officer	 to  make  a
memorandum  at the end of the confession to the effect	that
he has explained to the maker that he was not bound to	make
the  confession	 and that the confession, if  made  by	him,
would  be  used	 as against him and  that  he  recorded	 the
confession  only on being satisfied that it was	 voluntarily
made.	Rule 15(5) requires that every	confession  recorded
under  <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_481">Section	15</a> should be sent forthwith  either  to	 the
Chief	Metropolitan  Magistrate  or  the   Chief   Judicial
Magistrate  having jurisdiction over the area in which	such
confession  has	 been  recorded and  the  Magistrate  should
forthwith forward the recorded confession received by him to
the Designated Court taking cognizance of the offence.
</p><p id="p_326">260. For  the foregoing discussion, we hold that <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_482">Section  15</a>
is not liable to be struck down since that section does	 not
offend either <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_483">Article 14</a> or <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_484">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_327">261. Notwithstanding  our final conclusion made in  relation
to the intendment of <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_485">Section 15</a>, we would hasten to add that
the recording of a confession by a Magistrate under  <a href="/doc/78014276/" id="a_486">Section
164</a>  of	 the  Code  is	not  excluded  by  any	exclusionary
provision  in the TADA Act, contrary to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_487"> the Code</a> but on	 the
other  hand the police officer investigating the case  under
the TADA Act can get the confession or statement of a person
indicted with any offence under any of the provisions of the
TADA  Act recorded by any Metropolitan Magistrate,  Judicial
Magistrate,   Executive	 Magistrate  or	 Special   Executive
Magistrate  of whom the two latter Magistrates are  included
in  <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_488">Section 164(1)</a> by sub-section (3) of Section 20  of	 the
TADA Act and empowered to record confession.
</p><p id="p_328">262. The net result is that any confession or statement of a
person under the TADA	 Act  can  be recorded either  by  a
police officer not lower in rank than of a   Superintendent
of Police, in exercise of the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_489">Section
15</a> or by a Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate or
Executive Magistrate or Special Executive Magistrate who are
empowered  to record any confession under <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_490">Section 164(1)</a>  in
view of sub-section (3) of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">682</span>
Section	 20  of	 the TADA Act.	As we  will  be	 elaborately
dealing	 with  <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_491">Section	20(3)</a>  in the  later  part  of	this
judgment, we do not like to go into detail any more.
</p><p id="p_329">263. However, we would like to lay down following guidelines
so  as	to ensure that the confession obtained in  the	pre-
indictment  interrogation by a police officer not  lower  in
rank than a Superintendent of Police is not tainted with any
vice  but is in strict conformity with	the  well-recognised
and accepted a esthetic principles and fundamental  fairness
:

<p id="p_331">264.  Though it is entirely for the court trying the offence
to decide the question of admissibility or reliability of  a
confession in its judicial wisdom  strictly adhering to	 the
law, it must, while so deciding the question should  satisfy
itself	that  there was no trap, no track and  no  importune
seeking	 of evidence during the custodial interrogation	 and
all the conditions required are fulfilled.

</p><p id="p_334">266. Much  argument was advanced stating that <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_499">Section  16(1)</a>
is  violative  of  the	provisions  of	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_500">Article	 14</a>  of	 the

</p><p id="p_335">267. The   learned  Additional	Solicitor  General  made   a

</p><p id="p_338">269. No doubt, the trials are traditionally open which is an
indispensable  attribute  of  the  criminal  justice.	This
characteristic flowed not merely from the public interest in
seeing fairness and proper conduct in the administration  of
criminal  trials,  but,	 more  important,  the	"therapeutic
value"	to  the	 public	 of  seeing  its  criminal  laws  in
operation, purging the society of the outrage felt with	 the
commission of many crimes, convincingly demonstrated why the
tradition developed and is maintained.	This is the accepted
practice  of  guaranteeing a public trial to an	 accused  as
having	its roots in the English Common Law heritage.	But,
however,  though  it is an indispensable  attribute  of	 the
criminal justice, in exceptional circumstances there  cannot
be any legal ban in having the trial in camera.	 Though	 the
criminal  justice prevailing in our country  recognises	 and
accepts	 the  practice	of  only open  trial,  there  is  an
exception to such trial as contemplated under <a href="/doc/842738/" id="a_504">Section 237(2)</a>
of  the	 Code of Criminal Procedure  falling  under  Chapter
XVIII  with caption "Trial before a Court of Session"  which
provides an exemption to the general practice.	The relevant
sub-section reads :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_89">	      "237. (2) Every trial under this section shall
	      be  held in camera if either party thereto  so

</blockquote><p id="p_339">270. Under  the	 "General  provisions as  to  enquiries	 and
trials"	 falling  under	 Chapter XXIV there  is	 a  specific
provision,  namely, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_505">Section 327</a> with a caption "Court to  be
open"  according  to  which the inquiry	 and  trial  of	 any
offence	 should be held in an open court, to  which  general
public	may  have access.  However, under  the	proviso	 the
discretion is given to the presiding Judge or Magistrate  to
regulate  the public generally, or any person in  particular
in  having  access  to,	 or be or remain  in,  the  room  or
building  used by the court.  An exemption is given for	 the
open court trial under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_506">Section 327(2)</a> which is as follows :

challenge  of  <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_511">Section 16(1)</a> is required since	a  new	sub-
section is substituted to the original <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_512">Section 16(1)</a> of	 the

is  given to the Designated Court either to hold or  not  to
hold the proceedings in camera.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">685</span>
<p id="p_342">273.   It is the further contention of the counsel that	 the
remaining  sub-sections of <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_515">Section 16</a>, save sub-section	 (1)
of  that  section  empower a court to  keep  back  from	 the
defence	 the  names and addresses of the  witnesses  without
which the accused cannot prepare his defence or successfully
defend	himself	 at  the trial.	 The object  of	 the  cross-
examination,  according	 to  them,  in	such  circumstances,
becomes	 futile and impotent.  In continuation, it has	been
urged  that  <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_516">Section 16(2)</a> and (3) of Act 1987	empower	 the
Designated  Court to take measures for keeping the  identity
and address of witnesses      secret and to issue directions
for  securing that their identity is not disclosed and	that
these  provisions turn a trial under the provisions of	TADA
into a farce.
</p><p id="p_343">274. Mr	 Tarkunde states that it is true that in some  cases
the  safety of witnesses requires the non-disclosure of	 the
identity  of the witnesses, but at the same time the  cross-
examination   of   witnesses  is  liable   to	be   largely
ineffective  if their identity is not known to	the  accused
and  his counsel.  He suggests that a proper course must  be
that  when the Designated Court finds that the	identity  of
witnesses  cannot safely be disclosed, the trial  should  be
dropped and the accused may, if the authority so decides, be
detained under the preventive detention law.
</p><p id="p_344">275. With reference to the arguments relating to sub-section
(2)  of	 <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_517">Section 16</a>, it has been submitted  by	the  learned
Additional Solicitor General that the Legislature has merely
regulated the right of fair trial and the right of  accused.
to   effectively   defend  himself  keeping  in	  view	 the
requirements  of  the  situation  prevailing  in  terrorists
affected areas where the witnesses are living in a reign  of
terror and are unwilling to depose against the terrorists in
courts	for fear of retribution or reprisal.   Stating	that
the  right  of cross-examination is neither absolute  nor  a
constitutional	right,	the  learned  Additional   Solicitor
General	 placed reliance on (1) <a href="/doc/309469/" id="a_518">Gurbachan Singh v. State  of
Bombay7</a>	 5  (SCR  at  p.  743),	 (2)  <a href="/doc/610407/" id="a_519">Hira  Nath  Mishra  v.

Kinematograph  Renters Society Ltd.  100 According  to	him,
the  person  accused  should know;  firstly  the  nature  of

the  decision in Bimal Kaur58 wherein an identical  question

Court and was rejected holding that <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_521">Section 16(2)</a> cannot  be

notwithstanding the conclusion, the court has observed	that
the  identity  of  the witnesses should	 be  disclosed	well
before the start of the trial.
</p><p id="p_346">277. Under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_522">  the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, whether it is  a
trial before a Court of Session or a trial or warrant  cases
by Magistrates there are specific provisions prescribing the
mode  of  recording  evidence  with  the  right	 of   cross-
examination  of any witness by the accused  as	contemplated
under  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_523">Sections 244</a> as well as <a href="/doc/285163/" id="a_524">Sections 273</a>, <a href="/doc/1565155/" id="a_525">275</a> and <a href="/doc/1049807/" id="a_526">276</a>  of
the  Code.   Both  under the sessions  trial  and  trial  of
warrant cases, the accused is given a discretionary right of
deferring the cross examination of any witness or  recalling
any  witness  for further cross-examination  [vide  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_527">Sections
231(2)</a>, proviso to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_528">Section 242</a> sub-section (3)].
</p><p id="p_347">278. <a href="/doc/1612728/" id="a_529">Section  137</a>  of the Evidence Act defines	what  cross-
examination means and <a href="/doc/334170/" id="a_530">Sections 139</a> and <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_531">145</a> speak of the mode
of cross-examination with reference to the documents as well
as  oral  evidence.   It is the jurisprudence  of  law	that
cross-examination is an acid-test of the truthfulness of the
statement made by a witness on oath in examination-in-chief,
the objects of which are :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_93">	      (1)   to	destroy	 or weaken  the	 evidentiary
	      value of the witness of his adversary;
	      (2)   to elicit facts in favour of the  cross-
	      examining	 lawyer's client from the  mouth  of
	      the witness of the adversary party;
	      (3)   to show that the witness is unworthy  of
	      belief  by impeaching the credit of  the	said
	      witness;
</blockquote><p id="p_348">and  the questions to be  addressed in the course of  cross-
examination are to test his veracity; to discover who he  is
and what is his position in life; and to shake his credit by
injuring his character.
</p><p id="p_349">279. The identity of the witness is necessary in the  normal
trial of cases to achieve the above objects and the right of
confrontation  is one of the fundamental guarantees so	that
he  could guard himself from being victimised by  any  false
and invented evidence that may be tendered by the  adversary
party.
</p><p id="p_350">280. Under  the provisions of this Act, the right of  cross-
examination  is	 not  taken  away  but	the  identity,	 and
addresses  of  the witnesses are permitted to  be  withheld.
The submission of the counsel attacking sub-sections (2) and
(3) of <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_532">Section 16</a> is that the withholding or the issuance of
any  direction	not  to disclose  the  identity,  names	 and
addresses of the witnesses prevents the accused from  having
a  fair	 trial to which right he is  otherwise	legitimately
entitled  to.	As we have already pointed out that  in	 the
normal course, this difficulty does not arise.	In fact when
the  copies  of	 the  documents	 on  which  the	 prosecution
proposes  to rely upon are furnished to the accused  with  a
memo  of  evidence  under <a href="/doc/1187622/" id="a_533">Section 173</a> of  the  Code,  he  is
informed of the names and     addresses of the witnesses.
</p><p id="p_351">281. Notwithstanding the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_534">Evidence Act</a>	 and
the procedure  prescribed  under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_535">  the  Code</a>,  there  is	  no
imposition of constitutional or statutory constraint against
keeping the identity and address of any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">687</span>
witness	 secret	 if  some  extraordinary  circumstances	  or
imperative   situations	 warrant  such	 non-disclosure	  of
identity and address of the witnesses.
</p><p id="p_352">282. There are provisions in some local laws e.g. Section 56
of  Bombay Police Act, 1951 the constitutional	validity  of
which  has  been approved as well as  observations  of	this
court  in  various  decisions touching	the  question  under
consideration.
</p><p id="p_353">283. The  Constitution Bench of this Court  while  examining
the  constitutional  validity  of Section  27(1)  of  Bombay
Police	Act, 1902 (which provision is akin to Section 56  of
Bombay	Police	Act, 1951) in <a href="/doc/309469/" id="a_536">Gurbachan Singh  v.  State  of
Bombay75</a> gave its finding with regard to the  non-disclosure
of  the	 identity and address of the witnesses	who  deposed
against	 him  and  on whose  evidence  the  proceedings	 for
externment were started, thus : (SCR pp. 743 and 744)
	      "In our opinion this by itself would not	make
	      the  procedure unreasonable having  regard  to
	      the  avowed  intention of the  legislature  in
	      making the enactment.  The law is certainly an
	      extraordinary  one and has been made  only  to
	      meet   those   exceptional  cases	  where	  no
	      witnesses for fear of violence to their person
	      or  property  are willing to  depose  publicly
	      against certain bad characters whose  presence
	      in  certain areas constitutes a menace to	 the
	      safety  of the public residing therein.	This
	      object would be wholly defeated if a right  to
	      confront or cross-examine these witnesses	 was
	      given to the suspect.
</p><p id="p_354">	      down under the ordinary law has been  provided
	      for a particular class of persons against whom
	      proceedings could be taken under Section 27(1)
	      of  the  City of Bombay Police  Act,  but	 the
	      discrimination   if  any	is  based   upon   a
	      reasonable classification which is within	 the
	      competency of the legislature to make.  Having
	      regard to the objective which the	 legislation
	      has  in view and the policy underlying  it,  a
	      departure	 from  the  ordinary  procedure	 can
	      certainly	 be justified as the best  means  of
	      giving   effect	to   the   object   of	 the

</p><p id="p_355">284. <a href="/doc/610407/" id="a_537">In	 Hira  Nath Mishra v.  Principal,  Rajendra  Medical
College, Ranchi98</a>   a  complaint  was  made  by	 some	girl
students residing in the girls	hostel of    the    College,
alleging  that	the appellants with some others	 in  a	late
night had entered into the compound of the girls hostel	 and
walked	without	 clothes  on  them.   In  respect  of	this
allegation,  an Enquiry Committee was constituted  and	that
Committee  recorded  the  statement  of	 some  of  the	girl
students  but not in presence of the appellants and  finally
was  of	 the  view  that  the  students	 deserved  deterrent
punishment  and recommended expulsion from the hostel.	 The
appellants-the	 students  questioned  the  order  on	many
grounds, the chief contention of which was that the rules of
natural	 justice had not been followed before the order	 was
passed	since the inquiry had been held behind	their  back;
the  witnesses who tendered evidence against them  were	 not
examined in their presence and there was no opportunity to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">688</span>
cross-examine  the  witnesses  with a  view  to	 test  their
veracity.  Rejecting this contention, this Court held thus :
(SCC pp. 809, 810, paras 12, 13)
	      "The very reasons for which the girls were not
	      examined	in the presence of  the	 appellants,
	      prevailed	 on  the authorities not to  give  a
			    copy of the report to them.	 It would have bee
n
	      unwise to do so. ...
</p><p id="p_356">	      Rules  of	 natural justice cannot	 remain	 the
	      same  applying to all conditions.	 We know  of
	      statutes	in India like the Goonda Acts  which
	      permit  evidence	being collected	 behind	 the
	      back of the goonda and the goonda being merely
	      asked  to represent against the  main  charges
	      arising  out of the evidence collected.	Care
	      is  taken to see that the witnesses  who	gave
	      statements  would not be identified.  In	such
	      cases  there is no question of  the  witnesses
	      being  called  and the goonda being  given  an
	      opportunity  to cross-examine  the  witnesses.
	      The  reason is obvious.  No witness will	come
	      forward  to give evidence in the	presence  of
	      the  goonda.  However unsavory  the  procedure
	      may appear to a judicial mind, these are facts
	      of life which are to be faced."
</p><p id="p_357">285.
In  this  connection, the observation made  by	Chandrachud,
C.J. speaking for the Constitution Bench in A. K. Roy4O	 may
be  recalled, which is as follows : (SCC p. 340, paras	102,
</p><p id="p_358">103)
	      "Whatever	 it is, Parliament has not made	 any
	      provision in the <a href="/doc/190229/" id="a_538">National Security Act</a>,  under
	      which  the  detenu could claim  the  right  of
	      cross-examination	 and  the matter  must	rest
	      there.
</p><p id="p_359">	      We  are therefore of the opinion that, in	 the
	      proceedings  before  the Advisory	 Board,	 the
	      detenu  has no right to  cross-examine  either
	      the  persons on the basis of  whose  statement
	      the   order  of  detention  is  made  or	 the
	      detaining authority."
</p><p id="p_360">286. Under  <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_539">Section  16(2)</a> of the 1987 Act,  the  Designated
Court  is given only a discretionary authority to  keep	 the
identity and address of any witness secret on the  following
three contingencies :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_94">	      (1)   On	an application made by a witness  in
	      any proceedings before it; or
	      (2)   on	an  application made by	 the  Public
	      Prosecutor in relation to such witness; or
	      (3)   on its own motion.
</blockquote><p id="p_361">287.	  Sub-section (3) classifies only the measures to be
taken	by  the	 Designated  Court  while   exercising	 its
discretion  under sub-section (2).  If neither	the  witness
nor  the Public Prosecutor has made an application  in	that
behalf nor the court has taken any decision of its own	then
the  identity  and  addresses of the witnesses	have  to  be
famished  to the accused.  The measures are to be  taken  by
the   Designated   Court  under	 any  one   of	 the   above
contingencies  so  that a witness or witnesses may  not	 be
subjected  to any harassment for having spoken	against	 the
accused.
</p><p id="p_362">288. Generally speaking, when the accused persons are of bad
character,  the witnesses are unwilling to come	 forward  to
depose against such persons
40   (1982) 1 SCC 271: 1982 SCC (Cri) 152: (1982) 2 SCR 272
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">689</span>
fearing	 harassment  at	 the hands of  those  accused.	 The
persons who are put for trial under this Act are  terrorists
and  disruptionists.  Therefore, the witnesses will all	 the
more  be  reluctant and unwilling to depose at the  risk  of
their	life.	 The  Parliament  having  regard   to	such
extraordinary  circumstances  has thought it  fit  that	 the
identity and addresses of the witnesses be not disclosed  in
any one of the above contingencies.
</p><p id="p_363">289. In this context, reference may be made to <a href="/doc/1696350/" id="a_540">Section 228-A</a>
of the Indian Penal Code as per which the disclosure of	 the
identity of the victims of certain offences, as contemplated
under  sub-section  (1) of that section	 is  punishable	 but
subject to sub-section (2).  However, when the witnesses are
examined in the presence of the accused then the accused may
have the chances of knowing the identity of the witnesses if
they are already known to the defence.	But if the witnesses
are  unknown to the defence then there is no possibility  of
knowing the identity of the witnesses even after they  enter
into  the witness box.	During a trial after examination  of
the  witnesses	in  chief the accused have got	a  right  of
deferring  the cross-examination and calling  the  witnesses
for  cross-examination on some other day.  If the  witnesses
are known to the accused they could collect the material  to
cross-examine  at  the	time of	 cross-examination  in	such
circumstances.	 Whatever  may	be  the	 reasons  for	non-
disclosure  of	the  witnesses, the fact  remains  that	 the
accused persons to be put up for trial under this Act  which
provides severe punishments, will be put to disadvantage  to
effective cross-examining and exposing the previous  conduct
and character of the witnesses.
</p><p id="p_364">290. Therefore, in order to ensure the purpose and object of
the cross-examination, we feel that as suggested by the Full
Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bimal  Kaur58,
the  identity, names and addresses of the witnesses  may  be
disclosed  before the trial commences; but we would like  to
qualify	 it  observing	that  it should	 be  subject  to  an
exception  that the court for weighty reasons in its  wisdom
may decide not to disclose the identity and addresses of the
witnesses  especially of the potential witnesses whose	life
may be in danger.
</p><p id="p_365"><a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_541">Section 19</a> of 198 7 Act
</p><p id="p_366">291. This  section  provides that  notwithstanding  anything
contained  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_542"> the Code</a>, an appeal shall lie as a  matter  of
right  from  any judgment, sentence or order  not  being  an
interlocutory  order  of a Designated Court to	the  Supreme
Court  both  on facts and on law.  Sub-section (2)  of	that
section	 makes	it clear that except as	 contemplated  under
sub-section (1) of that section, no appeal or revision shall
lie to any other court.
</p><p id="p_367">292. The  above provision is attacked solely on	 the  ground
that  the  conferment  of the right of	appeal	and  further
appeal to the Supreme Court on grant of leave under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_543">Article
136</a> of the Constitution, both at the remedial and procedural
level,	is taken away by the statutory compulsion under	 the
guise of speedy trial even in respect of a conviction  under
the  provisions	 of ordinary criminal law  even	 though	 the
charge	for  the  offence under the TADA Act  has  ended  in
acquittal, and the taking away of the right of
58   AIR 1988 P&amp;H 95 : (1988) 93 Punj LR 189 : 1988  Cri  LJ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">169</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">690</span>
traditional appeal or revision will cause great hardship and
make one to suffer in	 incurring     heavy	 expenditure
especially those who are far away from the situs  of	 the
Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_368">293. The  above	 argument  is  vehemently  resisted  by	 the
learned	  Additional  Solicitor	 General.   He	extols	 the
specialised  procedure	of appeal directly  to	the  Supreme
Court both on facts and on law as a matter of right, without
approaching the traditional appellate and revisional  courts
and submits that this appeal procedure is a very significant
advantage  to the person tried by the Designated  Court	 and
the  professed	object	of  it is  in  conformity  with	 the
doctrine  of 'speedy trial'.  He adds that such a  procedure
of adjudication of appeals is cheaper, faster,	procedurally
simpler	 and less formal than other  traditional  procedure.
The Additional Solicitor General relying on the dictum	laid
down  in (1) <a href="/doc/1063853/" id="a_544">Syed Qasim Razvi v. State Of  Hyderabad10</a>,	 and
(2) V.C. Shukla v. State (Delhi Admn.)102 submitted that the
appeal	procedure prescribed by the TADA Act cannot be	said
to be prejudicial or less advantageous to the accused merely
on  the ground that the right of appeal provided  under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_545">	 the
Code</a> of Criminal Procedure is taken away.
</p><p id="p_369">294. Leave apart the question whether this provision entails
or  excludes a great deal of delay than the usual course  of
disposal  of appeals, the indisputable reality is  that	 the
Supreme	 Court	is  beyond the reach of	 an  average  person
considering  the fact of distance, expense etc.	  One  could
understand the right of appeal directly to the Supreme Court
under <a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_546">Section 19</a> of the Act against any judgment pronounced,
sentence  passed or order made by a Designated Court  solely
under the provisions of TADA or under both the provisions of
TADA  and the ordinary criminal law.  But it would be  quite
unreasonable to compel a person to prefer an appeal only  to
the  Supreme Court even in a case wherein the trial was	 for
charges	 under both the provisions of TADA and the  ordinary
or general criminal law and the trial has ended in acquittal
of  the	 offences  punishable  under the  TADA	Act  but  in
conviction  of	the offences under the penal  provisions  of
general law alone.
</p><p id="p_370">295. We see no logic or convincing reasoning in providing no
choice	but  forcing  a person aggrieved  by  the  judgment,
sentence or order of the Designated Court passed only  under
the ordinary criminal law to prefer an appeal to the Supreme
Court  directly	 in which case the aggrieved person  has  to
deny himself firstly, the right of appeal to the High  Court
and  secondly, the benefit of approaching the Supreme  Court
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_547">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.	If every such person
aggrieved by the judgment and order of the Designated  Court
passed under any criminal law other than the TADA Act has to
approach the Supreme Court from far-flung areas, many of the
persons	 suffering from financial constraints may  not	even
think of preferring an appeal at all but to languish in jail
indefinitely  on that count.  The statutory  compulsion,  in
such a situation as pointed out by the counsel,
101  1953 SCR 589: AIR 1953 SC 156: 1953 Cri Li 862
102 1980 Supp SCC 249: 1980 SCC (Cri) 849: AIR 1980 SC 1382
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">691</span>
would  not  only deny fair play and justice to	such  person
but  also amount to destruction of the professed  object  of
criminal  justice system in the absence of any	other  valid
reason for an abnormal procedure.
</p><p id="p_371">296. This predicament and practical difficulty an  aggrieved
person has to suffer can be avoided if a person who is tried
by the Designated Court for offences under the TADA Act	 but
convicted only under other penal provisions and is acquitted
of  the offences under the provisions of TADA, Is given	 the
right  of  preferring an appeal before	the  next  appellate
court  as provided under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_548"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure	 and
if the State prefers an appeal against the acquittal of	 the
offence	 under the provisions of TADA then it  may  approach
the Supreme Court for withdrawal of the appeal or  revision,
as the case may be, preferred by such person to the  Supreme
Court so that both the cases may be heard together.
</p><p id="p_372">297. We have adverted to the practical difficulties faced by
the  aggrieved persons under the appeal provisions  and	 how
the same can be removed so that Parliament may take note  of
them  and  devise a suitable mode of redress by	 making	 the
necessary  amendments in the appeal provisions.	  This	does
not,  however, mean that the existing appeal provisions	 are
constitutionally invalid.
</p><p id="p_373"><a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_549">Section 20</a> of 1987 Act
</p><p id="p_374">298. Very  intense and sharp arguments	occasionally  filled
with emotions were advanced by both the parties with  regard
to  the	 scope	of  sub-sections  (3),	(4),  (7)  and	more
particularly  of  sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_550">Section 20</a> of  the	 Act
which  call for an intense, explicit and candid	 debate	 and
discussion.   As  every issue involved in respect  of  every
sub-section is a volatile one bringing the parties almost to
the critical crossroads, it has become inevitable to examine
the  burning issues especially with regard to the  grant  of
bail very objectively and dispassionately.
</p><p id="p_375">299. Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_551">Section 20</a> of the Act reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_95">	      "<a href="/doc/78014276/" id="a_552">Section	164</a>  of	 the  Code  shall  apply  in

	      thereunder,  subject to the modification	that
	      the  reference in sub-section (1)	 thereof  to
	      'Metropolitan    Magistrate    or	    Judicial

	      to    'Metropolitan    Magistrate,    Judicial
	      Magistrate,  Executive Magistrate	 or  Special
	      Executive Magistrate'."
</blockquote><p id="p_376">300.
In  order  to have a better understanding of the above	sub-
section,  we reproduce the sub-section (1) of  <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_553">Section	164</a>,
which reads thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_96">	      "164.	Recording   of	  confessions	 and

	      force,  or at any time afterwards	 before	 the
	      commencement of the inquiry or trial
</blockquote><p id="p_377">301. The reading of these two sub-sections in  juxtaposition
shows that <a href="/doc/78014276/" id="a_554">Section 164(1)</a> of the Code is made  substantially
applicable in relation to a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">692</span>
case  involving an offence punishable under the TADA Act  or
any rule made thereunder.  But the modification is only with
reference  to  Judicial	 Magistrates who  are  empowered  to
record any confession or statement made to him in the course
of an investigation under Chapter XII or under any other law
for the time being in force, that is to say, the expressions
'Metropolitan  Magistrate' and 'Judicial Magistrate'  should
be  construed  as a reference  to  Metropolitan	 Magistrate,
Judicial   Magistrate,	Executive  Magistrate	or   Special
Executive   Magistrate.	  In  other  words,  the   Executive
Magistrate  and	 Special Executive Magistrate  are  included
along	with  the  Metropolitan	 Magistrate   and   Judicial
Magistrate  and	 they  are  all	 empowered  to	record	 the
confession or statement.
</p><p id="p_378">302. <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_555">Section  3</a> of the Code deals with the  construction  of
references  to the words 'Magistrates', 'Magistrate  of	 the
Second	Class',	 'Magistrate of the First  Class'  and	'the
Chief Judicial Magistrate'.  The classes of criminal  courts
contemplated under <a href="/doc/1633827/" id="a_556">Section 6</a> of the Code read as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_97">	      "6.  Classes of Criminal Courts.- Besides	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_379">303. <a href="/doc/1666329/" id="a_557">Section 20(t)</a> of the Code empowers the State Government
to appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be  Executive
Magistrates  in	 every district and  in	 every	metropolitan
area, and that one of the Magistrates so appointed should be
appointed as District Magistrate.  <a href="/doc/1666329/" id="a_558">Section 20(4)</a> of the Code
empowers   the	State  Government  to  place  an   Executive

functions   to	be  performed  by  the	 Special   Executive
Magistrates.  This section empowers the State Government  to
appoint	 for  such  term  as it	 may  think  fit,  Executive
Magistrates to be known as Special Executive Magistrates for
particular  areas  or  for  the	 performance  of  particular
function  and  confer on such Special  Executive  Magistrate
such  of  the powers as are conferrable under this  Code  on
Executive Magistrates, as it may deem fit.
</p><p id="p_380">304. The  contention  of  the learned counsel  is  that	 the
inclusion  of the Executive Magistrate or Special  Executive
Magistrate to record any confession or statement is with  an
oblique motive of making it possible that the confession  or
statement  may be recorded and admitted in evidence even  if
the  confessions or statements are not made voluntarily	 but
are  extorted under coercion or inducement.  The  empowering
of these two Magistrates, according to them, is against	 the
very principle of separation of judiciary from the executive
enunciated in <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_560">Article 50</a> of the Constitution, and therefore,
this  provision	 is  bad under Articles 14  and	 21  of	 the
Constitution.	 It  has  been	further	 stated	  that	 the
conferment of judicial functions on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">693</span>
newly	added  non-judicial  authorities,  who	 cannot	  be
expected  to  have judicial integrity and  independence,  is
totally	 opposed to the fundamental principle of  governance
contained in <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_561">Article 50</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_381">305. Now  let us examine the above submission.	As  we	have
pointed	 out  supra,  the  Executive  Magistrates  are	also
brought	 as one of the classes of criminal courts  in  every
State.	  This	revised	 set  up  and  the   allocation	  of
magisterial   functions	 between  the  two   categories	  of
Magistrates,  judicial under the control of the	 High  Court
and the executive under the control of the State Government,
the new Code has provided for, make for the simple scheme of
separation  of	the judiciary from the executive on  an	 all
India  basis.	The  Executive	Magistrates  have  not	been
further	 classified  evidently	for  the  reason  that	 the
judicial   functions  to  be  performed	 by  the   Executive
Magistrates  under  the	 new Code  are	very  few.   Broadly
speaking  the  functions which are essentially	of  judicial
nature	are for the Judicial Magistrates and  the  functions
which  are of police and administrative nature are  for	 the
Executive   Magistrates	 as  appears  from  the	  rules	  of
construction contained in sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_562">Section 3</a>. When
<a href="/doc/1536853/" id="a_563">Section 6</a> brings Executive Magistrates' Courts as one of the
classes	 of  criminal  courts, it must be held	that  it  is
acting	as  a  criminal court.	The  orders  passed  by	 the
criminal  courts inclusive of the Executive Magistrates	 are
revisable  as having been passed in 'judicial  proceedings'.
<a href="/doc/1982516/" id="a_564">See R. Subramaniam v. Commissioner of Police103</a>.  As pointed
out  above, there is no classification or gradation  of	 the
Courts	of Executive Magistrates but the  Special  Executive
Magistrate is the one appointed by the State Government	 for
a   particular	area  or  for  the  purpose  of	  particular
functions.
</p><p id="p_382">306. Under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_565">  the Code</a>, the Executive Magistrates and  Special
Executive  Magistrates	are  empowered	to  perform  certain
functions some of which are 'judicial or quasi-judicial'  in
character.  Besides they also perform statutory functions in
their executive capacity.  Reference may be made to <a href="/doc/1021266/" id="a_566">Sections
22</a>,  <a href="/doc/813048/" id="a_567">23</a>, <a href="/doc/103053/" id="a_568">40</a>, <a href="/doc/1326950/" id="a_569">44</a>, <a href="/doc/1106405/" id="a_570">78</a>, <a href="/doc/540972/" id="a_571">79</a>, <a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_572">80</a>, <a href="/doc/492182/" id="a_573">81</a> and <a href="/doc/1068667/" id="a_574">93</a> etc.  Apart from	 the
above,	 the   Executive  Magistrates  are   also   assigned
significant  functions for prevention and dealing  with	 the
investigation  and  trial  of  criminal	 offences.   Various
quasi-judicial	and judicial functions are also assigned  to
Executive  Magistrates	and  Special  Executive	 Magistrates
under <a href="/doc/1404883/" id="a_575">Sections 107</a>, <a href="/doc/985205/" id="a_576">108</a>, <a href="/doc/1630403/" id="a_577">109</a>, <a href="/doc/390107/" id="a_578">110</a>, <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_579">133</a>, <a href="/doc/926866/" id="a_580">144</a>, <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_581">145</a>, <a href="/doc/130551/" id="a_582">146</a>,	<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_583">174</a>,

167</a>  of the Code which has been inserted by Act 45  of	1978
w.e.f.	 18-12-1978,   an  Executive  Magistrate   is	also
authorised   to	 perform  certain  judicial   functions	  of
authorising the detention of the accused in such custody  as
he  thinks  fit	 for  a term not  exceeding  7	days  in  an
aggregate for the reasons to be recorded in writing and also
releasing  the arrestee on bail on the expiry of the  period
of  detention so authorised by him when the  police  officer
making	an investigation transmits to the nearest  Executive
Magistrate conferred with the powers of Judicial  Magistrate
when the Judicial Magistrate is not available, a copy of the
entry in the police diary and forwards the accused to

authorising detention and releasing the arrestee on bail are
normally  performed  by	 the  Judicial	Magistrates  in	 the
discharge of their judicial functions.
</p><p id="p_383">307. Under  Chapter VIII of the Code of	 Criminal  Procedure
dealing	 with  security for keeping the peace and  for	good
behavior <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_586">Section 106</a> empowers the Court of Session or  Court

that  person  convicted of any offenses	 specified  in	sub-
section (2) of <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_587">Section 106</a> or of abetting any such  offence.

as  contemplated  under	 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_592">Section 273</a>  to  proceedings  under
Chapter VIII also an explanation was added to <a href="/doc/285163/" id="a_593">Section 273</a> of
the Code reading :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">	      "In this Section, 'accused' includes a  person

</blockquote><p id="p_384">308. It	 may  be  noted, in  this  connection  that  certain
legislative changes were made in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_594">Section 436</a> of the old Code
corresponding to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_595">Section 398</a> of the new Code by substituting
the  expression "person accused of an offence" by Act  XVIII
of  1923 so as to make <a href="/doc/1517318/" id="a_596">Section 436</a> of the Code	inapplicable
to the security proceedings as well as to proceedings  under
<a href="/doc/356470/" id="a_597">Sections  133</a>, <a href="/doc/10736/" id="a_598">134</a> and <a href="/doc/555656/" id="a_599">135</a> of the Code.	 <a href="/doc/1013766/" id="a_600">See Directorate  of
Enforcement v. Deepak Mahajal43</a>.
</p><p id="p_385">309. Therefore, merely because the Executive Magistrates and
Special	 Executive Magistrates are included along  with	 the
other Judicial Magistrates in <a href="/doc/78014276/" id="a_601">Section 164(1)</a> of the Code and
empowered  with	 the authority of recording  confessions  in
relation  to the case under the TADA Act, it cannot be	said
that  it is contrary to the accepted principles of  criminal
jurisprudence and that the Executive Magistrates and Special
Executive  Magistrates	are personam outside  the  ambit  of
machinery for adjudication of criminal cases.
</p><p id="p_386">310. The  next question that falls for our consideration  is
whether	 the  conferment  of  judicial	function  to  record
confessions  or	 statements by the Executive  Magistrate  is
opposed to the fundamental principle of governance contained
in <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_602">Article 50</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_387">311. The  Indian  Constitution provides for  an	 independent
judiciary   in	the  States  and  in  order  to	 place	 the
independence  of the subordinate judiciary beyond  question,
provides  in <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_603">Article 50</a> of the Directive Principles for	 the
separation of the judiciary from the executive.
</p><p id="p_388">312. We,  without entering into the wide range of the  scope
and value underlying <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_604">Article 50</a>, would confine ourselves  to
the  issue whether the Executive Magistrates  falling  under
one of the classes of criminal courts under <a href="/doc/1633827/" id="a_605">Section 6</a> of the
Code are judicial officers.
</p><p id="p_389">313. This Court in <a href="/doc/1687581/" id="a_606">Statesman (P) Ltd. v. H.R. Deb104</a> had  an
occasion to examine the question who is a 'judicial officer'
and  Hidayatullah, C.J. speaking for the Constitution  Bench
answered the same thus : (SCR p. 620)
43 (1994) 3 SCC 440: JT (1994) 1 SC 290
104 (1968) 3 SCR 614: AIR 1968 SC 1495
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">695</span>
	      "All  learned  Judges  seem to  agree  that  a
	      Magistrate exercises judicial functions.	This
	      does not admit of any doubt and no reasons are
	      required.	 That his duties are partly judicial
	      and  partly other does not in any way  detract
	      from  the	 position  that while  acting  as  a
	      Magistrate he is a judicial officer."
</p><p id="p_390">Further,  the  Bench  agreed  with  the	 view  expressed  by
Bachawat,  J.  that a Magistrate holds a  'judicial  office'
dissenting  from  the  view taken by  Banerjee,	 J.  that  a
Magistrate  could not be said to hold judicial office.	 See
Shree Hanuman Foundries v. H.R. Deb1O5.
</p><p id="p_391">314. Recently,	this  Court in <a href="/doc/868559/" id="a_607">Shri Kumar  Padma  Prasad  v.
Union  of  India106</a> has observed as follows : (SCC  p.	445,
para 22)
	      "The  expression 'judicial office' in  generic
	      sense  may  include wide	variety	 of  offices
	      which are connected with the administration of
	      justice  in one way or the other.	  Under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_608">	 the
	      Criminal	 Procedure  Code</a>,  1973	 powers	  of
	      judicial	Magistrate can be conferred  on	 any
	      person who holds or has held any office  under
	      the  Government.	 Officers  holding   various
	      posts  under  the executive are  often  vested
	      with   the  Magisterial  powers  to   meet   a
	      particular situation."
</p><p id="p_392">After having thus observed, the learned Judges went  further
to the question with regard to the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1120401/" id="a_609">Article
217(2)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/1086036/" id="a_610">236(b)</a> and so on which are not germane for the
determination of the question with which we are	 confronted.
See also  <a href="/doc/67871/" id="a_611">Chandra Mohan v.State of Up</a>.107
</p><p id="p_393">315. In	 this  context,	 we  feel that	it  would  be  quite
significant to recall the opinion of a Constitution Bench in
<a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_612">Ram  Jawaya  Kapur  v. State of Punjab108</a>.   In	 that  case,
Mukherjea,  C.J. while dealing with the scope of  separation
of powers has observed thus : (AIR at p. 556)
	      "The   Indian  Constitution  has	not   indeed
	      recognised  the  doctrine	 of  separation	  of
	      powers  in  its  absolute	 rigidity  but	 the
	      functions	 of the different parts or  branches
	      of  the  Government  have	 been	sufficiently
	      differentiated  and consequently it  can	very
	      well  be said that our Constitution  does	 not
	      contemplate  assumption, by one organ or	part
	      of  the State, of functions  that	 essentially
	      belong  to another.  The executive indeed	 can
	      exercise	 the  powers  of   departmental	  or
	      subordinate  legislation when such powers	 are
	      delegated it by the legislature.
</p><p id="p_394">	      It  can  also,  when  so	empowered,  exercise
	      judicial	functions  in a	 limited  way.	 The
	      executive	 Government, however, can  never  go
	      against the provisions of the Constitution  or
	      of any law.  This is clear from the provisions
	      of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_613">Article 154</a> of the Constitution but, as  we
	      have  already stated, it does not follow	from
	      this that in order to enable the executive  to
	      function	there  must  be	 a  law	 already  in
	      existence and that the powers of the executive
	      are  limited  merely to the  carrying  out  of
	      these laws.

	      The   limits   within  which   the   executive
	      Government  can  function	 under	the   Indian
	      Constitution  can be ascertained without	much
	      difficulty  by  reference to the form  of	 the
	      executive	 which our Constitution has set	 up.
	      Our   Constitution,  though  federal  in	 its
	      structure,   is	modeled	  on   the   British
	      Parliamentary  system where the  executive  is
	      deemed to have the primary responsibility	 for
	      the formulation of governmental policy and its
	      transmission  into  law though  the  condition
	      precedent	   to	the   exercise	  of	this
	      responsibility is its retaining the confidence
	      of the legislative branch of the State."
</p><p id="p_397">316. In	 view of the discussions made above and also in	 the
light  of the principles laid down in the various  decisions
cited  above, we hold that the Executive  Magistrates  while
exercising their judicial or quasi-judicial functions though
in  a limited way within the frame<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_614"> of the Code</a>	of  Criminal
Procedure,  which judicial functions are normally  performed
by  Judicial  Magistrates  can be held	to  be	holding	 the
judicial  office.  Therefore, the contention of the  learned
counsel	 that  the conferment of judicial functions  on	 the
Executive  Magistrates and Special Executive Magistrates  is
opposed to the fundamental principle of governance contained
in  <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_615">Article 50</a> of the Constitution cannot  be  countenanced.
Resultantly,  we hold that sub-section (3) of Section 20  of
the TADA Act does not offend either <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_616">Article 14</a> or <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_617">Article 21</a>
and  hence  this  sub-section  does  not  suffer  from	 any
constitutional invalidity.
</p><p id="p_398">317. Though   we   are	 holding  that	 this	section	  is
constitutionally   valid,  we,	in  order  to	remove	 the
apprehension  expressed	 by  the learned  counsel  that	 the
Executive Magistrates and the Special Executive	 Magistrates
who  are  under the control of the State may not  be  having
judicial  integrity  and independence as  possessed  by	 the
Judicial  Magistrates and the recording of  confessions	 and
statements  by those Executive Magistrates may not  be	free
from any possible oblique motive, are of the opinion that it
would be always desirable and appreciable that a  confession
or  statement  of  a  person is	 recorded  by  the  Judicial
Magistrate   whenever	the  Magistrate	 is   available	  in
preference  to	the Executive Magistrates  unless  there  is
compelling  and justifiable reason to get the confession  or
statement,  recorded by the Executive or  Special  Executive
Magistrates.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_106">	       (c) sub-section (2-A) thereof shall be deemed

</blockquote><p id="p_401">319. The modification in sub-section (4)(a) of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_621">Section 20</a> is
in  the same line of sub-section (3); in that the  Executive
Magistrate and the Special Executive Magistrate are included
along  with the Judicial Magistrate.  Therefore, whenever  a
person	is arrested for an offence under the  provisions  of
TADA  Act, the arrestee can be transmitted to  the  Judicial
Magistrate  or	the  Executive	Magistrate  or	the  Special
Executive Magistrate though the transmission of the  accused
under <a href="/doc/593844/" id="a_622">Section 167(1)</a> for other offenses is still only to the
Judicial  Magistrate.	It may be recalled that	 under	sub-
section	 (2A) of <a href="/doc/593844/" id="a_623">Section 167</a>, a police officer can  transmit
the copy of the entry in the diary relating to the case	 and
forward	 the  accused  arrested	 normally  to  the  Judicial
Magistrate  and	 when  he is not  available,  to  a  nearest
Executive Magistrate who is empowered to authorise detention
only for a specified period not exceeding seven days in	 the
aggregate.   But  by  the modification	of  <a href="/doc/593844/" id="a_624">Section  167</a>  in
relation  to sub-section (4)(a) of Section 20 of  TADA	Act,
the Executive Magistrate or Special Executive Magistrate can
perform all the powers of a Judicial Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_402">320. Under   sub-section   (4)(b)   of	 <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_625">Section   20</a>,	 the
modification  is  only	with  reference	 to  the  period  of
detention of the accused in custody.  As per <a href="/doc/593844/" id="a_626">Section 167(2)</a>,
the Magistrate is authorised to detain the accused from time
to  time,  in such custody as he thinks fit for a  term	 not
exceeding  fifteen  days  on the whole	but  the  period  of
fifteen	 days  now  is	extended  to  sixty  days  and	 the
authorisation	of  the	 detention  of	an  accused   person
otherwise than in the custody of police can be up to  ninety
days   where  the  investigation  relates  to	an   offence
punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment
for  a term of not less than ten years and sixty days  where
the  investigation relates to any other offence.  The  words
'ninety	 days'	and 'sixty days' are construed to  be  under
clause	(b)  of sub-<a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_627">section 4</a> as 'one year' and	 'one  year'
respectively.  However, by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_628">Amendment Act</a> 43 of 1993, one
year  period is reduced to one hundred and eighty  days	 but
subject	 to  the newly introduced proviso where	 under	'one
hundred and eighty days' can be extended up to 'one year' on
the  report of Public Prosecutor indicating the progress  of
the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention
beyond	the  said period of 'one hundred and  eighty  days'.
The extended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">698</span>
period of remand of one year now reduced to one hundred	 and
eighty	days,  subject to the proviso, is  attacked  on	 the
ground that this extended period of detention of an  accused
is  not in tune with the spirit of the doctrine	 of   speedy
trial'.	   This	 criticism  is	resisted  by   the   learned
Additional  Solicitor  General stating that in view  of	 the
activities  of terrorists and disruptionists  covering	wide
range  of  area both domestically  and	internationally	 the
extended  period of detention is justifiably required  since
it is not possible to complete	   the investigation  within
a shorter period.
</p><p id="p_403">321. Be that as it may, the other scathing attack is that by
availing  the extended period of detention, the	 prosecution
makes  the  accused not only languish in  incarceration	 but
also  denies the right to get bail within that	period.	  We
will  deal  with  the  second  attack  while  disposing	 the
contention in relation to sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_629">Section 20</a>.
</p><p id="p_404">322. For the reasons mentioned in the preceding part of	 the
judgment while disposing the submission made with  reference
to sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_630">Section 20</a>, we hold that the criticism
that  the  inclusion  of Executive  Magistrate	and  Special
Executive  Magistrate in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/593844/" id="a_631">Section  167</a>  is
with  an  ulterior motive, cannot be countenanced  and	this
provision cannot be said to be unconstitutional.
</p><p id="p_405">323. In view of this finding, the conclusion in Bimal Kaur58
that "clause

</p><p id="p_412">327. It is needless to emphasise that both the Parliament as
well   as  the	State  Legislatures  have  got	 legislative
competence to enact any law relating to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_641"> the Code</a> of Criminal
Procedure.   No provision relating to anticipatory bail	 was
in the old Code and it was introduced for the first time  in
the  present  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_642">Code  of</a> 1973 on the suggestion  made  of	 the
Forty-first  Report  of	 the Law Commission  and  the  Joint
Committee  Report.   It may be noted that  this	 section  is
completely omitted in the State of Uttar Pradesh by  <a href="/doc/811293/" id="a_643">Section
9</a>   of	the  Code  of  Criminal	 Procedure  (Uttar   Pradesh
Amendment) Act, 1976 <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_644">(U.P. Act</a> No. 16 of 1976) w.e.f. 28-11-
1975.	In the State of West Bengal, proviso is inserted  to
<a href="/doc/1144664/" id="a_645">Section	 438(1)</a> of the Code w.e.f. 24-12-1988 to the  effect
that no final order shall be made on an application filed by
the accused praying for anticipatory bail in relation to  an
offence	 punishable  with death, imprisonment  for  life  or
imprisonment  for  a  term of not  less	 than  seven  years,
without giving the State not less than seven days' notice to
present	 its case.  In the State of Orissa, by Section 2  of
Orissa	Act 11 of 1988 w.e.f. 28-6-1988, a proviso is  added
to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_646">Section 438</a> stating that no final order shall be made  on
an  application	 for anticipatory bail	without	 giving	 the
State notice to present its case for offence punishable with
death,	imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term  of
not less than seven years.
</p><p id="p_413">328. It is relevant to note one of the reasons given by	 the
Law   Commission  for  its  suggestions	 to  introduce	 the
provision  for	anticipatory bail, that	 reason	 being	"...
where there are reasonable grounds for holding that a person
accused of an offence is not likely to abscond, or otherwise
misuse	 his   liberty	while  on  bail,  there	  seems	  no
justification  to  require him first to submit	to  custody,
remain in prison for some days and then apply for bail".  To
put it differently, it can be deduced from the reasoning  of
the Report of the Law Commission that where a person accused
of a non-bailable offence is likely to abscond or  otherwise
misuse his liberty while on bail, will have no justification
to claim the benefit for anticipatory bail.  Can it be	said
with certainty that terrorists and disruptionists who create
terrorism and disruption and inject sense of insecurity, are
not likely to abscond or misuse their liberty if released on
anticipatory bail.  Evidently, the Parliament has thought it
fit  not  to  extend  the benefit of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_647">Section  438</a>  to	such
offenders.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">700</span>
<p id="p_414">329. Further,  at  the risk of repetition, we may  add	that
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_648">Section	 438</a> is a new provision incorporated in the  present
Code creating a new right.  If that new right is taken away,
can it be said that the removal of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_649">Section 438</a> is  violative
of  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_650">Article 21.</a>	 In Gurbaksh Singh109, there is no  specific

</p><p id="p_415">330. Hence  for the aforementioned reasons, the attack	made
on  the	 validity of sub-section (7) of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_653">Section	 20</a>  has  to

this amendment was necessary keeping in view the  prevailing

According to him, it was in order to meet the  deteriorating

</p><p id="p_422">     335.  The construction of the above  sub-section  which
imposes severe limitations on the grant of bail in  addition
to the limitations contained in	 <a href="/doc/1682361/" id="a_670">Section 437(3)</a> of the Code,
has  led  to a fiery articulation by both the  parties.	  Of

pass  an  order either	granting or denying  bail.  As	sub-
section (9) which in term provides that the  limitations  on

for the time being in force on	   granting of bail,  serves
as a qualifying provision to sub-section (8), it has  become
imperative  while interpreting sub-section (8)	to  construe
sub-section (9) also along with sub-section (8).  Therefore,
we would like to reproduce both the sub-sections (8) and (9)
of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_673">Section 20</a> hereunder :
</p><p id="p_423"> "(8)  Notwithstanding anything	 contained  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_674">

	      not  likely  to commit any  offence  while  on

</p><p id="p_426">	      (9)   The	 limitations  on  granting  of	bail

</p><p id="p_427">336. Much earlier to the enactment of the Acts of 1984, 1985
and 1987,      there  was a similar provision, namely,	Rule
184  of	 the Defence and Internal Security of  India  Rules,
1971  (for  short  'Rules of 1971) (with which	we  are	 not
concerned otherwise).  It ran as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_108">	      "Notwithstanding	anything  contained  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_676">	 the

	      no   person   accused  or	  convicted   of   a

</p><p id="p_430">337. Sub-section  (8)  of <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_677">Section 20</a> commences with  a	non-
obstante  clause  as  in  Rule 184  of	the  Rules  of	1971
(referred  to above) and in its operation imposes a  ban  on
release	 on  bail  of  a  person  accused  of  any   offence
punishable  under the TADA Act or any rule  made  thereunder
unless	the two conditions specified in clauses (a) and	 (b)
of that sub-section are satisfied.
</p><p id="p_431">338. In	 relation  to  the  question  involved,	 a  lot	  of
arguments were advanced at the bar and voluminous  decisions
were  relied  upon.  It is the common grievance of  all	 the
counsel	 assailing this provision that whilst <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_678">Section  20(7)</a>
makes  <a href="/doc/1144664/" id="a_679">Section	438</a> of the Code inoperative,  <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_680">Section  20(8)</a>
makes the grant of bail as an impossible one.  According  to
them,	an   overgenerous  infusion   of   constraints	 and
restrictions as well as unreasonable restrictions which	 are
not  found in any of the bail provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_681"> of the	 Code</a>,	have
made  this  provision as prescribing a	procedure  which  is
unjust and unfair.
</p><p id="p_432">339..Mr V.M. Tarkunde impugns this provision contending that
this  subsection  infringes  the  underlying  principle	  of
Articles  21  and 14 of the Constitution as  the  manifested
intention  of  this provision make impossible  for  even  an
innocent person to get bail when he is falsely charged	with
an offence under the TADA Act.	When the salutary  principle
of  criminal justice is that every person is presumed to  be
innocent  till	he is proved to be  guilty,  this  provision
under	challenge  goes	 diametrically	contrary   to	that
principle.   Placing reliance on the decision  in  <a href="/doc/656741/" id="a_682">Gudikanti
Narasimhulu v. Public Prosecutor111</a> wherein Krishna Iyer, J.
has commenced his judgment with a prefatory note reading,  "
'Bail  or jail?'  at the pretrial or post-conviction  stage
belongs	 to the blurred area of the criminal justice  system
and  largely  hinges on the hunch of  the  Bench,  otherwise
called judicial discretion" and observed, "The	significance
and  sweep of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_683">Article 21</a> make the deprivation of  liberty  a
matter	of grave concern and permissible only when  the	 law

goals  of  community good and State necessity spelt  out  in
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_684">Article	 19"-</a>  Mr Tarkunde asserts that	 this  provision  is
totally in violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_685">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_433">340. Mr Jethmalani attacks this provision contending that it
is  the most obnoxious and unfair provision,  requiring	 the
court  to certify that "the accused is not likely to  commit
any  offence  while  on bail".	He pleads  to  declare	this
clause as unconstitutional, based on the observation of	 the
Full Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bimal Kaur58.
</p><p id="p_434">341. The  learned Additional Solicitor General	attempts  to
meet  the above arguments stating that there is no  question
of  unconstitutionality	 of the provision and in  fact,	 the
conditions imposed under clause (b) of sub-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">703</span>
section	  (8)  is  in  consonance  with	  the	requirements
prescribed under clauses (i) and (ii) of sub-section (1)  of
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_686">Section	 437</a>  and  clause (b) of  sub-section  (3)  of	that
section.  In any event, according to him, the conduct of  an
accused	 seeking bail in the context of his  background	 and
the nature of crime committed are to be evaluated before the
concession of bail can be granted and that the evaluation is
fundamentally  from the point of view of his  likelihood  of
either tampering with the evidence or unleashing a threat to
the  society during the period when he may be allowed to  be
on  bail.   He also quotes another  observation	 of  Krishna
Iyer, J. in Gudikanti111 in support of his submission  which
reads: (SCR at p. 376: SCC p. 245, para 12)
	      "All  deprivation of liberty is  validated  by
	      social defence and individual correction along
	      an anti-criminal direction.  Public justice is
	      central  to  the	whole scheme  of  bail	law.
</p><p id="p_435">	      Fleeing justice must be forbidden but punitive
	      harshness	 should be minimised. ... No  seeker
	      of justice shall play confidence tricks on the
	      court or community."
</p><p id="p_436">342. Sub-section (8) which imposes a complete ban on release
on  bail against the accused of an offence punishable  under
this Act minimises or dilutes that ban under two conditions,
those  being  (1)  the Public Prosecutor must  be  given  an
opportunity to oppose the bail application for such release;
and  (2)  where	 the  Public  Prosecutor  opposes  the	bail
application  the  court	 must  be  satisfied  that  the	 two
conditions,  namely,  (a) there are reasonable	grounds	 for
believing  that	 the person accused is not  guilty  of	such
offence and (b) he is not likely to commit any offence while
on  bail.  Sub-section (9) qualifies sub-section (8) to	 the
effect	that the above two limitations imposed on  grant  of
bail  specified	 in sub-section (8) are in addition  to	 the
limitations  under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_687">  the Code</a> or any other law for  the	time
being in force on granting of bail.  <a href="/doc/1517318/" id="a_688">Section 436</a> of the Code
provides for grant of bail to a person accused of a bailable
offence, while <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_689">Section 437</a> provides for grant of bail to any
accused	 of,  or suspected of, the commission  of  any	non-
bailable  offence.  Nonetheless, sub-section (1) of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_690">Section
437</a> imposes certain fetters on the exercise of the powers of
granting  bail on fulfillment of two conditions, namely	 (1)
if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has
been   guilty  of  an  offence	punishable  with  death	  or
imprisonment for life; and (2) if the offence complained  of
is  a  cognizable  offence and that  the  accused  had	been
previously  convicted of an offence punishable	with  death,
imprisonment  for  life or imprisonment for seven  years  or
more or he had previously convicted on two or more occasions
of a non-bailable and cognizable offence.  Of course,  these
two  conditions	 are subject to three provisos	attached  to
sub-section  (1) of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_691">Section 437</a>.  But we are not  very	much
concerned  about the provisos.	However, sub-section (3)  of
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_692">Section	 437</a>  gives discretion to the court  to	 grant	bail
attached  with some conditions if it considers necessary  or
in  the	 interest of justice.  For proper  understanding  of
those	conditions  or	limitations  to	 which	 two   other
conditions  under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (8)  of

Memon v. State Of Gujarat53</a>, with which we are in agreement:
(SCC pp. 286-287, para 19)
	      "Though	there	is  no	 express   provision
	      excluding the applicability of <a href="/doc/1667941/" id="a_699">Section 439</a>  of

	      punishable  under	 the Act or  any  rule	made
	      thereunder, but that result must, by necessary
	      implication,  follow.   It is  true  that	 the
	      source of power of a Designated Court to grant
	      bail  is	not <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_701">Section 20(8)</a> of the Act  as  it
	      only  places limitations on such power.	This
	      is made explicit by <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_702">Section 20(9)</a> which enacts
	      that  the	 limitations  on  granting  of	bail
	      specified in <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_703">Section 20(8)</a> are 'in addition to
	      the  limitations under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_704"> the Code</a> or  any  other

	      <a href="/doc/1667941/" id="a_705">Section 439</a> of the Code.	It cannot be doubted

	      the  meaning of <a href="/doc/1682361/" id="a_706">Section 437</a> of the Code.	 The
	      exercise	of  the	 power to grant	 bail  by  a

Balchand112 Bhagwati, J. (as the learned Chief Justice	then
was)  speaking for the Bench observed as follows :  (SCC  p.
577, para 3)
	      "The Rule, on its plain terms, does not confer
	      any  power  on the Court to release  a  person
	      accused  or convicted of contravention of	 any
	      Rule  or order made under the Rules, on  bail.
	      It  postulates the existence of power  in	 the
	      Court under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_716"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure and
	      seeks  to	 place	a curb on  its	exercise  by
	      providing	 that a person accused or  convicted
	      of  contravention	 of any Rule or	 order	made
	      under  the Rules, if in custody, shall not  be
	      released	on  bail unless	 the  aforesaid	 two
	      conditions are satisfied.	 It imposed  fetters
	      on the exercise of the power of granting	bail
	      in  certain  kinds of cases and  removes	such
	      fetters  on fulfillment of the  aforesaid	 two
	      conditions.   When  these two  conditions	 are
	      satisfied,  the  fetters are removed  and	 the
	      power of granting bail possessed by the  Court
	      under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_717">  the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure  revives
	      and  becomes  exercisable.   The	non-obstante
	      clause  at the commencement of the  Rule	also
	      emphasises  that the provision in the Rule  is
	      intended	to  restrict the power	of  granting
	      bail under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_718"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure	 and
	      not to confer a new power exercisable only  on
	      certain  conditions.   It is not	possible  to
	      read Rule 184 as laying down a  self-contained
	      code  for	 grant of bail in case of  a  person
	      accused  or convicted of contravention of	 any
			    Rule or order made under the Rules so that the
	      power to grant bail in such case must be found
	      only  in	Rule  184 and not  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_719">  the  Code</a>  of
	      Criminal	 Procedure.   Rule  184	 cannot	  be
	      construed	  as   displacing   altogether	 the
	      provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_720">  of the Code</a> of Criminal  Procedure
	      in regard to bail in case of a person  accused
	      or  convicted of contravention of any Rule  or
	      order made under the Rules.  These  provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_721">
	      of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure must be read
	      along  with Rule 184 and full effect  must  be
	      given to them except in so far as they are, by

</p><p id="p_447">	      23)
	      "Further, while it is true that Chapter XXXIII
	      of  the Code is still preserved  as  otherwise
	      the  Designated Courts would have no power  to
	      grant  bail, still the source of power is	 not
	      <a href="/doc/1667941/" id="a_725">Section 439</a> of the Code but <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_726">Section 437</a>  being
	      a court other than the High Court or the Court
	      of  Session.  Any other view would lead to  an
	      anomalous	 situation.  If it were to  be	held
	      that the power of a Designated Court to  grant
	      bail  was	 relatable to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_727">Section 439</a>  it  would
	      imply  that not only the High Court  but	also
	      the  Court  of Session would  be	entitled  to
	      grant  bail  on such terms as they  deem	fit.
</p><p id="p_448">	      The  power to grant bail under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_728">Section 439</a>  is
	      unfettered  by any conditions and	 limitations
	      like <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_729">Section 437</a>.	 It would run counter to the
	      express prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_730">Section 20(8)</a>
	      of the Act which enjoins that  notwithstanding
	      anything in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_731"> the Code</a>, no person accused of  an
	      offence  punishable under the Act or any	rule
	      made  thereunder	shall,	if  in	custody,  be
	      released	on  bail unless the  conditions	 set
	      forth  in clauses (a) and (b)  are  satisfied.
	      Lastly, both the decision in Balchand  Jain112
	      and that in Ishwar Chand113 turn on the scheme
	      of the Defence and Internal Security of  India
			    Act, 1971.	They proceed on the well recognise
d
	      principle	 that an ouster of  jurisdiction  of
	      the  ordinary  courts  is not  to	 be  readily
	      inferred	except	by express provision  or  by
	      necessary implication.  It all depends on	 the
	      scheme of the particular Act as to whether the
	      power  of	 the  High Court and  the  Court  of
	      Session  to grant bail under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_732">Sections 438</a>	 and
	      <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_733">439</a>  exists.  We must accordingly	 uphold	 the
	      view  expressed by the High Court that it	 had
	      no  jurisdiction to entertain  an	 application
	      for  bail under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_734">Section 439</a> or  under  <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_735">Section
	      482</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_449">	      That   takes  us	to  the	 approach  which   a
	      Designated  Court has to adopt while  granting
	      bail in view of the limitations placed on such
	      power under <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_736">Section 20(8)</a>.  The sub-section in
	      terms  places  fetters  on  the  power  of   a
	      Designated  Court on granting of bail and	 the
	      limitations specified therein are in  addition
	      to the limitations under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_737"> the Code</a>."
</p><p id="p_450">348.	  We  are  in  full agreement with  the	 above	view
expressed  by  the learned Judges in Usmanbhai53.   In	that
case,  this  Court finally set aside the  orders  passed  by
various	 Designated  Courts and remitted the  cases  with  a
direction  that the Designated Courts should  consider	each
particular  case on merit as to whether it fell	 within	 the
purview	 of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_738">Section 3</a> and/or Section 4 of the TADA  of	1987
and if so whether the accused in the facts and circumstances
of the case were entitled to bail, while keeping in view the
limitations  on the powers of the court under <a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_739">Section  20(8)</a>

in  consonance with the conditions prescribed under  clauses

</p><p id="p_454">(b)  of	 sub-section (3) of that section.   Similar  to	 the
conditions  in	clause	(b) of sub-section  (8),  there	 are
provisions  in	various other enactments  such	as  <a href="/doc/1456244/" id="a_742">Section
35(1)</a> of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and <a href="/doc/276692/" id="a_743">Section  104(1)</a>

reason	to  believe that any person in India or	 within	 the
Indian	customs	 waters	 has  been  guilty  of	an   offence
punishable  under  the	respective  Acts,  may	arrest	such
person.	  Therefore, the condition that "there	are  grounds
for  believing that he is not guilty of an  offence",  which
condition  in different form is incorporated in	 other	Acts
such as clause (i) of <a href="/doc/1682361/" id="a_744">Section 437(1)</a> of the Code and Section
35(1) of FERA and 104(1) of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_745">Customs Act</a>, cannot be	said
to be an unreasonable condition infringing the principle  of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_746">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_457">351. No	 doubt,	 liberty  of a	citizen	 must  be  zealously
safeguarded  by	 the courts; nonetheless  the  courts  while
dispensing justice in cases like the one under the TADA Act,
should keep in mind not only the liberty of the accused	 but
also the interest of the victim and their near and dear	 and
above  all the collective interest of the community and	 the
safety of the nation so that the public may not loose  faith
in  the	 system of judicial administration  and	 indulge  in
private retribution.
</p><p id="p_458">352. It is true that on many occasions, we have come  across
cases  wherein	the prosecution	 unjustifiably	invokes	 the
provisions  of	the  TADA  Act with  an	 oblique  motive  of
depriving the accused persons from getting bail and in	some
occasions  when	 the courts are inclined to  grant  bail  in
cases	registered   under  ordinary   criminal	  law,	 the
investigating officers in order to circumvent the  authority
of  the courts invoke the provisions of the TADA Act.	This
kind  of invocation of the provisions of TADA in cases,	 the
facts  of which do not warrant, is nothing but sheer  misuse
and  abuse  of the Act by the police.	Unless,	 the  public
prosecutors rise to the occasion and discharge their onerous
responsibilities  keeping in mind that they are	 prosecutors
on  behalf of the public but not the police and	 unless	 the
Presiding Officers of the Designated Courts discharge  their
judicial  functions keeping in view the	 fundamental  rights
particularly  of  the personal right and  liberty  of  every
citizen as enshrined in the Constitution to which they	have
been  assigned	the  role of sentinel on the  qui  vive,  it
cannot be said that the provisions of TADA Act are  enforced
effectively in consonance with the legislative intendment.

indicted  of an offence under the TADA Act to  approach	 the
High Court for bail under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_749">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India.	Some of the High Courts have taken the view that the
jurisdiction  of  the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_750">Article 226</a>  of	 the
Constitution to entertain bail applications and pass  orders
in cases registered under the provisions of TADA cannot,  in
any  way,  be taken away or whittled down.   In	 fact,	bail
applications  are  freely entertained by some  High  Courts.
Relating  to  this  question, we would like to	refer  to  a
decision  of  a Division Bench of the Bombay High  Court  in
<a href="/doc/822085/" id="a_751">Rafiq Abid Patel v. Inspector of Police, Thane115</a>.  In	that
case, the learned Judges disagreeing with the view taken  by

</p><p id="p_462">355. In	 Usmanbhai53  one of the  questions  of	 substantial

recourse  to  its  inherent powers under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_755">Section  482</a>  to  a
person held in custody accused of an offence under  Sections
3  and 4 of the TADA Act of 1987, During the course  of	 the

whether	 a  bail application can be moved  before  the	High

Maharashtra v. Abdul Hamid Haji Mohammed117</a> after  examining
a question regarding the justification of the High Court  to
exercise its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_766">Article 226</a> for quashing the
prosecution for an offence punishable under the TADA Act has
observed thus : (SCC pp. 669-70, para 7)
	      "...  It is no doubt true that in	 an  extreme
	      case  if	the  only  accusation  against	 the
	      respondent prosecuted in the Designated  Court
	      in accordance with the provisions of TADA	 Act
	      is such that ex facie it cannot constitute  an
	      offence  punishable under TADA Act,  then	 the
	      High  Court may be justified in  invoking	 the
	      power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_767">Article 226</a> of the Constitution on
	      the  ground that the detention of the  accused
	      is  not under the provisions of TADA Act.	  We
	      may hasten to add that this can happen only in
	      extreme  cases  which would be rare  and	that
	      power of the High Court is not exercisable  in
	      cases  like  the	present	 where	it  may	  be
	      debatable	 whether the direct accusation	made
	      in    conjunction	   with	   the	   attendant
	      circumstances, if proved to be true, is likely
	      to  result in conviction for an offence  under

	      for  the	High Court in the  present  case  to
	      exercise it jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_768">Article 226</a>  of

	      TADA Act."
</p><p id="p_465">After observing thus, the Court finally concluded : (SCC  p.
671, para 10)
	      "The  view  taken by the High  Court  on	this
	      aspect  is  contrary to law apart	 from  being
	      unjustified  and impermissible in exercise  of

no  jurisdiction  in  matters relating	to  TADA  provisions

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">710</span>

</p><p id="p_467">359. Though  the  High Courts have very	 wide  powers  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_778">Article	 226</a>, the very vastness of the powers imposes on  it
the  responsibility to use them with circumspection  and  in
accordance   with  the	judicial  consideration	  and	well
established  principles.   The legislative history  and	 the
object	of TADA Act indicate that the special Act  has	been
enacted	 to  meet challenges arising out  of  terrorism	 and
disruption.  Special provisions are enacted in the Act	with
regard	to  the grant of bail and appeals arising  from	 any
judgment,  sentence  or order (not  being  an  interlocutory
order) of a Designated Court etc.  The overriding effect  of
the provisions of the Act (i.e. Section 25 of TADA Act)	 and
the  Rules  made thereunder and the non-obstante  clause  in
<a href="/doc/1577106/" id="a_779">Section	 20(7)</a> reading, "Notwithstanding anything  contained
in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_780">  the	 Code</a>...... clearly postulate that  in	granting  of
bail,	the   special  provisions  alone  should   be	made
applicable.   If  any party is aggrieved by the	 order,	 the
only  remedy under the Act is to approach the Supreme  Court
by  way	 of an appeal.	If the High  Courts  entertain	bail
applications invoking their extraordinary jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_781">Article 226</a> and pass orders, then the very scheme and object
of  the	 Act and the intendment of the Parliament  would  be
completely defeated and frustrated.  But at the same time it
cannot	be said that the High Courts have  no  jurisdiction.
Therefore,  we	totally agree with the view  taken  by	this
Court  in  Abdul Hamid Haji Mohammed' 17 that  if  the	High
Court is inclined to entertain any application under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_782">Article
226</a>, that power should be exercised most sparingly and	only
in  rare  and appropriate cases	 in  extreme  circumstances.
What   those   rare  cases  are	 and  what  would   be	 the
circumstances	that  would  justify  the  entertaining	  of
applications  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_783">Article 226</a> cannot be  put	 in  strait-
jacket.	  However,  we	would  like  to	 emphasise  and	 re-
emphasise that the judicial discipline and comity of  courts
require that the High Courts should refrain from  exercising
their  jurisdiction  in entertaining  bail  applications  in
respect	 of an accused indicted under the special Act  since
this  Court  has jurisdiction to interfere and	correct	 the
orders	of  the	 High  Courts  under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_784">Article  136</a>  of	 the
Constitution.

</p><p id="p_469">360. Though  no	 oral  argument has  been  advanced  by	 the
learned counsel challenging the validity of this  provision,
since  we are scrutinising the entire Act, we feel  that  it
would  be  better  if our view on  this	 provision  is	also
recorded.  However, Mr Jethmalani in his written submissions
has  stated that this section is unintelligible and that  it
is  quite impossible to identify any person on the basis  of

submission.
</p><p id="p_470">361. If	 the  evidence regarding the identification  on	 the
basis  of a photograph is to be held to have the same  value
as  the	 evidence of a test identification parade,  we	feel
that  gross  injustice	to  the	 detriment  of	the  persons
suspected may result.  Therefore, we are inclined to  strike
down  this provision and accordingly we strike down  <a href="/doc/1021266/" id="a_786">Section
22</a> of the Act.

Act
</p><p id="p_472">362. <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_789">Section  2(1)(i)</a>  of 1984 Act  defines  the  expression
"terrorist  affected  area" meaning an area  declared  as  a
terrorist affected area under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_790">Section 3</a>, and Section 2(1)(f)
of  TADA  Act of 1987 defines 'notified area'  meaning	such
area  as  the State Government may, by notification  in	 the
Official Gazette, specify.  We are given to understand	that
in  some of the States, the State Governments have  notified
almost	all the areas of the State as 'notified area'.	 But
no  notified  area  seems  to  have  been  renotified  after
notification.	Further,  nothing has been  brought  to	 our
notice	about the denotification of any area in	 any  State.
Therefore,  we	suggest that the  State	 Governments  should
review periodically and take decision either to denotify any
area  or  continue  the	 same as  'notified  area'  and	 act
accordingly.   The  Screening or Review Committee  which  we
have  suggested	 while dealing with <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_791">Section 15</a> of  the	1987
Act, may also be empowered by the respective Governments  to
scrutinise   the   prevailing	situations   and   to	make
recommendations	 to  the  State	 Governments,	recommending
either to continue or to discontinue the notification.	 Our
opinion	 in this regard may also be followed in the case  of
declaring any area as "terrorist affected area".
</p><p id="p_473">363. Before  formulating our conclusions, we would  like  to
express	 our  opinion  on  the role of	the  police  in	 the
implementation of these Acts.
</p><p id="p_474">364.  Lord Denning in his treatise, The Due Process  of	 Law
says:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_112">	      "In safeguarding our freedoms, the police play
	      a vital role.  Society for its defence needs a
	      well-led,	 well-trained  and  well-disciplined
	      force of police whom it can trust : and enough
	      of them to be able to prevent crime before  it
	      happens,	or if it does happen, to  detect  it
	      and bring the accused to justice.	 The police,
	      of course, must act properly.  They must obey the
	      rules of right conduct."
</blockquote><p id="p_475">365. It is heart-rending to note that day in and day out  we
come across with the	 news of blood-curdling incidents of
police	brutality  and	atrocities,  alleged  to  have	been
committed,  in	utter  disregard  and  in  all	breaches  of
humanitarian  law and universal human rights as well  as  in
total  negation of the constitutional guarantees  and  human
decency.   We  are  undoubtedly committed  to  uphold  human
rights	even  as  a part of long standing  heritage  and  as
enshrined  in  our constitutional law.	We  feel  that	this
perspective
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">712</span>
needs  to be kept in view by every law	enforcing  authority
because	 the recognition of the inherent dignity and of	 the
equal  and  inalienable	 rights	 of  the  citizens  is	 the
foundation  of freedom, justice and peace in the world.	  If
the human rights are outraged, then the court should set its
face  against such violation of human rights  by  exercising
its majestic judicial authority.
</p><p id="p_476">366. The  protection that the citizens enjoy under the	Rule
of  Law are the quintessence of two thousand years of  human
struggling  from  Adam.	  It is not  commonly  realised	 how
easily	this  may  be lost.  There is  no  known  method  of
retaining  them	 but  by eternal  vigilance.   There  is  no
institution to which the duty can be delegated except to the
judiciary.   If	 the law enforcing authority becomes  a	 law
breaker, it breeds contempt for law, it invites every man to
become a law unto himself and ultimately it invites anarchy.
</p><p id="p_477">367. Many  a  time in human history,  great  societies	have
crumbled into oblivion through their failure to realise	 the
significance  of  crisis situations operating  within  them.
True,  ours  is	 a  country which  stands  tallest  even  in
troubled  times,  the  country that  clings  to	 fundamental
principles  of human rights, the country that cherishes	 its
constitutional	heritage and rejects simple  solutions	that
compromise the values that lie at the root of our democratic
system.	 Each generation of mankind has considered its	(sic
own) perplexities and concerns to be unique and consequently
their fundamental demands are more :
</p><p id="p_478">the cry for justice
the longing for peace
and
the felt need for security
</p><p id="p_479">368. The  above	 are  to  maintain  the	 higher	 rhythms  of
pulsating democratic life in a constitutional order.

</p><p id="p_494">373. The   foundation	of  Indian  political	and   social
democracy,   as	  envisioned   in  the	 preamble   of	 the
Constitution,  rests  on  justice,  equality,  liberty,	 and
fraternity in secular and socialist republic in which  every
individual   has   equal  opportunity  to   strive   towards
excellence  and	 of his dignity of person in  an  integrated
egalitarian  Bharat.   Right  to justice  and  equality	 and
stated liberties which include freedom of expression, belief
and  movement  are the means for excellence.  The  right  to
life with human dignity of person is a fundamental right  of
every  citizen	for  pursuit of	 happiness  and	 excellence.
Personal  freedom is a basic condition for full	 development
of  human  personality.	  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_828">Article  21</a>  of  the	Constitution
protects right to life which is the most precious right in a
civilised  society.  The trinity i.e. liberty, equality	 and
fraternity always blossoms and enlivens the flower of  human
dignity.   One of the gifts of democracy to mankind  is	 the
right  to personal liberty.  Life and personal	freedom	 are
the  prized  jewels under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_829">Article 19</a> conjointly	 assured  by
Articles 20(3), 21 and 22 of the Constitution and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_830">Article 19</a>
ensures	 freedom of movement.  Liberty aims at	freedom	 not
only  from  arbitrary  restraint but  also  to	secure	such
conditions  which are essential for the full development  of
human personality.  Liberty is the essential concomitant for
other rights without which a man cannot be at his best.	 The
essence of all civil liberties is to keep alive the  freedom
of  the	 individual  subject to the  limitations  of  social
control	 envisaged  in diverse articles in  the	 chapter  of
Fundamental  Rights  Part III in harmony  with	social	good
envisaged  in  the Directive Principles in Part	 IV  of	 the
Constitution.  Freedom cannot last long unless it is coupled
with order.  Freedom can never exist without order.  Freedom
and order may coexist.	It is essential that freedom  should
be exercised under authority and order should be enforced by
authority   which  is  vested  solely  in   the	  executive.
Fundamental rights are the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">716</span>
means  and the directive principles are essential ends in  a
welfare State.	The evolution of the State from police State
to  a  welfare State is the ultimate  measure  and  accepted
standard   of	democratic  society  which  is	 an   avowed
constitutional mandate.	 Though one of the main functions of
the  democratic	 Government is to safeguard liberty  of	 the
individual,  unless  its  exercise  is	subject	 to   social
control,  it becomes anti-social or undermines the  security
of  the State.	The Indian democracy wedded to rule  of	 law
aims  not  only	 to protect the fundamental  rights  of	 its
citizens but also to establish an egalitarian social  order.
The  individual	 has  to grow  within  the  social  confines
preventing  his unsocial or unbridled growth which could  be
done by reconciling individual liberty with social  control.
Liberty	 must be controlled in the interest of	the  society
but the social interest must never be overbearing to justify
total  deprivation  of individual liberty.   Liberty  cannot
stand  alone  but must be paired with  a  companion  virtue;
liberty and morality; liberty and law; liberty and  justice;
liberty	 and common good; liberty and  responsibility  which
are concomitants for orderly progress and social  stability.
Man being a rational individual has to live in harmony	with
equal  rights  of  others  and	more  differently  for	 the
attainment of antithetic desires.  This intertwined  network
is difficult to delineate within defined spheres of  conduct
within which freedom of action may be confined.	  Therefore,
liberty would not always be an absolute licence but must arm
itself within the confines of law.  In other words there can
be no liberty without social restraint.	 Liberty, therefore,
as  a  social  conception is a right to be  assured  to	 all
members	 of a society.	Unless restraint is enforced on	 and
accepted by all members of the society, the liberty of	some
must  involve  the  oppression of  others.   If	 liberty  be
regarded a social order, the problem of establishing liberty
must  be  a problem of organising  restraint  which  society
controls  over the individual.	Therefore, liberty  of	each
citizen is borne of and must be subordinated to the  liberty
of  the greatest number, in other words common happiness  as
an  end	 of the society, lest lawlessness and  anarchy	will
tamper	social	weal  and harmony and  powerful	 courses  or
forces	would  be at work to undermine	social	welfare	 and
order.	 Thus the essence of civil liberty is to keep  alive
the  freedom of the individual subject to the limitation  of
social	control	 which could be adjusted  according  to	 the
needs of the dynamic social evolution.
</p><p id="p_495">374. The modem social evolution is the growing need to	keep
individual to be as free  as possible, consistent  with	 his
correlative obligation to the society.	According   to	  Dr
Ambedkar in his closing speech in the Constituent  Assembly,
the  principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are	 not
to  be treated as separate entities but in a trinity.	They
form  the union or trinity in the sense that to divorce	 one
from  the other is to defeat the very purpose of  democracy.
Liberty	 cannot be divorced from equality.  Equality  cannot
be  divorced from liberty.  Nor can equality and liberty  be
divorced  from fraternity.  Without equality, liberty  would
produce	 supremacy of law.  Equality without  liberty  would
kill individual initiative.  Without fraternity, liberty and
equality  would	 not  become a	natural	 course	 of  things.
Courts, as sentinel on the qui vive, therefore must strike a
balance between the changing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">717</span>
needs of the society for peaceful transformation with orders
and protection of the rights of the citizen.
</p><p id="p_496">     375.  As seen, one of the functions of the State is  to
maintain peace and	 order in the society.	As its part,
State  is not only the prosecutor of the offender  but	also
the investigator of crime.  To facilitate such investigation
police	has  been given wide powers to	arrest	the  suspect
without	 warrant,  interrogate him in  custody,	 search	 and
seize incriminating material, to collect the evidence and to
prosecute  the offender.  Deprivation of dignity of  person,
self-respect  and  inviolable right to life, would  only  be
within	the prescribed limits set down by laws;	 assiduously
supervised  by	courts; and executive excesses	strictly  be
limited.     Excessive	 authority   without   liberty	  is
intolerable.   Equally excessive liberty  without  authority
and  without responsibility soon becomes intolerable.	Lest
the  freedoms  and  fundamental	 rights	 become	 sacrificial
objects	 at the altar of expediency.   Unrestricted  liberty
makes life too easy for criminals and too difficult for	 law
abiding	 citizens.   In	 a  free  society  too	many  crooks
blatantly  break  the law, blight young	 lives,	 traffic  in
drugs and freely indulge in smuggling and claim	 fundamental
rights to exploit weak links of law, indulge in violence and
commercial  camouflage.	 Our values are	 drastically  eroded
because	 many  a  man with no more  moral  backbone  than  a
chocolate eclair claim the freedom	and   free    action
which  results	inevitably  in	increasing  the	 members  of
violent criminals.
</p><p id="p_497">376. The<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_831"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>, 1973 for short 'the  Code'
and its	  predecessor  occupied the field. Police have	been
empowered to carry out	 thorough   investigation,   as	  is
practicable  and  reasonable in a  cognizable	offence,  in
order  that  all relevant information and  facts  about	 the
allegations    of the crime are collected and placed for the
trial  of the offender within the limits set down by law.  A
suspect,  if  under arrest, be placed  as  expeditiously  as
possible  before  the  Magistrate  within  24  hours   after
excluding the time  taken  for journey. Though every  person
has social or statutory duty to assist	the	     police,
exceptions  have been engrafted and it is  a  constitutional
mandate	  under Articles 20(3) and 21 as a fundamental right
against	 self-incrimination.  <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_832">Article 3</a>	 of  Declaration  of
Human  Rights  assures	that everyone  has  right  to  life,
liberty and security of person. The constitutional and human
rights	  commitment,  therefore,  is that no one  shall  be
constrained to commit himself out of his own mouth. In other
words, the procedural checks are the valued means to prevent
excess and civilises the actions of the executive.  Articles
20(3)  and 21 accord, therefore, to every  person  privilege
against	 self-incrimination as part of right to	 life  which
reflects many of fundamental values, the notable ones  being
unwillingness  to subject those suspected of  crime  to	 the
cruel or inhuman treatment of self-accusation, and abuse  of
person.	 It  is	 a protection to the innocent or  may  be  a
shelter	 or  shield  to	 the  guilty  but  so  far  as	 the
constitutional	protection is available, its deprivation  is
permissible only in accordance with law consistent with	 the
mandate of Articles 20 to 22 of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">718</span>
<p id="p_498">377. Custodial interrogation exposes the suspect to the risk
of  abuse of his person or dignity as well as distortion  or
manipulation of his self incrimination in the crime.  No one
should	be subjected to physical violence of the  person  as
well  as  to torture.  Infringement thereof  undermines	 the
peoples'  faith in the efficacy of criminal justice  system.
Interrogation  in  police  lock-up  are	 often	done   under
conditions of pressure and tension and the suspect could  be
exposed	 to great strain even if he is innocent,  while	 the
culprit	 in  custody  to  hide or  suppress  may  be  doubly
susceptible  to	 confusion  and	 manipulation.	 A  delicate
balance	 has,  therefore, to be maintained  to	protect	 the
innocent from conviction and the need of the society to	 see
the  offender punished.	 Equally everyone has right  against
self-incrimination  and a right to be silent  under  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_833">Article
20(3)</a> which implies his freedom from police or anybody else.
But when the police interrogates a suspect, they abuse their
authority having unbridled opportunity to exploit his  moral
position  and  authority  inducing the	captive	 to  confess
against his better judgment.  The very fact that the  person
in  authority puts the questions and exerts pressure on	 the
captive	 to  comply  (sic).   Silence on  the  part  of	 the
frightened  captive seems to his ears to call for  vengeance
and  induces a belief that confession holds out a chance  to
avoid  torture	or  to	get bail  or  a	 promise  of  lesser
punishment.    The  resourceful	 investigator	adopts	 all
successful  tactics  to elicit confession  as  is  discussed
below.
</p><p id="p_499">378. In	 Confessions  : Recent Developments in	England	 and
Australia  by Kumar Amarasekara, Lecturer, Faculty  of	Law,
Manash	 University  [International  and   Comparative	 Law
Quarterly, Vol. 29, (1980) pp. 327-29] the exclusion of	 the
confession  on	the ground of oppressive  treatment  of	 the
accused	 is  stated  elaborately.  It  is  stated  that	 the
Criminal  Law Revisional Committee of Australia	 recommended
that use of oppressive treatment of the accused should be an
additional ground for excluding a confession.  Intimidation,
persistence,  sustained or undue insistence or pressure	 are
some   of  the	grounds	 which	can  render   a	  confession
involuntary.  The use of prolonged, sustained pressure on  a
suspect	 to  make him confess has long	been  recognised  in
Australia  as a ground of exclusion.  Whether such  pressure
was exerted by persistent interrogation or other means	such
as  inducing  mental and physical strain,  the	question  of
voluntariness  has  sometimes to be decided as a  matter  of
degree.	 In Confession and the Social Psychology of Coercion
by  Edwin D. Driver, Professor of Sociology,  University  of
Massachusetts  [1968-69 (Vol. 82) Harvard Law Review  42  at
pp.  48, 50-60], it is stated that voluntariness is  a	test
for  admissibility of confession.  Courts have	to  consider
mental	abuse  as  well	 as  physical  force  and   threats,
deficiencies   and  talents  peculiar  to   the	  individual
defendant are to be assessed, and an investigation into	 the
totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession  is
required  to be gone into.  Since in custody  interrogations
are  highly  secretive,	 the  courts  have  to	infer	what
transpired from questionable data.  Police adopt  successful
tactics for eliciting confessions; crucial importance is  of
self-confidence,   which   may	 not   remain	intact	  in
interrogation.	Barred are physical abuse or threats, mental
coercion,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">719</span>
lengthy detention or interrogations, inducements or promises
of  legal  gains  which are some of  the  grounds  to  infer
involuntariness.   In addition to the interrogation  setting
and  the  propensities	of  the	 interrogator,	the  ethical
interrogator  still has an adequate range of persuasive	 and
manipulative  tactics at his disposal to obtain	 confession.
First,	the interrogator, communicates by word	and  gesture
that  he  strongly believes the suspect	 guilty.   The	next
tactics	 is  to provide factual evidence in the	 support  of
this  belief.	It is, however,	 self-confidence  and  self-
assertion  which indigents, a category into which over	one-
half the felony defendants fall, are likely to lack; thus  a
majority of suspects in their passivity and uncertainty will
be  little  protected against the pressures of	even  proper
interrogation.	 Moreover, the imbalance between  the  State
and  the  defendant begins with arrest	and  detention,	 for
these experiences influence the detenu in ways analogous  to
interrogation,	the  negative implications of  silence,	 the
self-mortification or extreme humiliation at being arrested,
the desire to shield the self from potentially,	 humiliating
questioning  and the emotional stress caused by the  symbols
of  the	 law's authority even in persons  of  higher  status
would get lost.
</p><p id="p_500">379. In	 Crime and Confession by Arthur E.  Sutherland,	 Jr.
Professor  of Law, Harvard Law School [reported in  1965-66,
Vol. 79, Harvard Law Review pp. 21-25, 32, 35-37, 39-41, 93-
97]  stated  that  the zealous executive  agents  of  public
authority   must  demonstrate  the  suspect's	offence	  to
impartial  judicial  officers  and  people  insist  on	 the
correlative  principle	that  the  citizen  may	 stand	mute
without	 prejudice  in	the  face  of  official	 accusation.
Despite centuries of experience in which people have  chosen
thus  to weigh the scales in favour of the accused, many  of
those officers whom   people look to for the difficult	task
of  enforcing our criminal laws are "still not convinced  of
the  wisdom of adopting rightful means in interrogation	 and
eliciting  confessions.	  "It  is a nice  theory",  such  an
officer	 might say.  "We subscribe to this, at any rate	 for
those  wrongly accused.	 But when we get wicked men  in	 our
hands we cannot afford to let technicalities permit them  to
escape condign punishment." But the officers know of persons
in   some    way  connected  with  the	event,	 family	  or
associates,  persons seen in the vicinity, men with  records
suggesting  that  they are likely to have been	involved  in
offenses  of the sort in question .... Much worse  than	 the
conviction  of the innocent in its ultimate  consequence  is
the   undermining   of	public	confidence  in	 the   whole
administration of criminal justice, which ensues when public
officers  commit widespread violations of the  Constitutions
of  the United States and the States, and follow  these	 by
cynical	 accounts of "voluntariness", not convincing to	 any
person	who  studies  the  record, or  even  to	 the  casual
newspaper  reader and they would suspect the  constitutional
and  legal rights systematically (sic) deny them on  grounds
of  expediency,	 popular  respect for  the  system  for	 the
processes of law enforcement, and for the men engaged in  it
inevitably declines.  Crime is contagious, if the Government
becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites
every man to become a law unto himself; it invites  anarchy.
To  declare that in the administration of the  criminal	 law
the end justifies the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">720</span>
means  to declare that the Government may commit crimes	 in
order  to secure the conviction of a private criminal  would
bring  terrible	 retribution.	The only  effective  way  to
establish  a constitutional regime in the administration  of
criminal  justice  is for the  administrative  superiors  of
police	and  prosecutors  to insist  on	 compliance  of	 the
constitutional	mandate	 to see that  nothing  occurs  which
deprives  the  accused of a right which he  is	entitled  to
assert.	  The  Constitution of United States is	 a  law	 for
rulers	and people, equally in war and in peace, and  covers
with the shield of its protection all classes of men at	 all
times  and under all circumstances.  No doctrine,  involving
more  pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the	 wit
of  man	 than that any of its provisions  can  be  suspended
during	any of its grave exigencies of Government.   In	 the
Psychology of Evidence and Trial Procedure edited by Saul M.
Kassim and Lawrence S. Wrightsman at pp. 7880, it was stated
from  a psychological standpoint, that the suspects  readily
make false confession to escape an aversive situation and to
secure	a favorable self-outcome.  Interrogation process  is
like  hypnosis.	 He refers to Foster theory in	this  behalf
"station   house  syndrome"  at	 pp.  690-91   that   police
interrogation can produce a trance like state of  heightened
suggestibility	 so   that  "truth  and	  falsehood   become
hopelessly  confused in the suspect's mind".   He  explained
that due to hypnosis the suspect lose initiative and in	 the
heightened  fantasy, confabulation and distortion get  mixed
up  due to leading questions.  A study by Weistein  Abrahams
and  Subbons said to have revealed that implanting  a  false
sense of guilt by hypnosis would not pass a polygraphic	 lie
detector  test.	  He cited Munsterberg (1908)  Report  in  a
murder case in which the accused was convicted and  executed
on  the basis of a confession that might have been  elicited
through	 hypnotic induction that he raped Bessie  Hollister.
That  statement obtained through hypnosis was  subjected  to
medical	 analysis.  His statement was denied at	 the  trial,
namely, "I saw the flash of steel in front of me.  Then	 two
men  got before me.  I can remember no more than that  about
it.  I suppose I must have made those statements, since they
all  say  I  did.  But I have no knowledge  of	having	made
them."	It was proved later that those statements were	made
under  hypnosis.   Hugo Munsterberg and William	 James,	 the
renowned  psychologists	 noted	some  instances	 that  under
conditions  normally  associated  with	telling	 the  truth,
subject comes to believe the lies they had been inducted  to
tell.	The minimum of inducement and the mildest  and	most
subtle forms of coercion used could be sufficient to extract
false confession.  In 1991, Law Quarterly Review, Vol.	107)
"Should confessions be corroborated" by Rosemary Patenden of
University  of East Anglia it was stated at pp. 318-19	that
coercion is produced by situational factors  accusation	 by
a person in a position of authority by fact and intimidating
environment   and the use of  psychological  interrogation
techniques  by the police.  The police use these tactics  to
extract	 true  confession, but an innocent  suspect  who  is
susceptible  to	 intimidation may respond by  confessing  to
something  which  he  did not do.  The	majority  of  untrue
statements  that  come	before	the  courts,  probably	from
coerced-complaint suspect.  The suspect goes along with	 the
views of the interrogator without internalising these  views
as his own in order to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">721</span>
please	 or  to	 gain  some  temporary	advantage    bail,
termination of an unpleasant interrogation, possibly an	 end
to  violence  or the threat of violence.   According  to  an
eminent	 forensic psychologist, Armstrong, confession  falls
into  various  categories.  In the  Principles	of  Criminal
Evidence  by  A.A.S. Suckerman at pp. 302-306 it  is  stated
that  in order to preserve our freedom from excessive  State
interference  the police powers have to be strictly  limited
and  assiduously  supervised.  The  custodial  interrogation
lays  the  suspect  open to two	 particular  risks  of	harm
against	 which the law must protect him	 the risk of  abuse
of  his	 person	 or dignity and the risk  of  distortion  or
manipulation  of  his statements so as to implicate  him  in
crime.	 The  questioning  in the police  station  is  often
conducted   under  conditions  of  pressure   and   tension.
Suspects  under	 investigation	are  likely  to	  experience
considerable  strain even if they are innocent, while  those
who have something to hide or fear may be doubly susceptible
to  confusion  and manipulation.  If one adds  to  this	 the
natural	 tendency  of the  investigator	 to  manipulate	 the
suspect's  responses  and  interprets them  in	a  way	that
confirms his own suspicion, one realizes that the scope	 for
unreliability of confessions is not insignificant.  However,
the  need  to  safeguard reliability  does  not	 necessarily
create	a  conflict between the protection of  the  innocent
from  conviction and the need of the community to  see	that
the  offenders are punished because the latter only  demands
the  conviction of the guilty, not of the innocent.   It  is
difficult  for a suspect to insist his privilege and  refuse
to answer police questions, considering the mental pressures
generated by police interrogation and the fear that  silence
would  be  construed as an admission of	 guilt	which  would
operate as a factor to make false confession.  However, when
the police interrogate the suspect they have an	 opportunity
to  exploit  his moral position and induce  the	 suspect  to
confess against his better judgment.  Bentham observed	that
the  very  fact	 that  questions are  put  by  a  person  in
authority  exerts  pressure on the suspect to  comply  with,
silence	 on the part of the affrighted culprit seems to	 his
ear to call for vengeance, confession holds out a chance for
indulgence.    Physical	 abuse,	 threat,  mental   coercion,
prolonged  detention or interrogation,	inducement,  promise
are  per  se prohibited methods to  obtain  confession.	  In
addition  interrogator	conveys	 to  the  captive  that	  he
strongly  believes that the captive committed the crime	 and
he  has evidence in support of that behalf.  In Harvard	 Law
Review, Vol. 82 (1968-69), Prof.  Driver stated at pp. 48-50
that  psychological control, assumed personal roles  of	 the
interrogator, certain persuasive or manipulative tactics may
substantially  influence suspects to change their ideas	 and
memories.

Law  Commission of India stated that custodial violence	 and
abuse  of  police power has been  concern  of  international
community.   The  General  Assembly of	the  United  Nations
adopted	 on December 9, 1975 the declaration for  protection
of persons from being subjected to torture and other  crimes
of  inhuman  or	 degrading  treatment  or  punishment.	  It
prohibited the member States to permit or tolerate abuse  of
powers	even in exceptional circumstances such as  state  of
war  or	 threat of war or  internal  political	instability.
<a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_834">Article	 5</a>  thereof required comprehensive training  of	 law
enforcement  officers against torture.	<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_835">Article	 7</a>  required
system of review of the interrogation, methods and practices
as well as custodial arrangements.  It obligates the  States
to  ensure that the acts of torture are made offenses  under
National Criminal Law.	The declaration is a part of binding
international  law  and in our country it has not  yet	been
implemented.  There is a code of conduct for law enforcement
officials  adopted by the General Assembly on  December	 17,
1979,  under which substantive norms were prescribed  for  "
effective   maintenance	  of  ethical  standards"   by	 the
officials.   <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_836">Article  5</a> thereof	 prohibits  law	 enforcement
officials from inflicting, instigating or tolerating any act
of  torture.   It  was followed by  another  declaration  on
December  10,  1984,  by a convention  which  provides	more
elaborate  procedure  in 33 articles.  The  United  Nations'
General	 Assembly adopted yet another declaration  known  as
"Carcus	 Declaration on Basic Principles of Justice for	 the
Victims	 of Crime and Abuse of Power" on November 29,  1985,
which  obligates  the State to define laws  prohibiting	 the
criminal abuse of power and also for prohibition of recourse
to third degree methods.  The aforestated working paper says
that   India   being  a	 party	to  the	  declarations	 and
Conventions, is under an obligation to take effective  steps
to prohibit abuse of power, including torture and  custodial
violence,  etc.	 in  accordance	 with  <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_837">Article	51</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_504">383. Neither  the Evidence Act, 1872 nor<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_838"> the Code</a>,  nor	 its

Kaur v. State of Punjab</a>'24 ruled that: (SCR at p. 104)
	      "A  confession must either admit in terms	 the

	      gravely	 incriminating	  fact,	   even	   a
	      conclusively  incriminating  fact, is  not  of
	      itself   a  confession.	A   statement	that
	      contains self-exculpatory matter cannot amount
	      to a confession, if the exculpatory  statement
	      is of some fact, which if true, would negative
	      the offence alleged to be confessed."
</p><p id="p_505">Therefore,  confession means an admission  of certain  facts
which  constitute an offence or substantially all the  facts
that  constitute the offence, made by a person charged	with
the offence which is the subject-matter of the statement. In
Pakala Narayana Swami v. King-Emperor125 Lord Atkin, held at
p. 81 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_118">	      "An admission of a gravely incriminating fact,
	      even a conclusively incriminating fact, is not
	      of  itself  a confession, e.g.,  an  admission
	      that  the accused is the owner of and  was  in
	      recent  possession  of the knife	or  revolver
	      which  caused a death with no  explanation  of
	      any other man's possession."
</blockquote><p id="p_506"><a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_840">Sections 24</a> to <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_841">30</a> of the Evidence Act deal with	 provability
or  relevancy  of  a confession.  A confession	made  by  an
accused	 person is irrelevant if it appears to the court  to
have  been caused by inducement, promise or threat having  a
reference  to  the  charge  proceeding	from  a	 person	  in
authority.   By <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_842">Section 25</a> there is an absolute ban  at	 the
trial against proof of a confession to a police officer,  as
against	 a person accused of any offence.  The	partial	 ban
under  <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_843">Section	24</a> and total ban under	<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_844">Section	 25</a>  applied
equally	 with  <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_845">Section	26</a> that no confession  made  to	 any
person	while  the  accused is in the custody  of  a  police
officer,  unless it is made in the immediate presence  of  a
Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.  <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_846">Section
27</a> makes an exception to <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_847">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_848">25</a> and <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_849">26</a> and provides
that   when  any  fact	is  deposed  to	 as  discovered	  in
consequence of information received from a person accused of
any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much  of
such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not,
as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be
proved.	  The  provisions  in  <a href="/doc/189581/" id="a_850">Sections 28</a>  to	<a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_851">30</a>  are	 not
relevant for discussion.  The fascicule of <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_852">Sections 24</a> to <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_853">30</a>
aim  to zealously protect the accused against  becoming	 the
victim of his own delusion or the mechanisation of others to
self-incriminate  in crime.  The confession,  therefore,  is
not  received with an assurance, if its source be  not	omni
suspicious mojes, above and free from the remotest taint  of
suspicion.   The  mind	of the accused	before	he  makes  a
confession must be in a state of perfect equanimity and must
not  have been operated upon by fear or hope or	 inducement.
Hence threat or promise or inducement held out to an accused
makes  the  confession	irrelevant  and	 excludes  it	from
consideration.	A confession made to a police officer  while
the  accused is in the custody or made before he  became  an
accused,  is not provable against him on any  proceeding  in
which  he is charged to the commission of the said  offence.
Equally	 a confession made by him, while in the	 custody  of
the police officer, to any person is also not provable in  a
proceeding in which he is charged with the commission of the
offence unless it is made in the immediate
125 66IA66,81:AIR1939PC47:40CriU364
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">724</span>
presence  of the Magistrate.  Police officer  is  inherently
suspect	  of  employing	 coercion  to	obtain	 confession.
Therefore,  the	 confession made to a police  officer  under
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_854">Section	 25</a> should totally be excluded from  evidence.	 The
reasons	 seem  to  be that the	custody	 of  police  officer
provides  easy	opportunities  of  coercion  for   extorting
confession.  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_855">Section 25</a> rests upon the principle that it  is
dangerous  to  depend  upon a confession made  to  a  police
officer	 which	cannot extricate itself from  the  suspicion
that it might have been produced by the exercise of coercion
or  by	enticement.  The legislative  policy  and  practical
reality	 emphasise  that  a statement  obtained,  while	 the
accused	 is in police custody, truly be not the	 product  of
his  free choice.  So a confessional statement	obtained  by
the law enforcement officer is inadmissible in evidence.
</p><p id="p_507">384. In	 Chapter 12<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_856"> of the Code</a>, "Information by the  police
and their powers to investigate", <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_857">Section 162</a> mandates	that
no  statement made by any person to a police officer in	 the
course of an investigation shall, if reduced to writing,  be
signed by the person making it, nor shall any such statement
or  any	 record	 thereof,  whether  in	a  police  diary  or
otherwise, or any part of such statement or record, be	used
for  any  purpose,  save as  hereinafter  provided,  at	 any
inquiry	  or   trial  in  respect  of  any   offence   under
investigation  at  the time when such  statement  was  made.
Under  the proviso to sub-section (1) it may be used by	 the
accused,  and  with  the permission of	the  court,  by	 the
prosecution,  to  contradict  such  witness  in	 the  manner
provided  by  <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_858">Section  145</a> of the Evidence Act	or  for	 the
purpose	 of explaining any matter referred to in the  cross-
examination by reexamining such witness.  In Pakala Narayana
Swami  case125	the  Privy  Council  held  that	 any  person
referred  to  in  <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_859">Section 162</a> would  include  a	 person	 who
eventually  became an accused.	"Any such  statement",	must
therefore,  include such a case and it would appear that  if
the  statement is to be admitted at all, it can only  be  by
limiting the words "used for any purpose" by the addition of
such  words  "except as evidence for or against	 the  person
making	it when accused of an offence".	 Accordingly it	 was
held that "the words of <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_860">Section 162</a> in their Lordships' view
plainly are wide enough to exclude any confession made to  a
police	officer	 in the course of investigation,  whether  a
discovery  is made or not.  They may, therefore,  pro  tanto
repeal	the provisions of the section which would  otherwise
apply.	If they do not, presumably it would be on the ground
that <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_861">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act is a special law  within
the  meaning  of <a href="/doc/1093366/" id="a_862">Section 1</a>, sub-section (2)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_863"> of the  Code</a>  of
Criminal  Procedure, and that <a href="/doc/1762984/" id="a_864">Section 162</a> is not a  specific
provision  to the contrary.  <a href="/doc/56195/" id="a_865">In Tahsildar Singh v. State  of

force, or at any time afterwards before the commencement  of
the inquiry or trial.  The Magistrate may record  confession
or  statement  made  to	 him.  But before  doing  so  he  is
enjoined by sub-section (2) thereto to explain to the person
making	it  that he is not bound to make  a  confession	 and
that, if he does so, it may be used as evidence against him;
and  the  Magistrate shall not record  any  such  confession
unless, upon questioning the person making it, he has reason
to  believe  that it is being made  voluntarily.   He  shall
record the confession in the manner provided in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_868">Section	 281</a>
for  recording	the examination of the accused	person.	  It
shall not only be signed by the Magistrate, but also by	 the
accused	 himself.   The	 Magistrate  shall  also  append   a
memorandum  at the foot of the record as laid down  in	sub-
section	 (4).  If he has no jurisdiction to inquire into  or
try the offence he shall forward the confession so  recorded
to the Magistrate by whom the case is to be inquired into or
tried.	 High Courts have made rules in this behalf to	give
sufficient  time  to the accused  for  reflection,  relevant
warnings and other related procedural safeguards, etc.
</p><p id="p_509">386. The  Magistrate before recording the confession  should
properly question   the accused, as far as may be necessary,
elicit from him whatever facts he  is  willing to state;  to
understand  exactly  what  his meaning is  and	how  far  he
intends	 his confession or admission to go.  The  confession
must  be recorded with great care and  circumspection.	 The
Magistrate  must record the questions put to the accused  to
ascertain  whether the confession was of  voluntary  nature,
that he will not have to go back to the police custody after
statement   was	 recorded;  to	warn  the  accused  of	 the
consequences which would ensue if the confession is false or
if  he has in the hope of release implicated himself and  to
ask  the accused whether the police or any other person	 had
subjected  him to ill-treatment etc.  No hard and fast	rule
could or should be laid down as to the procedure which would
be adopted when an accused is brought before the  Magistrate
to  record  his confession.  Confession extracted  while  in
custodial    interrogation   excites   suspicion   of	 its
voluntariness.	 But  when it is recorded  by  the  Judicial
Magistrate it removes the stains and assures  voluntariness.
The  object  of	 keeping  the  accused/suspect	in  judicial
custody	 and giving him sufficient time for  reflection	 and
necessary warnings reinforces it since sufficient time given
the  accused  frees  himself from  the	pressure  of  police
interrogation  and for reflection before making	 confession.
It will have sobering effect on the accused/suspect.
</p><p id="p_510">387. <a href="/doc/1107594/" id="a_869">In	 Nazir Ahmad v. King-Emperor</a>' 27 the  Privy  Council

enjoined  under <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_873">Section 164</a>.  He tendered his oral  evidence

confession  must  be recorded in open court and	 during	 the

feasible to do so.  This is a very important provision which
emphasises  that the Magistrate in recording  confession  is
exercising  "part  of his judicial function" in	 the  manner
prescribed  by	the law.  One of the  instructions  provides
that  the  Magistrate  should enquire  the  reason  why	 the
accused is making the confession knowing that it may be used
against him.  In that case since the confession was recorded
in the police lock-up, it was held that it was inadmissible.
</p><p id="p_511">388. It	 would thus be clear that the provisions of  <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_875">Section

follow	the  procedure strictly.  If he fails to do  so,  he
would be failing in his discharge of judicial duty.  If	 the

with <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_876">Sections 164</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_877">281</a> and the rules made thereunder, the
confession  would be admissible, although it  is  retracted.
In  Nazir  Ahmad  case127  it was  held	 that  a  confession

precautions laid in those provisions of such trifling  value
as  to be almost idle.	A confession duly recorded with	 the

voluntary  and	be  admissible in evidence  subject  to	 the
conditions  contained  in <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_880">Sections 24</a> to  <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_881">30</a>.	A  retracted

II Judges, per majority, interpreting <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_913">Article 20(3)</a> held  on
"testimonial  compulsion" that, "[w]e can see no  reason  to
confine the content of the constitutional guarantee to	this
barely	literal import.	 So to limit it would be to rob	 the
guarantee  of  its  substantial	 purpose  and  to  miss	 the
substance  for	the  sound as  stated  in  certain  American
decisions."  Indeed  every  positive  act  which   furnishes
evidence  is testimony and testimonial	compulsion  connotes
coercion which procures positive oral evidence.	 The acts of
the  person,  of  course, is neither  negative	attitude  of
silence	 or submission on his part, nor is there any  reason
to  think  that the protection in respect  of  the  evidence
procured is confined to what transpires at the trial in	 the
court  room.   The phrase used in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_914">Article 20(3)</a> is to  be  a
witness and not to appear as a witness.	 It follows that the
protection  accorded to an accused insofar as it is  related
to the phrase "to be a witness" is not merely in respect  of
the  testimonial compulsion in the court room but  may	well
extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from	him.
The guarantee was, therefore, held to include not only	oral
testimony  given  in  a	 court or out  of  court,  but	also
statements  in	writing which incriminated  the	 maker	when
figuring  as  accused person.  <a href="/doc/1938988/" id="a_915">In Nandini Satpathy  v.	P.L.

is  a legitimate right of the police to arrest a suspect  on
receiving  some	 credible information or material,  but	 the
arrest must be in accordance with law and the  interrogation
should	not  be	 accompanied with torture or  use  of  third
degree methods.	 The interrogation and investigation  should
be  in	true  sense purposeful	to  make  the  investigation
effective.    This  Court  in  <a href="/doc/174498/" id="a_920">Sheela  Barse  v.  State	  of

he  should  further be informed that he has  a	right  under

conscience  of	our  people,  it  would	 be  classified	  or
characterised  or  ranked as unjust  and  unfair  procedure.
Appearance  of	injustice is denial of	justice.   Built  in
procedural  safeguards assure a feeling of  fairness.	When
the   procedure	 prescribed  by	 the  statute  offends	 the
principle  of fair justice or established judicial ethos  or
traditions  or shocks the conscience, it could be said	that
it is fundamentally unfair and violative of the	 fundamental
fairness which are essential to the very concept of  justice
and civilised procedure.  Whether such fundamental  fairness
has  been denied is to be determined by an appraisal of	 the
totality  of facts, gathered from the setting, the  contents
and the procedure which feed the end result.  The  procedure
which  smacks  of  the denial of  fundamental  fairness	 and

not  capable  of undergoing interrogation  when	 the  lawyer

waiver.	   This	 rationale  applies  when  the	suspect	  is
reapproached  concerning a different offence since there  is
no basis for concluding that the officers interrogating such
offence	 will  lack the " eagerness to obtain  a  confession

incrimination interest".

head  of the District Police Administration  responsible  to
maintain  law and order is expected to be keen	on  cracking
down  the crime and would take all tough steps to  put	down
the  crime to create terror in the heart of  the  criminals.
It  is not the hierarchy of officers but the source and	 for
removal	 of suspicion from the mind of the suspect  and	 the
objective assessor that built-in procedural safeguards	have
to  be scrupulously adhered to in recording  the  confession
and  trace of the taint must be absent.	 It  is,  therefore,
obnoxious  to  confer  power on	 police	 officer  to  record
confession under <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_943">Section 15(1)</a>.	 If he is entrusted with the
solemn	power  to  record a confession,	 the  appearance  of

seemingly suspect and inspire no public confidence.  If	 the

conferred  with	 judicial powers in a lesser crisis  and  be

</p><p id="p_541">411. It is the basic postulate under the Indian Constitution
that the legal sovereign power has been distributed  between
the legislatures to make the law, the executive to implement
the  law and the judiciary to interpret the law	 within	 the
limits	set  down  by  the  Constitution.   The	 courts	 are
intermediary between the people and the other organs of	 the
State  in  order to keep the latter  within  the  parameters
delineated by the Constitution.	 There can be no liberty  if
the  power of judging be not separated from the	 legislative
and  executive	powers.	  <a href="/doc/192717/" id="a_966">Article 50</a>  of  the  Constitution,
therefore,  enjoins  the  State and in	fact  separated	 the
judiciary  from the executive in the public services of	 the
State.	 It is the constitutional duty of the  judiciary  to
adjudicate the disputes between the citizen and the citizen;
and the State; the States inter se and the States and Centre
in accordance with the Constitution and the law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">737</span>
<p id="p_542">412.	  Independent	judiciary  is  the  most   essential
attribute  of  rule of law and is indispensable	 to  sustain
democracy.  Independence and integrity of the judiciary in a
democratic system of Government is of the highest importance
and  interest  not only to the judges but to the  people  at
large  who  seek judicial redress  against  perceived  legal
injury or executive excesses.  Dispensation of justice by an
impartial presiding judge, without fear or favour, affection
or  ill-will,  is  the	cardinal  creed	 and  is   zealously
protected by the Constitution.	Judicial review is the basic
structure and independent judiciary is the cardinal  feature
and  an	 assurance of faith enshrined in  the  Constitution.
Confidence  of	the  people  in	 impartial  dispensation  of
justice	 is  the  binding force for  acceptance	 of  justice
delivery system.  Independence is not limited to  insulating
the  judges  from  executive pressures	alone.	 Its  sphere
extends	 to  many  other impeccable zones  of  pressures  or
prejudices.   Judges should be made of stem stuff  unbending
before	the power, economic or political which	alone  would
ensure	fair and effective administration of  justice.	 The
officer exercising judicial power vested in him must be,  of
necessity,  free to act upon his own conscience and  without
apprehension of personal consequences to himself or lure  of
retrial	  rehabilitation.    The  judges  should   be	made
independent   of  most	of  their  restraints,	checks	 and
punishments which are usually called into play against other
public	 officers   and	 he  should  be	  devoted   to	 the
conscientious performance of his duties.  Therefore, he must
be  free from external as well as internal  pressures.	 The
need  for  independent	and impartial  judiciary  manned  by
persons	  of  sterling	character,   impeccable	  integrity,
undaunting  courage  and  determination,  impartiality	 and
independence is the command of the Constitution and call  of
the  people.   He would administer justice without  fear  or
favour,	 affection or ? ill-will.  His sanction	 and  succor
are  nurtured  and nourished from the  Constitution  itself.
The  ability and integrity of the judge to make	 a  decision
free  from  external interference or influence	or  external
cravings is an essential component and an in built assurance
to shape the orderly life of the community.  Independent and
impartial judiciary thus sustain the faith of the people  in
the  efficacy,	effectivity  and  impartiality	of  judicial
process.  Independence of the judiciary has been secured  by
providing  security  of	 tenure	 and  other  conditions	  of
service.   Judicial independence means total liberty of	 the
presiding judge to try, hear and decide the cases that	have
come  before him according to the set procedure	 and  decide
the  cases and give binding decision on merits without	fear
or favour, affection or ill-will.
</p><p id="p_543">413. The    subordinate	  judiciary   is    complement	  to
constitutional	courts as part of the constitutional  scheme
and  plays  vital  part in  dispensation  of  justice.	 Its
decisions  are	subject to appeal or revision  to  the	High
Court  which  exercises	 control and  supervision  over	 the
proceedings  and decisions of subordinate courts,  tribunals
and other bodies or persons who carry out administrative  or
quasi-judicial	  functions    within	 its	 territorial
jurisdiction.	Judicial review is not only  concerned	with
the  merits of the decision but also of the  decision-making
process.   It intends to protect the individual against	 the
misuse or abuse of the power by a wide range of authorities.
Judicial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">738</span>
review	is a protection to the individual and not a  weapon.
It,  therefore	concerns  with	the  manner  in	 which	 the
authority  makes the decision.	The court of  appeal  though
substitutes  its own decision to that of  the  subordinating
courts or the tribunal etc. on merits, it is to ensure	that
the  individual is give a fair treatment.   Judicial  review
ensures that the authority acts fairly and the order is	 not
vitiated  by illegality, unreasonableness, irrationality  or
procedural  impropriety.   The	civil  rights  and  criminal
justice are integral part of judicial process.	Procedure is
the handmaid to substantive justice.  Law therefore, has  to
be  vigilant to ensure adequate safeguards for	those  whose
rights	are  affected or to exercise their rights  or  acts.
Equally	  the  exercise	 of  the  executive  power  of	 the
Government  should be put under control.   Judicial  review,
therefore, is the process by which the constitutional courts
i.e.   the  Supreme  Court  and	 the  High  Court   exercise
supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings and  decisions
of  the subordinate courts etc., tribunals or  authority  or
persons entrusted with administrative or quasi-judicial acts
or  duties.   Subordinate  courts  also,  as  said  earlier,
exercise,   in	 a   small  measure   judicial	 review	  of
administrative	acts.  Subordinate courts are integral	part
of  the	 judiciary under the Constitution.  In	Black's	 Law
Dictionary, 6th Edn., Judicial power has been defined at  p.
849 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_122">	      "The authority exercised by that department of

	      distinguished    from   the   executive	 and
	      legislative power.  Courts have general powers
	      to  decide and pronounce a judgment and  carry

<p id="p_544">	      determination   of  questions  of	  right	  in

</p><p id="p_545">414. Judicial  power,  therefore, means the  judicial  power
which  every  authority	 i.e. courts  i.e.  High  Court	 and
subordinate  judiciary, established under Chapters V and  VI
of Part VI and the Union Judiciary constituted in Chapter IV
in  Part V, 'the Supreme Court of India' must  of  necessity
have  to  decide  controversies	 between  citizen  and	 the
citizen,  and the State or the States inter se, whether	 the
rights relate to life, liberty or property.  The courts have
power  and authority to declare the law, apply the  law	 and
give  a	 binding  and  authoritative  decision	between	 the
parties before it and carry it into effect.

<a href="/doc/1067003/" id="a_975">11</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_976">12</a>  of the Act does not indicate  to  preserve	 the
control or supervision of the High Court over the Designated
Courts	or  judges  holding  the  posts,  though  they	were
appointed  initially  with  the	 concurrence  of  the  Chief
Justice	 of the High Court.  <a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_977">Section 19</a> of the Act  provides
an  appeal to the Supreme Court from any judgment,  sentence
or order of a Designated Court both on facts and under	law.
Control	 of  the High Court over the judicial  work  of	 the
judge or additional judge of the Designated Court was  taken
out.  Thus it would be clear that appointment of Sessions or
Additional Sessions Judges as judge of the Designated  Court
under	<a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_978">Section	  9(1)</a>	are  outside  the  scheme   of	 the
Constitution and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_979"> the Code</a> but a creature of the Act.  Though
the appointment of the District or Additional Sessions Judge
to  the	 Designated Court by the Central Government  or	 the
State	Government,  as	 the  case  may	 be,  is  with	 the
concurrence  of	 the  Chief  Justice  of  the  High   Court,
thereafter the High Court ceases to have any  administrative
or   judicial	supervision  or	 control  over	 them.	  On
appointment as a judge of the Designated Court, the Sessions
or   Additional	  Sessions  Judge  is  transposed   to	 the
administrative	control of the executive, be it the  Central
or State Government.  In other words the concurrence of	 the
Chief  Justice of the High Court is necessary only  for	 the
initial	 appointment of a judge of the Designated Court	 and
thereafter  the High Court cease to have any  administrative
and  judicial control and supervision of  him.	 Sub-section
(7)  of <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_980">Section 9</a> of the Act postulates its fulcrum  without
mincing any word that despite the judge or additional  judge
of   a	 Designated  Court  having  attained  the   age	  of
superannuation	under rules applicable to him in  the  State
judicial  service, he shall be entitled to continue as	such
judge or additional judge by employing unequivocal  language
"shall	 not  affect  his  continuance	as  such  judge	  or
additional   judge".   In  other  words,   the	 legislative
intention  is  clear that though Designated  Judge  attained
superannuation under the relevant rules applicable to him in
his  normal  judicial service as a  Sessions  or  Additional
Sessions  Judge,  he  shall remain  in	service	 during	 the
pleasure   of	  the  Central	or  the	 appropriate   State
Government.   What would be its message?  Is  it  consistent
with the independence of the judiciary?	 Would it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">740</span>
create	confidence in the accused that the Designated  Judge
would  be  of stem stuff unbending before power or  lure  of
personal advantage?  The constitutional validity of  <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_981">Section
9(7)</a>  of the Act should be addressed from the above  setting
and perspectives.  The concern here is not so much with	 the
initial appointment as Designated Judge but with the control
and supervision over his discharge of judicial functions and
on its part is he insulated from executive influence overtly
or covertly?

Provisions) Act, 1 of 1962 made by the Parliament of  Ceylon
contained special procedure for nomination of special judges
by the Minister of Justice to try certain offenders or class
of  offenses  which  was  later	 amended  giving  power	  of
nomination to the Chief Justice of the Ceylon Supreme Court.
Power  was also given to the police to record confession  of
those  in police custody.  The vires of <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_982">Section 9</a>  modifying
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_983">Section	 440-A</a>	of  the	 Criminal  Procedure  Code  and	 the
nomination of three judges who tried the offenders and other
sections  and  the  consequential conviction  of  them	were
challenged as being ultra vires and void.  The Supreme Court
of Ceylon held that the power of nomination was ultra  vires
clause	4 of the Charter of Justice, 1833.  The	 convictions
were set aside.	 On appeal, the Judicial Committee held that
the  provisions of the Charter of Justice, 1833 manifest  an
intention to secure to the judiciary freedom from political,
legislative   and  executive  control.	 They	are   wholly
appropriate  in a constitution which intends  that  judicial
power shall be vested only in the judiciary.  They would  be
inappropriate  in  a constitution by which it  was  intended
that judicial power should be shared by the executive or the
legislature.   The constitution's silence as to the  vesting
of judicial power is consistent with its remaining, where it
was for more than a century, in the hands of the  judicature
and  was inconsistent with any intention that henceforth  it
should	pass  on  to or be shared by the  executive  or	 the
legislature.   It was further held that each case has to  be
decided	 in  the light of its own  facts  and  circumstances
including the true purpose of the legislation, the situation
to  which  it  was directed, the  existence  (where  several
enactments  are impugned) of a common design and the  extent
to  which  the legislation affects, by way of  direction  or
restriction, the discretion or judgment of the judiciary  in
specific  proceedings.	 It  is,  therefore,  necessary	  to

Judiciary was designed to stand independent of the executive
and  the legislature.  Periodical appointments are fatal  to
the  independence  of  the  Judiciary.	 If  the  power	  of
appointment   is  committed  either  to	 the  executive	  or
legislature, there would be danger of improper compliance to
the  branch  which  possessed it.   A  judiciary  free	from
control	 of  the executive and legislature is  essential  to
relieve	 the  judiciary from potential domination  by  other
branches  of Government.  The inexorable command of  <a href="/doc/158646/" id="a_988">Article
111</a>,  <a href="/doc/1093366/" id="a_989">Section  1</a> is that judicial power shall be  vested  in
Supreme Court and inferior courts.  Bankruptcy Judges  whose
officers  are created under the Act are under the  executive
control.   The Congress's majority to control the manner  in
which	the  rights  adjudicated,  through   assignment	  of
historically judicial functions to a non-Article III adjunct
must  be unconstitutional.  Accordingly the  court  declared
the  Act  to  be  ultra vires the  power  of  the  Congress.
However,  the declaration was held prospective in  operation
since retrospective operation would surely visit substantial
injustice and hardship upon those litigants who relied	upon
the  Act's  vesting jurisdiction in the	 Bankruptcy  Courts.
The court gave time to the Congress to amend the law and the
operation of the judgment was postponed till specified date.

Shinghal, J. pointedly considered the question in a separate

	      "That  is	 in  fact necessary  to	 ensure	 the

<p id="p_556">	      (emphasis supplied)
It  was further opined that all persons charged	 with  crime
must,  in  law,	 stand on the same footing  at	the  Bar  of
Justice.   Such	 an  equality should  be  assured  not	only
between	 one  accused  and  another  but  also	between	 the
prosecution and the accused.  Thus this is not a mere rights
explosion  but, as will appear, it is what our	Constitution
has  carefully,	 assuredly  and	 fully	provided  for  every
citizen of the country.	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_996">Article 21</a> of the Constitution	 is,
by  itself,  enough to bring this out.	 Nomination  of	 the
retired	 judges was treated with disfavor.   This  principle
reinforces  that the judicial function must  be	 coterminous
with superannuation and no longer.
</p><p id="p_557">419. It would thus be seen that constitution of a Designated
Court per se may be valid but as a court parallel to  Courts
of  Session and appointment of Sessions Judge or  Additional
Sessions  Judge as a judge of the Designated  Court  without
administrative	and  judicial  control	of  the	 High  Court
concerned   and	 continuance  in  office   after   attaining
superannuation are clearly in negation of and subversive  to
the  independence of the judiciary, carefully conserved	 and
given  to  the	people	of India.  It  would  foster  the  "
pleasure  doctrine"  laying  the seeds	to  bear  fruits  of
poisoned  tree to destroy independence and  impartiality  of
justice which the Constitution of India consciously avoided.
It is, therefore, unconstitutional.
</p><p id="p_558">420. This  conclusion does not mean that the offenses  under
the  Act  cannot be tried by the regular  courts  especially
assigned  by  the High Court to the Sessions  or  Additional
Sessions   or  Joint  Sessions	Judges	to  exercise   those
functions or the power under the Act.  Moreover, <a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_997">Section  19</a>
confers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">744</span>
appellate powers on this Court.	 It is true as contended  by
Shri Tulsi, expeditious trial and disposal of the cases	 and
appeals	 is  one  of the aims of the Act.   But	 as  rightly
contended  for	the  accused  that  many  an  accused  being
indigent, cannot effectively pursue the remedy of appeal  in
the  Supreme  Court  due to oppressive	distance  and  heavy
litigation costs, conferment of appellate power on the	High
Court  would be just and fair remedy.  I  find	considerable
force in the contention.  Yet it being a legislative policy,
it  would be left to the wisdom of the Parliament to  decide
and  suitably  amend the Act, keeping in view  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_998">Article	39-A</a>
which  itself is a fundamental right to the  indigent.	 The
remedy	of  appeal  to	the  High  Court  would	 be   easily
accessible  at	the  State  level,  lest  the  poor  may  be
constrained  to forego the remedy of appeal.  The  right  to
approach  this Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_999">Article 136</a> has  constitutionally
been preserved to everyone.

constitutional, civil or criminal.  In paragraph 73 (SCC  p.
</p><p id="p_560">783) it was held that the cut-off date to give effect to the
law  laid down in the judgment is the date of the  judgment.
Though I had held that the parties before the Court in	that
judgment   were	 entitled  to  the  relief,  majority	held
otherwise  to  which I am bound.  In  Victor  Linkletter  v.
Victor G. Walker143 it was held that though the evidence was
collected in illegal search and seizure violating the Fourth
Amendment,  and the conviction based thereon is	 not  valid,
the  decision was held to be prospective and the  conviction
thereunder was not interfered with. In Ernesto A. Miranda v.
State  of Arizona137 a confessional statement obtained	from
the accused violating his constitutional right and  evidence
was  held  to  be inadmissible,	 yet  the  conviction  based
thereon was not interfered with.  Same view was followed  in
Danny Escobedo v. Illinois144 and Sylvester Johnson v. State
of  New Jersey145 wherein the conviction and  sentence	were
not  interfered with though held that evidence	obtained  in
violation of the constitutional right was inadmissible.	  It
is  already seen that in Northern Pipeline Construction	 Co.

Congress to amend the, law without disturbing the  judgments

Court held that (SCR pp. 484-85: SCC p. 140, para 17)
	      "A  judge, de facto, therefore, is one who  is
	      not  a  mere intruder or usurper but  one	 who
	      holds office, under color of lawful authority,
	      though  his appointment is defective  and	 may
	      later  be found to be defective.	Whatever  be
	      the  defect  of  his  title  to  the   office,
	      judgments	 pronounced by him and acts done  by
	      him  when he was clothed with the	 powers	 and
	      functions	 of the office,	 albeit	 unlawfully,
	      have the same efficacy as judgments pronounced
	      and acts done by a Judge de jure.
</p><p id="p_562">Such is the de facto doctrine, born of necessity and  public
policy to prevent needless confusion and endless  mischief."
This  Court  also  further held that  the  validity  of	 the
appointment cannot be challenged in collateral	proceedings.
It  is	true that in the light of the finding  that  <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_1003">Section
9(7)</a>  is  invalid,  violative of  the  basic  structure	 and
judicial independence envisaged in the Constitution,  public
policy	requires that the doctrine of de facto be  engrafted
on  necessity to protect the interest of the public and	 the
individuals  involved  in  the	official  acts	of   persons
exercising the duty of an office without actually being	 one
in strict point of law.	 Therefore, though, de jure they are
not  by title validly appointed, but by color of  title	 the
exercise  and  functions as Judge of the  Designated  Court,
trials	 conducted,  judgments	rendered,   orders   passed,
punishments  imposed  and  convictions made  are  legal	 and
valid.	 The  de  facto doctrine is not a  stranger  to	 the
Constitution or to the Parliament and the legislature of the
States.	  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1004">Article 233-A</a> recognises this doctrine brought  by
Constitution Twentieth Amendment Act, 1966.  Therefore,	 the
trials	conducted,  judgments pronounced and the  orders  or
punishment imposed under the Act remained valid.
</p><p id="p_563">423.  Thus it must be held that the confessions recorded  by
any  police  officer  below the rank  of  Superintendent  of
Police	under <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1005">Section 15(1)</a> and the appointment of  Sessions
and Additional Sessions Judges to the Designated Court under
<a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_1006">Section	 9(7)</a> are unconstitutional.  Yet the confessions  so
recorded  by exercising the power under <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1007">Section 15(1)</a>  shall
remain	valid  and would be considered at the  trial  or  in
appeal	in accordance with law.	 Any judgment or order	made
and conviction rendered exercising powers under the Act	 and
sentence imposed relying thereon does not become invalid  or
void.  We further hold that it is open to the Parliament  to
amend  <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_1008">Sections	 9(7)</a> and <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1009">15(1)</a> of the	Act  suitably..	 The

<a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1012">Section 15(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_1013">Section 9(7)</a> would thereafter become void.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">746</span>
</p><p id="p_564">424. The further question is whether the High Court would be
justified  to  exercise its power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1014">Article 226</a>  of	 the
Constitution  in  respect of the matters covered  under	 the
Act?
</p><p id="p_565">425. The legislature treated terrorism as a special criminal
problem under the Act	 and  the ordinary  criminal  courts
created under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1015"> the Code</a> were divested	of  the	 power	 and
jurisdiction to try the offenses governed under the Act	 and
invested  the  same in the Designated  Court  and  appellate
powers to this Court.
</p><p id="p_566">426. From  the scheme of the Act therefore it is clear	that
the  offenses created thereunder are exclusively triable  by
the  Designated Court and conviction made or orders  passed,
whether	 final	or interlocutory orders	 pending  trial	 are
regulated under the provisions of the Act.  Right of  appeal
thereon	 has  been  provided by <a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_1016">Section 19</a>  to	this  Court.
Under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1017"> the Code</a> the Court of Session and the High Court	play
major  role in the administration of criminal justice,	from
the stage of arrest of an accused or suspect till the  trial
is concluded or conviction became final.  The High Court has
jurisdiction  and control over the Court of Session  or	 the
Magistrate, but under the scheme of the Act there is a	wall
of separation and complete exclusion of the jurisdiction  of
the  High Court is total.  The Designated Court	 is  neither
subordinate  to the High Court, nor the High Court  has	 any
control or supervisory jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1018">Article 227.</a>
</p><p id="p_567">427. From  this scenario, the question emerges	whether	 the
High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1019">Article 226</a> would be right in	entertaining
proceedings to quash the charge-sheet or to grant bail to  a
person accused of an offence under the Act or other offenses
committed   during  the	 course	 of  the  same	 transaction
exclusively  triable  by the Designated Court.	 Nothing  is
more  conspicuous  than	 the  failure of  law  to  evolve  a
consistent   jurisdictional  doctrine  or  even	  elementary
principles, if it is subject to conflicting or inconceivable
or   inconsistent   result  which   lead   to	uncertainty,
incongruity  and  disbelief  in the efficacy  of  law.	 The
jurisdiction  and power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1020">Article	 226</a>
of the Constitution is undoubtedly constituent power and the
High Court has untrammeled powers and jurisdiction to  issue
any  writ or order or direction to any person  or  authority
within	its territorial jurisdiction for enforcement of	 any
of  the	 fundamental rights or for any other  purpose.	 The
legislature  has  no  power  to	 divest	 the  court  of	 the
constituent  power engrafted under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1021">Article 226.</a>	 A  superior
court  is  deemed to have general jurisdiction and  the	 law
presumes  that the court has acted within its  jurisdiction.
This  presumption  is denied to the  inferior  courts.	 The
judgment  of a superior court unreservedly is conclusive  as
to all relevant matters thereby decided, while the  judgment
of  the inferior court involving a question of	jurisdiction
is   not   final.   The	 superior  court,   therefore,	 has
jurisdiction  to  determine  its own  jurisdiction,  may  be
rightly or wrongly.  Therefore, the court in an	 appropriate
proceeding  may erroneously exercise jurisdiction.  It	does
not  constitute want of jurisdiction, but it  impinges	upon
its propriety in the exercise of the jurisdiction.  Want  of
jurisdiction can be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">747</span>
established solely by a superior court and that in  practice
no  decision  can be impeached collaterally by	an  inferior
court.	 However, acts done by a superior court	 are  always
deemed	valid wherever they are relied upon.  The  exclusion
thereof	 from the rule of validity is indispensable  in	 its
finality.   The	 superior courts, therefore, are  the  final
arbiters of the validity of the acts done not only by  other
inferior   courts  or  authorities,  but  also	 their	 own
decisions.   Though they are immune from collateral  attack,
but  to avoid confusion the superior court's  decisions	 lay
down the rules of validity; are not governed by those rules.

conclusiveness may acquire other specific meanings.  It	 may
mean  that the finding upon which the decision is founded
as  distinct  or  it is the operative part  or	has  to	 be
conclusive or these findings bind only parties on  litigated
disputes  or that the organ which has made the	decision  is
itself	precluded  from revoking,  rescinding  or  otherwise

it lacked constituent power but by doctrine of concomitance.
</p><p id="p_569">429. In	 Connolly  Brothers  Ltd.,  Re;	 Wood  v.   Connolly
Brothers  Ltd.	147 the facts were that Palatine  Court	 and
Chancery   Division   have  coordinate	 jurisdiction	over
debenture  holder of a company carrying on business  in	 the
County Palatine of Lancaster.  When the debenture holder was
indicted  of an offence of cheating, Palatine Court and	 the
Chancery Division simultaneously had taken cognizance of the
offence	 on  a motion, the High Court issued  an  injunction
restraining  the plaintiff in the Palatine action while	 the
proceedings in Palatine Court had jurisdiction to grant	 the
same  injunction.   The question was  whether  the  Palatine
Court was justified in taking cognizance and issuance of the
injunction   prayed  for.   Parker,  J.	 as  he	 then	was,
exercising the jurisdiction of the Chancery Division  issued
the  injunction	 restraining the plaintiff in  the  Palatine
Court from proceeding with the action.	On appeal,  Fletcher
Moulton, L.J., of Court of Appeal, as he then was, held that
a man has a right to bring an action in a court of  inferior
jurisdiction when the circumstances of the case entitle	 him
to  do so and if he is within the right, he is neither	more
nor  less  liable to be restrained from proceeding  with  an
action in a court of coordinate jurisdiction.  The  question
of  jurisdiction to grant the injunction has nothing  to  do
with  the  status  of  the court.  It has  to  do  with	 the
circumstances of the case as bearing on the
147 (1911)ICh731:80LJCh409
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">748</span>
conduct	 of  the party enjoined.  That being so,  the  court
held that the case turns upon propriety of making the order.
The existence of the jurisdiction does not warrant the court
in exercising it on occasions when its exercise is not fully
justified by the facts of the case.  It held that since	 the
Chancery Court has avoided vexation, the Chancery Court	 was
justified  in  exercising the jurisdiction  in	issuing	 the
injunction.

the plaintiff Tobacco company launched sales promotion known
as  "spot  cash" for a particular brand of  cigarette.	 The
Director of Public Prosecution laid prosecution in the Crown
Court against the company under Lotteries and Amusement Act,
1976.	The  plaintiff initiated action	 in  the  Commercial
Court, High Court, seeking a declaration that their  schemes
are  lawful.   Before charges were tried in  the  Commercial
Court, the Crown Court took a preliminary objection that the
Commercial  Court has no jurisdiction to  grant	 declaration
sought for and if it were to be held in its jurisdiction  it
regulated  to decline to be summoned the declaration on	 the
ground	that  criminal	case  was  already  pending  in	 the
coordinate  jurisdiction, namely the Crown Court.   In	that
context	 the Court of Appeal through Ormrod, L.J.  following
Connolly Brothers Ltd. case147 held that the case is one  of
concurrent  jurisdiction, the Crown Court being a  court  of
coordinate  jurisdiction,  it is unusual that the  court  of
coordinate  jurisdiction  is  a	 criminal  court.   This  is
clearly a major factor to be taken into account is  deciding
whether	 the  High  Court in its discretion,  to  assume  or
decline jurisdiction to hear the summons on its merits.	  It
was held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_125">	      " The basic principles are not in doubt.	 The
	      object  of all procedural rules is  to  enable
	      justice	to  be	done  between  the   parties
	      consistently  with the public  interest.	 So,
	      the   choice  between  courts  of	  concurrent
	      jurisdiction  must always depend on where	 and
	      how  justice can best be done.   Many  factors
	      have to be considered, but, where the conflict
	      lies  between  courts of	civil  and  criminal
	      jurisdiction, the most important consideration
	      is the obvious one: criminal courts exist	 to
	      deal   with   criminal  matters,	 and   their
	      procedural   rules  are  designed	  for	that
	      purpose.	It is only in those relatively	rare
	      cases where the sole issue is one of law	that
	      a	 case  can  be made for the  High  Court  to
	      assume  jurisdiction.  This is because,  there
	      being  no	 issue of fact	to  be	determined.,
	      trial  by jury is otiose; the issue  of  guilt
	      will  be determined by the judge of the  Crown
	      Court on submission of law, leading inevitably
	      to a formal direction to the jury to acquit or

declined  to grant relief.  Exercise of the power  even	 in
exceptional   cases   or   circumstances   is,	  therefore,
incompatible  with or inconsistent with comity.	  Therefore,
the only check up on a court's exercise of power is ones own
sense of self-restraint and due respect to comity.  Judicial

not only for infraction of fundamental rights guaranteed  by

legislative competence to enact these legislations to  vague
and  wide  definitions of expressions  such  as,  'terrorist
activity'  and 'abet'; to constitution of designated  courts
with  persons who could continue even after  superannuation,
thereby	  reducing  its	 credibility   providing   arbitrary

<p id="p_582">439. Terror according to dictionary means, 'extreme fear  or
fright'.   But	'terrorist'  and  'terrorism'  have   become
associated  with "ideology of overthrowing a  government  by
resorting to violent fear inspiring methods", "opposition to
government  by	methods which excite fear or any  series  of
terrifying, unlawful deeds which tend to intimidate".	Some
"consider  it as a desperate response of the growing  number
of  weak or powerless groups challenging the  rigidities  of
frontiers, powers and resource of distribution".  An  abused
understanding of the terrorism is said to be "pejorative for
freedom	  fighting   or	  rebellion   disapproved   by	 the
authorities".	  Terrorism   politically    is	   "coercive
intimidation".	Systematic use of murder and destruction  to
instill	 the  feeling  of fear and terror  in  one  or	all,
individual  or	group,	institutions or	 government  is	 its
acknowledged  method.  The most reprehensible part of it  is
that its victims are usually innocent persons having nothing
to  do either with politics or government.   Whatever  their
ideology  or  coloring,	 terrorists  are  desperate   people
bitterly opposed to the prevailing regime.

	      and the Liberal State by Paul Wilkinson].
</blockquote><p id="p_583">440. Terrorism	 is   a	  global   phenomenon.	  Hijacking,
diplomatic killings, bombing, kidnapping, innocent  murders,
destruction  have  become  order  of the  day.	 It  may  be
politically   motivated	 or  revolutionary  in	outlook	  or
sponsored  by  one country against other in shape  of  proxy
war.  But in either case its method being violative of human
rights	it  is	neither	 legally  justified  nor   ethically
acceptable.   In  our  country	terrorism  unlike   European
countries  such as Baader-Meinh of gang of West	 Germany  or
the  Japanese Red Army, or Italy's Red Brigades, or  IRA  in
Ireland,  is described as the, "classical manifestation	 of,
sponsored terrorism".  The objective of such  unconventional
war is to destabilise and weaken the Government and break up
the social, political and economic order.  It is adopted  by
one country against another by promoting use of violence and
encouraging    disruptive    activities,    feeding    vague
imaginations  of  the misguided, extending false  hopes	 and
promises, providing financial assistance, weapons,  training
and sanctuary.
</p><p id="p_584">441. Terrorism,	  irrespective	of  its	 slogans,   personal
glorification,	is an evil which cannot be tolerated by	 any
society.   No State can put up with it as it is	 responsible
to protect its citizens, their lives, property, institutions
and their legitimate and democratically elected	 Government.
Protest	 by minority is the essence of	democracy.   Strike,
boycott,  marches, demonstration are legitimate	 methods  of
expressing   dissatisfaction  and  inviting  attention	 of'
Government  to	the  demands.	The  extreme  form  of	such
political and moral
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">753</span>
pressure  may be civil disobedience.  But once	the  protest
degenerates into violence it is opposed to basic  democratic
values.	  It shakes the rule of law the structural basis  of
any democracy.	Whether such action is result of frustration
or  generated due to feeling of injustice or  oppression  it
cannot be accepted as legitimate and legal by any  civilised
society, or any form of Government.  It may be that founders
of  many  nations  were	 in a  state  of  rebellion  against
existing  order	 and were hailed as  patriots  on  achieving
their  mission	but  that does not  legitimise	the  methods
adopted	 by terrorists or any political group as it  largely
depends on innocent killing and attacking soft targets.
</p><p id="p_585">442. Such  being  the terrorist ideology  and  philosophy  a
State which is obliged not only to maintain the rule of	 law
and  peace, but to maintain social environment for  cultural
progress and development of the society is legally  entitled
and morally justified to take such measures as are necessary
to  combat such undesirable activity.  Use of force  by	 the
State  to  overcome  such inhuman  menace  invading  State's
monopoly to counter it cannot be seriously doubted.  Killing
of  democracy by gun and bomb should not be permitted  by  a
State  but in doing so the State has to be vigilant  not  to
use  methods which may be counter-productive.  Care must  be
taken to distinguish between the terrorist and the innocent.
If  the State adopts indiscriminate measures  of  repression
resulting  in  obliterating  the  distinction  between	 the
offender and the innocent and its measures are repressive to
such  an extent where it might not be easy to  decipher	 one
from  the  other,  it would  be	 totally  incompatible	with
liberal values of humanity, equality, liberty and injustice.
A country where terrorism or militancy is becoming  religion
and  creed  of the frustrated, weak and	 the  misguided	 the
State has a constitutional duty to uphold the authority with
firmness  and  determination  by  directing  its  repressive
measures  towards  quelling terrorism without  sliding	into
general	 repression  or exploiting the crisis  for  its	 own
political  advantage  or to destroy  legitimate	 opposition.
Measures adopted by the State should be to create confidence
and  faith in the Government and  democratic  accountability
should be so maintained that every action of the  Government
be weighed in the scale of rule of law.	 No further need  be
said  as  Brother Pandian, J., has elaborately	and  lucidly
dealt  with  the  background  of  the  legislation  and	 its
necessity.
</p><p id="p_586">443. Having  prefaced the discussion it may now be  examined
if  the	 three	enactments can be declared  as	invalid	 for
being,	'legislative  tyranny' or 'State  violence'  of	 the
fundamental   rights  guaranteed  in  Chapter  III  of	 the
Constitution.	But before entering upon an  examination  of
different  provisions of the Act it appears  appropriate  to
deal,  at  the threshold, with the argument  of	 legislative
competence.  In substance the submissions were twofold, one,
that the subject-matter of the impugned legislation in	pith
and  substance	was public order, which	 fell  in  exclusive
domain	of  State  Legislature under Entry  1  of  List	 II,
therefore,  the power could not have been exercised  by	 the
Parliament.  And even if by straining the language of  Entry
1 in List III it could be held to be criminal law the latter
part of the entry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_145">754</span>
operated  as  a	 bar  on  exercise  of	such  power  by	 the
Parliament.   Are these submissions well-founded?  Power  to
frame or enact law for the governance of the country by	 the
supreme	 body  exercising the sovereign power  is  known  as
legislative  power.   In  a democracy which  has  opted	 for
federal structure of governance with a written	Constitution
the  legislative powers either of the Central or  the  State
Legislature  are derived from the Constitution	itself.	  In
our  Constitution  the Legislatures under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1048">Article  246</a>	have
plenary powers.	 Both are supreme in their sphere.  But	 the
field	of  legislative	 activity  of  the   two   sovereign
Legislatures  is  regulated and is exercised  in  consonance
with entries in List I and List II of the Seventh  Schedule.
Apart  from  exclusive field of activity provision  is	made
empowering  both  the Legislatures to  exercise	 legislative
power  in respect of any of the matters enumerated  in	List
III  in the Seventh Schedule known as Concurrent List.	 How
these  entries	should be construed, what is the  effect  of
their	overlapping  marginally	 have  been  discussed	 and
explained  by this Court time and again.  Therefore,  it  is
not  necessary	to recount all that.  Although	the  learned
Additional  Solicitor  General attempted to  urge  that	 the
exercise of power could be traced to Entries 1, 2 and 2-A of
List I and it has been accepted by Brother Pandian, J.,	 but
I would confine it to the alternative submission made by the
learned	 counsel that the legislation could be upheld  under
Entry 1 of List III which is extracted below :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_128">	      "Criminal law, including all matters  included
	      in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1049">  the Indian Penal Code</a> at the	commencement
	      of  this Constitution but	 excluding  offenses
	      against law with respect to any of the matters
	      specified	 in List I or List II and  excluding
	      the  use of naval, military or air  forces  or
	      any other armed forces of the Union in aid  of
	      the civil power."
</blockquote><p id="p_587">444. <a href="/doc/77461/" id="a_1050">In	 Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia v. Union of  India156</a>
it was observed:    (SCC p. 174, para 8: AIR at p. 145 8)
	      "The  power  to  legislate  is  given  to	 the
	      appropriate legislatures by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1051">Article 246</a> of the
	      Constitution.  The entries in the three  Lists
	      are  only	 legislative  heads  or	 fields	  of
	      legislation;  they  demarcate  the  area	over
	      which   the   appropriate	  legislatures	 can
	      operate.	 It  is well  established  that	 the
	      widest  amplitude	 should	 be  given  to	 the
	      language	of  the entries.  But  some  of	 the
	      entries in the different lists or in the	same
	      list may overlap or may appear to be in direct
	      conflict with each other.	 It is then the duty
	      of  this	Court to reconcile the	entries	 and
	      bring about a harmonious construction."
</p><p id="p_588">	      445.  From  the language used it	is  apparent
	      that the entry is couched in very wide  terms.
	      The  words following the expression  'criminal
	      law' enlarge the scope to any matter which can
	      validly  be  considered  to  be  criminal	  in
			    nature.   The  exercise  of	 power	under  thi
s
	      entry,   therefore,   has	 to   be   construed
	      liberally	 so  as	 to give full  play  to	 the
	      legislative activity.  The width of the entry,
	      however,	 is   controlled   by	the   latter
	      expression  which	 takes	away  the  power  of
	      either legislature to legislate in respect  of
	      offenses	against laws with respect to any  of
	      the  matters specified in List I or  List	 II.
	      Since this part
	      156 (1969) 2 SCC 166: AIR 1970 SC 1453
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">	      755</span>
	      restricts	 and narrows the ambit of the  entry
	      it has to be construed strictly.	Since  under
	      the  federal  structure the law  made  by	 the
	      Parliament  has supremacy (<a href="/doc/1235907/" id="a_1052">See Union of  India
	      v.  H.S.	Dhillon157</a>) any	 enactment  made  in
	      exercise	of power under entry  in  Concurrent
	      List  shall have overriding effect subject  to
	      restrictions  that may be spelt out  from	 the
	      entry   itself.	 A  legislation	  by   Union
	      Parliament  to be valid under this entry	must
	      satisfy  two requirements; one, that  it	must
	      relate to criminal law and the offence  should
	      not  be such as has been or could be  provided
	      against  laws  with  respect  to	any  of	 the
	      matters  specified  in  List II.	 What  is  a
	      criminal	law?  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1053">Any Act</a> or rule  dealing	with
	      crime,  "(The)  criminal justice system  is  a
	      firmly   societal	  defensive   reaction	  to
	      intolerable  behavior.  From the beginning  it
	      was  considered as a tool designed to  protect
	      an established order of values attuned to	 the
	      political	  organisation	of  the	  community.
</p><p id="p_589">	      Transgression   of   some	  important    norms
	      reflecting  these values was seen as  a  crime
	      and, as such, demanded punishment."
</p><p id="p_590">	      446.  What is a crime in a given society at  a
	      particular time has a wide connotation as	 the
	      concept of crime keeps on changing with change
	      in  political, economic and social  set-up  of
	      the  country.   Various  legislations  dealing
	      with  economic  offenses or  offenses  dealing
	      with  violation  of  industrial  activity	  or
	      breach of taxing provision are ample proof  of
	      it.    The  Constitution-makers  foresaw	 the
	      eventuality,  therefore  they  conferred	such
	      powers both on Central and State	Legislatures
	      to  make	laws  in this  regard.	 Such  right
	      includes	power to define a crime and  provide
	      for  its punishment.  Use of  the	 expression,
	      "including all matters included in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1054"> the  Indian
	      Penal   Code</a>  at	the  commencement   of	 the
	      Constitution"  is	 unequivocal  indication  of
	      comprehensive   nature  of  this	entry.	  It
	      further empowers the legislature to make	laws
	      not only in respect of matters covered by<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1055">	 the
	      Indian  Penal Code</a> but any other matter  which
	      could reasonably and justifiably be considered
	      to  be  criminal	in  nature.   Terrorist	  or
			    disruptive	activity is criminal  in  content,
	      reach  and  effect.   The	 Central  and  State
	      Legislature both, therefore, are empowered  to
	      legislate	 in respect of such an	activity  in
	      exercise of the power conferred under Entry  I
	      of  the Concurrent List.	But this wide  power
	      is otherwise controlled and restricted by	 the
	      latter  part of the entry.  It carves  out  an
	      exception	  by   precluding  either   of	 the
	      legislatures  from exercising the power if  it
	      is  in respect of "offence against  laws	with
	      respect  to  any of the matters  specified  in
	      List I or II".  The controversy, narrows	down
	      to  whether  the offenses under the  TADA	 are
	      such in respect of which the State Legislature
	      could  make  a  law.  In other  words  if	 the
	      legislation relating to TADA can fall in Entry
	      1 of List II then the State Legislature  would
	      have competence to make a law under this entry
	      and create offenses for violation of such	 law
	      under  Item  64  of List II  and	the  Central
	      Legislature would be precluded from making any
	      law.  But that would happen if it is held that
	      law  relating to TADA is either in fact or  in
	      pith and substance a law relating to,
	      157 (1971) 2 SCC 779: AIR 1972 SC 1061
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">	      756</span>
	      'public order'.  This expression was construed
	      in <a href="/doc/456839/" id="a_1056">Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras3</a>.  It was
	      held :
</p><p id="p_591">	      "Now  'public order' is an expression of	wide
	      connotation   and	 signifies  that  state	  of
	      tranquility prevailing among the members of  a
	      political society as a result of the  internal
	      regulations  enforced by the Government  which
	      they have instituted."
</p><p id="p_592"><a href="/doc/1733535/" id="a_1057">In Ram Manohar Lohia v. State of Bihar</a>' 9 it was observed as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_129">	      "It  will	 thus appear that  just	 as  'public
	      order'  in the rulings of this Court  (earlier
	      cited)  was  said to comprehend  disorders  of
	      less gravity than those affecting 'security of
	      State',  'law  and  order'  also	 comprehends
	      disorders of less gravity than those affecting
	      'public  order'.	 One has  to  imagine  three
	      concentric circles.  Law and order  represents
	      the  largest circle within which is  the	next
	      circle  representing  public  order  and	 the
	      smallest circle represents security of  State.
	      It is then easy to see that an act may  affect
	      law and order but not public order just as  an
	      act  may affect public order but not  security
	      of the State."
</blockquote><p id="p_593">Can  it	 be said that offenses dealt under  TADA  relate  to
public	order?	Is the distinction between public  order  as
visualised in Entry 1 List II and TADA of degree only or are
they  substantially  different?	  "Terrorism  constitutes  a
direct	 repudiation  of  liberal  and	human	values	 and
principles,   and  that	 terrorist  ideology  is   ...	 and
constantly  deployed in a struggle to defame  and  discredit
democracy."  The terrorism with which our country  is  faced
has  been  described  as  explained  earlier  is   sponsored
terrorism.    Terrorism	  whether   it	 is   sponsored	  or
revolutionary  or  even political by its  nature  cannot  be
considered  to be public order as explained by	this  Court.
Conceptually  public order and terrorism are  different	 not
only  in  ideology and philosophy but also in cause  or	 the
mens  rea,  the manner of its commission and the  effect  or
result	of such activity.  Public order is  well  understood
and fully comprehended as a problem associated with law	 and
order.	Terrorism is a new crime far serious in nature, more
graver in impact, and highly dangerous in consequence.	 One
pertains  to law and order problem whereas the other may  be
political in nature coupled with unjustifiable use of  force
threatening  security  and  integrity  of  the	State.	 The
submission thus advanced on legislative competence, more  as
a  matter  of form than with any feeling of  conviction	 and
belief in its merit, does not appear to be sound.
</p><p id="p_594">447. TADA  having been enacted under Entry 1 of List III  of
the  Seventh  Schedule,	 it  did not  suffer  from  lack  of
legislative  competence, yet the question is if any  of	 the
provisions  impinges upon the fundamental  right  guaranteed
under  the  Constitution  and is,  therefore,  ultra  vires.
Before	embarking  upon this exercise it may  be  worthwhile
examining the depth of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1058">Article 21</a> of the Constitution as any
law of punitive or preventive detention has to be tested  on
the  touchstone	 of the constitutional	assurance  to  every
person	that he shall not be deprived of his liberty  except
in  accordance	with procedure established by  law.   It  is
declaration of deep faith and belief in

human  rights.	 In  the  "pattern  of	guarantee  woven  in
Chapter	 III of the Constitution, personal liberty of a	 man
is  at	the  root of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1059">Article 21".</a>  Modem  history  of  human
rights is struggle for freedom and independence of the	man.
One  may  call	the right guaranteed under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1060">Article  21</a>	 as,
'natural  right'  or  'basic human  right'  but	 a  society,
committed  to  secure  to  its	citizens  "justice   social,
economic  and  political; liberty of  thought,	equality  of
status and liberty to promote amongst themselves fraternity"
the foundation on which edifice of the Constitution has been
structured could not have done otherwise than to provide for
the human dignity and freedom as has been done by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1061">Article 21</a>
of the Constitution which reads as under:
</p><p id="p_595">	      "21.  Protection of life and personal liberty.   No person s
hall be deprived of his life  or
	      personal liberty except according to procedure
	      established by law."
</p><p id="p_596">Each expression used in this article enhances human  dignity
and  value.  It lays foundation for a society where rule  of
law has primacy and not arbitrary or capricious exercise  of
power.	 'Life'	 dictionarily means,  "state  of  functional
activity and continual change peculiar to organised  matter,
and  especially to the portion of it constituting an  animal
or plant before death; animate existence; being alive".	 But
used  in the Constitution it may not be mere existence.	  As
far back as 1877 Field, J. in Munn v. Illinois158  construed
similar	 expression  in the American Constitution  as  "more
than  animal existence".  It has been approved by our  Court
in  <a href="/doc/619152/" id="a_1062">Kharak  Singh v. State Of U. P</a>. 159	 and  reiterated  in
Sunil Batra v, Delhi Administration (1)23.  It Was given new
dimension in <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_1063">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India21</a> and  extended
in <a href="/doc/78536/" id="a_1064">Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union  Territory
of  Delhi74</a> when it was held: (SCR p. 529: SCC pp.  618-619,
para 8)
	      "... protection of limb or faculty or does  it
	      go  further  and embrace something  more.	  We
	      think  that  the right to	 life  includes	 the
	      right to live with human dignity and all	that
	      goes   along   with  it,	namely,	  the	bare
	      necessaries   of	 life	such   as   adequate
	      nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities
	      for reading, writing and expressing oneself in
	      diverse forms, freely moving about and  mixing
	      and commingling with fellow human beings."
</p><p id="p_597">448.	  Liberty is the most cherished possession of a man.
"Truncate  liberty in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1065">Article 21</a> and several other  freedoms
fade out automatically".  Edmond Burke called it  'regulated
freedom'.   Liberty is the right of doing an act  which	 the
law permits.  This article instead of conferring the  right,
purposely  uses negative expression.  Obviously because	 the
Constitution  has recognised the existence of the  right  in
every  man.   It was not to be guaranteed or  created.	 One
inherits  it  by  birth.   This	 absolutism  has  not	been
curtailed  or  eroded.	 Restriction  has  been	 placed	  on
exercise of power by the State by

using  the negative.  It is State which is  restrained	from
interfering  with  freedom  of life and	 liberty  except  in
accordance  with the procedure established by law.   Use  of
the  word 'deprive' is of great significance.  According  to
the  dictionary	 it means, "debar  from	 enjoyment;  prevent
(child	 etc.)	from  having  normal  home   life".    Since
deprivation  of	 right	of  any	 person	 by  the  State	  is
prohibited  except in accordance with procedure	 established
by law, it is to be construed strictly against the State and
in favour of the person whose rights are affected.   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1066">Article
21</a>  is	a constitutional command to State  to  preserve	 the
basic human rights of every person.  Existence of right	 and
its  preservation has, thus, to be construed  liberally	 and
expansively.  As a corollary to it the exercise of power  by
the  State has to be construed narrowly	 and  restrictively.
It should be so understood and interpreted as not to nullify
the  basic  purpose  of the guarantee.	 No  legislative  or
executive  action can be permitted to get through unless  it
passes	through	 the  judicial	scanning  of  it  being	 not
violative of the cherished right preserved constitutionally.
If the article is construed as empowering the State to	make
a  law and deprive a person as the Constitution	 permits  it
then  the  entire concept of personal  liberty	shall  stand
frustrated.   A	 political party voted to  power  may  adopt
repressive measures against its political foes by enacting a
law  and  it  may well be said	that  deprivation  being  in
accordance  with procedure established by law it  is  within
the  constitutional frame.  The procedure adopted  by  State
either	legislatively or executively must therefore  satisfy
the  basic  and fundamental requirement of  being  fair	 and
just.  The word	    'except'  restricts	 the  right  of	 the
State by directing it not to fiddle with this	  guarantee,
unless	it  enacts a law which must withstand  the  test  of
<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_1067">Article	 13.</a>   Today   it  appears  wellnigh  settled	that
procedure   established	  by  law,  extends  both   to	 the
substantive  and  procedural law.  Further mere law  is	 not
sufficient.  It must be fair and just law.  Even in  absence
of any provision as in American Constitution fair trial	 has
been  rendered	the basic and primary test through  which  a
legislative and executive action must pass.
</p><p id="p_598">449. How  fundamental is the guarantee under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1068">Article  21</a>  of
the  Constitution can be well appreciated when one looks  at
the constitutional amendment made in the year 1978.  By	 the
44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1069">Amendment Act</a>, 1978, <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_1070">Article 359</a> was amended and it was
provided that Articles 20 and 21 could not be suspended even
during	emergency.  The occasion for it arose due to  narrow
construction  placed  by this Court in	<a href="/doc/165099707/" id="a_1071">Additional  District
Magistrate,  Jabalpur  v.  Shivakant</a>  Shuklal6O	 denying   a
citizen his right to challenge even arbitrary detention	 and
arrest.
</p><p id="p_599">450. Having analysed the scope of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1072">Article 21</a> and traced	 its
history,  judicially  and legislatively, it is	proposed  to
take up few provisions of 1987 Act as I have nothing to	 add
to  what has been said by Brother Pandian, J., on  1984	 Act
and  1985  Act with which I respectfully agree.	  Taking  up
1987 Act 1 may mention at the very outset that	fully  agree
with  the  reasoning and conclusions arrived at	 by  Brother
Pandian,  J.,  in  respect of most  of	the  sections.	 For
instance,  I  agree  with him that  sub-clause	(i)  of	 the
definition of
160 (1976) 2 SCC 521: AIR 1976 SC 1207
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">759</span>
'abet' should be amended in order to avoid the ambiguity and
make  it immune from arbitrariness.  As regards	 <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1073">Sections  3</a>
and  <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1074">4</a> they are not liable to be struck down for  vagueness.
Their  scope  has  been	 elaborately  discussed	 by  Brother
Pandian,  J.  But  the one section with which  I  could	 not
reconcile, even though it was raised in written submissions,
only, is <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_1075">Section 5</a> which is extracted below :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_130">	      "5.  Possession of certain unauthorised  arms,
	      etc. in specified areas.- Where any person  is
	      in  possession  of  any  arms  and  ammunition
	      specified in Columns 2 and 3 of Category 1  or
	      Category	III(a)	of Schedule 1  to  the	Arms
	      Rules,  1962,  or	 bombs,	 dynamite  or  other
	      explosive	  substances  unauthorisedly  in   a
	      notified	 area,	he  shall,   notwithstanding
	      anything	contained in any other law  for	 the
	      time  being  in  force,  be  punishable	with
	      imprisonment  for	 a term which shall  not  be
	      less  than five years but which may extend  to
	      imprisonment for life and shall also be liable
	      to fine."
</blockquote><p id="p_600">451. Mere possession of arms and ammunition specified in the
section	 has  been  made substantive offence.	It  is	much
serious	 in  nature and graver in impact as  it	 results  in
prosecution  of	 a man irrespective of	his  association  or
connection  with  a  terrorist	or  terrorist  activity.   A
comparison   of	  this	section	 with  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1076">Sections	 3</a>   and   <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1077">4</a>
demonstrates  the arbitrariness inherent in it.	  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1078">Section  3</a>
operates  when	a  person not only intends  to	overawe	 the
Government  or create terror in people etc. but he uses	 the
arms and ammunitions which results in death or is likely  to
cause  death and damage to property etc.  In other words,  a
person	becomes	 a  terrorist  or  is  guilty  of  terrorist
activity  when	intention, action and  consequence  all	 the
three  ingredients are found to exist.	Similarly <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1079">Section  4</a>
applies	 to  those  activities which  are  directed  towards
disrupting  sovereignty	 and territorial  integrity  of	 the
country.   Thus a terrorist or a disruptionist and a  person
possessing  any of the arms and ammunition mentioned in	 the
section have been placed on a par.  In <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1080">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1081">4</a>	 the
offence	 arises	 on  the act having  been  done	 whereas  in
<a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_1082">Section 5</a> it is founded only on possession.  Even under sub-
section (3) of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1083">Section 3</a> a person is liable to be prosecuted
for abetting the offence if he assists or communicates	with
a terrorist.  Sub-sections (5) and (6) inserted by Act 43 of
1993  to  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1084">Section  3</a>  also require  that  a  person  can  be
prosecuted only if he is found to be a member of a terrorist
gang  or  terrorist organisation etc.  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1085">The  Act</a>,  therefore,
visualises prosecution of the terrorist or disruptionist for
offenses  under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1086">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1087">4</a> and of others only if	they
are associated or related with it.  That is in keeping	with
the  objective of the Act.  The legislation has been  upheld
as  the	 legislature is competent to enact in respect  of  a
crime which is not otherwise covered by any Entry in List II
of  the Seventh Schedule.  The definition of the  crime,  as
has been discussed earlier, is contained in <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1088">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1089">4</a>
of  the Act and it is true that while defining the crime  it
is open to the legislature to make provision which may serve
the  objective of the legislation and from a wider point  of
view  one may say that possession of such arms, the  use  of
which may lead to terrorist activity, should be taken as one
of the offenses as a preventive or deterrent provision.	 Yet
there	must  be  some	inter-relation	between	  the	two,
howsoever, remote it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">760</span>
may be.	 The harshness of the provisions is apparent as	 all
those  provisions  of  the  Act	 for  prosecuting  a  person
including  forfeiture of property, denial of bail etc.,	 are
applicable  to a person accused of possessing any  arms	 and
ammunition  as	one  who is charged  for  an  offence  under
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1090">Sections  3</a> and <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1091">4</a> of the Act.  It is no doubt true  that  no
one  has justification to have such arms and ammunitions  as
are  mentioned	in <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_1092">Section 5</a>, but  unjustifiable  possession
does  not make a person a terrorist or disruptionist.	Even
under Ireland Emergency Provisions Act, 1978 on which  great
reliance was placed by learned Additional Solicitor  General
there is no such harsh provision like <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_1093">Section 5</a>. Since	both
the substantive and procedural law apply to a terrorist	 and
disruptionist or a terrorist act or a disruptive act, it  is
necessary, in my opinion, that this section if it has to  be
immune from attack of arbitrariness, may be invoked only  if
there  is  some	 material to show that the  person  who	 was
possessed  of the arms intended it to be used for  terrorist
or  disruptionist activity or it was an arm  and  ammunition
which in fact was used.

conferring power on police officer to record the  confession
and  for making it admissible supported the  departure	from
age-old	 law  in  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1098">Evidence Act</a>	by  taking  illustration  of
England	 and America where confessions are permitted  to  be
recorded  by  police constable.	 He made an  appeal  that  a
confession made to a police constable in those countries was
admissible and, therefore, a time has come when this country
should	depart	from what Sir James Fitz Stephen  felt	when
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1099">Indian	Evidence Act</a>, 1872 was enacted and a  policeman	 was
not treated as worthy of trust.	 In support of giving  power
to  higher police officers to record confession he stated  :
(Parliamentary Debates, p. 724)
	      "Perhaps	it  is correct and good	 among	many
	      levels  of Police Officers.  But are we  going
	      to live with that kind of a slur on the entire
	      police for 120 years?  Are we going to say for
	      ever  and	 ever there will be  nobody  in	 the
	      police  force, no Indian, no son, no  daughter
	      in India, if he or she joins the police  force
	      will ever be fair just and objective?  All our
	      children	will  join the police  force.	They
	      will  rise to be the SP of Police.  They	will
	      rise  to	be DIG of Police and IG	 of  Police.
</p><p id="p_602">	      Yet,  is Parliament going to say for ever	 and
	      ever that this will be the only country in the
	      world  where  a confession to  a	high  police
	      officer,	whatever the safeguards, will be  an
	      untrustworthy statement?	Are we going to live
	      with that kind of a slur?	 What we are  trying
	      to  do  is, for a period of two years,  in  an
	      extraordinary situation, dealing only with one
	      kind of offence namely, terrorist offenses, we
	      say,  that a confession made to a high  police
	      officer  of  the	rank  of  Superintendent  of
	      Police   and  above,  under  very	  restricted
	      conditions,  will be admissible in a court  of
	      law."
</p><p id="p_603">The  appeal made by the then Hon'ble Minister  might  appear
plausible.   There may be no difficulty in even sharing	 his
views that at some point of time the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_152">761</span>
distrust  with	which the police is looked upon	 has  to  be
given  up.   But  has  the time	 come  for  that?   Was	 the
political, administrative and social climate of the  country
mature	for it?	 What should not be forgotten is that it  is
not the efficiency or honesty of the police force at  higher
level  which  was  relevant  for  taking  such	a  momentous
decision.   What  was required to be considered was  if	 the
approach  of  the police force has undergone a	change.	  It
would not be out of place to extract a paragraph from  Fifth
National Police Commission Report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_131">	      "41.30 We find that policemen have a  tendency
	      to   become   cynical.  We  also	 find	that
	      frequently such cynicism is developed,  within
	      very  few	 years of service.   Policemen	very
	      rapidly  pick up the knowledge that  what	 the
	      law  requires  is	 one  thing  but  what	 has
	      actually	to be done in practice	is  another.
	      Once this dichotomy takes root in their minds,
	      all  training, all exhortations are  a  waste.</blockquote>
<p id="p_604">	      Thus,  the  law is that third  degree  is	 not
	      permitted,  but in practice that is  the	only
	      way.  Very often people themselves expect	 the
	      police to beat up goondas and when this is not
	      done  charges  of bribery and  corruption	 are
	      hurled  at the police.  People  complain	that
	      police  are  partial  in	their  conduct,	 but
	      policemen	 learn that while under the law	 all
	      are  equal,  as things happen, a rich  man  is
	      more  equal than a poor man, a common  citizen
	      different from a politician or one who has the
	      support	of   a	politician,   a	  bureaucrat
	      different from an ordinary government employee  the list is
endless."
</p><p id="p_605">453. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1100">When Evidence Act</a> of 1872 was passed it was enacted  by
a Parliament which was committed to rule the country and not
govern.	  Yet  the  power  to  record  confession  was	 not
entrusted  to police officer.  The rationale is not  far  to
seek.  There is a basic difference between the approach of a
police	officer and a judicial officer.	 A judicial  officer
is  trained  and  tuned to reach the final goal	 by  a	fair
procedure.   The basis of a civilized jurisprudence is	that
the  procedure	by which a person is sent  behind  the	bars
should	be  fair, honest and just.   A	conviction  obtained
unfairly  has never been countenanced by a system  which  is
wedded	to  rule  of law.  A police officer  is	 trained  to
achieve	 the  result irrespective of the  means	 and  method
which  is  employed  to achieve it.  So	 long  the  goal  is
achieved  the means are irrelevant and this philosophy	does
not change by hierarchy of the officers.  A Sub-Inspector of
the  Police may be uncouth in his approach and harsh in	 his
behavior  as  compared	to a  Superintendent  of  Police  or
Additional  Superintendent of Police or any higher  officer.
But  the basic philosophy of the two remains the same.	 The
Inspector  of Police is as much interested in achieving	 the
result	by securing confession of an accused person  as	 the
Superintendent	of Police.  By their training  and  approach
they are different.  Procedural fairness does not have	much
meaning for them.  It may appear unfortunate that even after
independence  a force which was created to  implement  harsh
and  Draconian	laws  of  imperial  regime,  ruthlessly	 and
mercilessly,  has  not changed much even in  people  regime.
Dignity of the individual and liberty of person	 the  basic
philosophy  of Constitution  has still not  percolated	and
reached	 the bottom of the hierarchy as the constabulary  is
still not accountable to public and unlike British police it
is highly centralised administrative
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">762</span>
instrumentality	 meant to wield its stick and spread awe  by
harsh  voice  more for the executive than for  the  law	 and
society.   One of the reasons for it may be, as observed  by
the National Police Commission, the political set-up of	 the
country which has used it more to serve its purpose than  to
serve the society.
</p><p id="p_606">454.	  The  police  constable in England and	 America  is
duty-bound  to inform the accused not only that whatever  he
was going to state could be treated as confession in a court
of  law	 but  he was entitled-to have  his  lawyer  and	 any
relative he desired.  <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_1101">Section 62</a> of Criminal Law Act of 1973
of  England  made  it  mandatory  for  the  police   officer
arresting a person to send information to his relative about
arrest	and  place of detention.  Circular No.	74  of	1978
issued	in England permitted the accused to have  assistance
of  lawyer.   In  America same safeguards  are	provided  by
judicial  decisions.   In <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_1102">Section 24</a> of the Evidence  Act  a
confession  obtained by threat or inducement or by force  is
rendered inadmissible.	By <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1103">Section 25</a> a confession made to a
police officer is deemed to be inadmissible ipso facto.	 But
if  the same confession is made in presence of a  Magistrate
then  by  <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_1104">Section  26</a> it is not	 treated  as  suspect.	 The
obvious reason for these provisions is to ensure fair trial.
A  confession  made to a police officer is suspect  even  in
England	 and  America.	 But it	 has  been  made  admissible
subject	 to the safeguards mentioned above.   Why?   Because
what  is provided by <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_1105">Section 26</a> of the Evidence	 Act  stands
substituted  by	 presence  of lawyer or	 near  relative.   A
confession  to a police officer in presence of a  Magistrate
is  admissible	as it having been recorded  in	presence  of
judicial  authority it becomes credible.   Same	 credibility
attaches  if  the  confession is  recorded  in	England	 and
America	 before	 a  lawyer or near  relative.	Presence  of
Magistrate  under  <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_1106">Section  26</a> of the Evidence	Act  and  of
lawyer	or relative in England and America lend	 credibility
to  the	 confession  recorded by a  police  officer  as	 the
element	 of  inducement,  threat,  duress  or  force  stands
removed.   The	inadmissibility	 attaches  to  a  confession
recorded by a police officer not because of him but  because
of uncertainty if the accused was not made a witness against
himself	 by  forcing out something which he would  not	have
otherwise  stated.   Further a confession made to  a  police
officer for an offence committed irrespective of its  nature
in  non-notified area is inadmissible.	But the same  police
officer	 is beyond reproach when it comes to notified  area.
An  offence under TADA is considered to be more	 serious  as
compared  to  the one under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1107"> Indian Penal Code</a> or  any  other
Act.  Normally graver the offence more strict the procedural
interpretation.	  But  here it is just otherwise.   What  is
inadmissible  for a murder under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1108">Section 302</a>  is  admissible
even against a person who abets or is possessed of the	arms
under  <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_1109">Section	5</a> of the Act.  How the	methods	 applied  by
police in extracting confession has been deprecated by	this
Court  in series of decisions need not reproduced.  But	 all
that changed overnight when TADA was enacted.  Giving  power
to  police officer to record confession may be in line	with
what  is  being	 done  in England  and	America.   But	that
requires a change in outlook by the police.  Before doing so
the police force by education and training has to be made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_154">763</span>
aware  of their duties and responsibilities, as observed  by
Police Commission.  The defect lies not in the personnel but
in  the culture.  In a country where few are under  law	 and
there  is  no accountability, the cultural climate  was	 not
conducive for such a drastic change.  Even when there was no
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1110">Article 21</a>, <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_1111">Article 20(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1112">Article 14</a> of the Constitution
any  confession to police officer was inadmissible.  It	 has
been  the established procedure for more than a century	 and
an  essential  part  of	 criminal  jurisprudence.   It	was,
therefore, necessary to bring about change in outlook before
making	a provision the merits of which are attempted to  be
justified on law existing in other countries.
</p><p id="p_607">455. Since  for	 justifying various provisions	of  the	 Act
reliance  was  placed on Ireland Emergency  Provisions	Act,
1978  and it was attempted to be argued that the  provisions
in  the TADA were fair and just it appears necessary to	 say
few  words.  In 1971 in England an internment  operation  of
provisions  was	 made which led to many arrests	 which	were
challenged  in	High Court.  And the High  Court  held	that
those exercising emergency powers were nonetheless  required
to fulfill ordinary common law requirement of informing	 the
person	arrested of the reason for his arrest.	This led  to
constitution of Diplock Committee which resulted in Northern
Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1973.  This  empowered
the  army to arrest any suspected terrorist for a period  of
four  hours  for establishing identity after  which  it	 was
required  to hand over the accused to the police.  This	 led
to  abuse  of  power  what  came  to  be  called,  "military
security"  approach.   And the survey made in  that  country
noticed, "that the procedure for arrest and questioning	 and
for extra judicial detention has been abused.  The  security
authorities   have  in	some  areas  mounted  a	  'dredging'
operation based on widespread screening.  This has resulted,
in  our	 view, in large numbers of wholly  innocent  persons
being  arrested	 and  large  numbers  whose  involvement  in
terrorist   activities	is  relatively	 unimportant   being
detained"  (Terrorism  and  Criminal Justice  by  Ronald  D.
Crelinsten).  This led to replacement of 1973 Act by the new
Act which is in force.	Various safeguards were made in	 the
Act.   Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_1113">Section 8</a> of the Act excludes	 any
statement  obtained  by torture or  inhuman  treatment	from
admissibility.	 But  Section  15 of  the  TADA	 throws	 all
established  norms  only because it is recorded	 by  a	high
police	officer.  In my opinion our social  environment	 was
not mature for such a drastic change as has been effected by
<a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1114">Section	 15</a>.   It  is destructive of  basic  values  of	 the
constitutional guarantee.
</p><p id="p_608">456.	  A confession is an admission of guilt.  The person
making	it  states something against himself,  therefore  it
should	 be  made  in  surroundings  which  are	 free	from
suspicion.    Otherwise	 it  violates	the   constitutional
guarantee  under <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_1115">Article 20(3)</a> that no person accused of  an
offence shall be compelled to be a witness against  himself.
The  word 'offence' used in the article should be given	 its
ordinary  meaning.   It	 applies  as  much  to	an   offence
committed  under  TADA as under any other  Act.	  The  word,
'compelled'  ordinarily	 means 'by force'.   This  may	take
place positively and negatively.  When one forces one to act
in a manner desired by him it is compelling him
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_155">764</span>
to do that thing.  Same may take place when one is prevented
from  doing  a particular thing unless he agrees  to  do  as
desired.   In  either case it is compulsion.   A  confession
made by an accused or obtained by him under coercion suffers
from infirmity unless it is made freely and voluntarily.  No
civilised democratic country has accepted confession made by
an  accused before a police officer as voluntary  and  above
suspicion,  therefore, admissible in evidence.	One  of	 the
established  rule  or  norms  accepted	everywhere  is	that
custodial  confession is presumed to be tainted.   The	mere
fact that the Legislature was competent to make the law,  as
the  offence  under TADA is one which did not  fall  in	 any
State entry, did not mean that the Legislature was empowered
to  curtail  or erode a person of  his	fundamental  rights.
Making a provision which has the effect of forcing a  person
to  admit his guilt amounts to denial of the  liberty.	 The
class of offenses dealt by TADA may be different than  other
offenses but the offender under TADA is as much entitled  to
protection  of	Articles  20  and  21  as  any	other.	 The
difference   in	 nature	 of  offence  or   the	 legislative
competence  to	enact a law did not affect  the	 fundamental
rights	guaranteed by Chapter III.  If the  construction  as
suggested  by  the learned Additional Solicitor	 General  is
accepted  it shall result in taking the law back once  again
to  the days of Gopalan161, <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1116">Section 15</a> cannot be held to  be
valid merely because it is as a result of law made by a body
which has been found entitled to make the law.	The law must
still  be fair and just as held by this Court.	A law  which
entitles a police officer to record confession and makes  it
admissible  is thus violative of both Articles 20(3) and  21
of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_609">457. <a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_1117">Section 19</a> provides for an appeal as a matter of  right
from   any  judgment,  sentence	 or  order  not	  being	  an
interlocutory  order  of a Designated Court to	the  Supreme
Court both on facts and law.  Such provision existed in 1984
and  1985 Act as well.	It may be mentioned that  when	1984
Act was passed by the Legislature, it was primarily made due
to grave situation prevailing in the State of Punjab.  Today
the 1987 Act has been extended even to far off States.	 The
effect of such extension is that for every sentence, may  be
under  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1118">Section	3</a>  or 4 or any other  section,	one  has  to
approach  this Court.  In many cases, the remedy  of  appeal
may be illusory.  For instance, one may be prosecuted  under
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1119">Sections  3</a>,  <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1120">4</a>	 and  <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_1121">5</a>	 or  under  any	 other	section	 and
provision.   He	 may  be acquitted for	the  offenses  under
<a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1122">Sections  3</a>  and  <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1123">4</a> and yet may	 be  convicted	under  other
sections  or provisions for minor offenses which were  tried
by the Designated Court by virtue of <a href="/doc/1882893/" id="a_1124">Section 12</a> of the	Act.
He  may	 not  be  able to approach  this  Court	 because  of
enormous expenditure and exorbitant legal expenses  involved
in approaching this Court.  It should not be forgotten	that
ours  is  a vast country with majority on the  poorer  side.
The  knowledge of economic inability of sizeable section  of
the  society  to approach this Court by way  of	 appeal	 may
result	in arbitrary exercise of power and excesses  of	 the
police.	 A provision for appeal to this Court in minor cases
may  result  in defeating the remedy itself.   Inability  to
file  appeal due to financial reasons in petty	matters	 may
amount to breach of

guarantee under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.	  It
may in many cases be denial of justice.	 I would, therefore,
suggest that it may be examined if a proviso to	 sub-section
(1)  of <a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_1126">Section 19</a> can be added that a person  convicted  of

of  the	 accused  filed	 in  the  High	Court  shall  stand,
automatically,	transferred  to	 this  Court  and  shall  be

home by the State.

invoked	 as an abuse of process of court or  for  extraneous

of us (Pandian, J.) was a member, after detailed examination
of the judicial decisions held, "where the allegations	made

they  were taken at their face value and accepted  in  their
entirety did not prima facie constitute any offence or	make

under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1134">Article 226</a> was maintainable.  It was urged that	 the

relation  to  exclusion of High Court's	 jurisdiction  under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1135">Sections  439</a>  and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1136">482</a> were squarely applicable	 to  Article

that  power of superintendence conferred by <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1138">Article 227</a>	 was
to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases
in  order to keep the subordinate courts within	 the  bounds
and their authority and not in correcting errors.  The	High
Court  should  not  be permitted  to  entertain	 a  petition
against rejection of bail under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1139">Article	 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1140">227.</a>  Reliance was also placed on <a href="/doc/376684/" id="a_1141">State  of
Gujarat	 v.  Vakhtsinghji  Suringhji  Vaghela119</a>  and  <a href="/doc/26503/" id="a_1142">Mohd.
Yunus v. Mohd.	Mustaqiml</a> 21.  The power given to High Court
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1143">Article	226</a> is an extraordinary power  not  only  to
correct the manifest error but also to exercise it for	sake
of  justice.   Under the scheme of the Constitution  a	High
Court is the highest court for purposes of exercising civil,
appellate,  criminal or even constitutional jurisdiction  so
far that State is concerned.  The jurisdiction possessed  by
it  before  coming  into  force	 of  the  Constitution	 was
preserved  by  <a href="/doc/12910/" id="a_1144">Article 225</a> and by Articles 226	and  227  an
extraordinary  jurisdiction  was conferred on it  to  ensure
that the subordinate authorities act not only in  accordance
with law but they also function within the framework of law.
That jurisdiction of the High Court has not been taken	away
and  in	 fact could not be taken away  by  legislation.	  In
England even in absence of Constitution whenever an  attempt
was  made by Parliament to provide that the order was  final
and  no writ of certiorari would lie the High  Court  always
struck	down the provision.  Since the High Court under	 the
Constitution is a forum for enforcement of fundamental right
of  a citizen it cannot be denied the power to	entertain  a
petition by a citizen claiming that the State machinery	 was
abusing	 its  power  and  was acting  in  violation  of	 the
constitutional	guarantee.  Rather it has  a  constitutional
duty  and responsibility to ensure that the State  machinery
was acting fairly and not on extraneous considerations.	  <a href="/doc/1577324/" id="a_1145">In
State  of  Maharashtra v. Abdul Hamid Haji  Mohammed</a>"'	this
Court  after examining the principle laid down in  <a href="/doc/1033637/" id="a_1146">State  of
Haryana	 v.  Bhajan  Lal159</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1256540/" id="a_1147">Paras	 Ram  v.  State	  of
Haryanal63</a>  held  that the High Court  has  jurisdiction  to
entertain  a  petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1148">Article 226</a> in  extreme  cases.
What  are  such	 extreme cases cannot be put  in  a  strait-
jacket.	  But  the  few on which there	can  be	 hardly	 any
dispute	 are  if  the  High Court is  of  opinion  that	 the
proceedings under TADA were an abuse of process of court  or
taken for extraneous considerations or there was no material
on record that a case under TADA was made out.	If it be  so
then  there  is	 no reason why should  the  High  Court	 not
exercise  its jurisdiction and grant bail to the accused  in
those  cases  where one or the other exceptional  ground  is
made out.
</p><p id="p_613">460. Since I am agreeing with Brother Pandian, J. except  on
one  or	 two  issues it appears	 appropriate  to  record  my
conclusions in brief:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_132">	      (1)   That  the three <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_1149">Acts  Act</a> 61  of  1984,
	      Act  31 of 1985, and Act 28 of 1987 have	been
	      validly enacted by the Parliament in  exercise
	      of its power under Entry 1 of List III of	 the
	      Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_133">	      (2)   Even   though   no	opinion	  has	been
	      expressed by Brother Pandian, J., on <a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_1150">Section 5</a>
	      <a href="/doc/1093366/" id="a_1151">1</a>	 am  of the opinion that the  provisions  of
	      this  section  can be invoked  only  when	 the
	      prosecution  is able to establish	 that  there
	      was
	      119   (1968) 3 SCR 692: AIR 1968 SC 1481
	      121   (1983) 4 SCC 566
	      117   (1994) 2 SCC 664
	      159   (1964)  1  SCR 332: AIR  1963  SC  1295:

	      some material on record to show that the	arms
	      and  ammunition mentioned in the section	were
	      likely  to  be  used  for	 any  terrorist	  or
	      disruptive activity or that they had been used
	      as such.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_134">	      (3)   Although  the  provisions  relating	  to
	      appointment  of a person as  Designated  Court
	      are clear yet in the written arguments it	 was
	      pointed  out that some of them were  appointed
	      even  after  retirement.	 Such	appointments
	      would be in teeth of the express provisions in
	      the  statute.   Therefore, no  one  should  be
	      appointed as Designated Court who has  retired
	      from service.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_135">	      (4)   As	regards <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_1152">Section 15</a> of the Act  which
	      provides	 for  recording	 of  confession	  by
	      Superintendent  of  Police, for  the  detailed
	      reasons  given by me I am of the opinion	that
	      it  is violative of Articles 20 and 21 of	 the
	      Constitution  and, therefore, is liable to  be
	      struck down.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_136">	      (5)   As	regards provisions of appeal I	have
	      suggested	 that  it  may be  examined  by	 the
	      appropriate  authority if a proviso  could  be
	      added to <a href="/doc/1166210/" id="a_1153">Section 19</a> that where convictions are
	      for  offenses other than <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_1154">Sections 3</a> and  <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_1155">4</a>  of
	      Act 28 of 1987 the accused may be entitled  to
	      file an appeal in the High Court itself and in
	      case an appeal against conviction is filed  by
	      the  Government in this Court then the  appeal
	      filed by the accused in the High Court  should
	      stand automatically transferred.	I am further
	      of the opinion that in such cases the  accused
	      should be provided a counsel of his choice and
	      the  payment of fee should be either  made  by
	      the State or if made by the accused it  should
	      be reimbursed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_137">	      (6)   As	regards	 jurisdiction  of  the	High
	      Court  to	 entertain an application  for	bail
	      under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1156">Article 226</a> of the Constitution I am  of
	      the   opinion  that  the	High  Courts   being
	      constitutionally	obliged to ensure  that	 any
	      authority which exercises judicial and  quasi-
	      judicial powers in its jurisdiction  functions
	      within  the framework of law, are entitled  to
	      entertain	 the  petition to determine  if	 the
	      proceedings  were not an abuse of	 process  of
	      court.   But while exercising  discretion	 the
	      court must not be oblivious of the sensitivity
	      of  the legislation and the  social  objective
	      inherent in it and, therefore, should  exercise
	      it  for  the  sake  of  justice  in  rare	 and
	      exceptional cases the details of which  cannot
	      be fixed by any rigid formula.
