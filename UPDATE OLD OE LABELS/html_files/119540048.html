<p id="p_1">ALTAMAS KABIR, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.    Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    The sole question for consideration in these appeals is whether  on  a
complaint made to the Copyright Board under  <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_1">Section  31</a>  of  the  Copyright
Act, 1957, the said Board under Clause (b) of Sub-Section (1)  can  pass  an
interim order in the pending complaint.  Since, we  shall  be  dealing  with
the  said  section  throughout  this  judgment,  the   same   is   extracted
hereinbelow :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      “31. Compulsory licence in works withheld from public.-(1) If  at  any
      time during the term of copyright in any Indian work  which  has  been
      published or performed in public, a complaint is made to the Copyright
      Board that the owner of copyright in the work-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (a) has refused to republish or allow the re-publication of  the
           work or has refused to allow the performance in  public  of  the
           work, and by reason of such refusal the work  is  withheld  from
           the public; or


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (b)  has  refused  to  allow  communication  to  the  public  by
           [broadcast], of such work or in the case of a [sound  recording]
           the work recorded in such [sound recording], on terms which  the
           complainant considers reasonable,


      the Copyright Board, after giving to the owner of the copyright in the
      work a reasonable opportunity of being heard and  after  holding  such
      inquiry as it may deem necessary, may, if it  is  satisfied  that  the
      grounds for such refusal are not reasonable, direct the  Registrar  of
      Copyrights to grant to the complainant a  licence  to  re-publish  the
      work, perform the work in public or communicate the work to the public
      by [broadcast], as the case may be, subject to payment to the owner of
      the copyright of such compensation and subject to such other terms and
      conditions as the Copyright Board may  determine;  and  thereupon  the
      Registrar of Copyrights shall grant the licence to the complainant  in
      accordance with the directions of Copyright Board, on payment of  such
      fee as may be prescribed.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      Explanation.-In  this  sub-section,  the  expression   "Indian   work”
      includes-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">           (i) an artistic work, the author of which is a citizen of India;
           and


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           (ii) a  cinematograph  film  or  a  [sound  recording]  made  or
           manufactured in India.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (2) Where two or more persons have made a complaint under  sub-section
      (1), the licence shall be  granted  to  the  complainant  who  in  the
      opinion of the Copyright Board would best serve the interests  of  the
      general public.”


</blockquote><p id="p_4">3.    However, in order to consider the said question, it  is  necessary  to
set out some of the facts giving rise to the said question.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.     These  appeals  preferred  by  Super   Cassettes   Industries   Ltd.,
hereinafter referred to as  “Super  Cassettes”,  are  directed  against  the
order dated 1st September, 2011, passed by the Delhi High Court  whereby  it
reversed the order passed by the Copyright Board on  28th  March,  2011,  in
which the Board held that it did not have the  power  to  grant  an  interim
compulsory licence.  By its judgment and order dated 1st September, 2011  in
R.F.A.No.250 of 2011 and C.M.No.8977 of 2011, the High  Court  reversed  the
finding of the Copyright Board upon holding that even  while  the  grant  of
compulsory  licence  under  <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_2">Section  31</a>  of  the  Copyright  Act  was  under
consideration, an interim compulsory licence  could  be  granted.  The  High
Court also held that where the dispute is over the quantum of  licence  fee,
an interim compulsory  licence  had  to  be  granted.   The  impugned  order
directs the Copyright Board to grant an interim compulsory  licence  against
Super Cassettes with the further direction to  the  Board  to  fix  its  own
terms for such licences, after hearing the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    Appearing for  Super  Cassettes,  Mr.  Amit  Sibal,  learned  counsel,
submitted that on 16th May, 2008, this Court had  decided  the  two  set  of
cases, in which it upheld  the  setting  aside  of  the  compulsory  licence
granted against Super Cassettes  by  the  Copyright  Board  in  relation  to
Entertainment Network India Ltd.,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  “ENIL”,  a
radio broadcaster.  In the other set of matters, where Super  Cassettes  was
not a party, this Court upheld the grant of compulsory licence  in  relation
to the works administered  by  Phonographic  Performance  Ltd.,  hereinafter
referred to as “PPL”, and remanded the matter to the Copyright Board to  fix
the rates at which  the  compulsory  licences,  in  relation  to  the  works
administered by PPL, were to be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    Pursuant to the decision of this Court,  the  Copyright  Board  passed
the order on 25th August, 2010, fixing the rates, not just for PPL, but  for
all music providers, including Super  Cassettes,  although,  it  was  not  a
party to the proceedings.  Mr. Sibal submitted that on 9th September,  2010,
Music Broadcast Pvt. Ltd., hereinafter  referred  to  as  “MBPL”,  wrote  to
Super Cassettes informing it that MBPL proposed to broadcast  the  works  in
which copyright was owned by Super Cassettes  on  the  terms  fixed  in  the
aforesaid order of the Copyright Board dated 25th August, 2010.   Mr.  Sibal
submitted that this was done despite the fact  that  MBPL  had  an  existing
voluntary licence from Super  Cassettes,  which  had  subsisted  since  25th
March, 2002, and had been amended and renewed a number of times since  then.
 It was  also  submitted  that  several  other  broadcasters  with  existing
voluntary licence from Super Cassettes wrote similar letters to it.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.    Super Cassettes filed Writ Petition No.6255 of 2010,  questioning  the
order passed by the Copyright Board dated 25th August, 2010.  After  hearing
Super Cassettes and the Respondents,  including  MBPL,  on  15th  September,
2010, the Delhi High Court passed an interim order to the  effect  that  the
order dated 25th August, 2010, passed by the Board would not be relied  upon
by any of the Respondents or  any  other  party  for  a  compulsory  licence
against Super Cassettes. Despite the  aforesaid  order  of  the  Delhi  High
Court dated 15th September, 2010, MBPL filed an application  for  compulsory
licence under <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_3">Section 31(1)(b)</a> of the Copyright Act, relying solely  on  the
rates fixed by the Copyright Board for PPL by its order dated  25th  August,
2010.  Other eight  broadcasters  also  filed  applications  for  compulsory
licence against  Super  Cassettes,  relying  solely  on  the  order  of  the
Copyright Board dated 25th August, 2010.  Super Cassettes responded  to  the
said offer made by MBPL on the  same  terms  as  were  prevalent  under  the
expired voluntary  licence  agreement.  The  said  proposal  made  by  Super
Cassettes was rejected  by  MBPL,  while  other  broadcasters  continued  to
broadcast the work of Super Cassettes  on  existing  mutually  agreed  terms
which were different from the terms set out in the order  of  the  Copyright
Board dated 25th August, 2010.  By its order dated  28th  March,  2011,  the
Copyright Board dismissed the application for interim relief filed  by  MBPL
holding that it did not have the  power  to  grant  any  interim  compulsory
licence.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.    Mr. Sibal submitted that even though MBPL did not broadcast the  works
of Super Cassettes after 25th December, 2010, its radio  station,  known  as
“Radio City”, improved its listenership ratings to become the  most  popular
radio station in Mumbai and was maintaining its position as the  fifth  most
popular radio station  in  Delhi.  Mr.  Sibal  urged  that  MBPL  thereafter
preferred an appeal against the order dated 28th  March,  2011,  before  the
Delhi High Court and vide the impugned order, the High Court held  that  the
Copyright Board had the power to issue interim compulsory licence.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.    Mr. Sibal submitted that the impugned order of the Delhi  High  Court,
inter alia, held that the power to grant interim  relief  is  not  dependent
upon a specific statutory empowerment  to  this  effect.   The  power  is  a
common law principle and is not founded on any statute or legislation.   Mr.
Sibal submitted that the Delhi High Court also held that the refusal of  the
copyright  holder  to  grant  a  licence  would,  in  effect,   compel   the
broadcaster or any other party similarly  placed,  into  succumbing  to  the
demands of the owners and that since, litigation is protracted  over  years,
a party would be unable to play or broadcast music, owned by  the  copyright
holder, even though it was willing to pay a reasonable fee for  making  such
broadcast and may also have to give up its action under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_4">Section  31</a>  of  the
Copyright Act.  Mr. Sibal urged that the High Court went  on  to  hold  that
refusal to grant interim relief would frustrate the rights of a  broadcaster
under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_5">Section 31</a> of the Copyright Act, which would render the provisions  of
the statute futile and nugatory.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   It was further held by the  High  Court  that  where  the  controversy
concerns only the quantum of licence fee, an interim  protection  should  be
granted and even though Super Cassettes was not a party to the order of  the
Copyright Board dated 25th August, 2010, it  is  similarly  placed  as  PPL,
which was bound by the order passed by  the  Board  on  25th  August,  2010.
Accordingly, it was appropriate that Super Cassettes should also receive  2%
of the net advertisement revenue as licence fee in the  interim  period  for
broadcasting of its sound recordings.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.   Mr. Sibal urged that the Division  Bench  of  the  Bombay  High  Court
chose not to differ with the decision of the Single Judge  in  Music  Choice
India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Phonographic Performance Ltd. [(2009) 39  PTC  597],  in
which the learned Single Judge had held  that  the  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_6">Copyright  Act</a>  did  not
prohibit  the  Copyright  Board  from  passing   any   interim   order   for
determination of reasonable fees by way of royalty or  compensation  by  the
plaintiff.  The High Court disposed of  the  appeal  by  making  an  interim
arrangement, whereby Super Cassettes was to receive an aggregate  of  4%  of
the advertisement revenue of MBPL for  broadcasting  its  sound  recordings,
music and literary work, while remanding the matter to the  Copyright  Board
for interim order, making it clear that the Board need not be bound  by  the
interim arrangement devised by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.   Mr. Sibal submitted that the High Court had erred in  law  in  holding
that even in the absence of an express conferment by statute, the  Copyright
Board had the power to grant an interim compulsory licence under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_7">Section  31</a>
of the Copyright Act.  He urged that  the  Copyright  Board  is  a  Tribunal
created under <a href="/doc/98765/" id="a_8">Section 11</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957, and  being  a  creature
of statute, its powers were confined to  the  powers  given  to  it  by  the
statute.  Mr. Sibal urged that while  <a href="/doc/1657731/" id="a_9">Section  12</a>  of  the  Act  vested  the
Copyright Board with  the  authority  to  regulate  its  own  procedure  and
<a href="/doc/35469/" id="a_10">Section 74</a> conferred certain limited powers of a civil court on  the  Board,
the same were procedural in nature  and  did  not  vest  the  Board  with  a
substantive right to grant interim orders under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_11">Section 31</a> of the Act.   Mr.
Sibal submitted that the High Court had  erred  in  holding  that  grant  of
interim relief was not dependent upon a specific  statutory  empowerment  to
this effect. Learned counsel submitted that being  a  creature  of  statute,
the Copyright Board could  only  exercise  such  powers  as  were  expressly
vested in it by  the  statute  and  that  the  power  to  grant  an  interim
compulsory licence not having been vested  with  the  Board,  it  could  not
exercise such substantive power, which it did not possess.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.   In support of his submissions, Mr. Sibal referred to the  decision  of
this Court in Rajeev Hitendra Pathak &amp; Ors. Vs. Achyut Kashinath  Karekar  &amp;
Anr. [2011 (9) SCALE 287], wherein three learned Judges of this  Court  were
called upon to consider as to whether  the  District  Forum  and  the  State
Commission as established under the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_12">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986,  had  the
power to recall an ex parte order.  After examining  various  provisions  of
the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_13">Consumer Protection Act</a>, this Court held that such an express power  not
having been conferred on the District Forum and the State  Commission,  they
had no jurisdiction to exercise such powers which  had  not  been  expressly
given to them.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.   Mr. Sibal also referred to  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  Morgan
Stanley Mutual Fund Vs. Kartick Das [(1994) 4 SCC 225], wherein  this  Court
was considering the scope of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_14">Consumer Protection  Act</a>,
1986.  On construction of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_15">Section 14</a> of the said Act,  this  Court  came  to
the conclusion that there was no power under the Act to  grant  any  interim
relief, even of an ad interim  nature.   Their  Lordships  who  decided  the
matter, observed as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      “……… If the jurisdiction of the Forum to grant relief is  confined  to
      the  four  clauses  mentioned  under  <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_16">Section  14</a>,   it   passes   our
      comprehension as to how an interim injunction could  ever  be  granted
      disregarding even the balance of convenience.”


</blockquote><p id="p_16">15.   Reference was also made to a decision of the Punjab and  Haryana  High
Court in Sham Lal Vs. State Election  Commission  [AIR  1997  P&amp;H  164],  in
which the High Court was considering a similar question as  to  whether  the
Election Tribunal constituted under the  Punjab  State  Election  Commission
Act, 1994, had the power to pass an injunction so as to restrain an  elected
representative from assuming office  pending  adjudication  of  an  election
petition filed against him. After  considering  various  provisions  of  the
1994 Act, the Court observed  that  “if  the  legislature  had  so  desired,
nothing prevented it from  conferring  statutory  power  upon  the  Election
Tribunal to grant interim stay or injunction or restraint order  during  the
pendency of the election petition.”  Accordingly, the Court went on to  hold
that the Election Tribunal did not have the  power  to  pass  any  order  of
injunction or stay which would impede the implementation of  the  result  of
election.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.   Mr. Sibal cited yet another decision on the same issue rendered  by  a
Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Lingamma Vs.  State  of  Karnataka
[AIR 1982 Karnataka 18], where the question involved was as to  whether  the
Appellate Tribunal constituted under the Karnataka Appellate  Tribunal  Act,
1976, was empowered to  pass  interim  orders  when  there  was  no  express
provision which conferred such substantive power on the Appellate  Tribunal.
 The Full Bench held that “in the absence of express  conferment,  power  to
grant temporary injunction was not implied.”  The Full  Bench  further  held
that the fact that no express provision had  been  made  conferring  on  the
Tribunal jurisdiction to make interlocutory orders, clearly  indicates  that
the legislature did not want the Tribunal to have such powers.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.   Mr. Sibal urged that in view of the  aforesaid  decisions  and  having
regard to the fact that the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_17">Copyright Act</a>  did  not  specifically  vest  the
Copyright Board  with  substantive  powers  to  pass  interim  orders  under
<a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_18">Section 31</a> of the Copyright Act, the High  Court  erred  in  taking  a  view
which was contrary to the well-established principle that a  statutory  body
could exercise only such powers that were vested in it by a statute and  not
otherwise.  Learned counsel urged that by making an interim arrangement  and
granting an interim compulsory licence to the  Respondent,  the  High  Court
had conferred upon itself a jurisdiction  which  the  Copyright  Board  and,
consequently, the High Court  did  not  possess  under  <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_19">Section  31</a>  of  the
Copyright Act.
</p>
<p id="p_19">18.   Mr. Sibal went on to submit further  that  all  tribunals  constituted
under different statutes, were not the same and some enjoyed powers to  pass
certain orders which had been vested in them by  statute,  which  made  them
different from other tribunals to whom such  express  powers  had  not  been
given. Learned  counsel  urged  that  there  were  certain  tribunals  which
completely supplemented the jurisdiction of the Civil Court and,  therefore,
exercised all the powers of the  Civil  Court  in  respect  of  the  matters
entrusted to them by statute. In this regard, reference was made to  <a href="/doc/132806168/" id="a_20">Section
41(1)</a> of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 1985,  which  specifically  provides
that  the  Tribunal  shall  have  all  jurisdiction,  powers  and  authority
exercisable by all courts in matters  relating  to  service.  Reference  was
also made to other Tribunals, such as, the  Telecom  Disputes  Settlement  &amp;
Appellate Tribunal, the National Green Tribunal and also the Debts  Recovery
Tribunal, which had been  expressly  vested  with  powers  to  pass  interim
orders under the statutes under which  they  had  been  created.  Mr.  Sibal
submitted that there were no similar provisions in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_21">Copyright Act</a>,  which
granted such powers to the Copyright Board.
</p>
<p id="p_20">19.   Mr. Sibal then  submitted  that  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the
Copyright  Board  was  discharging  quasi-judicial  functions,  it  did  not
possess inherent powers to pass interim orders, since it continued to  be  a
tribunal governed by the statute under which it had been  created.   It  did
not, therefore, have jurisdiction to pass interim orders  which  inheres  in
other Tribunals.  Referring to the decision of  this  Court  in  Bindeshwari
Prasad Singh Vs. Kali Singh [(1977) 1 SCC 57], Mr. Sibal urged that  in  the
said decision, this Court  was  called  upon  to  decide  as  to  whether  a
Magistrate had the authority to review or recall  his  order.  It  was  held
that unlike Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, which vests  the  civil
courts and certain tribunals with inherent powers, the subordinate  criminal
courts had no such inherent power, since there was absolutely  no  provision
in the Code of Criminal Procedure empowering a magistrate to  exercise  such
powers.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.   Mr. Sibal lastly referred to the decision of this Court  in  Transcore
Vs. Union of India [(2008) 1 SCC 125], and submitted that in the said  case,
this Court had observed that the Debts Recovery Tribunal is a  tribunal  and
a creature of statute and it does not have inherent powers which existed  in
the civil courts.
</p>
<p id="p_22">21.   Mr. Sibal also submitted that apart from  the  decisions  rendered  in
the case of Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund (supra), the Supreme Court  had  held
on several occasions that while entertaining  matters,  final  relief  ought
not to have been granted at the interim stage.  In  fact,  as  submitted  by
Mr. Sibal, the courts will not imply a power in a  particular  provision  of
the statute if  the  legislative  intent  behind  the  statute  suggested  a
contrary view.  Learned counsel submitted that implying a power to  exercise
the powers under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_22">Section 31</a> of the Act was not the legislative intent  which
is easily discernible.  It was  urged  that  implying  such  a  power  would
transform compulsory licensing to statutory licensing without any  statutory
mandate to do so.  Mr. Sibal also reiterated the principle that power  would
not be implied to displace a pre-existing vested  statutory  right  and  the
court would not, therefore,  exercise  such  powers  as  a  statutory  right
unless a statute expressly allowed the same.  The power  to  over-ride  such
pre-existing right had to be in express terms  and  could  not  be  implied.
Various other decisions were referred to  by  Mr.  Sibal,  which  will  only
amount to repetition to what has already been stated.
</p>
<p id="p_23">22.   Mr. Sibal submitted that the High Court  erred  in  holding  that  the
Copyright Board had power to grant an interim compulsory  licence  and  that
when there was a dispute as to the quantum of fees payable by the  licencee,
an interim compulsory licence had to be given.  Mr. Sibal submitted that  in
the face of the well-established  propositions  of  law,  the  High  Court’s
order could not stand and was liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_24">23.   Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for  the
Respondent, firstly contended that although <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_23">Section 31</a> of the Copyright  Act
may not have expressly vested the  power  to  pass  interim  orders  on  the
Copyright  Board  pending  disposal  of  an  application  for  grant  of   a
compulsory licence, the same would have to  be  read  into  the  Section  as
being incidental to the powers granted by the Statute to the Board to  grant
compulsory licences.   Dr. Singhvi urged that it could  not  have  been  the
intention of the legislature that pending the determination of the right  of
an applicant to a compulsory licence, the public should be deprived  of  the
entertainment of listening to music in respect of which the  owner  has  the
copyright, in this case, Super Cassettes.
</p>
<p id="p_25">24.   Dr. Singhvi urged that if it were to be held that the  Board  did  not
have such power to grant an interim  compulsory  licence,  the  consequences
would be contrary to public interest, since it was not  possible  to  assess
the time that could be taken by the Copyright  Board  for  disposing  of  an
application for grant of compulsory licence.   Dr.  Singhvi  submitted  that
the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_24">Copyright Act</a>  is  a  Code  in  itself  and  that  matters  relating  to
copyrights and grant of licences had been left to the  Copyright  Board  for
decision, which only lend strength to  the  submission  that  the  Board  is
vested with incidental and ancillary powers under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_25">Section 31</a> of the  Act  to
give effect to the final relief which it is  empowered  to  give  under  the
said Section.
</p>
<p id="p_26">25.   Dr. Singhvi referred to <a href="/doc/414728/" id="a_26">Section 25</a> of the  Trade  Marks  Act  as  also
<a href="/doc/44680/" id="a_27">Section 25(i)</a> and (ii) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_28">Patents  Act</a>,  which  vested  the  authorities
under the said Acts to pass appropriate orders in aid of the  final  relief.
Dr. Singhvi urged that  it  is  in   situations  such  as  these,  that  the
doctrine of “implied power” comes into play. Learned counsel submitted  that
without holding that the Copyright Board had the  authority  to  direct  the
grant of interim  compulsory  licences  in  keeping  with  the  doctrine  of
implied power, the  provisions  of  the  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_29">Copyright  Act</a>  would  be  rendered
somewhat unworkable.
</p>
<p id="p_27">26.   Dr. Singhvi urged that the Copyright Board is  a  quasi-judicial  body
discharging quasi-judicial functions and under the scheme  of  the  Act,  it
has been vested with the power to determine the reasonableness of  royalties
claimed by performing rights societies and to fix the rates thereof  and  to
consider applications  for  general  licences  for  public  broadcasting  of
works.  Dr. Singhvi submitted that it is in that context that <a href="/doc/1657731/" id="a_30">Section 12</a>  of
the Copyright Act would have to be read.  Under <a href="/doc/1657731/" id="a_31">Section  12</a>,  which  defines
the powers and procedure of the Copyright  Board,  it  has  been  stipulated
that the Board would, subject to any rules that may be made under  the  Act,
have the power to regulate  its  own  procedure,  including  the  fixing  of
places and times of its meetings.   Referring to Sub-section (7) of  <a href="/doc/1657731/" id="a_32">Section
12</a>, Dr. Singhvi urged that the Copyright Board is  to  be  deemed  to  be  a
Civil Court for certain purposes and all proceedings before  the  Board  are
to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_33">Sections  193</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_34">228</a>  of
the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_28">27.   Dr. Singhvi then drew the Court’s attention to  <a href="/doc/1725108/" id="a_35">Section  19-A</a>  of  the
Copyright Act, which was inserted by amendment with effect from 9th  August,
1984, in regard to disputes with respect to  assignment  of  copyright.   It
was submitted that the said provision clearly indicated that the  Board  was
an adjudicating authority in regard to  disputes  between  the  parties  and
would, therefore, be deemed to be  vested  with  ancillary  powers  to  make
interim orders in aid of the  final  relief  that  could  be  granted  under
<a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_36">Section 31</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_29">28.   Dr. Singhvi urged that the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_37">Copyright Act</a>  contemplated  the  grant  of
three types of licences, namely :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">        i) voluntary;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">       ii) compulsory; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      iii) statutory.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">   Dr. Singhvi urged that <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_38">Sections 30</a>, <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_39">31</a> and <a href="/doc/1288659/" id="a_40">31-A</a>  of  the  Act  deal  with
grant of voluntary,  compulsory  and  statutory  licences.   However,  while
<a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_41">Section 30</a> deals with grant of voluntary  licences  by  the  owners  of  the
copyright, <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_42">Sections 31</a> and <a href="/doc/1288659/" id="a_43">31-A</a> speak of grant of licences for  broadcasting
works which had been withheld from  the  public,  either  by  the  copyright
owners, or where the owner of an Indian work is either dead or  untraceable.
 However, <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_44">Section 52</a> of the  Act  also  made  provision  that  certain  acts
performed by broadcasters were not  to  be  considered  as  infringement  of
copyright.  In particular, reference was made  by  Dr.  Singhvi  to  <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_45">Section
52(1)(j)(iv)</a> which indicates that the making of sound recordings in  respect
of any literary, dramatic or musical work would not amount  to  infringement
of copyright if the person making such sound recording allowed the owner  of
the right or his duly authorised agent  or  representative  to  inspect  all
records and books  of  accounts  relating  to  such  sound  recording.   Dr.
Singhvi urged that, in any event, any  decision  in  respect  of  the  above
provisions would be appealable under <a href="/doc/1528325/" id="a_46">Section 72</a> of the  Copyright  Act.  Dr.
Singhvi urged that the powers now vested in the  Copyright  Board  were,  in
fact, powers which had been  vested  in  it  as  high  a  body  as  Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council under <a href="/doc/42009/" id="a_47">Section 4</a> of the Copyright  Act,  1911,
which had been passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom  and  modified
in its application to India by the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_48">Indian Copyright Act</a>, 1914.
</p>
<p id="p_31">29.   In support of the submissions made by him,  Dr.  Singhvi  referred  to
various decisions, beginning with the decision of this Court in  Income  Tax
Officer Vs. M.K. Mohammed Kunhi [(1969) 2 SCR 65], wherein the power of  the
Income Tax  Appellate  Tribunal  to  stay  recovery  of  penalty  was  under
consideration.  Although,  such  power  was  not  directly  vested  in   the
Tribunal, the High Court held that the power to order the stay  or  recovery
of penalty is an incidental and ancillary power possessed  by  the  Tribunal
in its appellate jurisdiction. Reference  was  also  made  to  the  decision
cited on behalf of the Appellant  in  Morgan  Stanley’s  case  (supra).  Dr.
Singhvi urged that the same was  no  longer  good  law  on  account  of  the
subsequent decisions of this Court. Dr.  Singhvi  urged  that  in  Allahabad
Bank, Calcutta Vs. Radha Krishna Maity &amp;  Ors.  [(1999)  6  SCC  755],  this
Court was considering the provisions of the Recovery of Debts Due  to  Banks
and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, hereinafter referred to  as  “the  <a href="/doc/1683455/" id="a_49">DRT
Act</a>”, wherein it was held that in a Suit under <a href="/doc/509070/" id="a_50">Section  19(1)</a>  for  recovery
of monies, the Tribunal acted within its powers in passing an interim  order
to restrain the defendants from  recovering  any  money  from  a  particular
party. It was held that in view of <a href="/doc/535461/" id="a_51">Section 22(1)</a> of the  Act,  the  Tribunal
could exercise powers contained in the Civil Procedure Code and  could  even
go beyond<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_52"> the Code</a> as long as  it  passed  orders  in  conformity  with  the
principles of natural justice. This Court held further  that  <a href="/doc/84171509/" id="a_53">Section  19(6)</a>
of the Act did not in any manner limit the generality of the powers  of  the
Tribunal under  <a href="/doc/535461/" id="a_54">Section  22(1)</a>  and  that  <a href="/doc/84171509/" id="a_55">Section  19(6)</a>  was  an  enabling
provision and that certain types of stay orders  and  injunctions  mentioned
therein could be passed by the Tribunal, but the same could  not  be  deemed
to be exhaustive nor restricting the Tribunal’s powers only to  those  types
of injunctions or stay orders mentioned therein. It was also  observed  that
in addition, Rule 18 enabled the Tribunal to pass orders to secure the  ends
of justice. Dr. Singhvi urged that the aforesaid decision of this Court  was
based on its earlier decision in Industrial Credit &amp; Investment  Corporation
of India Ltd. Vs. Grapco Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. [(1999) 4 SCC 710],  wherein
it had been held that the Debts Recovery  Tribunal  had  jurisdiction  under
<a href="/doc/338252/" id="a_56">Section 19(6)</a> of the DRT Act to  grant  interim  orders,  since  such  power
inheres in a Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_32">30.   Dr. Singhvi lastly contended that  the  decision  in  Rajeev  Hitendra
Pathak’s case (supra) could not be relied upon for a decision in  this  case
on account of the fact that in the said case this Court was called  upon  to
consider as to whether the District Forum and the State Commission had  been
vested with powers of revision,  in  the  absence  whereof  they  could  not
exercise such powers which had not  been  expressly  vested  in  them.   Dr.
Singhvi urged that having regard to the  various  decisions  of  this  Court
which have categorically held that powers to  pass  certain  interim  orders
were incidental and ancillary to the  exercise  of  powers  conferred  on  a
Tribunal  by  the  Statute,  the  doctrine  of  implied  power  would  stand
attracted and the  orders  of  the  High  Court  could  not,  therefore,  be
faulted.
</p>
<p id="p_33">31. Mr. Bhaskar P. Gupta, learned Senior Advocate,  appearing  for  some  of
the interveners,  adopted  Dr.  Singhvi’s  submissions  and  reiterated  the
concept that the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_57">Copyright Act</a> is a complete code in itself and the  parties
to the dispute would have to take recourse to the provisions of the Act  and
not<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_58"> the Civil Code</a> which lends support to Dr.  Singhvi’s   submissions  that
the “doctrine of implied  power”  would  have  to  be  incorporated  in  the
provisions  of  the  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_59">Copyright  Act</a>,  as  far  as  the  Copyright  Board  is
concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_34">32.   Mr. Gupta also raised the question as to whether during  the  pendency
of an existing licence granted under <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_60">Section 30</a>, a dispute could  be  raised
with  regard  to  the  fees  charged  under  <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_61">Section  31(1)(b)</a>   which   may
subsequently convert the voluntary licence given under  <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_62">Section  30</a>  of  the
Copyright Act into a compulsory  licence  under  <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_63">Section  31</a>  thereof.   Mr.
Gupta  contended  that  since  <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_64">Section  31(1)(b)</a>  of  the  Act  contemplates
adjudication, the Copyright Board had  the  trappings  of  a  quasi-judicial
authority which inheres in itself the right to pass interim  orders  in  the
interest of the parties and to apply  the  principles  of  natural  justice,
keeping in mind the  public  interest.   In  this  regard,  Mr.  Gupta  also
submitted that <a href="/doc/141634/" id="a_65">Section 75</a> of the Copyright Act provides that the orders  for
payment of money passed by the Registrar of Copyrights, the Copyright  Board
or by the High Court would be deemed to be decrees  of  a  Civil  Court  and
would be executable in the same manner as  a  decree  of  such  Court.   Mr.
Gupta contended that the intention of the legislature would  be  clear  from
the scheme of the Act that matters relating to  copyright  should  be  dealt
with by the authorities under the Act and not the Civil Court.
</p>
<p id="p_35">33.   Mrs. Prathiba Singh, learned Advocate, who appeared  for  one  of  the
parties, while reiterating the submissions  made  by  Dr.  Singhvi  and  Mr.
Gupta, submitted that the powers of the Board had been  gradually  increased
by legislation from time to time and even  in  regard  to  the  question  of
subsisting licences and the  grant  of  new  licences,  there  could  be  no
dispute as to the powers vested in the Copyright Board and the orders  which
it  was  competent  to  pass.   Mrs.  Singh,  however,  introduced   another
dimension  into  the  debate  by  contending  that  the  membership  of  the
Copyright Board is drawn from various quarters.  There being 14 members,  it
does not meet regularly and decisions in cases are, therefore, deferred  for
long intervals.  In fact, as pointed out by Mrs. Singh, sometimes it is  not
possible to hold even one meeting in a month.  In  such  cases,  unless  the
power to grant interim orders were read into the provisions  of  <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_66">Section  31</a>
of the Act, there would be a complete stalemate in  regard  to  cases  where
matters were pending before the Board and the public would  be  deprived  of
the pleasure of listening to such music and sound broadcasting.
</p>
<p id="p_36">34.   Mr. Harish Salve,  learned  Senior  Advocate,  in  his  turn  provided
another twist to the question under consideration in  urging  that  inherent
powers exist in an appellate forum. Mr. Salve urged  that  this  was  not  a
case where the Copyright Board  was  not  entitled  to  pass  orders  of  an
interim nature, but  whether  it  should  exercise  such  power.  Mr.  Salve
further urged that the power  under  <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_67">Section  31(1)(b)</a>  was  in  respect  of
matters which were already in the public domain and  the  transaction  being
purely of a commercial nature, the Board was only called upon to decide  how
much charges were required to be  paid  for  broadcasting  music  and  sound
recordings in respect whereof Super Cassettes had the copyright.  Mr.  Salve
urged that <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_68">Section 31(1)(b)</a> merely enumerated the  right  of  the  Copyright
Board to decide and compute the amount of fees payable for the  use  of  the
copyright, which was being withheld  from  the  public.   According  to  Mr.
Salve, the essence of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_69">Copyright Act</a>  is  the  delicate  balance  between
intellectual property rights and the  rights  of  access  to  the  copyright
material.  In such a situation, according to Mr. Salve, a private  right  of
copyright would have to give way to the public interest as  contemplated  in
<a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_70">Section 31</a> of the Copyright Act.
</p>
<p id="p_37">35.   Replying to the submissions made on behalf of the Respondents and  the
interveners, Mr. Sibal urged that  the  powers  which  were  inherent  in  a
Tribunal as against the implied powers, stood on a  different  footing  and,
in any event, the provisions of <a href="/doc/34094353/" id="a_71">Sections 19(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/1725108/" id="a_72">19-A</a>  were  not  relevant
to the doctrine of implied power in the facts of this case.
</p>
<p id="p_38">36.   Mr. Sibal submitted that the concept of public  interest  was  nothing
but a bogey introduced  on  behalf  of  the  Respondents,  when  the  entire
transaction  only  involved  the  computation  of  the  fees  payable  to  a
copyright owner for use of the copyright when the  same  was  withheld  from
the public. Referring to the decision between  ENIL  and  the  Appellant  in
Entertainment Network (India) Limited Vs. Super Cassette Industries  Limited
[(2008) 13 SCC 30], Mr. Sibal referred to paragraph 116  thereof,  which  is
extracted hereinbelow :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      “116. <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_73">Section 31(1)(b)</a> in fact  does  not  create  an  entitlement  in
      favour of an individual broadcaster. The  right  is  to  approach  the
      Board when it considers that the terms of offer for grant  of  licence
      are unreasonable. It, no doubt,  provides  for  a  mechanism  but  the
      mechanism is for the purpose of determination of  his  right.  When  a
      claim is made in terms of the provisions of a statute, the same has to
      be determined. All cases may not involve narrow  commercial  interest.</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">      For the purpose of interpretation of a statute, the  court  must  take
      into consideration all situations including the interest of the person
      who intends to have a licence for replay of  the  sound  recording  in
      respect whereof another person has a copyright. It, however, would not
      mean that all and sundry can file applications. The  mechanism  to  be
      adopted by the Board for determining the right of  a  complainant  has
      been provided under the Act.”

    Mr. Sibal urged that the decision of the High Court  was  liable  to  be
set aside and that of the Copyright Board was liable to be restored.
</p>
<p id="p_40">37.   What emerges from the submissions made on  behalf  of  the  respective
parties is the dispute  as  to  the  width  of  the  powers  vested  in  the
Copyright Board under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_74">Section 31</a> of the Copyright Act.  There is no  dispute
that the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_75">Copyright  Act</a>  is  a  Code  by  itself  and  matters  relating  to
copyrights and grant of licences in respect of  such  copyrights  have  been
left to the Copyright Board for decision.  Chapter II of the Copyright  Act,
1957,  deals  with  the  establishment  of  a  Copyright  Office   and   the
constitution of a Copyright  Board  and  the  powers  and  procedure  to  be
exercised and formulated for the functioning of the said Board.  <a href="/doc/98765/" id="a_76">Section  11</a>
of  the  Act,  which  comes  within  the  said  Chapter,  provides  for  the
constitution of a Copyright Board, which would hold office for  such  period
and  on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  may  be  prescribed.  <a href="/doc/1657731/" id="a_77">Section  12</a>
enumerates  the  powers  and  procedure  of  the  Board  and  is   extracted
hereinbelow :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      “12.Powers and procedure of Copyright  Board.  –  (1)   The  Copyright
      Board shall, subject to any rules that may be  made  under  this  Act,

      places and times of its sittings:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      Provided that the Copyright Board shall ordinarily hear any proceeding
      instituted before it under this Act within the zone in which,  at  the
      time of the institution of the proceeding, the person instituting  the
      proceeding actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business  or
      personally works for gain.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      Explanation.-In this sub-section "zone"  means  a  zone  specified  in

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      (2) The Copyright Board may exercise  and  discharge  its  powers  and

      (3) If there is a difference of  opinion  among  the  members  of  the
      Copyright Board or any Bench thereof in respect of any  matter  coming

      of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860)”.</blockquote>


<p id="p_41">      As would be  noticed,  the  Copyright  Board  has  been  empowered  to
regulate its own procedure and is to be deemed to be a Civil Court  for  the
purposes of <a href="/doc/1641897/" id="a_84">Sections 345</a> and <a href="/doc/1291430/" id="a_85">346</a> of the Code of  Criminal  Procedure,  1973,
and all proceedings  before  the  Board  shall  be  deemed  to  be  judicial
proceedings within the meaning of <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_86">Sections 193</a> and <a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_87">228</a> of the  Indian  Penal
Code.  The provisions clearly indicate that the Copyright  Board  discharges
quasi-judicial functions, which as indicated in <a href="/doc/1725108/" id="a_88">Sections 19-A</a>, <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_89">31</a>, <a href="/doc/1288659/" id="a_90">31-A</a>,  <a href="/doc/701290/" id="a_91">32</a>
and <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_92">52</a>, requires the Board to decide disputes in respect of matters  arising
therefrom.  In fact, <a href="/doc/134296/" id="a_93">Section 6</a> also spells out certain  disputes  which  the
Copyright Board has to decide, and its decision in respect thereof has  been
made final.  However, for the purposes of these  appeals  we  are  concerned
mainly with <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_94">Section 31</a>, which has been extracted hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_42">38.   Elaborate submissions have  been  made  regarding  the  power  of  the
Copyright Board to grant interim compulsory licences in works withheld  from
the public, in relation to matters which were  pending  before  it.   Having
considered the said submissions, we are unable  to  accept  the  submissions
made by Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mr. Bhaskar P. Gupta,  Mr.  Harish  Salve
and the other learned counsel appearing for the different  interveners.  The
Copyright Board has been empowered in cases where the owner of  a  copyright
in a work has withheld the same from the public, after giving the  owner  of
the copyright in the work a reasonable opportunity of being heard and  after
holding such inquiry as it may consider necessary  and  on  being  satisfied
that the grounds for withholding the work are not reasonable, to direct  the
Registrar of Copyrights to grant to the complainant a licence  to  republish
the work, perform the work in public or communicate the work to  the  public
by broadcast, as the case may be, subject to payment to  the  owner  of  the
copyright  of  such  compensation  and  subject  to  such  other  terms  and
conditions as the Board may determine.  The language  used  in  the  Section
clearly contemplates a final order after a  hearing  and  after  holding  an
inquiry to see whether the ground for  withholding  of  the  work  from  the
public was justified or not.  There is no hint  of  any  power  having  been
given to the Board to make interim arrangements, such as, grant  of  interim
compulsory  licences,  during  the  pendency  of  a  final  decision  of  an
application.
</p>
<p id="p_43">39.   As has been held by this Court in innumerable cases, a Tribunal  is  a
creature of Statute and can exercise only such powers as are  vested  in  it
by the Statute.  There is a second school of thought  which  propagates  the
view that since most Tribunals have the trappings of a Court,  it  would  be
deemed to  have  certain  ancillary  powers,  though  not  provided  by  the
Statute, to maintain the status-quo as prevailing at the time of  filing  of
an application, so that the relief  sought  for  by  the  Applicant  is  not
ultimately rendered otiose.  While construing the provisions of  <a href="/doc/550350/" id="a_95">Section  14</a>
of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, in the Morgan  Stanley  Mutual  Fund’s
case (supra), this Court categorically held  that  in  the  absence  of  any
specific vesting of power, no interim relief could be granted, not  even  of
an ad-interim nature.  The decision in the recent judgment of this Court  in
Rajeev Hitendra Pathak’s case (supra) also supports the  case  made  out  by
Mr. Sibal to the extent that in the absence of any express  power  conferred
on  the  District  Forum  and  the  State  Commission  under  the   <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_96">Consumer
Protection Act</a>, they had no jurisdiction to exercise powers  which  had  not
been expressly given to them.
</p>
<p id="p_44">40.    Even  the  decision  rendered  in  Bindeshwari  Prasad  Singh’s  case
(supra), which was a decision as to the  jurisdiction  of  a  Magistrate  to
review or recall his order, it was held that in the absence of any  specific
power in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_97"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, the Magistrate was not entitled  to
exercise such a power.
</p>
<p id="p_45">41.   On the other hand, the  various  decisions  cited  on  behalf  of  the
Respondent and the interveners were in the context of  the  question  as  to
whether a Tribunal has incidental powers, which  were  inherent  though  not
specifically vested,  in  order  to  preserve  the  status-quo  as  in  M.K.
Mohammed Kunhi’s case (supra), Allahabad Bank, Calcutta’s  case  (supra)  or
even in Grapco Industries Ltd.’s case (supra), till a decision  was  reached
in the pending matter.
</p>
<p id="p_46">42.   In the instant case, the power being sought to be  attributed  to  the
Copyright Board involves the grant of the final relief, which  is  the  only
relief contemplated under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_98">Section 31</a> of the Copyright Act.  Even in  matters
under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2  and  Section  151  of  the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure, an interim relief granting  the  final  relief  should  be  given
after exercise of great caution and in rare and exceptional cases.   In  the
instant case, such a power is not even vested in  the  Copyright  Board  and
hence the question of  granting  interim  relief  by  grant  of  an  interim
compulsory licence cannot, in our view, arise. Mr. Salve’s  submission  that
the substratum of the scheme of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_99">Section 31</a> is commercial in nature and  only
involves computation of the  charges  to  be  paid  to  the  holder  of  the
copyright who withholds the same from  the  public,  is  no  answer  to  the
proposition that under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_100">Section 31</a> only an ultimate relief by  way  of  grant
of a licence on payment of reasonable charges  to  the  copyright  owner  to
publish and/or broadcast the work could  be  given.   To  grant  an  interim
compulsory licence during the  stay  of  the  proceedings  would  amount  to
granting the final relief at the interim stage, although the power to  grant
such relief has not been vested in the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_47">43.   It  is  no  doubt  true,  that  Tribunals  discharging  quasi-judicial
functions and having the trappings of a Court, are generally  considered  to
be  vested  with  incidental  and  ancillary  powers  to   discharge   their
functions, but that cannot surely mean that in the absence of any  provision
to the contrary, such Tribunal would have the power to grant at the  interim
stage the final relief which it could grant.
</p>
<p id="p_48">44.   As also indicated hereinbefore, such incidental powers could  at  best
be said to exist in order to preserve the status-quo, but not to  alter  the
same, as will no doubt happen, if an interim compulsory licence is  granted.
If the legislature had intended that the Copyright Board should have  powers
to grant mandatory injunction at the interim stage,  it  would  have  vested
the Board with such authority.  The submission made that there is no bar  to
grant such interim relief in  <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_101">Section  31</a>  has  to  be  rejected  since  the
presence of a power cannot be inferred  from  the  absence  thereof  in  the
Statute itself.
</p>
<p id="p_49">45.   In the aforesaid circumstances, we have no hesitation in allowing  the
appeals and setting aside the impugned judgment and order  of  the  Division
Bench of the High Court.  The  Appeals  are,  accordingly,  allowed.   There
will be no order as to costs.

Chelameswar, J.
</p>

<p id="p_53">            Though, I agree  with  the  conclusion  reached  by  my  learned
brother Justice Kabir, I wish to add a few lines.
</p><p id="p_54">2.          To my mind, the issue is not whether the Copyright  Board  is  a
Court or a Tribunal while exercising the jurisdiction under  <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_102">Section  31</a>  of
the Copyright Act or any  other  Section,  which  authorises  the  Copyright
Board to perform certain adjudicatory functions.  It is also not  the  issue
whether Courts or Tribunals have  such  powers,  which  are  categorised  as
powers ancillary to their jurisdiction irrespective of  the  fact  that  the
Statute,  which  created  the  jurisdiction,  does  not,  always,  expressly
provide for the exercise of such ancillary powers.  This Court has  held  on
more than one occasion that such  powers  could  be  implied  -  <a href="/doc/736105/" id="a_103">Income  Tax
Officer vs. M.K. Mohammed  Kunhi</a>,  1969  (2)  SCR  65  and  <a href="/doc/1833094/" id="a_104">Allahabad  Bank,
Calcutta vs. Radha Krishna Maity and others</a>, (1999) 6 SCC 755.   As  noticed
by my learned brother at para 39 of the Judgment, there have been  decisions
of this Court, which appear conflicting on the question whether a  Statutory
Tribunal has powers other than those expressly conferred by the Statute.
</p><p id="p_55"> 3.         In the ultimate analysis, both the Courts and the Tribunals  are
adjudicatory bodies to  whom  the  Legislature  entrusts  the  authority  to
resolve the disputes falling within the jurisdiction conferred upon each  of
such bodies  and  brought  before  them.   The  jurisdiction  is,  normally,
defined with reference either to; (1) the subject matter of the dispute  and
/ or the pecuniary value of the dispute; or (2)  the  territorial  nexus  of
either the parties to the dispute or the subject matter of  the  dispute  to
the Court or Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_56">4.          In the  context  of  Courts  adjudicating  civil  disputes,  the
jurisdiction and powers necessary to effectively exercise the  jurisdiction,
such as, securing the presence of defendants  /  respondents  or  witnesses,
granting of interim orders etc., and the method and  manner  of  enforcement
of a decision or a decree, are matters elaborately  dealt  by<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_105">  the  Code</a>  of
Civil  Procedure.   Similarly,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_106">  the  Code</a>  of  Criminal  Procedure  contains
provisions necessary for the exercise of the jurisdiction  of  the  Criminal
Courts.  While<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_107"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, under  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_108">Section  151</a>,  recognises
the existence of inherent powers in all Civil Courts,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_109"> the Code</a>  of  Criminal
Procedure recognises all such inherent powers only in the High  Court  under
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_110">Section 482</a>.
</p><p id="p_57">5.          Therefore, the  jurisdiction  and  authority  of  not  only  the
Tribunals, but also the Courts are structured by the  statutory  grants  and
limitations.
</p><p id="p_58">6.          However, both the grant as well  as  the  limitations  could  be
either express or implied from the scheme of a  particular  enactment.   The
considerations relevant for ascertaining whether there is an  implied  grant
of such powers, as can be culled out from the various Judgments relied  upon
by the learned counsel appearing in these matters,  which  have  been  taken
note of by my learned brother Justice Kabir,  appear  to  be;  (1)  need  to
preserve status quo with respect to the subject matter  of  the  dispute  in
order to enable the party, which eventually succeeds in the  litigation,  to
enjoy the fruits of the success;  and  (2)  need  to  preserve  the  parties
themselves a  consideration,  which  weighed  heavily  with  this  Court  in
implying such powers in favour  of  the  Magistrates  while  exercising  the
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_111">Section 125</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
</p><p id="p_59">7.          The often stated principle  that  Courts  would  not,  normally,
grant a relief by way of an interim measure, which is either identical  with
or substantially the same as the final relief sought in the  proceeding,  is
based on the ground that indiscriminate grant of such  interim  reliefs  are
capable of producing public mischief  see  <a href="/doc/96932/" id="a_112">Assistant  Collector  of  Central
Excise, Chandan Nagar, West Bengal  v.  Dunlop  India  Limited  and  others</a>,
(1985) 1 SCC 260.  This Court opined that the injury, if any, to  the  party
approaching the Court is reversible  and  the  public  interest  in  certain
instances should outweigh the temporary inconvenience of individuals.
</p><p id="p_60">8.           Take  another  example,  if  a  returned   candidate   to   the
constitutionally  created  Legislative  Bodies  could  be  restrained   from
functioning as a legislator by an interim order pending the adjudication  of
the legality of such candidate’s election,  the  same  would  produce  great
public mischief.
</p><p id="p_61">9.          Therefore, different considerations  come  into  play  depending
upon the context or nature of the legal rights at issue  or  subject  matter
of the dispute, etc., in deciding the question whether an adjudicatory  body
can be said to have been invested with the power to  grant  interim  orders,
which are identical or substantially similar to the final  relief  that  can
be afforded in the lis by implication from the scheme and  language  of  the
enactment, which created the jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_62">10.          For  deciding  the  question  whether  the   Copyright   Board,
exercising the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_113">Section  31</a>  of  the  Copyright  Act,  can
grant  ad  hoc  compulsory  licence  by  an  interim   order   pending   the
adjudication of the issue, is required to be examined.
</p><p id="p_63">11.         Copyright in a “work”, undoubtedly, is a  valuable  legal  right
subsisting in the “owner” or somebody claiming through the  owner.   Such  a
right has  more  than  one  dimension.   It  may  have  a  commercial  value
depending upon the quality, nature and the public demand of  the  work.   It
may also have aesthetic value.  Whether such a right should  be  transferred
or not is a matter,  essentially,  for  the  “owner”  of  the  copyright  to
determine.  It is, further, the right of the owner to decide on  what  terms
and conditions (which need not necessarily be related to  money  alone),  he
would part with the copyright of his work if ever he decides  to  part  with
it.  However, <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_114">Section 31</a> of the Copyright Act creates an  exception  to  the
abovementioned principle of the right of the owner  of  the  copyright.   In
substance - the Section deprives the “copyright” of the “owner” against  his
volition.  In other words, by <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_115">Section 31</a>, the State is  authorised,  by  its
coercive powers, to deprive the owner of his copyright in a work,  which  is
his property and the right to enjoy such  property  in  the  manner  as  the
owner of the property pleases.  Necessarily, in view of  the  constitutional
mandate under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_116">Article 300A</a>, such a deprivation can only be by the  authority
of law and it is too well entrenched a principle on the  constitutional  law
that such a law could be only for a public purpose.
</p><p id="p_64">12.         The core of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_117">Section 31</a> is that the owner  of  a  copyright  has;
(1) either refused to “republish” or “allow the republication” of  his  work
or “refused to allow the performance in public” of the work; (2)  by  reason
of such refusal the work is withheld from the public; and  (3)  the  grounds
for  such  refusal  are  not  reasonable.   It  is  in  the   abovementioned
circumstances, if the Copyright Board  is  satisfied  that  the  grounds  of
refusal are not reasonable, the Copyright Board is authorised,  by  law,  to
take steps for the grant of a compulsory licence.
</p><p id="p_65">13.         As can be seen, the appellants are interested in the  commercial
exploitation of a work, of which they are not  “owners”  of  the  copyright.
To succeed in their claim for a compulsory licence  in  their  favour,  they
must, firstly, establish that  “the  work  is  withheld  from  the  public”,
because of the “owner’s” refusal to republish the work, etc.; secondly,  the
owner’s refusal is on grounds, which are “not reasonable” in  law.   Whether
the  owner  is  withholding  the  republication  on   grounds,   which   are
unreasonable or  not,  is  a  question,  which  can  only  be  decided  upon
affording a complete hearing to the owner of the work,  as  I  have  already
indicated the reason for withholding need not only be  monetary.   Take  for
example the case of a book or a cinematograph film, such as, Satanic  Verses
or Da Vinci Code,  which  have  created  quite  some  commotion  in  certain
quarters including the security threat to the author or owner of  the  work.
If the author, on realising that repeated  publication  of  the  work  might
endanger his security, declines or refuses republication  of  the  work,  it
cannot be said that the author (owner) unreasonably withheld  republication.
 Such a  refusal  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  monetary  considerations.
Therefore, by conceding a power to grant ad hoc  compulsory  licence  during
the pendency of the proceeding, under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_118">Section 31</a>, would not only render  the
final inquiry into the question, a futile  exercise  in  a  case  where  the
owner has reasons other  than  inadequacy  of  monetory  compensation.   The
power under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_119">Section 31</a> to grant a compulsory licence meant for avoiding  the
withholding of the republication or  refuse  to  allow  the  performance  in
pubic of some “work” - is, essentially,  for  the  benefit  of  the  public.
Commercial  benefit  to  “publisher”   is   incidental.    Unless,   it   is
demonstrated  that  failure  to  imply  such  power  to   direct   immediate
republication or performance of a work in public  would  be  detrimental  to
public interest, the power to grant ad hoc  compulsory  licence,  cannot  be
implied.  No such detriment is demonstrated.  In the absence of  an  express
statutory grant, I would not imply the power to grant an ad  hoc  compulsory
licence by way of interim order by the Copyright Board.
