     proprietor of Aamna Sales (Scooter House) having its office at Near
     Police Station, Opp. Girls School, Manendragarh - 497442, District:
     Manendragarh, Chhattisgarh, as recorded in the Local Commissioner's

<p id="p_15">13. It is also deposed that in October 2010, the plaintiff, through its
     representative/investigator appointed to ascertain infringing parties

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) 2587/2010                                                Page 5 of 13</span>
      involved in selling counterfeit products in Manendragarh, learnt that the
     defendants are engaged in selling motorcycle parts bearing the plaintiff's
     registered trademark and logo which do not originate from the plaintiff.
     The investigator filed an affidavit dated December 14, 2010 with which
     photographs of the defendant's products and defendant's premises were
     attached. The Affidavit dated 14.12.2010 is exhibited as Ex. PW-1/14.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14. PW-1 has deposed that the products viz. one pack of Disk Clutch Friction,
     one Element Air Cleaner and one Valve Kit purchased by the investigator
     from the premises of the defendant prominently bears the plaintiff's
     registered trademark HERO HONDA as well as the logo; and the quality
     and packaging of the defendant's products as well as the prices at which
     the defendants' products are available clearly demonstrates that the said
     products are not manufactured by the plaintiff; and the poor finish of the
     logo on the defendants' products packaging also indicates that the said
     products do not originate from the plaintiff. She has deposed that the
     plaintiff's spare parts department carried out a thorough check on the
     parts purchased from the defendant and came to the conclusion that
     following points indicate that the products purchased are counterfeits and
     non-genuine:
</p>
<p id="p_17">        a)       The price label is white in colour unlike that of the original
                 products which is green in colour.
</p><p id="p_18">        b)       The MRP of the counterfeit products is different from that of
                 the original products:
</p><p id="p_19">                   Disk Clutch Friction: Counterfeit- Rs. 75 per unit vs.
                    Original- Rs. 82 per unit
                   Element Air Cleaner: Counterfeit- Rs. 75 per unit vs.
                    Original - Rs. 61 per unit

</p><p id="p_20">          c)      The word "GENUINE" printed on the price label of the
                 counterfeit products is in simple ink unlike the thermochromic
                 ink used in the original products.
</p><p id="p_21">         d)      The crown-like structure and the semicircle in the Hero Honda
                 logo printed on the borders of the packaging of these
                 counterfeit products, are overlapping one another.
</p><p id="p_22">         e)      The holographic strip on the price label of these counterfeit
                 products is a poor imitation of the Plaintiff's original
                 holographic strip as it lacks the kinetic effect, 3D logo effect
                 and HH expanding and shrinking effect as in the original
                 products.
</p><p id="p_23">         f)      The description of the Element Air Cleaner on these
                 counterfeit products is as "Element A &amp; B Air Cleaner"
                 instead of Element A Air Cleaner as in the original item.
</p><p id="p_24">         g)      The part No. on the counterfeit Disk Clutch Friction is
                 22201GF6000LS whereas on the original item it is
                 22201GF6000S.

<p id="p_26">15.   Ms.Dogra has deposed that the unauthorized reproduction of the
      plaintiff's registered trademark HERO HONDA amounts to infringement
      of the Registered Trademark Nos. 419115 and 513474 of the plaintiff; and
      the unauthorized reproduction of the plaintiff's HERO HONDA logo and
      packaging amounts to infringement of the copyright vested with the
      plaintiff. She has also deposed that use of the plaintiff's registered trade
      mark HERO HONDA amounts to a false statement as to the source


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) 2587/2010                                                Page 7 of 13</span>
       identifier; and the use of the plaintiff's registered trademark and the logo
      by the defendants would cause confusion and deception in the minds of
      the general public at large about a connection or affiliation with the
      plaintiff since the trademark connotes and denotes the plaintiff's products
      alone; and the defendants are clearly passing off their goods as those
      originating from the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_27">16.   PW-1 has further deposed that the plaintiff has been extremely diligent
      and proactive in protecting its intellectual property rights and has
      successfully taken legal actions against various third parties violating the
      plaintiff's exclusive rights in the HERO HONDA trade mark and logo.
      Copies of the orders passed by this Court in various matters relating to
      third party infringers are collectively exhibited as Ex. PW-1/16 (Colly).
</p>
<p id="p_28">17.   This witness has also deposed that the defendants' conduct is clearly
      dishonest and malafide and guided by the desire to make unjust gains and
      is also perpetuating a fraud on the consumers; and the malafides of the
      defendants are plainly evident from the fact that the defendants have
      slavishly copied the minutest of details of the plaintiff's products to
      deceive the customers. The counterfeit goods recovered from the
      defendants' premises during the execution of the local commission were
      three (3) packets (each containing two pieces) of counterfeit Swing Arm
      Bush.    It is also deposed that the counterfeit goods found at the
      defendants' premises during the execution of the local commission were
      six (6) pieces of counterfeit clutch plates and twenty (20) pieces of
      counterfeit Bearings bearing the plaintiff's registered trade mark HERO
      HONDA and logo; and the defendants and his associates wrongfully
      removed and concealed the counterfeit products from the custody of the
      Local Commissioner during the course of the commission proceedings as

       recorded in the Local Commissioner's report.           This witness has also
      deposed that to this effect plaintiff has filed a contempt petition CCP No.
      124 of 2011 and the same is pending before this Hon'ble Court. PW-1
      has further deposed that the Investigator had purchased counterfeit
      products viz. one pack of Disk Clutch Friction, one Element Air Cleaner
      and one Valve Kit from the defendant, thus the defendant is clearly
      indulging in manufacture and sale of a variety of counterfeit products; and
      since the defendant did not disclose their books of accounts during the
      Local Commission, it is not possible to obtain an accurate estimate of the
      volume of sales they have affected and over what period of time and at
      what profits. It is also deposed that the plaintiff estimates that by reason
      of the illegal trade activities of the defendants, the loss suffered in its
      business shall be to the tune of over Rs. 20,05,000/- whereas the damage
      to its goodwill and reputation cannot be assessed in monetary terms.

<p id="p_29">18.   I have heard counsel for the plaintiff and perused the plaint and the
      accompanying documents and the evidence led by the plaintiff.                The
      evidence of the plaintiff remained unrebutted. In this case at the stage of
      filing of the suit, interim orders were granted and Local Commissioner
      was also appointed to seize the goods in question. The goods were taken
      possession of and then released on superdari to the defendant. The
      plaintiff has established that the plaintiff is the proprietor of the registered
      trade mark HERO HONDA and logo. The plaintiff also hold the copyright
      in the logo and the packing material. The aforesaid facts and
      circumstances show that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to use the
      trademark HERO HONDA and the logo as also the packaging material in
      question. The defendant is attempting to counterfeit the products of the
      plaintiff and pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff. This not only
      causes loss of profits to the plaintiff, but results in inferior products made

      defendant.

<p id="p_30">19.   In view of the above, the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of permanent
      injunction against the defendant from dealing with the goods having
      infringing mark in terms of prayers (a) to (c) of paragraph 20 of the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_31">20.   The last aspect to be considered is the issue of damages for loss of
      reputation and business as also the cost of the present proceedings. It is
      trite to say that the defendant has deliberately stayed away from the
      present proceedings with the result that an enquiry into the accounts of
      the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place. However,
      the infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff as also its logo is not in
      dispute. The plaintiff has claimed damages to the tune of Rs.20,05,000/-
      for loss of sale and reputation payable to the plaintiff.   The attention of
      this Court has been drawn to a number of judgments in this behalf where
      dealing with similar situations, damages have been awarded.

      damages of Rs.5 lakhs, punitive damages have also been awarded. It
     would be useful to reproduce paras 7 and 8 of the said judgment, which
     are as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "7. Coming to the claim of Rs.5 lacs as punitive and
                   exemplary damages for the flagrant infringement of the
                   plaintiff's trade mark, this Court is of the considered view
                   that a distinction has to be drawn between compensatory
                   damages and punitive damages. The award of compensatory
                   damages to a plaintiff is aimed at compensating him for the
                   loss suffered by him whereas punitive damages are aimed at
                   deterring a wrong doer and the like minded from indulging in
                   such unlawful activities. Whenever an action has criminal
                   propensity also the punitive damages are clearly called for so
                   that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of
                   others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive
                   damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice
                   and as such, in appropriate cases these must be awarded to
                   give a signal to the wrong doers that law does not take a
                   breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels
                   concerned about those also who are not party to the lis but
                   suffer on account of the breach. In the case in hand itself, it is
                   not only the plaintiff, who has suffered on account of the
                   infringement of its trade mark and Magazine design but a
                   large number of readers of the defendants' Magazine 'TIME
                   ASIA SANSKARAN' also have suffered by purchasing the
                   defendants' Magazines under an impression that the same are
                   from the reputed publishing house of the plaintiff company.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   8. This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has
                   come when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of
                   trade marks, copy rights, patents, etc. should not only grant
                   compensatory damages but award punitive damages also
                   with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers who
                   indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so
                   that they realize that in case they are caught, they would be
                   liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would be
                   liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell
                   financial disaster for them. In Mathias v. Accor Economi
                   Lodging, Inc., 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003) the factors

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) 2587/2010                                                   Page 11 of 13</span>
                    underlying the grant of punitive damages were discussed and
                   it was observed that one function of punitive damages is to
                   relieve the pressure on an overloaded system of criminal
                   justice by providing a civil alternative to criminal
                   prosecution of minor crimes. It was further observed that the
                   award of punitive damages serves the additional purpose of
                   limiting the defendant's ability to profit from its fraud by
                   escaping detection and prosecution. If a tortfeasor is caught
                   only half the time he commits torts, then when he is caught
                     he should be punished twice as heavily in order to make up
                   for the reason that it is very difficult for a plaintiff to give
                   proof of actual damages suffered by him as the defendants
                   who indulge in such activities never maintain proper
                   accounts of their transactions who they know that the same
                   are objectionable and unlawful. In the present case, the claim
                   of punitive damages is of Rs.5 lacs only which can be safely
                   awarded. Had it been higher even this court would not have
                   hesitated in awarding the same. The Court is of the view that
                   the punitive damages should be really punitive and not flee
                   bite and quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy
                   of infringement."

<p id="p_34">23.   Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that damages have been claimed in
      the present suit and the plaintiff is entitled to the damages to the tune of
      Rs.20,05,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_35">24.   I am in agreement with the aforesaid submission of learned counsel for
      the plaintiff that damages in such cases must be awarded and a defendant,
      who chooses to stay away from the proceedings of the Court, should not
      be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of court proceedings. Any
      view to the contrary would result in a situation where the defendant who
      appears in Court and submits its account books would be liable for
      damages, while a party which chooses to stay away from court
      proceedings would escape the liability on account failure of the
      availability of account books. A party who chooses to not participate in

       court proceedings and stays away must, thus, suffer the consequences of
      damages as stated and set out by the plaintiff. There is a larger public
      purpose involved to discourage such parties from indulging in such acts of
      deception and, thus, even if the same has a punitive element, it must be
      granted. R.C. Chopra, J. has very succinctly set out in Time Incorporated's
      case (supra) that punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of
      corrective justice. That was the case where the publishers of Time
      Magazine had come to Court and one of the factors which weighed while
      awarding punitive damages was that the readers had been sufferers of the
      infringement of the mark of the plaintiff. The only difference is that in the
      present case it is the consumer of the products of the plaintiff, who have
      suffered as a consequence of the infringement of the mark and logo of the
      plaintiff by the defendant.

<p id="p_36">25.   For the reasons stated above, the plaintiff has made out a case for grant of
      decree as prayed in the plaint. Accordingly, the order dated 21.12.2010 is
      confirmed and the suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiff and against the
      defendant with costs. Plaintiff is also entitled to the damages to the tune
      of Rs.5.0 lacs.
