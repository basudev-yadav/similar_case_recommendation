<p id="p_4">        These writ petitions have been filed challenging the 
constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_1">Sections 116</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2">117</a> of the Finance Act 
2000 and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_3">Section 158</a> of the Finance Act, 2003 by which the  
decision of this Court in Laghu Udyog Bharati &amp; Anr. Vs. 
Union of India &amp; Ors. (1999) 6 SCC 418,  striking down Rules 
2(1)(d), (xii) and (xvii) of the Service Tax Rules, 1994 (as 
amended in 1997) was sought to be overcome. 
	The writ petitioners are the customers or clients of goods 
transport operators and forwarding and clearing agents. There 
are three main grounds on which they have based their 
challenge.  They contend that the basis of the decision rendered 
in Laghu Udyog Bharati  had not been removed or displaced by 
the impugned sections and could not therefore overrule, replace 
or override this Court's decision.  The second ground of 
challenge is that Parliament was legislatively incompetent to 
enact the law.  It is  stated that the imposition of the impugned 
levy encroaches upon the State Government's power as defined 
in Entry 56 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution 
which pertains to 'Taxes on goods and passengers covered by 
road or on inland waterways'. The submission is that Parliament 
could not by resorting to the residuary Entry 97 of List 1 of the 
Seventh Schedule circumvent Entry 56 of List II and in the guise 
of levying service tax in fact levy a tax on the transport of goods.    
The constitutional validity of the imposition has also been 
challenged on the ground that it operated in discriminatory 
manner  by singling out only the customers of goods transport  
operators and clearing and forwarding agents to pay tax whereas 
the recipients  of other kinds of similar services were not  
subjected to such imposition. 
</p><p id="p_5">	  Service tax was introduced for the first time under Chapter 
V of the Finance Act, 1994.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_4">Section 66</a> of the Act was  the 
charging section and provided for the levy of service tax at the 
rate of five per cent of the value of the taxable services provided 
to any person by the person responsible for collecting the service 
tax.  In other words, the levy was on  the provider of the taxable 
services.  "Taxable service" was defined in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_5">Section 65</a> to include 
only three services namely any service provided to an investor by 
a stock broker, to a subscriber by the telegraph authority and to a 
policy holder by an insurer carrying on general insurance 
business. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_6">Section 68</a> required every person providing taxable 
service to collect the service tax at specified rates.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_7">Section 69</a> of 
the Finance Act, 1994 provided for the registration of the   
persons responsible for collecting service tax.  Sub-sections (2) 
and (5) indicated that it was the provider of the service who was 
responsible for collecting the tax and obliged to get registered.  
These Sections viz., 65, 66, 68 and 69 are pivotal to the present 
issue. They were amended thrice. The remaining sections of the 
1994 Act substantially continued as originally enacted with minor 
changes. Under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_8">Section 70</a> of the Finance Act, 1994, every 
person responsible for collecting the service tax must furnish or 
cause to be furnished to the Central Excise Officer in the 
prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner, a 
quarterly return. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_9">Sections 71</a>, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_10">72</a>, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_11">73</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_12">74</a> deal with the filing of 
returns, provisions for assessment, reopening of assessments 
and rectification of mistakes of assessment orders.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_13">Section 75</a> 
provides for payment of interest at the rate of one-half per cent 
for every month or part of a month by which the person 
responsible for collecting the service tax, delays in paying the tax 
to the credit of the Central Government.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_14">Section 76</a> deals with 
the imposition of penalty for failure to collect the service tax.  
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_15">Section 77</a> deals with the penalty for failure to furnish the 
prescribed return. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_16">Section 78</a> deals with the penalty for 
suppressing the value of taxable service and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_17">Section 79</a> for 
penalty for failure to comply with notices. No other section is 
required to be noted except  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_18">Section 94</a> of the Act which 
empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out 
the provisions of Chapter V of the Act.  Pursuant to such power, 
the Service Tax  Rules, 1994 were framed. 
</p><p id="p_6"> <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_19">By the Finance Act</a>, 1997 the first amendments to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_20">Section 
65</a>, of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_21">Finance Act</a> 1994 were made inter alia, by extending 
the meaning of 'taxable service' from three services to 18 
different services categorized in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_22">Section 65(41)</a>, clauses (a) to  
</p><p id="p_7">(r).  We are only concerned with clauses (j) and (m) of sub-
section (41) to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_23">Section 65</a>.  Clause (j) made service to a client 
by clearing and forwarding agents in relation to clearing and 
forwarding operations, a taxable service.  Similarly, service to a 
customer of a goods transport operator in relation to carriage of 
goods by road in a goods carriage was, by clause (m), also 
included within the umbrella of taxable service. The phrases 
"clearing and forwarding agent" and "goods transport operator"  
were defined as follows:  
</p>
<p id="p_8">(j) "clearing and forwarding agent" means any 
person who is engaged in providing any 
service, either directly or indirectly, 
connected with clearing and forwarding 
operations in any manner to any other 
person and includes a consignment agent"
</p>

<p id="p_9">(m) "goods transport operator" means   any 
commercial concern engaged in the 
transportation of goods but does not include 
a courier agency"
</p>

<p id="p_10">           The charge of service tax in respect of the services 
rendered by clearing and forwarding agents and goods 
transport operates remained on the person responsible for 
collecting the service tax under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_24">Section 66</a> (3).
</p>
<p id="p_11">"66(3) With effect from the date notified 
under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_25">Section 84</a> of the Finance Act, 
1997, there shall be charged a service 
tax at the rate of five per cent of the 
value of the taxable services referred to 
in sub-clauses (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), 
</p><p id="p_12">(m), (n), (o), (p), (q),and (r ) of clause 
(41) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_26">Section 65</a> which are provided to 
any person by the person responsible 
for collecting the service tax." 
</p>

<p id="p_13">          The 'person responsible for collecting the service tax' 
under this Section was therefore the person providing the 
service. The phrase itself was also defined under sub-section 
(28) of    <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_27">Section 65</a> to mean "a person who is required to collect 
service tax under this chapter or is required to pay any other sum 
of money under this Chapter and includes every person in 
respect of whom any proceedings under this Chapter have been 
taken" and 'assessee' was defined in sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_28">Section 
65</a> as meaning "a person responsible for collecting the service 
tax and includes his agent".  By the 1997 amendment under 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_29">Section 68-1A</a> the service tax in respect of taxable services from 
items (g) to (r ) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_30">Section 65</a> (41) was directed to be collected 
from "such person and in such manner as may be prescribed" 
and it was said that all provisions of Chapter V "shall" apply to 
such person as if he is the person responsible for collecting the 
service tax in relation to such services.     However, Sub-sections 
(2) and (5) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_31">Section 69</a> continued to refer to the persons 
responsible for collecting the service as the provider of the 
taxable service.  
</p><p id="p_14">	We are told that the goods transport operators as well as 
the clearing and forwarding agents went on an all India strike 
protesting against the imposition of service tax on them. Perhaps 
this might have precipitated an amendment to the Service Tax 
Rules 1994.      Rules 2(1)(d),(xii) and (xvii) of the Service Tax 
Rules, 1994 were amended by imposing the tax in effect on the 
customers of clearing and forwarding agents and goods transport 
operators.  As far as clearing and forwarding agents were 
concerned the relevant amendments to the Rules were carried 
out and brought into effect by two notifications both dated 16th 
July 1997. As far as the levy of service tax on customers of 
goods and transport operators were concerned, the amendments 
were made and brought into effect with effect from 16th 
November, 1997.
</p><p id="p_15">	The imposition of service tax on customers was challenged 
by many of the present petitioners in Laghu Udyog Bharati. 
During the pendency of writ petitions, on 2nd June 1998 
notification No.49/98 was issued exempting services provided by 
goods transport operators from the levy of service tax altogether 
and by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_32">Finance Act</a>, 1998 all provisions in the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_33">Finance Act</a>, 
1994 including <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_34">Section 65</a> (41) sub-clause (m) relating to the levy 
of service tax on services provided by goods transport operators  
were omitted with effect from 16th October, 1998.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_35">By the Finance 
Act</a> (No. 2), 1998, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_36">Section 69</a> was also amended.   The various 
sub-sections including sub sections (2) and (5) were omitted. The 
body of the sections now require every person liable to pay 
service tax to make an application for registration without 
indicating who was so liable.   The Service Tax Rules, 1994 were 
consequently also amended by the Service Tax (Amendment) 
Rules, 1998 to delete the provisions relating to service by goods 
transport operators.  
</p><p id="p_16">These facts were taken into account by this Court in Laghu 
Udyog Bharati but because the exemption granted on 2nd June 
1998 was prospective and no exemption had been granted with  
regard to the period from 16th July, 1997 to 2nd June 1998 and 
also because customers of clearing and forwarding agents 
continued to be liable to pay service tax, the writ petitions were 
disposed of on merits.     
</p><p id="p_17">In upholding the challenge to Rule 2(1)(d), (xii) and (xvii), 
this Court noted: 
</p>
<p id="p_18">"It is clear from the reading of these provisions 
that according to the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_37">Finance Act</a>  the   charge 
of tax is on the person who is responsible for 
collecting the service tax.  It is he, who by 
virtue of the provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_38">Section 65(5)</a> is 
regarded as an assessee.  He is the person 
who provides the service." 
</p><p id="p_19">It was held that in the circumstances


     " the definitions contained in Rule 2(d) 
</p><p id="p_20">(xii) and (xvii), which seek to make the 
customers or the clients as the assessee, are 
clearly in conflict with <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_39">Section 65</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_40">66</a> of the 
Act."
</p>
<p id="p_21">This Court construed <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_41">Section 68</a>(1-A) to hold that     
"<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_42">Section 68</a>(1-A) cannot be so interpreted as to make a person 
an assessee even though he may not be responsible for 
collecting the service tax". What the Court in effect said was 
that since the charging section (<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_43">Section 66</a>) provided for the tax 
to be paid by the provider, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_44">Section 68-1A</a>, which was merely the 
section which laid the machinery for collecting the tax, would 
not change the nature of the tax. 
</p><p id="p_22">	Finally this Court said that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_45">Sections 70</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_46">71</a> clearly 
showed "that the return which has to be filed pertains to the 
payment which are received by the person rendering the 
service in respect of the value of the taxable services. Surely, 
this is a type of information which cannot, under any 
circumstances, be supplied by the customer.  Moreover the 
operative part of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_47">Section 70</a> clearly stipulates 
that it is a person responsible for collecting the service tax who 
is to furnish the return".
</p><p id="p_23">         In the circumstances it was concluded that  "by rules 
which are framed, the person who is receiving the services 
cannot be made responsible for filing the return and paying the 
tax.  Such a position is certainly not contemplated by the Act". 
</p><p id="p_24">         Striking down the Service Tax Rules 2(1)(d) (xii) and (xvii), 
this Court directed that any tax which had been paid by the 
customers or clients of the clearing and forwarding agents or of 
the goods transporters should be refunded within 12 weeks from 
their making a demand for refund.  Consequently, the present 
writ petitioners made applications for refund of the tax paid by 
them.  In some cases, the tax was refunded.  In certain cases the 
refund was not made on the ground that the petitioners had failed 
to prove that the tax paid had not been passed on to other 
persons.   In some case as in W.P. No. 563 of 2000 the customer 
deducted service tax from the freight charges payable to the 
transporters/petitioner.  After the decision in Laghu Bharati 
Udyog,  the customer refunded the money to the transporter in 
question. 	
</p><p id="p_25">       	  At this stage on 12th May 2000, the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_48">Finance Act</a> 2000 
sought to amend <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_49">Finance Act</a> of 1994 in the manner indicated

returns was amended to provide, with retrospective effect, for the 
insertion of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_71">Section 71A</a>.    Under the newly inserted section, the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_72">Sections 69</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_73">70</a> do not apply to a person 
referred to in the proviso to sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_74">Section 68</a> as far 
as the filing of returns in respect of service tax for the period 
commencing from 16th July 1997 was concerned.  It seeks to 
provide that "such persons shall furnish return to the Central 
Excise Officer within six months from the day on which the 
Finance Bill, 2003 receives the assent of the President in the 
prescribed manner on the basis of the self assessment of the 
service tax and the provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_75">Section 71</a> shall apply 
accordingly". This period was extended by this Court by order 
dated 17.11.2003 for a period of two weeks with effect from the 
date of the order.	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_76">Section 94</a> as originally enacted for the rule 
making power of the Central Government was amended to read 
with effect from 16th July 1997, that the Central Government 
would also have the power to frame rules relating to the manner 
of furnishing returns under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_77">Section 71A</a>. 
There cannot be any doubt that the object of these sections 
is to nullify the effect of this Court's decision in Laghu Udhyog 
Bharati  by retrospectively amending and validating provisions 
held to be illegal.  It is a well settled principle that validation of a 
tax declared illegal may be done only if the grounds of illegality or 
invalidity are capable of being removed and are in fact removed 
and the tax thus made legal (vide <a href="/doc/1018531/" id="a_78">Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. vs. 
Broach Borough Municipality</a> : 1970 1 SCR 388 Indian 
Aluminum Co. &amp; Ors Vs. State of Kerala (1996) 7 SCC 637, <a href="/doc/1337952/" id="a_79">K.

Mkg. <a href="/doc/810499/" id="a_81">Federation v. Union of India</a> AIR 2003 SC 1329).  As a 
proposition of law this cannot be and is not disputed. The 
question is whether by enacting <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_82">Sections 116</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_83">117</a> of the 
Finance Act, 2000 and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_84">Section 158</a> of the Finance Act 2003,  the 
bases on  which this Court struck down Rule 2(1)(d), (xii) and 
(xvii) of the Service Tax Rules, 1994 had been displaced or 
removed.
</p><p id="p_56">As we read the decision in Laghu Udhyog Bharati, the 
basis was the patent conflict between <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_85">Sections 65</a>, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_86">66</a> , <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_87">68(1)</a> 
and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_88">71</a> of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended in 1997 on the 
one hand and Rules 2(1) (d) (xii) and (xvii) of the Service Tax 
Rules 1994 on the other.  Each of these sections of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_89">Finance 
Act</a> 1994 as amended in 1997 proceeded on the basis that the 
tax was imposable on the person providing the service. All the 
other sections regarding the liability to furnish returns, 
assessments, penalties etc. flowed from that. It was because 
unamended <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_90">Section 66</a> spoke of the liability to pay tax in 
respect of services "which are provided to any person  by the 
person responsible for collecting the service tax"  and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_91">Section 
65(5)</a> defined "assessee" as meaning "a person responsible for 
collecting the service tax", that this Court held that clauses (xii) 
and (xvii) of Rule 2(1) (d) of the Service Tax Rules were illegal.
As is apparent from <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_92">Section 116</a> of the Finance Act, 2000, 
all the material portions of the two Sections which were found to 
be incompatible with the Service Tax Rules were themselves 
amended so that now in the body of the Act by virtue of the 
amendment  to the word "assessee" in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_93">Section 65(5)</a> and the 
amendment to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_94">Section 66(3)</a>, the liability to pay the tax is not on 
the person providing the taxable service but, as far as the 
service provided by clearing and forwarding agents and goods 
transport operators are concerned, on the person who pays for 
the services.  As far as <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_95">Section 68(1A)</a> is concerned by virtue of 
the proviso added in 2003, the persons availing of the services 
of goods transport operators or clearing and forwarding agents 
have explicitly been made liable to pay the service tax. 
As we have said, Rule 2(1)(d) (xii) and (xvii) had been 
held to be illegal in Laghu Udhyog Bharati  only because the 
charging provisions of the Act provided otherwise.  Now that the 
charging section itself has been amended so as to make the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules compatible, the criticism of 
the earlier law upheld by this Court can no longer be availed of. 
There is thus no question of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_96">Finance Act</a>, 2000 overruling 
the decision of this Court in Laghu Udhyog Bharati as the law 
itself has been changed.  A legislature is competent to remove 
infirmities retrospectively and make any imposition of tax 
declared invalid, valid.  This has been the uniform approach of 
this Court. Such exercise in validation must of course also be 
legislatively competent and legally sustainable.  Those issues  
are considered separately.  On the first question, we hold that 
the law must be taken as having always been as is now brought 
about by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_97">Finance Act</a>, 2000. The statutory foundation for 
the decision in Laghu Udhyog Bharati has been replaced and 
the decision has thereby ceased to be relevant for the purposes 
of construing the present provisions (vide <a href="/doc/1482259/" id="a_98">Ujagar Prints vs. 
Union of India</a>) . Therefore subject to our decision on the 
question of the legislative competence of Parliament to enact 
the law, and assuming the amendments in 2003 to be legal for 
the time being, we reject the submission of the writ petitioners 
that by the amendments brought about  by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_99">Sections 116</a> and 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_100">117</a> of the Finance Act 2000, the decision in Laghu Udhyog 
Bharati has been legislatively overruled.
 	The next question is whether the levy of service tax on 
carriage of goods by transport operators was legislatively 
competent. Laghu Udhyog Bharati did not consider the 
question of legislative competency.  Before we consider the 
scope of the impugned Act, it is necessary to determine the 
scope of the two Legislative Entries namely Entry 97 of List I and 
Entry 56 of List II. It has been recognized in Godfrey Phillips 
(supra) that there is a complete and careful demarcation of taxes 
in the Constitution and there is no overlapping as far as the fields 
of taxation are concerned. This mutual exclusivity which has 
been reflected in <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_101">Article 246(1)</a> means that taxing entries must be 
construed so as to maintain exclusivity.  Although generally 
speaking a liberal interpretation must be given to taxing entries, 
this would not bring within its purview a tax on  subject matter 
which a fair reading of the entry does not cover.  If in substance, 
the statute is not referable to a field given to the State, the Court 
will not by any principle of interpretation allow a statute not 
covered by it to intrude upon this field.
</p><p id="p_57">Undisputedly, Chapter V of the Finance Tax Act, 1994 was 
enacted with reference to the residuary power defined in Entry 97 
of List I.  But as has been held in <a href="/doc/501420/" id="a_102">International Tourist 
Corporation vs. State of Haryana</a> (1981) 2 SCC 319;       
"before exclusive legislative competence can be claimed for 
Parliament by resort to the residuary power, the legislative 
incompetence of the State legislature must be clearly 
established.  Entry 97 itself is specific in that a matter can be 
brought under that Entry only if it is not enumerated in List II or 
List III and in the case of a tax if it is not mentioned in either of 
those  Lists". 
</p><p id="p_58">In that case Section 3(3) of the Punjab Passengers and 
Goods Taxation Act, 1952 was challenged by transport 
operators.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_103">The Act</a> provided for the levy of the tax on 
passengers and goods plying in the State of Haryana. According 
to the transport operators, the State could not levy tax on 
passengers and goods carried by vehicles plying entirely along 
the national highways.  According to them this was solely within 
the power of the Centre under Entry 23 read with 97 of List I.  
The submission was held to be patently fallacious by this Court. 
It was held that Entry 56 of List II did not exclude national 
highways so that the passengers and goods carried on national 
highways would fall directly and squarely within Entry 56 of List 
II.  It was said that the State played a role in the maintenance of 
the national highway and there was sufficient nexus between the 
tax and passengers goods carried on the national highway to 
justify the imposition.
</p><p id="p_59">The writ petitioners in this case have, relying on this 
judgment, argued that the Act falls squarely within Entry 56 of 
List II and therefore could not be referred to Entry 97 of List I. We 
do not agree.
</p><p id="p_60">There is a distinction between the object of tax, the 
incidence of tax and the machinery for the collection of the tax. 
The distinction is important but is apt to be confused.  Legislative 
competence is to be determined with reference to the object of 
the levy and not with reference to its incidence or machinery.  
There is a further distinction between the objects of taxation  in 
our constitutional scheme.  The object of tax may be an article or 
substance such as a tax on land and buildings under Entry 49 of 
List II, or a tax on animals and boats under Entry 58 List II or on 
a taxable event  such as manufacture of goods under Entry  84 
of List-I,  import or export of goods under Entry 83 of List-I, entry 
of goods under Entry 52 of List II or sale of goods under Entry 54 
List II to name a few.  Theoretically, of course, as we have held 
in Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. Vs. State of U.P. &amp; Ors. 2005 
Scale Page 367,  ultimately even a tax on goods will be on the 
taxable event of ownership or possession.  We need not go into 
this question except to emphasise that, broadly speaking the 
subject matter of taxation under Entry 56 of List II are goods and 
passengers. The phrase "carried by roads or natural water ways" 
carves out the kind of goods or passengers which or who can be 
subjected to tax under the Entry.  The ambit and purport of the 
entry has been dealt with in Rai Ramakrishna &amp; Ors. Vs. State 
of Bihar 1963(1) SCR 897 where it was said in language which 
we cannot better:-
</p><p id="p_61">"Entry 56 of the Second List refers to taxes 
on goods and passengers carried by road or 
on inland waterways.  It is clear that the 
State Legislatures are authorized to levy 
taxes on goods and passengers by this 
entry.  It is not on all goods and passengers 
that taxes can be imposed under this entry; 
it is on goods and passengers carried by 
road or on inland waterways that taxes can 
be imposed.  The expression "carried by 
road or on inland waterways" is an adjectival 
clause qualifying goods and passengers, 
that is to say, it is goods and passengers of 
the said description that have to be taxed 
under this entry.  Nevertheless, it is obvious 
that the goods as such cannot pay taxes, 
and so taxes levied on goods have to be 
recovered from some persons, and these 
persons must have an intimate or direct 
connection or nexus with the goods before 
they can be called upon to pay the taxes in 
respect of the carried goods.  Similarly, 
passengers who are carried are taxed under 
the entry.  But, usually, it would be 
inexpedient, if not impossible, to recover the 
tax directly from the passengers and so, it 
would be expedient and convenient to 
provide for the recovery of the said tax from 
the owners of the vehicles themselves".

(See: Poppat Lal Shah v. State of Madras 1953  
SCR 677).
</p><p id="p_68">             The provisions relating to service tax in the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_112">Finance 
Act</a>, 1994 make it clear under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_113">Section 64(3)</a> that the Act 
applies only to taxable services.  Taxable services  has been 
defined, as we have already noted, in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_114">Section 65(41)</a>.  Each of 
the clauses of that sub section refers to the different kinds of 
services provided.  Most of  the taxable services cannot be 
said to be in any way related to goods or passengers carried 
by road or waterways.  For example, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_115">Section 65(41)</a> (g) 
provides for service rendered to a client by a consulting 
engineer, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_116">Section 65(41)(k)</a> refers to service to a client by a 
manpower recruitment agency,  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_117">Section 65(41)</a> (o) refers to 
service by pandal or shamiana contractors and so on.  The 
rate of service tax has been fixed under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_118">Section 66</a>.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_119">Section 
67</a> provides for valuation of taxable service for the purposes of 
charging tax. The provision for valuation of service rendered 
by collecting and forwarding agents has been dealt with  
under sub-clause (j) and service  provided by goods transport 
operators has been provided under clauses (l). (subsequently 
renumbered as clause (ma)). These clauses read respectively 
as under:-
</p><p id="p_69">    "(j) in relation to service provided by a 
clearing and forwarding agent to a client, 
shall be the gross amount charged by such 
agent from the client for services of clearing 
and forwarding operations in any manner." 
</p>
<p id="p_70">"(ma) in relation to service provided by 
goods transport operator to a customer, shall 
be the gross amount charged by such 
operator for services in relation to carrying 
goods by road in a goods carriage and 
includes the freight charges but does not 
include any insurance charges".
</p>

<p id="p_71">	As far as clause (j) is concerned it does not speak of goods 
or passengers, nor to carriage of goods nor is it limited to service 
by road or inland waterways.  Clause (ma) shows that the 
valuation of the service tax includes the freight charges, but is 
not limited to it. 
</p><p id="p_72">            It is clear therefore that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_120">Section 66</a> read with <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_121">Section 
65(41)(j)</a> and (ma) Chapter V of the Finance Act 1994 do not 
seek to levy tax on goods or passengers. The subject matter of 
tax under those provisions of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_122">Finance Act</a> 1994 is not goods 
and passengers, but the service of transportation itself.  It is a 
levy distinct from the levy envisaged under Entry 56. It may be 
that both the levies are to be measured on the same basis, but 
that does not make the levy the same. As was held in 
Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India  etc.  
v. Union of India &amp; Ors., (1989) 3 SCC 634:
</p>
<p id="p_73">"..subjects which in one aspect and for one 
purpose fall within the power of a particular  
legislature may in another aspect and for 
another purpose fall within another legislative 
power.  Indeed, the law 'with respect to' 
a subject might incidentally 'affect' another 
subject in some way; but that is not the same 
thing as  the law being on the latter subject.  
There might be overlapping; but the 
overlapping must be in law.  The same 
transaction may involve two or more taxable 
events in its different aspects.  But the fact 
that there is an overlapping does not detract 
from the distinctiveness of the aspects." 
(pg.652-653)

Since service Tax is not a levy on passengers and goods 
but on the event of service in connection with the carriage of 
goods, it is not therefore possible to hold that the Act in pith and 
substance is within the States exclusive power under Entry 56 of 
List II.  What  the Act ostensibly seeks to tax is what it, in 
substance, taxes.  In the circumstances, the Act could not be 
termed to be a colourable piece of legislation.  It is not the case 
of the petitioners that the Act is referable to any other entry apart 
from Entry 56 of List II.  Therefore the negation of the petitioners 
submission perforce leads to the conclusion that the Act falls 
within the residuary power of Parliament under Entry 97 of List I. 
Incidentally a similar challenge to the legislative 
competence of Parliament to levy service tax was negatived in 
<a href="/doc/1290723/" id="a_123">Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Assn. V. Union of India</a> 2004 
(167) ELT 3 (S.C) which was a case where the levy  of service 
tax was challenged by owners of Kalayan Mandapam/ Mandap 
Keepers.  By virtue of the 1997 amendment service provided to a 
client by  Mandap keepers including the services if any rendered 
as a caterer was  treated as a taxable service.  The challenge, 
inter-alia, was that service tax on Mandap keepers was 
colourable legislation as the said tax was not on service but was 
in pith and substance only a tax on the sale of goods and/or a tax 
on land.  The writ petition filed before the Madras High Court  
was rejected and the constitutionality of the levy was upheld.  It 
was then urged before this Court by the appellants that Entries 
18, 14 and 54 of List II covered the levy in question and, 
therefore, resort could not be had to Entry 97 in List I of the 
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.  It was held by this Court 
that although certain items of the service might have been 
referable to any other entry, the service element was the "more 
weighty, visible and predominant".  Therefore, the nature and 
character of the levy of the service tax was distinct from a tax on 
the sale or hire  purchase of goods and from a tax on land. 
The point at which the collection of the tax is to be made is 
a question of legislative convenience and part of the machinery 
for realization and recovery of the tax. The manner of the 
collection has been described as  "an accident of administration; 
it is not of the essence of the duty" .   It will not change and does 
not affect the essential nature of the tax. Subject to the legislative 
competence of the Taxing Authority a duty can be imposed at the 
stage which the authority finds to be convenient and the most 
effective whatever stage it may be.  The  Central Government is 
therefore legally competent to evolve a suitable machinery for 
collection  of the service tax subject to the maintenance of a  
rational connection between the tax and the person on whom it is 
imposed. By <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_124">Sections 116</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_125">117</a> of the Finance Act 2000, the 
tax is sought to be levied from the recipients of the services. 
They cannot claim that they are not connected with the service 
since the service is rendered to them.  
</p><p id="p_74">  In a similar fact situation under an Ordinance the Central 
Government was authorized to levy and collect a duty of excise 
on all coal and coke dispatched from collieries.  Rules framed 
under the Ordinance provided for collection of the excise duty by 
the railway administration by means of a surcharge on freight 
recoverable either from the consignor or the consignee. The 
imposition of excise duty on the consignee was challenged on 
the ground that the consignee had nothing to do with the 
manufacture or production of the coal.  Negativing this 
submission this Court in  <a href="/doc/214162/" id="a_126">R.C. Jall V. Union of India</a> AIR 1962 
SC 1281, 1286 said:- 
</p><p id="p_75">"The argument confuses the incidence of 
taxation with the machinery provided for the 
collection thereof ". 
</p>
<p id="p_76">In Rai Ramakrishna (supra) the tax under Entry 56 of List 
II was held to be competently levied on the bus operators or bus 
owners even though the object of levy was passengers ( which 
they were not) because there was a direct connection between 
the object of the tax viz., goods and passengers and the owners 
of the transport carrying the goods or passengers.  There is thus 
nothing inherently illegal or unconstitutional to provide for service 
tax to be paid by the availer or user. 
</p><p id="p_77">              The  writ petitioners have relying upon the decision in  
<a href="/doc/68571/" id="a_127">Dwarka Prasad v. Dwarka Das Saraf</a> 1976 (1) SCC 128, 
contended that the amendment to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_128">section 68</a> by the introduction 
of a proviso in 2003, was invalid.  It is submitted that as the body 
of the section did not cover the subject matter, there was no 
question of creating an exception in respect thereto by a proviso.  
According to the writ petitioners, the proviso cannot expand the 
body by creating a separate charge. It is submitted that by 
merely amending the definition of the word "assessee" it could 
not be understood to mean that thereby all customers of the 
services in question were liable.
</p><p id="p_78">	The submission is misconceived for several reasons.  
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_129">Section 68</a> is a machinery section in that it provides for the 
incidence of taxation and is not the charging section which is 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_130">Section 66</a>.  The amendments to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_131">Section 66</a> brought about in 
2000 changed the point of collection of tax from the provider of 
the service to 'such manner as may be prescribed'.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_132">Section 
68(1A)</a> as it stood in 1997 provided for the collection and 
recovery of service tax in respect of the services referred in 
clauses (g) to (r) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_133">Section 65(41)</a>, which included both the 
services with which we are concerned, from such person and in 
such manner as may be prescribed.  The 1998 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_134">Finance Act</a> 
maintained this.  Now the Service Tax Rules 1994 provided for 
the collection and recovery of tax from the user or payers for the 
services.  This was the prescribed method.  All that the proviso to 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_135">Section 68(1A)</a> did was to prescribe the procedure for collection 
with reference to services of goods transport operators and 
clearing agents which services had already been expressly 
included under the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_136">Finance Act</a> 2000 into the definition of taxable 
service.   
</p><p id="p_79">The decision in <a href="/doc/68571/" id="a_137">Dwarka Prasad vs. Dwarka Das Saraf</a> 
(supra) relied upon by the writ petitioner does not in any way 
forbid a proviso from supplementing the enacting clause.  All that 
the decision says is that a proviso must prima facie be read and 
considered in relation to the principal matter to which it is a 
proviso. It is not a separate or an independent enactment.  The 
introduction of the proviso to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_138">Section 68(1)(A)</a> by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_139">Finance 
Act</a>, 2003 does not seek in any manner seek to expand that sub-
section.  In fact it gives effect to it. 
</p><p id="p_80">The final challenge to the 2000 amendment to the Service 
Tax Act, 1994 is that it operated in a discriminatory manner in 
that it chose the recipient of the services to be the assessee only 
in the case of services rendered by goods transport operators 
and clearing and forwarding agents.  We are unable to accept 
the submission. Because of the inherent complexity  of fiscal 
adjustments of diverse elements in the field of tax, the legislature 
is permitted a large discretion in the matter of classification to 
determine not only what should be taxed but also the manner in 
which the tax may be imposed.  Courts are extremely 
circumspect in questioning the reasonability of such classification 
but after a "judicial generosity is extended to legislative wisdom,  
if there is writ on the statute perversity, madness in the method 
or  gross disparity, judicial credibility may snap and the measure 
may meet with its funeral". (Vide: <a href="/doc/1290222/" id="a_140">Ganga Sugar Corporation vs. 
State of U.P</a>. )  
       The same judicial wariness was expressed in Federation of 
Hotel and Restaurant Association of India  etc.  v. Union of 
India &amp; Ors., (1989) 3 SCC 634 where it was said:
</p>
<p id="p_81">"It is now well settled that though taxing  
laws are not outside <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_141">Article 14</a>, however, 
having regard to the wide variety of diverse 
economic criteria that go into the formulation 
of a fiscal policy  legislature enjoys a wide 
latitude in the matter of selection of persons, 
subject matter, events etc., for taxation.  The 
tests of the vice of discrimination in a taxing 
law are, accordingly, less rigorous. In 
examining the allegations of a hostile, 
discriminatory treatment what is looked into 
is not its phraseology, but the real effect of 
its provisions.  A legislature does not, as an 
old saying goes, have to tax everything in 
order to be able to tax something.  If there is 
equality and uniformity within each group, 
the law would not be discriminatory.  
</p><p id="p_82">Decisions of this Court on the matter have 
permitted the legislatures to exercise an 
extremely wide discretion in classifying items 
for tax purposes, so long as it refrains from 
clear and hostile discrimination against 
particular persons or classes." (pg.659)
     				       (Emphasis added)

	In the case before us the discrimination is not, even 
according to the writ petitioners, by reason of the subject 
matter of tax.  It is also not the writ petitioners' case that 
within the separate classes of services covered by the 
different clauses in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_142">Section 65(41)</a>, there is any 
discrimination or that the law  operates unequally within the 
classes. According to them the discrimination lies in the 
method of collection of the tax followed. But as we have said 
this is not of the essence of the tax and the mere difference 
in the machinery provisions between the different classes of 
service cannot found a challenge of discrimination . If the 
legislature thinks that it will facilitate the collection of the tax 
due from such specified traders on a rationally discernible 
basis, there is nothing in the said legislative measure to 
offend <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_143">Article 14</a> of the Constitution .  It is therefore outside 
the judicial ken to determine whether the Parliament should 
have specified a common mode for recovery of the tax as a 
convenient administrative measure in respect of a particular 
class.  That is ultimately a question of policy which must be 
left to  legislative wisdom.  This challenge also accordingly 
fails.
</p><p id="p_83">Although the challenge to the constitutional validity and 
legality  of the levy of service tax is rejected, the writ petitioners 
have some subsidiary complaints.  They say that although the 
levy of service tax from the users of the services rendered by the 
goods transport operators was introduced with effect from        
16th November, 1997, the levy was exempted for the period 
subsequent to 2nd June, 1998 in view of the notification dated    
2nd June, 1998 which is still operative.  Yet the respondents had 
raised demands for service tax for periods subsequent to 2nd 
June, 1998.  It has been conceded  by the Union of India that the 
amendments made in the Act would have to be read along with  
the notifications so that the levy and collection of service tax 
would be only in respect of services rendered by goods transport 
operators between the period from 16th November, 1997 to      
2nd June, 1998.  Similarly there can be no tax liability on users  of 
the services of the clearing and forwarding agents beyond 
1.9.1999 when by notification No. 7/99 dated 23.8.99, the levy of 
service tax on the services provided by clearing and forwarding 
agents were exempted. Furthermore the liability to pay interest or 
penalty on outstanding amounts will arise only if the dues are not 
paid within the  period of two weeks from the order passed by 
this Court on 17th November, 2003. In those cases in which the 
tax may have been paid but not refunded to the writ petitioners, 
for whatever reason, there is no question of levy of any interest 
or penalty at all.
</p><p id="p_84">With these clarifications, the writ petitions are dismissed 
without any order as to costs.
