CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                   Page 1 of 30
 situated at B-1/ 30 Malviya Nagar, New Delhi which is engaged in providing

Educational Services, Coaching &amp; training for students in various Schools &amp;

Colleges, since the year 1998 under the trademark "TURNING POINT", which

had been duly registered by the Plaintiff under class 41 on 15.11.2005 and the

plaintiff has built up enormous goodwill &amp; reputation in the market over the

years. It is the case of the plaintiff that the said registration of the trademark

"TURNING POINT" by the Plaintiff is valid and subsisting till the year 2015. It

is also the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff was the first one to have coined

a unique &amp; subjective mark with respect to educational services in the year

1998. According to the plaintiff, M/s TURNING POINT has various centres in

Delhi, providing coaching and training services to the students in association

with the sole proprietorship concern run under the name "PYRAMID

CLASSES" by the Plaintiff‟s wife. It is also the case of the plaintiff that they

are primarily engaged in imparting coaching &amp; training to students of class

competitive entrance exams such as BBA, BBS, LAW, IIT, AIEEE,

CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                     Page 2 of 30
 well- known mark under Section 2 (z) (g) of the Trademarks Act, 1999. It is the

case of the plaintiff that in the month of June 2012, the plaintiff came to know

that the defendant has adopted an identical and deceptively similar mark to that

of the plaintiff. According to the plaintiff the defendant is using the impugned

mark out of greed with a view to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill

of the plaintiff.


Achievements, Sales and Advertising

3.     According to the plaintiff, the institution M/s TURNING POINT

maintains highest level of quality Education, training &amp;coaching services,

teaching about thousands of students, which has enabled the students to excel in

their exams. The plaintiff has printed various Brochures highlighting the

success of its students, their achievements in the educational field. The plaintiff

over the years has built up enormous goodwill, reputation and name in the

market among the public for providing quality and effective coaching and

training services, to the students helping them to prepare for various entrance

exams. It is also the case of the plaintiff that it has been using, advertising, &amp;

promoting the said mark continuously and extensively since the year 1998, with

respect to the above services making it distinctive and thereby, making it a well-

known mark under Section 2(z) (g) of the Trademarks Act, 1999. It has been

contended that the plaintiff has achieved tremendous sales which are reflective

of the enormous goodwill and reputation, which the plaintiff has achieved by
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                   Page 3 of 30

4.     The plaintiff has also incurred huge volume of sums in advertising and

promoting the educational training and coaching services under the name/

trademark „TURNING POINT‟, making the said mark of the plaintiff highly


CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                Page 4 of 30
 distinctive. It is also the host of the website www.theturningpoint.com where all

the information about the plaintiff‟s activities is given for its current and

prospective students. It also conducts online tests on its website for the students

to assess their intellectual capacity. In addition plaintiff also hosts a facebook

account and has hosted many online lectures on youtube.com. The plaintiff is

associated with various schools and universities in Delhi like, Don Bosco

School, Apeejay School Saket, Ryan International School, etc. wherein it

provides education, training and coaching services to the students. The plaintiff

has further been associated with Modi School, Lakshmangarh, Dist. Sirkar,

Rajasthan, for taking mathematics and science classes. The copies of the

acknowledgement of various schools have also been filed along with the plaint,

establishing the fact that the plaintiffs coaching classes and training sessions are

acknowledged more or less, by almost all the schools. The copy of the

trademark registration certificate, the original sales figures, sale invoices,

advertising invoices, web site and service tax registration has also been filed by

the plaintiff along with the plaint.

CASE OF THE PLAINTIFF AS AGAINST THE DEFENDANT:


5.    It is the case of the plaintiff that it has a huge set up and interactive

curriculum, thereby imparting theoretical as well as practical knowledge to the

students who appear for competitive exams and over the years, the plaintiff‟s

plinth of students has constantly increased with the similar proportionate
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                    Page 5 of 30
 increase in excellent results obtained by the students who are taught by the

plaintiff.


6.     It has also been alleged that the plaintiff came to know in June‟2012, that

the defendant, a limited company situated at B-234, Okhla Phase -1, New Delhi

110002, has launched a computer training program under the name "NIIT THE

TURNING POINT". It is the case of the Plaintiff that the defendant by using

the registered trademark of the plaintiff, as part of their educational and training

course is infringing upon the valuable statutory and common law rights of the

plaintiff in its registered trademark. It is also the case of the plaintiff that the

defendant has in an unauthorized manner started using the mark "TURNING

POINT" as part of its trade, without taking any permission or authorization

from the plaintiff, thereby, deliberately creating confusion with an attempt to

dilute the reputation and name commanded by the plaintiff among the students.


7.     It is also the case of the plaintiff that the defendant is causing substantial

loss and damage to the plaintiff‟s goodwill, name, reputation in the market,

which it has arduously build over years. The act of the defendant to adopt a

similar name as part of its trade name / training course is deliberate act of

deceit, unfair competition and would amount to passing off its services as that

of the plaintiff‟s. The defendant by using the similar mark for the same class of

the services i.e. Education services falling under class 41 of the Trademark Act,

1999, is creating confusion in the market thereby not only violating valuable
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                     Page 6 of 30
 common law rights of the plaintiff herein but also creating substantial loss and

damage to the plaintiff‟s business &amp; reputation at large.


8.     It has also been asserted by the Plaintiff that the defendant‟s activities are

crafting confusion, as it is portraying to have some nexus with the plaintiff or

that the defendant has entered into some understanding with the plaintiff to use

its mark. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that such an act is a deliberate

attempt to trade on the gargantuan goodwill of the plaintiff, with a view to have

unjust gains and profits.

9.     As per the plaintiff, the Defendant must have had the prior knowledge of

the existence of the plaintiff, in the market as both the parties are operating in

the same field of education, training and coaching services. The plaintiff further

submits that the defendant ought to have made due diligence about existence of

any similar name/ mark prior to its adoption before launching the said services

in the market. The conduct of the defendant express that the defendant has not

taken due diligence or care before adopting the identical name as that of the

plaintiff thereby violating their valuable statutory and common law rights in the

registered trademark "TURNING POINT". Ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff further

submitted that the defendant at all material times was aware of the plaintiff‟s

existence in the market, as in the year 2002, the plaintiff and the defendant had

joined hands for providing education and coaching services to various students.

Furthermore, both plaintiff and the defendant have been providing educational
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                     Page 7 of 30
 services to the students of MODY school, Rajasthan which creates more

confusion and deception as to the origin of the name "TURNING POINT".

Therefore, it is quite evident that the defendant is dishonest in their conduct.

The counsel further submitted that the defendant has also filed an opposition

against a party in Chennai against the use of the mark TURNING POINT ,

which shows its malafides as in the present case the defendant states that the

TURNING POINT of the plaintiff is descriptive while on the other hand it

opposes the mark TURNING POINT adopted by a third party on the basis of it

being similar to the mark of the defendant.


10.    It is also the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff immediately served

upon the defendant the cease and desist notice in the month of June, dated 1st

June 2012 calling upon the defendant to immediately cease from using the said

mark. But in reply dated 15.06.2012 to the said notice, the defendant denied all

the contentions of infringement or passing off arbitrarily.


11. Counsel further submitted that the word "TURNING POINT" was first

adopted by the plaintiff in the year 1998 and its long usage has transcended the

said mark into a distinctive mark. The Counsel further submitted that the

defendant has failed to substantiate its claim as mentioned in its written

statement that many people have been using the aforesaid mark, as the

defendant has only filed a search report according to which only a few service

providers are shown to have adopted the said mark without any proof of actual
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                  Page 8 of 30
 user. Counsel further submitted that the defendant has miserably failed to

produce any sales figures or invoices to substantiate its goodwill in the market

for its mark "NIIT THE TURNING POINT". Counsel thus submitted that the

defendant has been vigorously advertising impugned mark in the market with

high stress on the plaintiff‟s mark thereby creating confusion and causing loss to

the plaintiff‟s reputation and goodwill in the market.


12.    To support his arguments, Ld. counsel for the plaintiff placed reliance on

the following judgments:


a) <a href="/doc/128046/" id="a_1">Indian Shaving Products Ltd. &amp;Anr V. Gift Pack &amp;Anr</a>., 1998 PTC (18)

13.       In the light of the above, the plaintiff prays for issuance of ad-interim

injunction restraining the defendant, its directors, servants, principal officers,
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                   Page 9 of 30
 agents, successors, assigns, nominees etc. and others acting for and on behalf of

the defendant from using, marketing, selling, offering for sale, advertising or

displaying directly or indirectly or dealing in any manner or mode in class 41 of

the TMA, 1999 in which the plaintiff deals through the impugned trade name/

label „TURNING POINT‟ and also from doing any act that is likely to cause

confusion and deception and passing off of the plaintiff‟s goods.The plaintiff

also prays that if the defendant is not restrained, then the business of the

Plaintiff‟s Institution is going to suffer irreparable loss on account of the

unauthorized and unlicensed use of the said trade mark.


Defendant Co.'s Incorporation &amp; Trademark Registration

13.    Giving the background of the defendant‟s business, counsel for the

defendant submitted that the defendant is a renowned IT Education and

Training Company having its offices in several locations in India and Abroad. It

is the registered owner and proprietor of the mark „NIIT‟. NIIT was originally

coined in the year 1981 as an acronym of the full name - NATIONAL

INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, which was earlier being

used by the defendant in respect of its services. The mark NIIT and its

derivatives have now become distinctive brands of the defendant. The original

name of the defendant Company was PACE EDUCATION PRIVATE

LIMITED which commenced business of imparting computer education

services through a chain of institutes and coaching centres under
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                 Page 10 of 30
 mark/brand/name NIIT, and the said mark has been continuously and

extensively used by the defendant since then. The corporate name PACE

EDUCATION PVT. LTD. was changed to NIIT Limited in the year 1990,

thereafter a number of companies such as NIIT institute of finance, banking and

insurance training limited, NIIT institute of Process Excellence, NIIT Antilles

NV, NIIT USA Inc etc. have been incorporated in the NIIT name which include

companies in India, Netherlands, USA, Antilles, Bahrain etc. All these

companies use the mark NIIT as a prominent part of their corporate names and

/or trading styles and are commonly used as NIIT Group. They also provide a

range of services under the name NIIT. The model of the NIIT Group covers

both information Technology Education and Software Services. The NIIT group

started providing Software Solutions since 1984. The NIIT Group went public

in 1993, and the Software Solutions business was separated from the NIIT

Limited in 2003-2004 as a separate company and is called the NIIT

Technologies Limited. Counsel also stated that the Defendant is engaged in the

business of imparting IT education and training, running IT institutions

worldwide, providing business process outsourcing services to IT industry etc.


14.    Refuting the contentions raised by the Counsel for the plaintiff, Ld.

Counsel for the defendant submitted that the plaintiff is not a registered

proprietor of the mark TURNING POINT per se, as is sought to be portrayed in

the suit. The alleged mark is in respect of the label mark as a whole and that the
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                  Page 11 of 30
 alleged registration of the label mark does not confer any exclusivity on the

words TURNING POINT rather it‟s read as TP TURNING POINT and hence

no infringement suit lies against the Defendant.

15.    Ld. Counsel for the defendant also submitted that there lies no similarity

between the defendant‟s and the plaintiff‟s mark as it is a well settled principle

of law that the marks are to be compared as a whole, and the defendants mark

essentially bears the reputed trademark NIIT as an inseparable part of it whereas

the plaintiff‟s mark is a label mark. Counsel also submitted that the defendant‟s

mark/logo NIIT is registered under various classes and with respect to the

registration of NIIT THE TURNING POINT, the same is pending registration.


16.    The ld. counsel for the defendant also contended that the adoption of the

trademark NIIT THE TURNING POINT is honest and bona-fide, as the

defendant added its well-known trademark NIIT as a prefix to the words THE

TURNING POINT which are common dictionary words in the English

language and is used very often in respect of education and training services

which cannot be monopolized. Ld. Counsel further submitted that the alleged

mark TURNING POINT is incapable of being associated or being distinctive of

only one service provider, as these terms are very commonly used especially

qua services like education and training.




CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                  Page 12 of 30
 17.      Ld. Counsel also submitted that the defendant is a leading provider of

education and training services under the trademark and name NIIT and that the

institution has been in existence for a far longer period of time than the Plaintiff

and further that the Defendant company enjoys reputation and goodwill which

is unmatched by the Plaintiff. The mark /name NIIT is a well known mark

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_9">Section 2(zg)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. In addition

to the trademark NIIT THE TURNING POINT, the defendant uses various

trademarks/service marks for different courses as detailed inparagraph 6 of their

written statement and so far as the expression „TURNING POINT‟ is concerned

the same pertains only to cloud centric curriculum.


18. Ld. Counsel also submitted that defendants started using the said expression

in May 2012 with intent to show how the said course can be a TURNING

POINT in the career of the students. The Counsel also submitted that defendant

were conscious of the fact at the time when defendant had applied for the

registration of a trademark „TURNING POINT‟, that the same was a descriptive

word and therefore, the defendant in such a scenario reserves its rights to file a

rectification petition against the impugned registration of the mark/ label "THE

TURNING POINT" in the name of the plaintiff, if the need arises at a later

stage.


19.          Clarifying the stand of the defendant with regard to the arguments

advanced by counsel for the plaintiff that defendant has made a false averment
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                   Page 13 of 30
 in the written statement contending that defendants never had any tie up with

the plaintiff in providing educational services to the students of Modi School,

counsel categorically stated that from paragraph 5 of the written statement it is

manifest that it never had any tie up with the plaintiff for delivering any

educational services in the Modi School.


20.      Explaining the brochure placed on record by the plaintiff at page 46 of

the paperbook, counsel for the defendant submitted that this document has

already been denied by the defendant, as the defendant has no knowledge about

this document or who brought out the same. Counsel also submitted that so far

the reliance placed by the plaintiff on the invoice dated 28.03.2012 placed on

record at page 34 of the paper book is concerned, the defendant has nowhere

denied that they have not provided educational services to the Modi School, but

their categorical stand was that they had no tie up with the plaintiff for

providing training sessions at the Modi School ever.


21.    Counsel also submitted that so far the computer generated search report is

concerned the only purpose of the defendant was to show that the word

"TURNING POINT" is being used by various institutions. Counsel also

submitted that the name of the plaintiff in the said report is not appearing

possibly because of the fact that the defendant gave a word without a break in

the search stream. (Printout of status report from the internet showing the

opposition is placed on record). Counsel for the Defendant thus submitted that
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                 Page 14 of 30
 there is no concealment or misrepresentation of any kind on the part of the

defendant.


22. In support of her arguments, counsel for the defendant placed reliance on

the judgments of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the cases of <a href="/doc/1514512/" id="a_10">Skyline Education

Institute v. SL Vaswani</a>, 2010 (42) PTC 217, Marico Limited Vs. Agro Tech

Foods Ltd, MIPR 2010 (3) 0226 and <a href="/doc/147065063/" id="a_11">Three N Products Private Limited v.

Emami Limited</a> reported in MIPR 2008 (3) 0319.


23.    I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and given my anxious

consideration to the arguments advanced by them.


24.    At the stage of deciding an interim application under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2

of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, I only need to consider the undisputed facts

and the material placed on record. On perusal of the documents placed on

record by the parties and the contentions raised by their respective counsels, this

court does not have an iota of doubt in holding that the plaintiff was the first in

point of time to adopt the trademark/ label "TURNING POINT" with respect to

educational services falling under class 41 of Schedule IV of The Trademarks

Act, 1999. The documents placed on record clearly corroborate the fact that the

plaintiff adopted the trademark/ label „TURNING POINT‟ in 1998 and got it

registered on 15.11.2005 with respect of educational services falling under

Class 41 of The Trademarks Act, 1999 while the application for registration of

CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                  Page 15 of 30
 defendant‟s mark "NIIT THE TURNING POINT" is still pending registration.

       The documents on record showing that the plaintiff has been awarded

various acclamations and has been ranked highly in various schools, magazines

in imparting education and training, entertainment, sporting &amp; Cultural

Activities since 1998 clearly establish the fact of their uninterrupted usage of

the mark since then until now and such long usage of the mark by the plaintiff,

for more than a decade, has led to the services carried on by the plaintiff being

identified as exclusively originating from the plaintiff.


25.    It has been held by the Supreme Court in the "Super Cup" case reported

as <a href="/doc/920066/" id="a_12">Godfrey Philips India Ltd. v. Girnar Food and Beverages (P) Ltd</a>., (2004)

5 SCC 257 that a descriptive trademark may be entitled to protection if it has

assumed a secondary meaning which identifies it with a particular product or

has been from a particular source.


26.   <a href="/doc/67204010/" id="a_13">In Mahendra &amp; Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd. v. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra

Ltd</a>. 2001 IXAD SC 472 the Hon‟ble Supreme Court restrained the use of the

word „Mahendra‟ observing that the trade mark had acquired a distinctiveness

and a secondary meaning in the business or trade circles and that people have

come to associate the name Mahindra with a certain standard of goods and

services rendered by the plaintiff.




CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                 Page 16 of 30
 27.     In     ACL      Education      Centre     Pvt.    ltd.       and     <a href="/doc/140199339/" id="a_14">Anr.

while granting an ex parte injunction in favour of the plaintiff‟s for using the

common English words "American Centre for Languages" as its trade mark,

this Hon‟ble court held as under:

             "12. On the basis of material produced and the long user by
             the Plaintiffs, it appears prima facie that the „American
             Centre for Languages‟ has come to be associated with the
             Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs have produced the balance-sheet as
             per which it has shown that receipts in the form of fees are
             in several lakhs per years. Thus, it is clear that over this
             period thousands of students have undertaken English
             language and other courses offered by the Plaintiff institute
             and they identify „American Centre for Languages‟ with the
             Plaintiff."



28.     Dealing with the aspect that „STANDARD‟ being a common dictionary

word is capable of achieving distinctiveness because of its continuous usage

since a long period of time, it was observed in the case of Standard Electricals

Limited Vs. Rocket Electricals and Anr., 2004 (72) DRJ 794 in paragraph 22

that:

             "22. ........ Prima facie there does not appear much force in
             the argument of the defendant that the word STANDARD is
             continuously used for a long time as a trade mark for selling
             its goods and the trade mark cannot be protected only
             because it is a common English language word, a generic,
             descriptive or laudatory word. An ordinary generic or
             descriptive word or even name of a person, geographical
             place, or surname may come to acquire distinctiveness and
             secondary meaning in the business and trade circle so as to
             associate a product sold under that trade name with a
             particular person. If another person is using the same word
             or a deceptively similar mark for marketing its producers
             with dishonest intention to cash upon the reputation,
CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                   Page 17 of 30
            popularity and goodwill of the products of the plaintiff, the
           plaintiffs trade make is entitled to be given due protection
           by the Court."




29.    In the light of the dicta laid in the above judgments, it would be proper to

hold that the plaintiff‟s trade mark/ label „TURNING POINT‟ has achieved the

status of a well-known mark/ label within the meaning of <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_15">Section 2</a> (1) (zg) of

the Trademarks Act, 1999.


30.    The mere fact that there are other users of the mark „TURNING POINT‟,

as alleged by the defendant, with respect to educational services, will not aid the

defendant in defending this interlocutory application as the defendant has failed

to place on record any document substantiating the fact of being an actual user

of the mark by such alleged service providers and the amount of goodwill and

reputation that their mark allegedly enjoy in the market. (<a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_16">See Corn Products

Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd</a>., [1960] 1 SCR 968).


31.    As far as the reliance placed by the defendant on <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_17">Section 17</a> of the

trademark Act, 1999 is concerned, the defendant has profoundly contented that

the plaintiff cannot claim monopoly over the words "TURNING POINT" per se

when the registration is for a label/logo mark by virtue of section 17 of the

Trademarks Act, 1999. For better appreciation of section 17 of the Trademark

Act, 1999, the same is reproduced below:

           17. Effect of registration of parts of a mark.--

CS (OS) No. 2237/2012                                                  Page 18 of 30
            (1) When a trade mark consists of several matters, its
           registration shall confer on the proprietor exclusive
           right to the use of the trade mark taken as a whole.

           (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section
           (1), when a trade mark--

           (a) contains any part--

           (i) which is not the subject of a separate application by
           the proprietor for registration as a trade mark; or

           (ii) which is not separately registered by the
           proprietor as a trade mark; or
           (b) contains any matter which is common to the trade
           or is otherwise of a non-distinctive character,

           the registration thereof shall not confer any exclusive
           right in the matter forming only a part of the whole of
           the trade mark so registered.



32.    The argument advanced by the counsel for the defendant is that as per

<a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_18">section 17</a> (1) of the Act, the exclusive right of the registered proprietor is to

use the trademark "taken as a whole" and not "in part" which the plaintiff is

trying to claim. A recent judgment of the division bench of this court in the

case Unitech Biotech Pvt Ltd. (supra) has very explicitly taken care of the

aforesaid issue. The contention raised by the counsel for the appellant in the

said case was that the registration of respondent‟s trademark was in respect of</pre>

<p id="p_1">label mark ORZID and it is only the label which needs to be protected by

virtue of <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_19">Section 17</a> of the Act. Dismissing such contention raised by the

counsel for the appellant, the court observed that the essential feature of the

mark is also protected if the mark is registered as a whole. After placing

reliance on the judgment of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_20">Ramdev Food

 v. Arvindbhai Rambhai</a> , 2006 (33) PTC 281 (SC, the Division Bench of this

court observed in paras 24 and 25 as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "24. The entire arguments are on the wrong premise and it
           proceeds on the basis of common feature of the two marks
           suffix "ZID" and since the respondent has registration and
           trade mark "ORZID", it cannot bare a part of it, i.e., "ZID".
           What has been seen in a case like this is as to whether the
           mark "FORZID" is deceptively similar to "ORZID". That is
           the test which is to be applied and in a process, it is to be
           seen as to whether the two marks are structurally and
           phonetically similar and would cause deception in the minds
           of consumers. When we judge the matter from this angle,
           we find ourselves in agreement with the view taken by
           IPAB as well as the learned Single Judge. Although the
           mark "ORZID" is a label mark, the word mark "ORZID" is an
           essential feature which has been covered by the
           registration. Therefore, the learned counsel for the
           respondent appears to be right in his submission on this
           aspect, which is predicated on the Supreme Court decision
           in Ramdev Food Products Ltd. (supra). Following dicta on
           the said decision is pertinent:

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           82. In Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd. (supra), whereupon
           reliance has been placed by Mr. Nariman, this Court was
           concerned with a proprietary mark of 'Shree'. It was
           claimed that the mark 'Shree' was a trade mark apart from
           the device as a whole and it was an important feature of its
           device. The respondents were carrying on business in the
           name and style of Shree Durga Charan Rakshit. It was in
           the peculiar factual background obtaining therein, this
           Court, referred to the decision of Lord Esher in Pinto v.
           Badman [8 RPC 181] to say that where a distinctive label is
           registered as a whole such registration cannot possibly give
           any exclusive statutory right to the proprietor of the trade
           mark to the use of any particular word or name contained
           therein apart from the mark as a whole. This Court in the

           before him and the statement of counsel it was quite clear
           that the reason for resisting the disclaimer in this particular
           case was that the Company thought, erroneously no doubt
           but quite seriously, that the registration of the trade mark
           as a whole would, in the circumstances of this case, give it

            a right to the exclusive use of the word "Shree" as if
           separately and by itself it was also its registered trade mark
           and that it would be easier for it to be successful in an
           infringement action than in a passing off action. It was
           precisely the possibility of such an extravagant and
           untenable claim that called for a disclaimer for the purpose
           of defining the rights of the respondent company under the
           registration.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           25. We find that the learned Single Judge rightly held that
           when a label mark is registered, it cannot be said that the
           word mark contained therein is not registered. We, thus,
           are of the opinion that although the word "ORZID" is a label
           mark, the word "ORZID" contained therein is also worthy of
           protection. The learned Single Judge has rightly observed
           that the judgment of the Supreme Court in Ramdev Food
           Products Ltd. (supra) is the complete answer."

<p id="p_2">33.     In the light of the above, the plaintiff‟s trademark „TURNING POINT‟

being an essential feature of the label of the plaintiff "TP-TURNING POINT"

deserves protection from any acts of infringement/passing off caused at the

hand of any other person using the similar/ identical mark.


</p><p id="p_3">34.    The issue in the present case thus boils down to the question whether the

plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of infringement/ passing off against the

of "NIIT-THE TURNING POINT" and thus accords interim protection against

the defendant.

trademark. <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_23">Section 29</a>, dealing with. infringement of registered trademarks,

which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of the

that it has a registered trademark „TURNING POINT‟ with respect to the

the identical services of providing educational training to the students.

Primarily, what needs to be seen in the present case is whether the defendant‟s

whole. The parameters to be taken into consideration in order to determine

whether the defendant‟s mark is deceptively similar to the mark of the plaintiff

are very well enunciated in Pionotist case reported in 1906(23) RPC 774,

which reads as follows:

             the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy
             those goods. In fact, you must consider all the surrounding
             circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely
             to happen if each of those trademarks is used in a normal
             way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners
             of the marks. If, considering all those circumstances, you
             come to the conclusion that there will be a confusion-that is
             to say, not necessarily that one man will be injured and the
             other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be a
             confusion in the mind of the public which will lead to
             confusion in the goods-then you may refuse the

<p id="p_24">42.    Coming to the facts of the present case, the registered trademark of the

Plaintiff is not solely "TURNING POINT" but it‟s with the label TP and is read

as „TP TURNING POINT‟ as a whole, which is the name of the institution,

however, the Defendant has pre-fixed the name of its company NIIT before the

words "TURNING POINT" giving rise to the impugned phrase "NIIT- THE

TURNING POINT". It is not disputed that the Defendant company started

providing educational services and set up the company in 1993 way before than

that of the Plaintiff‟s, however, its mark in use has always been NIIT and

 moreover, just by pre fixing their own mark NIIT before the Phrase TURNING

POINT which enjoys a goodwill in the educational sector, would not necessarily

distinguish their mark with the Plaintiff‟s mark while adjudging two marks

having the same genre of practise, when placed alongside, if appear similar in

their description would cause infringement within the four corners of law.


</p><p id="p_25">43.    The court also does not find any genuineness on the part of the defendant

in adopting the trademark „NIIT THE TURNING POINT‟ on the basis of the

contention that they started using the said expression in May 2012 with intent to

show how the said course can be a TURNING POINT in the career of the

students. The defendant has vehemently denied the fact that they had ever

joined hands with the plaintiff in providing training courses to the students at

various educational institutes but admittedly, the defendant was providing its

educational services in Mody School, where the plaintiff was also engaged.

Such being the situation, it cannot be said that the defendant had no prior

knowledge regarding the plaintiff‟s services and adopted the impugned

trademark righteously and after exercising due diligence. Merely being a bigwig

in the field of providing educational services, the defendant cannot use its brand

name „NIIT‟ to ride upon the goodwill and business built up by the other

comparatively smaller service provider, working in the same field for over a

decade, under the garb of the defence that it has clearly distinguished its mark

with that of the other service provider by prefixing its own mark with former‟s

 mark so as to avoid confusion in the market. The use of the plaintiff‟s mark

along with NIIT can certainly cause confusion in the minds of the public at

large that the plaintiff and the defendant have joined hands in providing the

computer training services.

WADLOW, IIIrd EDITION, PAGE 430, it is passing off to misrepresent that

one‟s business is that of the claimant or connected with that of the claimant in

any way likely to cause damage . "The principle is this, that no man is entitled

to carry on his business in such a way or by such a name as to lead to the belief

that he is carrying on the business of another man or to lead to the belief that the

business which he is carrying on has any connection with the business carried

on by another man."(per Romer L.J. in Clock Limited v. Clock House Hotel

Limited, (1936) 53 R.P.C 269, C.A.)


</p><p id="p_28">45.    The bonafides on the part of the defendant is also doubted in view of the

fact that on one hand the defendant claims that the words TURNING POINT

are descriptive in nature and hence cannot confer any monopolistic rights to the

exclusion of the others in favour of the plaintiff and on the other hand the

Defendant has itself filed an opposition against a party in Chennai for using the

trademark „TURNING POINT‟.

Tech Foods Ltd and Three-N-Product v. Emami (supra),              would also be of

no help to the defendant and is entirely misplaced in the facts of the present

case, as it is case of the plaintiff that it had coined its trademark "TURNING

POINT" and the said mark has no direct reference to the character or quality of

services provided by the plaintiff as alleged by the defendant, and has not been

adopted or used for the purpose of describing the services which it provides.


</p><p id="p_31">47.     In the light of the above discussion and based on the triple test for the

grant of ad-interim injunction viz (1) whether the plaintiff has strong prima

facie case to succeed on merits (2) whether the balance of convenience lies in

favour of the plaintiff and (3) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss

and injury if the injunction is not granted in its favour, this court finds that all

the three principles lean in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. In

the facts and circumstances of the present case, the plaintiff has been able to

make out a prima facie case for grant of injunction against the Defendant.

</p><p id="p_32">48.    The use of the expression TURNING POINT along with their mark NIIT

by the Defendant at this initial stage deserves to be injuncted as the mark of the

Defendant is deceptively similar to that of the Plaintiff Institution. As a result,

the plaintiff‟s application for the grant of interim injunction under Order 39

Rule 1, 2 stands allowed and accordingly, the defendant, its directors,

employees, servants, agents etc. are restrained from marketing, selling or using
