      Initially     this        Court     recognized        a       sort      of

      demarcation between administrative orders and quasi-

      judicial orders but with the passage of time the

      distinction between the two got blurred and thinned

      out and virtually reached a vanishing point in the

      judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/639803/" id="a_13">A.K. Kraipak and others

      Court approvingly referred to the opinion of Lord

      Denning in Rigina vs. Gaming Board Ex parte Benaim

      [(1970) 2 WLR 1009] and quoted him as saying "that

</p><p id="p_30">17.   The expression `speaking order' was first coined by

      Lord   Chancellor       Earl   Cairns       in   a     rather       strange

      context. The Lord Chancellor, while explaining the

      ambit of Writ of Certiorari, referred to orders with

      errors on the face of the record and pointed out

      that an order with errors on its face, is a speaking

      order. (See 1878-97 Vol. 4 Appeal Cases 30 at 40 of

      the report)



</p><p id="p_31">18.   This Court always opined that the face of an order

      passed   by    a     quasi-judicial        authority         or    even   an

      administrative        authority         affecting      the    rights       of

      parties,      must    speak.       It    must    not    be        like    the

      Sunder Jhunjhunwala and others</a>, AIR 1961 SC 1669,

      the     question    of    recording          reasons        came     up     for

      consideration       in    the        context    of      a    refusal        by

      Harinagar     to    transfer,          without       giving        reasons,

      shares     held    by     Shyam       Sunder.     Challenging              such

      refusal,     the    transferee          moved     the        High         Court

      contending, inter alia, that the refusal is mala

      fide,     arbitrary      and     capricious.         The      High        Court

      rejected such pleas and the transferee was asked to

      file a suit. The transferee filed an appeal to the

      Central Government under Section 111 Clause (3) of

      <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_15">Indian    Companies       Act</a>,       1956    which     was     dismissed.

      Thereafter, the son of the original transferee filed

      another application for transfer of his shares which

      was similarly refused by the Company. On appeal, the

      Central Government quashed the resolution passed by

      the Company and directed the Company to register the

      transfer.     However,         in     passing     the       said      order,

      Government    did       not    give    any     reason.       The     company

      challenged the said decision before this Court.



</p><p id="p_34">20.   The other question which arose in Harinagar (supra)

      was whether the Central Government, in passing the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       8</span>
      appellate order acted as a tribunal and is amenable

      to <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_16">Article 136</a> jurisdiction of this Court.



</p><p id="p_35">21.   Even though in Harinagar (supra) the decision was

      administrative,        this       Court         insisted             on   the

      requirement    of   recording          reason       and    further        held

      that   in   exercising    appellate            powers,         the    Central

      Government     acted     as       a     tribunal          in    exercising

      judicial powers of the State and such exercise is

      subject to <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_17">Article 136</a> jurisdiction of this Court.

      Such powers, this Court held, cannot be effectively

      exercised if reasons are not given by the Central

      Government in support of the order (Para 23, page

      1678-79).

      of   this   Court   examined          the     question         whether    the

      under the aforesaid Rule the Central Government acts

      in a quasi-judicial capacity (See para 8 page 1610).

      Where the State Government gives a number of reasons

      some of which are good and some are not, and the

      Central Government merely endorses the order of the

      State Government without specifying any reason, this

      Court,    exercising      its      jurisdiction     under   <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_20">Article

      136</a>, may find it difficult to ascertain which are

      the grounds on which Central Government upheld the

      order    of    the    State   Government     (See    para    9   page

      1610).    Therefore,      this     Court   insisted    on   reasons

      being given for the order.

      U.P. Sugar Dealers License Order under which the

      license was cancelled, this Court held that such an

      order of cancellation is quasi-judicial and must be

      a speaking one. This Court further held that merely

      giving an opportunity of hearing is not enough and

      further pointed out where the order is subject to

      appeal,       the    necessity     to   record   reason     is   even

      greater. The learned Judges held that the recording

      the Central Government under the then <a href="/doc/106809565/" id="a_23">Section 36</a> of

      the Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_24">Salt Act</a>, 1944, held that the

      Central Government was actually exercising judicial

      power of the State and in exercising judicial power

      reasons in support of the order must be disclosed on

      two grounds. The first is that the person aggrieved

      gets an opportunity to demonstrate that the reasons

      are erroneous and secondly, the obligation to record

      reasons   operates   as   a    deterrent   against   possible

      arbitrary action by the executive authority invested

      with the judicial power (See para 11 page 865-866).

      giving     reasons     in       support       of    conclusions         in   the

      Award. The Court held that the very requirement of

      giving      reason         is     to      prevent          unfairness         or

      arbitrariness in reaching conclusions. The second

      principle is based on the jurisprudential doctrine

      that justice should not only be done, it should also

      appear to be done as well. The learned Judges said

      that   a    just     but     unreasoned            conclusion        does    not

      appear     to   be    just      to     those        who    read   the    same.

      Reasoned and just conclusion on the other hand will

      also   have     the    appearance             of    justice.      The    third

      ground is that such awards are subject to <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_28">Article

      136</a> jurisdiction of this Court and in the absence of

      reasons, it is difficult for this Court to ascertain

      whether the decision is right or wrong (See para 5

      decision is purely administrative or quasi-judicial.

      This Court held that the reasons in such context

      would   mean      the   link    between     materials       which      are

      considered and the conclusions which are reached.

      judicial order is, this Court held, as basic as

      following the principles of natural justice. And the

      rule must be observed in its proper spirit. A mere

      conferred upon the board that it is their duty
      to set out their reasoning in sufficient form
      to show the principles on which they have

      observations (in <a href="/doc/567147/" id="a_46">R vs. Immigration Appeal
      Tribunal</a>, ex p Khan (Mahmud) [1983] 2 All ER

      reasons for the lower amount is not obvious.
      Mr. Cunningham is entitled to know, either
      expressly or inferentially stated, what it was
      to which the board were addressing their mind
      in arriving at their conclusion.    It must be
      obvious to the board that Mr. Cunningham is
      left with a burning sense of grievance. They
      should be sensitive to the fact that he is
      left with a real feeling of injustice, that
      having been found to have been unfairly
      dismissed, he has been deprived of his just
      desserts (as he sees them)".

<p id="p_81">           "..thus, in the particular circumstances
      of this case, and without wishing to establish
      any precedent whatsoever, I am prepared to

      succinct reasons, if only to put the mind of
      Mr. Cunningham at rest. I would therefore

      towards an increasing recognition of the duty of

      Court   to   give   reasons    (See   North   Range   Shipping

      Limited vs. Seatrans Shipping Corporation, (2002) 1

      WLR 2397).    It has been acknowledged that this trend

      is consistent with the development towards openness

      in Government and judicial administration.

      (2002) 1 WLR 2409, it has been held that justice

      parties why one has won and the other has lost.                          The

      discipline ... which may contribute to such decisions

      being     considered       with       care.         Secondly,       reasons

      by this Court in S.N. Mukherjee (supra) in paragraph

      11 at page 1988 of the judgment. This Court held

      that in the United States the Courts have always

      insisted       on     the        recording          of   reasons          by

      administrative        authorities           in   exercise      of    their

      powers. It was further held that such recording of

      reasons is required as "the Court cannot exercise

      their duty of review unless they are advised of the

<p id="p_87">

</p><p id="p_88">51.    Summarizing the above discussion, this Court holds:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      a. In   India the judicial trend has always been to

        record reasons, even in administrative decisions,

        if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      b. A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in

        support of its conclusions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      c. Insistence       on    recording         of     reasons     is   meant     to

        serve the wider principle of justice that justice

        must not only be done it must also appear to be

        done as well.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">      d. Recording       of    reasons          also    operates     as     a    valid

        restraint on any possible arbitrary exercise of

        judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative

        power.

<p id="p_89">e. Reasons        reassure          that      discretion             has    been

  exercised        by     the       decision       maker        on     relevant

  grounds          and         by        disregarding                extraneous

  considerations.
</p>
<p id="p_90">f. Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a

  component        of     a      decision          making       process       as

  observing        principles            of      natural        justice       by

  judicial,             quasi-judicial               and           even       by

  administrative bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_91">g. Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review

  by superior Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_92">h. The    ongoing        judicial        trend       in      all     countries

  committed        to     rule      of     law      and      constitutional

  governance        is    in     favour       of     reasoned         decisions

  based    on     relevant       facts.       This      is    virtually      the

  life blood of judicial decision making justifying

  the principle that reason is the soul of justice.

i. Judicial       or    even     quasi-judicial              opinions       these

  days     can     be    as     different          as     the      judges    and

  authorities who deliver them. All these decisions

  serve one common purpose which is to demonstrate

  by     reason    that       the    relevant        factors         have   been

  objectively          considered.         This      is      important       for




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    26</span>
  sustaining     the    litigants'          faith   in    the    justice

  delivery system.
</p>
<p id="p_93">j. Insistence    on    reason     is    a    requirement        for   both

  judicial accountability and transparency.

k. If a Judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not

  candid    enough      about         his/her       decision      making

  process then it is impossible to know whether the

  person   deciding     is   faithful         to    the   doctrine     of

  precedent or to principles of incrementalism.

l. Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent,

  clear    and   succinct.        A    pretence      of   reasons      or

  `rubber-stamp reasons' is not to be equated with a

  valid decision making process.
</p>
<p id="p_94">m. It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine

  qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial powers.

  Transparency in decision making not only makes the

  judges and decision makers less prone to errors

  but also makes them subject to broader scrutiny.

  (See David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor

  (1987) 100 Harward Law Review 731-737).

n. Since the requirement to record reasons emanates

  from the broad doctrine of fairness in decision

  making, the said requirement is now virtually a

  component of human rights and was considered part

        Oxford,    2001     EWCA    Civ       405,    wherein     the    Court

        referred to <a href="/doc/19636/" id="a_48">Article 6</a> of European Convention of

        Human     Rights       which      requires,       "adequate       and

        intelligent       reasons      must    be    given   for   judicial

        decisions".
</p>
<p id="p_95">      o. In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a

        vital     role    in   setting        up     precedents    for    the

        future.          Therefore,      for       development     of     law,

        requirement of giving reasons for the decision is

        of the essence and is virtually a part of "Due

        Process".

      the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission

      of the observations made above. Since some time has

      Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in its order

      dated 4th April 2008 has given some reasons in its

      finding. The reasons, inter alia, are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">           "We have gone through the orders of the
           District Forum and the State Commission,
           perused the record placed before us and
           heard the parties at length. The State
           Commission has rightly confirmed the order
           of the District Forum after coming to the
           conclusion that the Petitioner and the
           Builder - Respondents No.3 and 4 have
           colluded   with   each  other   and  hence,
           directed them to compensate the complainant
           for the harassment caused to them."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_100">54.   From the order of the State Commission dated 26.7.07

      in connection with the appeal filed by the Bank, we

      do   not     find       that      the     State     Commission         has

      independently considered Bank's appeal. The State

      Commission       dismissed      the      Bank's    appeal       for    the

      reasons     given       in     its      order     dated     6.7.07      in

      connection with the appeal of the builders.



</p><p id="p_101">55.   This Court is of the view that since the Bank has

      filed a separate appeal, it has a right to be heard

      independently in support of its appeal. That right

      has been denied by the State Commission. In that

      view of the matter, this Court quashes the order
