HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJAY KISHAN KAUL
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANMOHAN SINGH
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER

MANMOHAN SINGH, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1.         By way of order dated 30th March, 2012 passed in CS(OS)
No.1446/2011, three questions were referred by me alongwith my opinion to
the larger Bench of this Court for consideration. Thereafter, the matter was
listed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice who was pleased to constitute a full
Bench comprising three Judges of this Court. The questions of law which
form the subject matter of the reference read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (1)      Whether the suit for infringement of registered design is
              maintainable against the another registered proprietor of the
              design under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_1">Designs Act</a>, 2000;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (2)      Whether there can be availability of remedy of passing off in
              the absence of express saving or preservation of common law of
              <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_2">Designs Act</a>, 2000 and more so when the rights and remedies
              under the Act are statutory in nature; and
     (3)      Whether the conception of passing off as available under the
              trademarks can be joined with the action under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_3">Designs Act</a>
              when the same are mutually inconsistent with that of remedy
              under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_4">Designs Act</a>.
</blockquote><p id="p_2">2.         I have had the advantage of going through the opinion recorded by my
learned brother, Mr. Rajiv Shakdher J. but despite the great respect which I
have for his learning and erudition, I find myself unable to agree with the



CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.2 of 94
 view taken by him. Therefore, I have decided to give my own opinion in a
separate judgment which is discussed below.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     Heard the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties
and also considered the legal position including the scheme of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_5">Design
Act</a>, 2000 and the statement of objects and reasons of the Act. Additionally,
the learned counsels appearing in the matter have also argued on several
other aspects as additional points, which I shall be answering separately
under the relevant heads of the answers to the reference.
Re: Answer to Question 1
</p><p id="p_4">4.     I am of the view that the question is not merely about the scheme of
the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_6">Design Act</a> being unlike the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_7">Patent Act</a>. The question is also not that
whether the registration is prima facie evidence of validity. The question
under reference rather invites the construction of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_8">Section 22</a> of the Design
Act, 2000 so as to discern whether it permits a suit for infringement of
Design by a registered proprietor against the another registered proprietor.
The connected question which is required to be answered is more of the
nature and characteristic of the monopoly right which is purely conferred by
the Statute (which only upon the grant of the certificate provides some
valuable rights including the right to sue for infringement) and under these
circumstances, whether the registered proprietor of the Design can proceed
to sue against another registered proprietor who is enjoying the same
privilege by virtue of registration? In my opinion, the answers of both the
questions are in negative considering the language of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_9">Section 22</a> of the
Design Act in which the said Section has been couched and also considering
the scheme of the Act.

</p><p id="p_6"> 5.     For the purposes of doing this analysis, it is deemed expedient to first
have a look at <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_10">Section 22</a> and <a href="/doc/1725358/" id="a_11">Section 11</a> of the Designs Act, 2000 minutely.
The said Sections read as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "Sec 22. Piracy of registered design. - (1) During the existence of
       copyright in any design, it shall not be lawful for any person-

               thereof, except with the licence or written consent of the
               registered proprietor, or to do anything with a view to enable
               the design to be so applied; or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">        (b)    if the proprietor elects to bring a suit for the recovery of
               damages for any such contravention, and for an injunction
               against the repetition thereof, to pay such damages as may
               be awarded and to be restrained by injunction accordingly:
       Provided that the total sum recoverable in respect of any one
       design under clause (a) shall not exceed fifty thousand rupees:

        Provided further that no suit or any other proceeding for relief
       under this sub- section shall be instituted in any court below the
       court of District Judge.
</p><p id="p_8">       (3) In any suit or any other proceeding for relief under sub- section
       (2), every ground on which the registration of a design may be

       defence.
</p><p id="p_9">       (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the second proviso to
       sub- section (2), where any ground on which the registration of a
       design may be cancelled under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_13">section 19</a> has been availed of as a
       ground of defence and sub- section (3) in any suit or other
       proceeding for relief under sub- section (2), the suit or such other
       proceeding shall be transferred by the court, in which the suit or
       such other proceeding is pending, to the High Court for decision.
       (5) When the court makes a decree in a suit under sub-section (2),
       it shall send a copy of the decree to the Controller, who shall cause
       an entry thereof to be made in the register of designs.

       prescribed fee, extend the period of copyright for a second period
       of five years from the expiration of the original period of ten
       years."
</p><p id="p_11">6.     Upon the conjoint reading of aforementioned Sections, it is manifest
that <a href="/doc/958493/" id="a_15">Section 22(1)</a> provides the rights conferred by the Design Copyright as
mentioned in <a href="/doc/1725358/" id="a_16">Section 11</a> of the Designs Act. <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_17">Section 22</a> (2) provides for the
consequences in case any person acts in contravention to sub-section (1) of
<a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_18">Section 22</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_12">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                        Page No.5 of 94
</p><p id="p_13"> 7.       The Scheme of the <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_19">Section 22</a> (1) itself reveals that the rights which
are conferred upon the design right holder are not to be exercised by "any
person" other than a registered proprietor are provided under <a href="/doc/958493/" id="a_20">Section 22(1)</a>
of the Act and it shall not be lawful such person to apply the said designs
else the consequences for contravention as provided under <a href="/doc/1190122/" id="a_21">Section 22(2)</a> of
the Act shall follow. This construction of the wordings "any person" can be
deduced by the careful reading of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_22">Section 22</a> and the reasons for non
inclusion of the registered proprietor within its ambit are enumerated as
under:
</p><p id="p_14">i)    Firstly, the language of the <a href="/doc/958493/" id="a_23">Section 22(1)</a> is such which begins with the
      opening words "during the existence of copyright in any design", it
      shall not lawful for any person to do the acts without the consent of the
      registered proprietor. The said <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_24">Section 22</a> (1) by virtue of its very
      language presupposes two participants one being the registered
      proprietor and another being any person for whom, it shall not be
      lawful to do the acts as defined in sub-<a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_25">section 22</a> (1) is such "any
      person" without the consent of the registered proprietor. The language
      employed under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_26">Section 22</a> (1) nowhere permits a registered proprietor
      of the subsequent design to fit into ambit of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_27">Section 22</a> (1). The said
      "any person" has to be person other than the registered proprietor for
      whom, the said acts are unlawful without the consent of the registered
      proprietor. The person who is the registered proprietor himself cannot
      do unlawful act for applying the design and for whom the consent of
      the another registered proprietor is not the sine qua non as his
      entitlement stands at par with the first registered proprietor. Therefore,
      "any person" as stated in the <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_28">Section 22</a> (1) has to be a person other
      than a registered proprietor. Any other view, would be doing injustice
      to the express wordings of the statute.
</p><p id="p_15">ii)   Subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_29">Section 22</a> has an immediate nexus with sub section
      (1), if the said any person does not fit within the purview of subsection
      (1), it cannot be said that the said "any person" shall contravene the
      provisions of sub-section (1), which would entitle him to the
      consequences provided under sub-section (2). All this would mean that
      once a registered proprietor of the design not fall within the purview of

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.6 of 94
        "any person", then it is inconceivable as to how he is found to violating
       the provisions of sub-section (1).
</p><p id="p_16">iii)   Here, the opportunity comes to analyze <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_30">Section 22(3)</a> also as it is
       generally understood that the courts are empowered to examine the
       correctness of the design certificate in an infringement proceedings.
       Let me therefore also have a look at <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_31">Section 22(3)</a> which reads as
       under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           "<a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_32">Section 22</a> (3) In any suit or any other proceeding for relief
           under sub- section (2), every ground on which the registration
           of a design may be cancelled under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_33">section 19</a> shall be available
           as a ground of defence."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">           A careful reading of sub section (3) would reveal that the
           opening words of the section provide for the conditions for the
           applicability of the said sub section (3), the said conditions are
           in any suit or proceeding for relief under sub section (2), thus
           for the applicability of the sub section (3), the suit or the
           proceeding must relate to one contained under sub section (2)
           relating to contravention. It passes human comprehension as to
           when the registered proprietor does not fall within in the ambit
           of sub section (1), not found violating the sub section (1) under
           subsection (2), then how the provisions of sub section (3) are
           applicable in a case where there is one registered proprietor is
           suing another registered proprietor. If the infringement action
           itself is not maintainable as per the provisions contained in
           <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_34">section 22</a> (1) and 22(2), where lies the opportunity to consider
           the invalidity of the registration of the said registered proprietor
           as the defendant under the provisions of sub section (3) of
           <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_35">Section 22</a>.
</blockquote><p id="p_17">iv)    The court in such a case if proceeds to invalidate the said registered
       design right of the defendant by invoking <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_36">Section 22</a> (3) would have
       to presuppose that there exists any such legal right to sue against the
       registered right holder when there exists none in law. Thus, <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_37">Section 22</a>
       (3) cannot be given interpretation wider in amplitude to operate in a
       field for which it is not even enacted. By doing this would mean,
       judicial legislation of the enactment, which is impermissible in law.
</p>


<p id="p_18">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                        Page No.7 of 94
</p><p id="p_19"> v)     The question is not the suit is based on the uniqueness or newness of
       the design but the legal right to sue. If the suit is entertained for
       infringement against another registered proprietor, the court has to
       presuppose that there is any right in common law which entitles the
       court to conduct such enquiry as to invalidity of the registered design
       of the Defendant, when the language employed in the section no
       where permits a registered proprietor to be included within the ambit
       of the words "any person". Such presupposing of the right in common
       law as if both the parties are before the court to prove the novelty and
       originality and whosoever succeeds in the same shall entitle for
       monopoly rights conferred by the statute no where exists. The creation
       of the said right to test the validity of the registered design of the
       Defendant in common law would be contrary to the nature and
       characteristic of Design right which is purely a monopoly conferred
       by statute and was never protected in common law which is akin to
       patent.
</p>
<p id="p_20">vi)    The occasion to test prima facie validity of the defendant's design
       arises only when the right to sue exists at the first place as per <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_38">Section
       22</a> (1) and (2). In the absence of the said right created by the special
       statute, no a priori assumption of invalidity can be drawn and enquiry
       as to invalidity of the said design registration by the civil court shall
       be a jurisdictional error as <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_39">Section 22</a> no where permits the same.
</p>
<p id="p_21">vii)   From the afore narrated pointers, it can be safely said that neither the
       plain reading of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_40">section 22</a> suggests that the registered proprietor can
       be subsumed within the meaning of "any person" nor the nature of
       monopoly permit any additional right to sue enabling the court to
       conduct the exercise of forming a prima facie opinion as to invalidity
       of the another registered proprietor's design as defendant. Under these
       circumstances, it is doubtful as to how the suit for infringement can be
       maintained against another registered proprietor.
</p>
<p id="p_22">       Let me now evaluate the submissions of the learned counsels for the
plaintiff.   Much emphasis has been laid by the learned counsel for the
plaintiffs that the use of the expression "any person" under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_41">Section 22</a> of the
Designs Act would tend to include a registered proprietor especially when

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                       Page No.8 of 94
 the continuing words "other than the registered proprietor" are missing. This
argument is sought to be fortified by the argument that the courts are
empowered to test the validity of the registered design in the infringement
proceedings as per <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_42">Section 22</a> (3) and therefore it is sought to be argued that
the term "any person" cannot be given a narrow construction but should
necessarily include the registered proprietor considering that the design
registration nowhere involves examination process and limiting the scope of
court's interference would, in fact, undermine the monopoly rights.
</p><p id="p_23">8.     The answer to the said argument lies in the opening words of the
<a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_43">Section 22</a> clearly begin with "During the existence of copyright in any
design it shall not be lawful for any person..." The contextual reading of
the said wordings would immediately make it clear that the said section
contemplates two kinds of persons; one having a registered design and
possessing rights of copyright as per <a href="/doc/1725358/" id="a_44">Section 11</a> who is termed as
"registered proprietor" and the other is "any person" who has been
distinguished from the registered proprietor by naming it as "any person".
This is inbuilt in <a href="/doc/958493/" id="a_45">Section 22(1)</a> wherein two different connotations exist
which are "registered proprietor" and "any person".
</p><p id="p_24">9.     Once the said <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_46">Section 22</a> is read completely and meaningfully, it can
therefore be easily said that <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_47">Section 22</a> presupposes one person being
"registered proprietor" and another person being "any person" with whom
there lies no monopoly and the opening words of the section are themselves
suggestive of the fact when they begin with the wordings "During the
existence of copyright in any design....." and thereafter proceeds to use the
expressions "registered proprietor" and "any person" within the same section
itself. Being conferred with the statutory privilege, registered proprietor

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.9 of 94
 who stands at par with another registered proprietor is not contemplated to
fit in to the provisions of <a href="/doc/958493/" id="a_48">Section 22(1)</a> as both are conferred with the
copyright as per <a href="/doc/1725358/" id="a_49">Section 11</a> rightly or wrongly under the provisions of
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_50">Designs Act</a> under <a href="/doc/1725358/" id="a_51">Section 11</a> and therefore, it cannot be said that it shall be
unlawful for such registered proprietor as he possesses independent right
which stands at par with the registered proprietor. Therefore, the expression
"any person" in whatsoever terms it may be read either contextually or
plainly, it cannot be said that "any person" may include a person who has
been conferred with monopoly rights for whom it shall be unlawful to use
the design.
</p><p id="p_25">10.    The contention that the courts are empowered to test the validity of
the design in infringement proceedings should support the argument that the
suit against the registered proprietor should be maintained is equally
unmeritorious. This argument is also fundamentally flawed as the civil court
is vested with the power to test the validity of plaintiff's patent when the
defendant takes grounds of revocation as a matter of defense in a suit or
proceedings under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_52">Section 22</a>. Thus, the courts have
limited power to cancellation to test the validity in an infringement
proceedings under sub-section (2) of the <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_53">Section 22</a> of Design Act when the
grounds of invalidity is taken as a ground of defence and not otherwise. The
said powers of the civil court cannot stand at par with the cancellation court
as the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_54">Design Act</a> is a special act and is a self-contained code.
</p><p id="p_26">11.    <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_55">Section 22(3)</a> clearly fortifies the said view. The same is reproduced
below:-
</p><p id="p_27">       "22(3) In any suit or any other proceeding for relief under sub-
       section (2), every ground on which the registration of a design may

        be cancelled under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_56">section 19</a> shall be available as a ground of
       defence."
</p><p id="p_28">       The reading of said section reveals that there is a suit for infringement
where the grounds of invalidity are taken as a ground of defence. The said
section nowhere empowers the court to entertain a suit against the registered
proprietor wherein the plaintiff pleads cancellation in the plaint itself against
the defendant's registration. Doing the same would mean extending the
scope of the <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_57">Section 22</a> and assuming the powers of cancellation court and
making the provisions of cancellation proceedings as provided under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_58">Section
19</a> as otiose. Therefore, the powers of civil court under <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_59">Section 22(3)</a> to test
the validity of the design is limited to the extent the same is available as a
ground of defense and not otherwise.
</p><p id="p_29">12.    It is well settled that the Courts are not allowed to extend or limit the
scope of Section and should read the Section as it is.
</p><p id="p_30">13.    It is equally well settled principle of law that when the power is given
by the statute to the court or authority to be performed in a particular
manner, the said power has to be performed in that particular manner to the
exclusion of the other modes which are implicitly forbidden. Kindly see the
judgment passed by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/407511/" id="a_60">State of UP vs.
Singhara Singh</a>, 1964 SCR (4) 485 wherein the Supreme Court approved
the rule laid down in Taylor v. Taylor and has held as under: "The rule
adopted in Taylor v. Taylor (3) is well recognised and is founded on sound
principle. Its result is (1) I.L.R. [1960] 2 All. 488. (2) L.R. 63 IA. 372. (3)
[1875] 1 Ch. D. 426, 431 that if a statute has conferred a power to do an act
and has laid down the method in which that power has to be exercised, it
necessarily prohibits the doing of the act in any other manner than that

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                       Page No.11 of 94
 which has been prescribed. The principle behind the rule is that if this
were not so, the statutory provision might as well not have been enacted.
A magistrate, therefore, cannot in the course of investigation record a
confession except in the manner laid down in <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_61">Section 164</a>. The power to
record the confession had obviously been given so that the confession
might be proved by the record of it made in the manner laid down. If
proof of the confession by other means was permissible, the whole
provision of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_62">Section 164</a> including the safeguards contained in it for the
protection of accused persons would be rendered nugatory. The section,
therefore, by conferring on magistrates the power to record statements
or confessions, by necessary implication, prohibited a magistrate from
giving oral evidence of the statements or confessions made to him.
(Emphasis Supplied)
</p><p id="p_31">14.    Therefore, the power to test the validity of registered design is
confined to examining the validity of the design in an infringement
proceedings when the grounds of invalidity are taken as a matter of defence,
it is inconceivable as to how the court would proceed to examine the validity
of design when the infringement action is not maintainable at the first place
as the registered proprietor will not fall within the ambit of "any person" and
therefore the argument that the civil courts are empowered to test the
validity of design in generality is incorrect and cannot come in the aid for
laying down the proposition that the suit against the registered proprietor is
maintainable when no such power exists.

of Design. The provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_64">Designs Act</a>, 2000 are self
contained code. The said provisions clearly provide the rights and remedies

different kinds of remedies for distinct eventualities arising from time to
time. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_66">The Act</a> provides for conditions of registrability of the design as per

the Act. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_71">The Act</a> also provides remedies for infringement of the registered
design, wherein the law permits the defendant to take the ground of
invalidity of the registration as a defence. The said rights, remedies and
challenges are prescribed by the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_72">Designs Act</a> at the relevant stages under the
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_73">Designs Act</a>. The scope of the said challenges cannot be extended by
conferment of power of one authority to another by judicial legislation. The
same would amount to unnecessarily enlarging the scope of the provisions of
special act which is <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_74">Designs Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_33">16.    If the power of the civil court to entertain the challenge as to validity
of the registered Design is confined to be taken as a matter of defence in the

power to the court to entertain the suit against the registered proprietor to
test the validity of the defendant's design. All this would mean that the civil
court seized of the infringement suit would be empowered to grant the
prayers of cancellation of the design as well as infringement of design which
will virtually convert suit court in to cancellation court in all senses.

the suit court is otherwise not the cancellation court for all other purposes.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "35. The Court while interpreting the provision of a statute,
       although, is not entitled to rewrite the statute itself, is not
       debarred from "ironing out the creases". The court should

       same in such a manner which would make it workable.

</blockquote><p id="p_37">20.   Applying the aforesaid principle of law to the instant case, if the view
that the Civil Court is entitled to test the validity of the registered design in

shall render <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_77">Section 19</a> of the Designs Act otiose or redundant as no one will
approach cancellation court and would prefer to file a suit for infringement
of Design along with the cancellation. Thus, the provisions of <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_78">Section 19</a>
shall be reduced to dead letters in such circumstances. Therefore, it is
appropriate to confine sub-section (3) of the <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_79">Section 22</a> within the bounds to
the extent it permits the challenge as to validity of the design in an

plaintiff and interveners that Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
permits every kinds of the suits unless there are expressly or implicitly
barred and thus, this court should accept the plea raised by the plaintiffs. I
find that the said plea is devoid of any merit. This is due to the reason after
fair reading of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_80">Design Act</a>, 2000, it is seems impermissible to the court to
entertain action against the registered proprietor as <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_81">Section 22</a> (3) provides
limited power to test the validity of the Design in the suit for infringement
where the ground of invalidity is raised as defence and not otherwise.
</p><p id="p_40">22.   This is also clear from the view which was taken by the learned single
judge of this court under the old Act which is <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_82">Designs Act</a>, 1911 when the
powers to hear cancellation as well as the suit used to vested in the High
Court itself. In those times too, the situation like both the parties were
registered proprietor arose and in the case of Western Engineering
Company Vs. America Lock Company, ILR 1973 Delhi 177 the learned
Single Judge Justice D. Kapur observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "As regards the third case, namely, the suit for injunction and
       damages brought by M/s. Western Engineering Company
       against M/s. America Lock Company, which is based on
       infringement of the registered design of the former, it is
       necessary to say that the result of that suit is largely dependent
       on the conclusions I reach on the two revocation applications
       before me. At present both parties have registered designs
       and the question of infringement does not arise. If both
       designs are revoked, then the suit will fail, but if the design
       of M/s. America Lock Company is revoked and that M/s.</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">       Western Engineering Company is maintained, then the suit
       will be maintainable. Hence, the decision in the suit

</p><p id="p_42"> 23.    It is altogether different matter that the learned Single Judge then
proceeded to decide the cancellation as empowered by the old Act 1911
under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_83">Section 51A</a> wherein High Court could entertain the cancellation
proceedings. But after the amendment and enactment of 2000 Act, as per the
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_84">Design Act</a>, 2000, the powers to hear cancellation vests before the Controller
General of Designs and the High Court powers are in a away divested to
hear cancellation petition except to the extent of hearing the challenges to
the validity as a defence to the infringement proceeds. The rest of the powers
to entertain cancellation are taken away by the Act of 2000. Once, the said
powers are divested from this court by way of amendments carried out in
2000 and the controller is exclusively invested with such powers, it would be
unwise to assume that the similar powers subsists with the civil court when
the civil court has been retained with limited power to examine the validity
in the cases where infringement suit is maintainable at the first place.
</p><p id="p_43">       In the case of East India Corporation Ltd. Vs. Shree Meenakshi
Mills Ltd., 1991 SCR (2) 310, the Supreme Court observed that the when
there exists an act which empowers the specialized tribunal to do the act and
entertain a remedy and the Act is self contained code on the conferment of
its remedies and rights, then the civil court jurisdiction to entertain the suit
though not expressly barred but to the extent the jurisdiction is vested with
the specialized tribunal can be implicitly barred if the Act is clear about the
remedies provided under it and entrust the same to the tribunals. In the
words of the Supreme Court, it was observed thus:

        are a self-contained code, regulating the relationship of parties,
       creating special rights and liabilities, and, providing for
       determination of such rights and liabilities by tribunals
       constituted under the statute and whose orders are endowed
       with finality. The remedies provided by the statute in such
       matters are adequate and complete. Although the statute
       contains no express bar of jurisdiction of the civil Court,
       except for eviction of tenants in execution or otherwise, the
       provisions of the statute are clear and complete in regard to
       the finality of the orders passed by the special tribunals set
       up under it, and their competence to administer the same
       remedy as the civil Courts render in civil suits. Such
       tribunals having been so constituted as to act in conformity
       with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure, the
       clear and explicit intendment of the Legislature is that all
       questions relating to the special rights and liabilities created
       by the statute should be decided by the tribunals constituted
       under it. Although the jurisdiction of the civil Court is not
       expressly barred, the provisions of the statute explicitly
       show that, subject to the extraordinary powers of the High
       Court and this Court, such jurisdiction is impliedly barred,

       statute."                       (Emphasis Supplied)

vests with controller of designs which is a specialized tribunal as per
<a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_87">Section 19</a> except to the extent it is permissible for the civil court to
entertain invalidity under the provision of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_88">Section 22</a> (3) in an
infringement proceedings. Therefore, the action against the registered
proprietor who does not fit within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_89">Section 22</a> (1) and 22(2)
is clearly implicitly barred as the same is power vested in the specialized

</p><p id="p_46"> 25.    The contention has also been raised by the learned counsel for the
parties that the entry made by the design office in the form of issuance of the
Design certificate is merely a formal entry and is only a prima facie proof of
the validity. Therefore, the said certificate does not attach the presumption as
to validity. As such, the courts once faced with an infringement action can
draw an inference as to invalidity and proceed with the infringement action
on the basis of the invalidity of the said registered design. I find that the said
contention is without any substance. The reason is simple which is that when
the courts are conferred with a limited power to test the validity of the
design only within the bounds of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_91">Section 22</a> (3) and not otherwise. Then,
where lies the occasion for the civil court to draw such inference. The
question of drawing an inference as to invalidity would arise only once the
statute permits such remedy to maintainable at the first place.
</p><p id="p_47">26.    The aspect that there exists a statutory indicator that the entry made in
Design register is merely a formal entry or is subject to rebuttable
presumption does not mean that the rights and remedies prescribed under the
statute can be interchanged and vested in the courts when they are conferred
to the specialized tribunal. The prima facie proof of the registration and
rebuttable presumption is only suggestive of the fact that where in a legally
permissible remedy, there arises an occasion to test the validity, then merely
furnishing of the certificate would not suffice if there exists an evidence to
invalidate the registration to the contrary. In the case of the present nature,
the remedy itself is not provided under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_92">Section 22</a> (1) and (2) as the
registered proprietor on true and plain construction of the provision does not
fit within the ambit of the any person, thus, there is no reason to draw any
such inferences at the place where there lies no remedy.

Jain (supra) and Servewell (supra) and all other judgments rendered by this
court putting reliance upon the said views to the extent they take contrary
view that suit for infringement of registered design is maintainable by one
registered proprietor against another are not good law. The answer to the
reference of question (1) is done in negative.
</p><p id="p_58">       In end of the answer to the question No. 1, I would also like to address
one more argument which has been raised by the counsel for the parties in
order to support the view that this court should permit the suit by the one
registered proprietor against another which is that the Design registrations
are subjected to low level of the scrutiny before the Designs office and the
said designs are granted quite easily by the Designs office. Therefore, this
court's ruling that the suit for infringement would not be maintainable
against the registered proprietor would affect the registered proprietors
adversely as the Designs are actually and in reality tested in the court of law.
Thus, this court should take the view that the suit for infringement is
maintainable against the another registered proprietor. I have considered the
said contention and find that the said argument does not preclude the court to
interpret the law as it stands in the Act and also cannot permit the court to
enlarge the scope of the provisions of the Act which is the domain of the
legislature.
</p><p id="p_59">29.   If in reality anything better could be done by the court in order to
improvise the situation so that the designs certificates are not issued easily is

 to request the legislature to amend the law relating to designs wherein the
strict examination process and procedure may be prescribed so that only the
designs which are novel and original should be granted the registration. This
court can also request the controller of the Design to decide the cancellations
of the Designs expeditiously so that the right to sue for infringement gets
revived at the earliest. But what the court cannot do is to assume the powers
under the Act which the plain and simple reading of the section under the
Act does not permit. Therefore, the said argument of the learned counsel for
the parties howsoever compassionate it seems to be cannot be acceded in
view of the clear and plain language of the Act and scheme provided by the

</p><p id="p_60">Answers to Questions (2) and (3)
</p><p id="p_61">30.    I find that the question No. 2 and 3 under the reference are connected
to each other and the answer of the one would have the bearing on the
answer of another. Therefore, I have taken two questions together and
proceeded to answer the same.
</p><p id="p_62">31.    Before beginning I would again say that the question under reference
is not as to whether the definitions of two Acts both <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_96">Trade Marks Act</a> and
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_97">Design Act</a> provide for the shape of the Article as a subject matter of
protection, indeed, they permit so and there is a kind of overlap. The key
answer to the said question under reference is also not that solely because
there is a reference of a kind of dual protection in the field of Design law
and Trade Mark Law so far as shape of the articles are concerned in the
authorities emanating from US and some in UK, the same should be
followed as such in Indian law overlooking the avowed object and scheme
of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_98">Designs Act</a>, 2000. For answering the said question Nos.2 and 3 under

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.21 of 94
 the reference, there are some connected questions which are required to be
answered which will enable this court to answer the reference. The said
questions are; what is true nature of action which is based on passing off
right and the Design right?; Whether the said action of passing off is
available as remedy in the absence of any saving or preservation of the
common law right under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_99">Design Act</a>?; Whether the objects and the
legislative intent of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_100">Designs Act</a> in India which are aimed at protection for
limited period with no further extension permit any such extension of the
monopoly rights in perpetuity by adopting the route of passing off thereby
protecting the same very shape of article which was or is the subject matter
of protection under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_101">Design Act</a>? Whether the right available in the trade
marks can be joined with the Design right which is mutually inconsistent
with each other? I propose to answer the said very questions arising in the
instant reference under the larger head of the question Nos. 2 and 3.
Nature and characteristic of Design Right
</p><p id="p_63">32.    As I have mentioned above that for the purposes of answering the
question (2), one has to address several connected questions. First and
foremost enquiry amongst the same is the true nature and characteristic of
the Design Right. The Design right is a limited monopoly right conferred by
a statute for an industrial article which has been used for commerce. The
said right has been created by the framers of the law by enacting a separate
enactment with a explicit intent that the articles containing the novel shapes
and designs which are put into commerce but though also aesthetic in nature
enjoy lesser monopoly than the ordinary Copyright. The Design right being
purely an statutory right has its genesis in patents and is equated with a
patent rights, however due to the aesthetic and ornamental features which

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.22 of 94
 designable subject matter bears, the said right is called as Copyright in the
Design. The said Design right is akin to patent right which has been seen
below which becomes a basis to understand why the extension of monopoly
over the designable subject matter is detrimental to the public policy and
also against the underlying object of the Act.
</p><p id="p_64">33.    The proposition that the Design right is purely a statutory right created
by a parliament and was never protected under the common law is clear
from the reading of the excerpts from the Narayanan on Copyright wherein
in his Book titled as Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs, the learned
author has observed about the nature of remedy of design in the following
words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">       "27.03 Nature of protection to industrial designs - The
       protection given for an industrial design under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_102">Designs
       Act</a> is not copyright protection but a true monopoly based on
       statute. Designs as such were never protected by the common
       law which was basically concerned with the protection of
       literary copyright. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_103">The Designs Act</a>, unlike the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_104">Copyright Act</a>,
       gives monopoly protection in the strict sense of the word
       rather than mere protection against copying as under the
       <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_105">Copyright Act</a>."                (Emphasis Supplied)


</blockquote><p id="p_65">34.    From the mere reading of the aforementioned excerpts from the
Narayanan, it can be seen that the Design right is a right stemming from the
true word of statute. The said right was never protected by the common law.
The said Design right protection is right to exclude others just like in patent
act rather than protection against the right to copy. This difference in the
law conferring right to exclude others and the law protecting the right to



CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.23 of 94
 copy has to be necessarily understood in order to better discern the policy
underlying the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_106">Design Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_66">35.    <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_107">The Design Act</a> is thus a privilege granted by a sovereign by way
design registration upon the declaration of the novel and original shape to
the design office by the proprietor for the limited period of maximum 15
years wherein the proprietor can exclude others from applying the design
upon the article which forms the subject matter of registration. It is therefore
the right which is equal to patent and unlike the trade mark and copyright
which protects the consumer interests by preventing the copying. One of the
consequences of the expiration of the Design right is that upon expiry, the
shape of the article goes in to public domain so that the shape of the article
may be used by others freely in order to further encourage the development
in the field of shape and arts.
</p><p id="p_67">36.    Laddie, Prescott &amp; Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright
and Designs, Fourth Edition, Vol-II, Lexis Nexis also provides for the
legislative history of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_108">Designs Act</a> in UK which also supports the same view
that the monopoly conferred by <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_109">Designs Act</a> is purely statutory in nature
which is akin to patents. In the words of Author, it has been observed thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "51.4 A registered design is a statutory monopoly of up to 25
       years duration, which is intended to give protection to the
       appearance, but not the function, of the whole or part of a
       product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines,
       contours, colours, shape, texture and / or materials of the
       product and/ or its ornamentation......."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "51.6 A proprietor of a registered design and certain licenses
       can bring proceedings for infringement against any third
       party who uses the design or any design which does not
       produce a different overall impression on the informed user.</blockquote>
<p id="p_68">       This applies to designs registered before the amendment of the

          RDA 1949 ( Registered Designs Act) by the 2001 Regulations
         as well as to designs applied for is that the latter can be
         enforced against a third party who has not copied the
         proprietor‟s design. It is a true monopoly which is similar in
         many respects to a patent monopoly." (Emphasis Supplied)
</p><p id="p_69">37.      The legislative history of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_110">Design Act</a> in India also makes it
abundantly clear that the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_111">Design Act</a> has always been considered as a
monopoly closer to the patent though the rights granted under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_112">Design
Act</a> is called as "Copyright". However, the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_113">Designs Act</a> was always the part
of <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_114">Patents Act</a> earlier. The said design right is considered as privilege of the
sovereign just like patents. The tests for evaluating the novelty in patents as
well as the designs are same. The legislative history of Indian Design law
reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       The first legislation in India for protection of Industrial Designs was
         The Patents &amp; <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_115">Designs Protection Act</a>, 1872. It supplemented the
         1859 Act passed by Governor General of India for granting exclusive
         privileges to inventors and added protection for Industrial Design. The
         1872 Act included the term ―any new and original pattern or design,
         or the application of such pattern or design to any substance or article
         of manufacture.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">       The Inventions &amp; <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_116">Designs Act</a> of 1888 re-enacted the law relating to
         protection of inventions and designs and contained provision relating
         to Designs in a separate part.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">       The Patents &amp; <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_117">Designs Act</a> enacted in 1911 also provided for

        <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_118">The Patents Act</a>, 1970 repealed the provisions of the Patents and
        <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_119">Designs Act</a>, 1911, so far as they related to Patents. However, the
        provisions relating to Designs were not repealed and continued to
        govern the Designs Law.
</p>
<p id="p_71">       India joined the WTO as a ―member State in 1995. Consequently,
        the Patents &amp; <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_120">Designs Act</a>, 1911 was repealed and the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_121">Designs Act</a>,
        2000 was enacted, to make the Designs Law in India TRIPS
        compliant. The definition of "design" in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_122">Designs Act</a>, 2000 is
        more or less the same as that of the 1911 Act. Novelty under the 1911
        Act was determined with reference to India, whereas under the
        <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_123">Designs Act</a>, 2000 novelty is determined on a global basis.
</p><p id="p_72">38.     The legislative policy behind the Patent and <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_124">Designs Act</a> being
statutory in nature is that by applying for a Patent and Design to the Patent
Office and Designs Office respectively and disclosing the embodiment or
shape of the article to the office, exclusive monopoly in the form of statutory
rights of 15 years is conferred with the corresponding right to the public at
large to freely use the said embodiment or the design after expiration of
Patent and Design. That is why, the said monopoly rights are for a limited
period of time and being statutory in nature can never be extended by
placing reliance on common law.
</p><p id="p_73">39.     In view of the aforementioned discussion so far made, it is clear that
there are authorities on the Design law, both in India as well as in UK from
where we have borrowed the Design law largely, provided that the Design
right is statutory right and was never protected in the common law. The
legislative history of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_125">Design Act</a> in India also supports the same view

 that the Designs are always considered as part of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_126">Patent Act</a> as the
underlying policy behind the two laws are the same which is limited rights to

<p id="p_74">Statement of Objects and Reasons of Designs Act and Purposive

</p><p id="p_75">40.    Now I shall proceed to also evaluate the statement and objects and
reasons of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_127">Design Act</a>, 2000 in order to understand the purpose and

</p><p id="p_76">41.    It is established rule of interpretation that the Statute is best
understood if we know the reasons for it. The said rule is a rule of purposive
construction of the Statute and whenever there is ambiguity in construing the
provisions of Act, the object behind the Act enlightens the court to interpret
the provisions of Act.         This has been laid down in the case of Utkal
Contractors &amp; Joinery (P) Vs. State of Orissa reported as (1987) 3 SCC
279, wherein the Hon'ble Justice Chinnappa Reddy (as he then was)

</p><p id="p_78"> 42.     In Reserve Bank of India Vs. Peerless General Finance reported as
(1987) 1 SCC 424, Hon'ble Justice Reddy again proceeded to take the same
view of purpose construction by propounding the rule of contextual
interpretation as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They
       are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is
       the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be
       ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which
       makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A
       statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted.
       With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole
       and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by
       phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the
       context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute maker,
       provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses,
       phrases and words may take colour and appear different than
       when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by
       the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a
       whole and discover what each section, each clause, each
       phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit
       into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no
       word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have
       to be construed so that every word has a place and everything
       is in its place. It is by looking at the definition as a whole in
       the setting of the entire Act and by reference to what preceded
       the enactment and the reasons for it that the Court construed
       the expression 'Prize Chit' in Srinivasa and we find no reason
       to depart from the Court's construction." [Emphasis supplied]

underlying purpose behind the enactment of law, state of the affairs existing

 unnecessary extension of time period. The said statement of objects and
reasons are clearly voicing the legislative policy for not to extend the
monopoly. The said object and purpose of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_135">Designs Act</a> is a clear
indicator to the effect that the statutory monopoly contained in the design is
akin to patent and cannot be protected under the common law.

the attempt has been made to extend the said limited monopoly right under
the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_137">Designs Act</a> by seeking a remedy under the Copyright statute. The
statement of object has been firstly considered by learned Single Judge of
this Court in the case of Microfibres Inc. Vs. Girdhar &amp; Co. &amp; Anr., 128
(2006) DLT 238 while answering the question as to whether the monopoly

switching over the rights to <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_139">Copyright Act</a>. By answering the question in
negative and applying <a href="/doc/1244586/" id="a_140">Section 15</a> which clearly debars the same, the learned
Single Judge observed thus:

        The proceedings from the Parliamentary Debate on the Bill
       were also referred to show that the concerned Minister of State
       had observed that the Act was being amended to 'provide help

       "Furthermore, the legislative intent is also to be kept in mind

</p><p id="p_99"> 53.    On the collective reading of the aforementioned provisions of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_180">Designs
Act</a>, it is beyond the cavil of any doubt that the monopoly conferred by the
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_181">Designs Act</a> is although termed as copyright in design but the said monopoly
is right in the limited period of time and is akin to patent and has trappings
of patent.    This is evident from the fact that Controller of Patents and
Designs remains the same. The High Court is also the same which is High
Court as defined in the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_182">Patents Act</a>, 1970. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_183">Patent Act</a>,
1970 are applicable to the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_184">Designs Act</a> as extended provisions. The Patent
Agent is deemed to be the agent practicing before the Designs Office. The
evidence certified by the Patents Office shall be admitted in the Court of
law. The provisions relating to cancellation of design is similar to that of the
patent. The tests relating to evaluation of novelty in Design is also the ones
relating to Patents. The said composite scheme of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_185">Designs Act</a>, 2000 clearly
leads to a conclusion that the design monopoly though named differently as
"copyright in design", but it has trappings of patent so far as the nature and
characteristic of the right is concerned. The said conclusion by fair reading
of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_186">Designs Act</a> being akin to patent is once read with the avowed objective
of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_187">Designs Act</a> wherein one of the objects is that to confer a limited
monopoly right which should not unnecessarily be extended makes it
crystal-clear that after the expiration of design right, the treatment of the said
monopoly conferred by the design right shall be the same as that of patents
which is that after expiration of design right, the same shall go to the public
domain as in the cases of patent and in case, the said monopoly is extended,
the same shall be contrary to the objects and scheme of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_188">Designs Act</a>.

 Nature of Passing off Remedy
</p><p id="p_101">54.    The remedy of passing off is available as a protection against the
commission of civil wrong or tortuous act which has been based on common
law principle that the no man is entitled to represent his goods or business on
the pretext that the said goods or business is of other person. Essentially, a
passing off is an action in deceit. The said action is available in common law
so that interests of the proprietors can be protected against the
misrepresentation.
</p><p id="p_102">55.    The ingredients as to maintainability of the action of passing off in
common       law     are    goodwill/reputation,   misrepresentation    and        the
consequential damage or likely damage to the goodwill arising out the
misrepresentation. The said passing off remedy has been expressly preserved
under <a href="/doc/562591/" id="a_189">Section 27</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_190">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999.
</p><p id="p_103">56.    The legislative intent behind preservation of the passing off remedy is
that though the Trade Mark Act provides several kinds of protections by way
registration of the trade marks. The rights in common law of the proprietors
should remain unaffected. This is due to the reason that the registration of
the trade marks is the statutory recognition of the rights pre-existing in
common law. The nature of rights under the common law is right to prevent
use. Thus, the basic reason behind preservation of the common law right was
that the trade marks are conventionally protected under the principles of
common law by way of use and the same has been followed from time to
time. The said practice of protection has been preserved in the form of
passing off action from where the trade mark rights had made their humble
beginning.
</p>


<p id="p_104">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                       Page No.36 of 94
</p><p id="p_105"> 57.    The trade mark rights as they were understood conventionally
included the word marks, labels, get ups, tickets etc. The problem has
however arisen when the definition of the Trade mark has been expanded to
include shape of the goods which is kind of unconventional trade mark. The
said definition has been expanded in view of the amendments carried out by
the Trade Mark Act, 1999. Going by the same, the shape of the product is
also given a status of the trade mark. The said concept of protection of
unconventional trade marks has brought in a question of overlapping of
protection under the regime of Intellectual property laws and the limits to
which such protection should be accorded to such rights.
</p><p id="p_106">58.    It has thus become but obvious that upon inclusion of the shape of the
goods under the definition of trade marks by way of amendments made in
the year 1999 to the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_191">Trade Marks Act</a> 1999, the said shape of the articles has
started enjoying the protection at par with the ordinary trade mark.
Therefore, going by the reading of <a href="/doc/562591/" id="a_192">Section 27</a> (2) of the Act, the passing off
action shall also be available as a right in common law for protection of
shape of the articles and there is no doubt about the same.
</p><p id="p_107">59.    The said right of common law for protection of shape of the articles
under the remedy of the passing off is to prevent from right to use or copy or
misrepresent which is quite inconsistent with the Design right which is right
to exclude others for a limited period of time.
</p><p id="p_108">60.    In view of the above discussion, it is clear the passing off is a right to
sue in common law to prevent misrepresentation is mutually inconsistent
and distinct from the purely statutory monopolies which are in the form of
privileges like patents and design which operate on the jurisprudence of
conferment limited statutory rights. Therefore, what can be deduced from

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                       Page No.37 of 94
 the present discussion that the rights in common law undermines and disturb
the basic thrust of the policy behind limited monopoly rights which is after
the expiration of the period, the said shapes of articles or embodiments
enjoying the monopoly shall go in public domain as the limited monopoly
rights extinguish or lapse. Therefore, the said limited monopoly rights or
privilege and common law rights jurisprudentially cannot co- exist as
complementary to each other, however, by saying so, it does not mean
that they cannot exist independent of each other.
</p><p id="p_109">61.    It is noteworthy to mention that no one is disputing the existence of
the passing off right qua the shape of the articles while answering the present
reference. The question which has been referred is whether the Design right
and the passing off right can be joined together or can co-exist when the
same are not saved by the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_193">Design Act</a>. It is thus essentially a question
relating to conflict between two statutes which are <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_194">Trade Marks Act</a> and
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_195">Designs Act</a> which are operating on the basis of two different legislative
policies which are militating against each other in which public interests are
involved. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_196">Both Designs Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_197">Trade Marks Act</a> have jurisprudentially
different nature of rights which are statutory and common law respectively.
Passing off right in cases involving the expired Design Right
</p><p id="p_110">62.    Learned counsel appearing for the parties have advanced the
arguments by taking the said question of co-existence of the passing off and
Design right to another level by urging that the passing off right should be
available to shape of the products in the cases where the Design rights have
been expired. Therefore, I am proceeding to evaluate the said proposition as
per the existing position in law.
</p>


<p id="p_111">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.38 of 94
</p><p id="p_112"> 63.    Now, given the avowed object of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_198">Designs Act</a> and the legislative
policy behind the Act of 2000, the question arises whether the amendments
made in the 1999 Act of Trade Marks which include the Shape of the goods
under the definition of the mark as per <a href="/doc/1437994/" id="a_199">Section 2(1)</a> (m) change the position
in the said policy and also whether the monopoly rights under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_200">Design Act</a>
can be extended on the availability of the remedy of the passing off by way
of amendments carried out under the Trade Mark Act which can lead to a
protection of the same subject matter doubly. The answer to the said
questions is in negative. This is due to the following reasons:
I.     The amendments carried out in Trade Mark Act were done in the year
       1999 though the Act were notified in the year 2003. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_201">The Design Act</a>
       was drafted in the year 2000. The said <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_202">Design Act</a> was a later
       enactment of 2000. Still, the legislative policy and the object behind
       the passing the Act remains the same which is to grant the limited
       monopoly rights and not to extend the same so that the public could
       use the same freely.
</p><p id="p_113">               It is well established principle of law that when there is
       inconsistency between two special laws operating in their respective
       fields, the conflict between the same has to be resolved by seeing
       objects behind the two special laws and interpretation must be devised
       so that both should operative and serve their relevant objects.
</p><p id="p_114">               The said proposition was laid down in the case of Ashoka
       Marketing Limited and Anr. Vs. Punjab National Bank and Others
       (AIR 1991 SC 855) wherein the Supreme Court observed thus:
</p><p id="p_115">               "In other words, both the enactments, namely, the Rent
               Control Act and the Public Premises Act, are special statutes

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                         Page No.39 of 94
                in relation to the matters dealt with therein. Since, the Public
               Premises Act is a special statute and not a general enactment
               the exception contained in the principle that a subsequent
               general law cannot derogate from an earlier special law
               cannot be invoked and in accordance with the principle that
               the later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws, the Public
               Premises Act must prevail over the Rent Control Act. The
               principle which emerges from these decisions is that in
               the case of inconsistency between the provisions of two
               enactments, both of which can be regarded as Special in
               nature, the conflict has to be resolved by reference to the
               purpose and policy underlying the two enactments and
               the clear intendment conveyed by the language of the
               relevant provisions therein. We propose to consider this
               matter in the light of this principle" (Emphasis Supplied)

               Applying the said principle of law to the instant case, the
       legislative policy provided in the later enactment <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_203">Design Act</a>, 2000
       was to confer the limited monopoly rights which should not be
       unnecessary extended so that public can freely use the said shapes and
       designs in the commerce. This object was kept in mind ever after
       making the amendments in the Trade Mark Act, 1999. Thus, the
       <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_204">Design Act</a> shall be continued to be guided by the same policy as
       contained in the statement of objects and reasons contained therein in
       the later Act. Accordingly, the legislative policy under the later
       enactment of 2000 cannot be abrogated when the legislature
       consciously devised the said policy even after making the
       amendments in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_205">Trade Marks Act</a> in the year 1999.
</p>



<p id="p_116">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                        Page No.40 of 94
 II.    Once the objects of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_206">Design Act</a>, 2000 provides that the monopoly
       rights are for limited period and the same should not be extended so
       that public can freely use the shape of the articles, the further
       extension of the rights under the guise of the passing off by calling it a
       dual monopoly would be against the policy and the purpose behind
       the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_207">Designs Act</a> which is to make the shape of the articles in public
       domain for free use after expiration. It cannot be the case that on one
       hand the shape of the article is passed to public domain for free use by
       operation of law of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_208">Design Act</a> and on the other hand, the same very
       shape is again taken away from the public and put into the bracket of
       the protection by granting monopoly rights in perpetuity by operation
       of another law which is a prior law and thereby in effect the public is
       debarred from using the said shape of the articles. The same cannot be
       legislative intent behind conferring the rights under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_209">Trade Marks
       Act</a> which would invariably be advantageous only to the particular
       class of the proprietors and which would also militate against the
       legislative policy of special law holding the field of Designs.
III.   The grant of the further monopoly rights under the guise of the
       passing off to the shape of the article even after the expiry of the
       Design would make the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_210">Design Act</a> redundant or nugatory or otiose.
       This is due to the reason that proprietors who have already enjoyed
       the statutory right to exclude others which is equivalent to patents
       would be granted further monopoly rights which are inconsistent with
       the Design right provided under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_211">Design Act</a> by making their
       registration and the rights conferred as inconsequential.
</p>


<p id="p_117">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                       Page No.41 of 94
 IV.    The monopoly rights of the Design and Trade mark are mutually
       inconsistent with each other. This is due to the manner in which Trade
       Mark and Design rights operate, their nature, characteristic, policies
       behind the two laws and many other ways. The said differences can be
       enumerated as under:
</p>
<p id="p_118">       a.      Where as the remedy under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_212">Trade Marks Act</a> is statutory as
               well as equitable in nature as it saves common law remedy, the
               rights and remedies under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_213">Design Act</a> are purely statutory in
               nature based on the strict word of statute.
</p><p id="p_119">       b.      The rights under the Trade Mark Act are based on securing
               registration as well as rights exists in common law by way of
               prior user which may lead to distinctiveness of the mark in
               question in market. Unlike, the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_214">Trade Marks Act</a>, the rights in
               <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_215">Design Act</a> are conferred only if the design is novel on the date
               of application as well as original. The said aspect of novelty is
               akin to law of patents which states that the invention must not
               be disclosed to public or pre published piece of art. Thus,
               whereas in <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_216">Trade Marks Act</a> prior user confers rights in
               common law; in <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_217">Design Act</a> is completely inconsistent in nature
               where prior user from the date of application destroys the rights
               as the same may lead pre publication in the eyes of the law.
       c.      Trade Marks are Registered for the period of 10 years and are
               renewable thereafter for the further period of 10 years each time
               they are due for renewal. Thus, there is no limitation on the
               period of trade marks to remain in force. The same also holds
               good for trade marks rights exist in common law. The only

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.42 of 94
                exception to the same is when the court declares that due to the
               long and extensive usage of the said mark, the said mark has
               become generic. On the other hand, the Design is registered for
               10 years and further renewed for one more term of 5 years and
               in that way, the said right under the Design is for the limited
               period of time.

                 Therefore, a proprietor by electing to go for registering a
       design explicitly forecloses his right to claim the said article as a
       trademark which is evident from the definition of Design under
       <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_233">Section 2(d)</a> of Designs Act.         In the case of M/s Ampro Food
       Products (Appellant) Vs. M/s Ashoka Biscuit Works and Ors
       (Respondents) AIR 1973 Andhra Pradesh page 17 which was passed
       in the old <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_234">Designs Act</a> containing similar exclusion, Hon'ble Justice
       Chinnappa Reddy (as he then was) held that design is different from
       a Trademark as by approaching the authority of Design Office a
       person has to declare that nothing contained therein is trademarkable.
       In the words of Hon'ble Justice Chinnappa Reddy it was observed
       thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">           "4. The respondent, it seems has applied for the registration of a
           trademark and Mr. Babulal Reddy, learned Counsel for the
           respondent submitted that the application will be granted as a
           matter of course. Assuming so, I do not see how that will entitle
           the respondent to commit an act of piracy in regard to the
           appellant‟s registered design. It should be remembered that a
           trademark is different from a design. A design is necessarily part
           and parcel of the article manufactured while a trademark is not
           necessarily so. In fact, the definition of "design" in <a href="/doc/1437994/" id="a_235">Section 2(5)</a>
           of the Designs Act expressly states that it does not include any
           trade mark as defined in <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_236">Section 2(1)(v)</a> of the Trade and
           <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_237">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958. That is why the certificate of
           registration of the design contains a note which recites "The
           novelty in the design resides in the ornamental source pattern
           which appears only on the side of the biscuit as illustrated. No
           claim is made by virtue of this registration to any right to the use
           as a trademark of what is shown in the representations or to the


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.44 of 94
            exclusive use of the letters appearing in the design." This note
           does not give any right to the respondent or other biscuit
           manufacturer to commit an act of piracy of the design as defined
           in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_238">Designs Act</a> under the guise of using it as a trade mark.
           The respondent or other biscuit manufacturer may perhaps use
           the design as a trade mark on a wrapper or a label or otherwise
           but not so as to make it part and parcel of the biscuit in which
           case he could be committing an act of piracy of the design as
           defined in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_239">Designs Act</a>."            [Emphasis laid]

</blockquote><p id="p_124">64.    By reading the judgment, it can be argued that the said judgment of
Ampro (supra) was passed under the old <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_240">Designs Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_241">Trade Marks
Act</a> has been amended in the year 1999 and repealed by the Old Act of 1958
and therefore this view should not be accepted but the fact of the matter is
that the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_242">Designs Act</a> has also been amended in the year 2000 which is a later
enactment than that of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_243">Trade Marks Act</a>. Still, the said express exclusion
is preserved and retained. The legislature was conscious of the impact of
1999 Act where the shape of mark was included in the definition of "mark",
but still the exclusion of trademark from the definition of design is not taken
away. All this would mean that still the position in law remains the same
which is that the design is mutually inconsistent right with that of the
trademark right which has been provided by excluding trade mark from
purview of the design and the said right on the same subject matter cannot
co-exist together with the inconsistent Design right and the only option
which remains for the preservation is that the proprietor has to elect either of
them to claim monopoly rights by taking consistent approach.
</p><p id="p_125">65.    This view is consistent with the legislative policy behind the Patent
and Design law in India which is that after expiry of Patent and Design


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.45 of 94
 which are limited monopoly rights, the said articles and embodiments go in
public domain. Public domain includes the right to freely copy. This kind of
concept of right to free copy after the expiry of limited monopoly rights is
consistent with the object behind the patent and design rights which is that
the said novel embodiments and designs may be worked upon by the public
or the competitors in field in order to further arrive at innovative designs in
the near future.
</p><p id="p_126">66.    The said lapsed Design and Patent articles in the public domain
cannot be taken away by way of passing off right as an additional one in
order to extend the monopoly rights at the whims and fancies of the
proprietor. It is true that the Trademark Act amends the definition of Mark
which also includes shape of article. However, the construction between the
two Acts should be devised in such a manner so that both the Acts should
work in their own fields respectively, which is the rule of harmonious
construction. If the passing off right is allowed to subsist irrespective of
where the design is registered or expired would mean that <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_244">Design Act</a> is
rendered otiose/redundant/nugatory.
</p><p id="p_127">67.    This is due to the reason that any person/ proprietor under the
common law would be in much more advantageous position even after
enjoying the Design right than the registered proprietor of the design. Such
anomalous situation cannot exist where the law which is for the time being
in force is rendered completely obsolete and a closed book. Though the
passing off right exists in the trademark statute, however, the same cannot be
pressed into service when the proprietor opts to go for design right which by
virtue of the very definition of design excludes the trademark.

</p><p id="p_129"> 68.    Several case laws have been relied upon at the bar including the cases
where the courts in UK and USA have accorded dual protection; both in
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_245">Design Act</a> as well as in <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_246">Trade Marks Act</a>. One has to really go into more
depth in order to understand and comprehend why such judgments are
passed by the courts of the respective jurisdictions. In UK, the policy behind
protection of design has undergone a significant change after much lobbying
created by the proprietors which persuaded the British Parliament to pass
legislations like Unregistered Designs Act where the designs are even
protected in common law. Further, the Design Law in UK has been amended
number of times and each time there is a shift in the legislative intent which
has gone forward towards the protection and extension of the monopoly one
way or other. Initially, the judgments passed by the UK courts took the
consistent view which was also in consonance with their legislative policy as
it then existed in UK which is also present in India under the current
scenario which was not to extend the monopoly rights under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_247">Design Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_130">       The Decision of House of Lords in the case of Re Coca-Cola Co.‟s
Application, [1986] 2 All ER 274 the House of Lords speaking through lord
Tempelman observed that an attempt to register the shape of the Coca-Cola
bottle was "another attempt to expand on the boundaries of intellectual
property and to convert a protective law into a source of monopoly." The
said view was also taken in the further decisions of UK. However, the
amendments carried out in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_248">Designs Act</a> of UK from time to time and
change the legislative policy also had an impact on the decisions of the
Court. All this is evident from the legislative history behind the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_249">Designs Act</a>
as it was amended from time to time in England.

 AMENDMENTS MADE IN THE COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN LAW
IN UK CONSEQUENTIAL EFFECT UPON CHANGE IN POLICIES
IN LAWS FROM TIME TO TIME

</p><p id="p_132">69.    It is noteworthy to mention that although the provisions of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_250">Designs
Act</a> in UK seem akin to the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_251">Indian Designs Act</a>, 2000, however, the
underlying policy and object of the design law in UK underwent a
significant change for the last more than 50 - 60 years which has made the
design law capable enough in UK to accommodate the proprietors of every
level and also accorded the protection in common law in additional to
statutory rights of registration.
</p><p id="p_133">70.    The legislative history and the change in policy coupled with
European Community Directives which were passed would itself narrate
how the registered design law as it exists in UK is different in policy and
object than that of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_252">Indian Designs Act</a>, 2000. the changes made in the
design law in UK can be sub categorized under the three heads which will
enable a person to understand the changes in the policy made in UK that
started as a fine distinction between the two monopoly rights that <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_253">Designs
Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_254">Copyright Act</a> are completely distinct from each other and thereafter
the link was established between the Registered Design and common law in
order to undermine the characteristic of statutory nature of Design right.
The effect of this policy change is that the shape of industrial commercial
articles which were earlier aimed at giving a limited monopoly of 15 years
due to its putting into commerce was extended either by giving a full
copyright protection of 60 years in certain cases or in the alternative
protected under the law of passing off by calling it as trade mark or trade
dress. Such was never the original intent of the framers of the design law

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                   Page No.48 of 94
 but still due to peculiar circumstances existing in UK and in European
countries, the said policy change was adopted and implemented in the
national legislations. The said three heads by which one can discern the
change and evolution of policy of dual protection in UK Design Law can be
enumerated as under:-
</p><p id="p_134">    Law prior to the year 1989- Prior to 1989, the copyright law in UK
       was governed by 1911 Act and thereafter the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_255">Copyright Act</a> of 1956.
       <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_256">Both the Act</a>s provided that the copyright rights and the design rights
       are totally distinct in nature. The articles which are registrable under
       the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_257">Designs Act</a> are given a limited monopoly rights and as such
       cannot be given copyright protection (Kindly see Section 10 of UK
       Copyright Act of 1956 and also see Section 22 of UK Copyright Act
       of 1911). The design law in UK was governed by the Registered
       Designs Act, 1949 which also confers a statutory monopoly upon the
       articles having novel shape and configuration. At that point of time
       when there was a clear legislative policy that <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_258">Designs Act</a> was passed
       with the aim to confer the limited monopoly rights to the proprietor
       and the same is distinct from that of copyright and it can never be
       extended. The judicial view which was prevalent at that point of time
       also supported the same conclusion.
</p><p id="p_135">    In the case of Coca-Cola Co‟s, [1986] 2 All ER 274. It was observed
       by Lord Templeman, thus:-
</p><p id="p_136">       It is not sufficient for the Coca-Cola bottle to be distinctive. The
       Coca-Cola Co. must succeed in the startling proposition that the
       bottle is a trademark. If so, then any other container or any
       article of a distinctive shape is capable of being a trade mark.
       This raises the spectre of a total and perpetual monopoly in

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.49 of 94
        containers and articles achieved by means of the 1939 Act. Once
       the container or article has become associated with the
       manufacturer and distinctiveness has been established, with or
       without the help of the monopolies created by the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_259">Patent Act</a>, the
       Registered Designs Act or the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_260">Copyright Act</a>, the perpetual
       trademark monopoly in the container or article can be achieved.
       In my opinion the 1938 Act was not intended to confer on the
       manufacturer of a container or on the manufacture of an article
       a statutory monopoly on the ground that the manufacturer has in
       the eyes of the public established a connection between the shape
       of the container or article and the manufacturer. A rival
       manufacturer must be free to sell any container or article or
       similar shape provided the container or article is labeled or
       packaged in a manner which avoids confusion as to the origin of
       the goods in the container or the origin of the article."(Emphasis
       Supplied)
       Likewise, in the case of Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith &amp;
       Co [1978] FSR 405, Chancery Division of United Kingdom was
       concerned with the question whether by claiming a corresponding
       patent protection in the embodiment and disclosing the industrial
       drawing before the Patent Office, Can monopoly rights in the
       drawings be claimed under the Copyright in order to prevent the
       manufacture of industrial article basing upon the said drawing?
       Answer to this question is in negative. Whitford J. took the view
       that on the expiry of Patent there must be an implied licence
       covering any use of patent drawings and all other drawings on
       which the articles were based. In his popular speech which is often
       quoted by the courts of law in UK and in India, it was observed
       thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_137">       "In my view, by applying for a patent and accepting the statutory
       obligation to describe and if necessary illustrate embodiments of
       his invention, a patentee necessarily makes an election accepting
       that, in return for a potential monopoly, upon publication, the
       material disclosed by him in the [patent] specification must be


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.50 of 94
        deemed open to be used by the public, subject only to such
       monopoly rights as he may acquire on his application for the
       patent and during the period for which his monopoly remains in
       force, whatever be the reason for the determination
       of the monopoly rights.          If this be correct... upon
       publication the plaintiffs must be deemed to have abandoned
       their copyright in drawings the equivalent of the patent
       drawings"                           (Emphasis Supplied)

    From the above, it is clear that the underlying policy prior to 1988 and
       1989 prevalent in UK was to prevent extension of monopoly rights; be
       it copyright vis-à-vis design; designs vis-à-vis trade marks or in the
       alternative patent vis-à-vis copyright.   There were contrary views
       which were taken in between by the courts below, however, the most
       popular ones which are often cited in India by the Superior Courts of
       England and denotes correct exposition of law has been discussed
       above.
</p><p id="p_138">    Law after the year 1989- In the year 1988, the copyright and design
       laws in UK were amended which have brought change in the policy
       underlying the design law. In the book titled as Laddie, Prescott &amp;
       Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, Fourth
       Edition, Vol-II, Lexis Nexis, the learned Author has noted the changes
       which were brought by 1988 amendments in the following words:-
          "43.5 This whole area of law was the subject of fundamental
          reform in 1988. The major features of the changes are as
          follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_139">          (1) registered design legislation was amended, in particular to
          make registration more attractive by extending the life of the
          monopoly to a maximum of 25 years;
</p>
<p id="p_140">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.51 of 94
           (2) a new right was created to give some protection to those
          who designed novel articles, even if they were functional. This
          is called „design right‟.
</p>
<p id="p_141">          (3) the law of copyright was modified, inter alia, to remove
          industrial designs from its ambit; and

          (4) transitional provisions were put in place in respect of
          copyright which reduced the protection for industrial designs
          and abolished conversion damages."     [Emphasis supplied]

</p><p id="p_142">71.     From the reading of above, the position as it then existed in 1988
clarified the intentions of framers of law and policy which was to extend the
monopoly rights in the commerce and industrially exploited articles in one
way or the other. The life time of monopoly of design was extended and
new right was created which is called design right which was actually an
unregistered design right in order to undermine the statutory nature of the
registered designs right. The unregistered design right conferred monopoly
even to the shapes of functional articles for the period of 25 years.
However, changes made in the year 1988 were just miniscule in nature as
the policy governing even at that point of time was that though the design
rights were extended monopoly of 25 years and additional design right was
created but the intention was always to keep the design right and copyright
distinct from each other.
</p><p id="p_143">       Learned Author in his Book Laddie, Prescott &amp; Vitoria on The
        Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, Fourth Edition, Vol-II,
        Lexis Nexis summarizes the said changes brought by Copyright,
        Design and <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_261">Patent Act</a>s of 1988 in the following manner:-
          "43.31... The CDPA 1988 thus served the link between
          protection by means of copyright and by registered design and

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                   Page No.52 of 94
          instead created a link between protection by unregistered
         design right and/ or by copyright."
</p>
<p id="p_144">    From the reading of aforementioned observations, it is clear that the
       legislative changes were brought in the copyright regime wherein
       there was another right called Design Right which was created
       and the link between the copyright and unregistered design right
       was     established       which      created   room   in   the     law        for
       protection of design irrespective of their registration even in
       common law.                                      (Emphasis Supplied)
    With the enactment of Copyright, Design and <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_262">Patent Act</a> of 1988 in
       UK, some transitional provisions were inserted in the said <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_263">Copyright
       Act</a> which also affected the enforcement of copyright in the
       registrable designs. The said transitional provisions were enacted in
       the form of Section 52 and 53 of CDPA of 1988. The said sections
       are reproduced below:-
</p><p id="p_145">       52.     Effect of exploitation of design derived from artistic work.
       (1)This section applies where an artistic work has been exploited, by

    The overall object of these transitional provisions were that the two
       policies; one existing prior to 1988 and the one subsequent thereto


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.54 of 94
        should apply to the designs which were existing earlier in the law and
       the new designs should continue to enjoy the limited kind of dual
       protection in the form of unregistered design right. The unregistered
       Designs which are derived from artistic copyright were given 25 years
       monopoly from the date of first marketing as an extended protection
       in common law. The said change was brought by the amendments
       with the aim that this will preserve the fine distinction between
       Design right and copyright. It is however highly doubtful whether the
       said actions and amendments brought by UK parliament really
       preserve such distinction or obliterates the same and establish a nexus
       between the Design right and common law right. Suffice it to say, that
       the said changes were made in UK law by giving such reasoning. The
       said object which was sought to be achieved by transitional provisions
       in CDPA 1988 has been explained very succinctly by the learned
       Author in his Book titled Laddie, Prescott &amp; Vitoria on The
       Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, Fourth Edition, Vol-II,
       Lexis Nexis. The relevant paragraph is reproduced below:-
         "43.52. As we have seen, an attempt was made under s 10 of the
         1956 Act to restrict copyright protection for registrable designs
         to the same term of the design monopoly which would have
         existed had a registration been sought and obtained. Under the
         CDPA 1988, the same overall objective is sought to be achieved
         by s 52, although the form of the section is very different to its
         predecessor. The transitional provisions try to fuse these two
         regimes together. The copyright limiting provisions of s 52 of the
         1988 Act apply to pre-August 1989 artistic works but the extent
         to which that section curtails copyright protection is determined
         by s 10 of the 1956 Act as follows: where s 10 applied to an
         artistic work at any time before 1 August 1989, s 52(2) now
         applies but the period of 25 years provided for by the latter is

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.55 of 94
          replaced by a period of 15 years as defined under s 10 (3) of the
         1956 Act. The general principle is that industrial exploitation
         plus sales prior to 1 August 1989 diminishes the period of
         protection and it is immaterial where the articles were
         manufactured. The effect of this transitional provision is nearly
         spent. To bring it into play and to start the clock running, the
         industrial exploitation and sales must have commenced before 1
         August 1989; if they commenced later, s 52 applies without
         modification, 15 years from 31 July 1989 takes one to 30 July
         2004 and any unauthorized sales by a third party must have
         taken place before that date to be infringing sales. The
         limitation period prevents such sales being actionable from 30
         July 2010."
</p><p id="p_160">    In view of the above, it is clear that the legislative policies as framed
       in UK underwent a sea change with the passage of time and the said
       policies attempted to respect the fundamental difference between the
       copyright law and design law but at the same time also accommodated
       the interest of the proprietor by creating new kinds of rights which
       extended the monopoly rights which were earlier not existed in their
       law prior to 1988.
</p><p id="p_161">       Thereafter, the judicial opinion on the subject also responded in
consonance with the policy changes made in the national legislation of UK
and therefore the judgments which were rendered for the period namely
1988 till 2000 onwards reflected legal position as it was existed in UK as per
the change made in the law and public policy governing the field.
    Law after the year 2001- The year 2001 has its own significance as a
       year which has changed the shape of design law as existed in UK and
       European Countries. There was a major policy change wherein it was
       not considered undesirable that one activity should be covered by two
       or more overlapping IP rights.       In the year 2001, the European

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.56 of 94
        Community had introduced a Directive No. 98/71/EC which virtually
       merged the design right into copyright right and extended the limited
       monopoly right of design right for 15 years to a full term of copyright
       of 60 years. The said European Directive mandated all the European
       countries including UK to change their domestic laws in consonance
       with the European community directives. The said policy change has
       been explained by the Author in his Book titled as Laddie, Prescott
       &amp; Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs,
       Fourth Edition, Vol-II, Lexis Nexis wherein he has proceeded to state
       that the applicability of the said directive is an acceptance of the
       principle of dual protection in UK and in European region. The said
       observation of the author reads as under:-
</p><p id="p_162">       43.53. In Chapters 51-60 we discuss how our domestic law of
       registered designs has been significantly altered by the
       implementation of Directive 98/71/EC. The purpose of the Directive
       is to harmonize to a large extent the substantive, but not the
       procedural, laws of registered designs throughout the Community.
       However, it also contains within it a provision which has an impact
       on the issues we have been discussing in this chapter. One of the
       principles underlying the Directive (and the Community Designs
       Regulation which introduced Community registered and
       unregistered designs) is that of „cumulation‟. That is to say the
       piling of one intellectual property right on top of another. It is not
       considered undesirable that one activity should be covered by two or
       more overlapping intellectual property rights. More than that, the
       Directive prohibits, at least in some respects, attempts under
       national law to prevent such overlap. This is achieved by art 17
       which provides:-
</p><p id="p_163">       "Relationship to Copyright

         A Design protected by a Design right registered in or in respect of
       Member State in accordance with this Directive shall also be eligible

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.57 of 94
        for protection under the law of the copyright of that state as from
       the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The
       extent to which, the conditions under which, such a protection is
       conferred, including the level of originality required shall be
       determined by each Member State"
</p><p id="p_164">       Notwithstanding its broad wording, this is not attempting to create
       an entirely new type of copyright. What it is directed to is preventing
       national laws from prohibiting overlap between copyright and
       registered design rights. If, therefore, our domestic law had a
       provision which said „any design which is protected by a registered
       design cannot qualify for copyright protection as well‟, the Directive
       would override it. The design would be entitled to both forms of
       protection as if the domestic provision did not exist. We do
       not have any such provision. However, before we discuss the impact
       of art 17 on our UK domestic law, we need to consider it
       further."                                    (Emphasis Supplied)
</p><p id="p_165">72.   From the reading of the above observations of the author, it is apparent
that the policy changes brought in the year 2001 in EU which has been
followed by UK further unequivocally accepts the policy of extension of
monopoly rights in the design law into a full term of copyright. The said
policy also indicates the view that dual protection can be accommodated in
European region.       UK accepted the said policy changes in the form of
Registered Design Regulations 2001 which came into force on 9 th
December, 2001. At the same time, it has been again re-emphasized by the
author that the said directive though broadly worded has not created new
rights but has just harmonized the two laws. By giving such reasoning of
harmonization, the dual protection policy has been introduced which has
also been acknowledged by the learned author in Modern law of Copyright
(supra) where it is not considered undesirable to have protection of the
design right in both forms.

<p id="p_166">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.58 of 94
</p><p id="p_167"> 73.    The consequence of allowance of dual protection policy in domestic
legislation of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_264">Design Act</a> further persuaded the courts in England not to
prevent the dual protection when it comes to registered design rights and
protection in common law. Therefore, whenever there a passing off claim in
the shape of an article was asserted in UK or in European region, the policy
underlying the dual protection having been accepted nowhere precluded the
court to express the concerns for public domain as the courts in England
were mandated to follow the law as it exists in the Statute Book.
</p><p id="p_168">74.    Simultaneously, the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_265">Trade Marks Act</a> of 1994 in UK was passed to
include new changes including the shape of the goods which was added
within the definition of a trademark. When such was the position in law
wherein the Trademark Act included the shape of goods in the year 1994 in
UK and there was an European directive in the year 2001 which was
accepted in UK introducing the dual protection policy, it is more than
obvious that the courts when would be faced with the actions premised on
passing off of goods basing upon the shape of article in UK would not feel
hesitant in entertaining the same and accepting the dual protection when
legislative intent in UK does not make it undesirable to prevent the dual
protection.
</p><p id="p_169">75.    In sharp contradistinction to the same, there are no such policy
changes which are brought in India in relation to Design law and the
statement of object of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_266">Design Act</a>, 2000 clearly provides that the sanctity of
industrial design being a statutory monopoly is still preserved in Indian
context and the overlapping of monopoly rights and dual protection of the
Designable subject matter under the common law would contravene the
object clause of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_267">Designs Act</a>. There is no legislative policy which has been

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.59 of 94
 brought in India to accept such dual protection. Therefore, it is not safe to
assume that the judgments passed in UK can be applicable with equal
strength in India due to policy differences as the objects and reasons of
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_268">Designs Act</a> of 2000 is inconsistent with the policy as it is existing today in
UK.     Therefore, the said judgments are clearly distinguishable and are
inapplicable in the Indian context.

lateron

</p><p id="p_171">76.    Just like in UK, the law relating to Intellectual Property right regime
began with the fine distinction of rights delimiting their bounds and
eventually the policy change in US also enabled the courts to accommodate
the interest of proprietors in the form of acceptance of dual protection and
thereby reducing the space for public domain, USA is equally no exception
to such acceptance of the said change in the policy. In a landmark case titles
as "The Trade Mark Cases" cited as 100 US 82(1879) decided in 1879, the
Supreme Court of United States had evolved an important distinction
between the Copyright, Patent rights and Trademark rights and the Supreme
Court proceeded to observe that there lies a distinction between all these
rights and the trademark has no necessary relation with the invention and
discovery. In the words of Supreme Court it was observed thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">       "The ordinary trade-mark has no necessary action to
       invention or discovery. The trademark recognized by the
       common law is generally the growth of a considerable period
       of use, rather than a sudden invention. It is often the result of
       accident rather than design, and when under the act of
       Congress it is sought to establish it by registration, neither
       originality, invention, discovery, science, nor art is in any way
       essential to the right conferred by the act. If we should


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.60 of 94
        endeavor to classify it under the head of writings of authors,
       the objections are equally strong. In this, as in regard to
       inventions, originality is required. And while the word
       writings may be liberally construed, as it has been, to include
       original designs for engravings, prints &amp; c., it is only such as
       are original, and are founded in the creative powers of the
       mind. The writings which are to be protected are the fruits of
       intellectual labor, embodied in the form of books, prints,
       engravings and the like. The trademark may be, in generally
       is, the adoption of something already in existence as the
       distinctive symbol of the party using it. At common law the
       exclusive right to it grows out of its use, and not its mere
       adoption. By the act of Congress this exclusive right attaches
       upon registration. But in neither case does it depend upon
       novelty, invention, discovery, or any work of the brain. It
       requires no fancy or imagination, no genius, no laborious
       thought. It is simply founded on priority of appropriation.
       We look in vain in the statute for any other qualification or
       condition. If the symbol, however plain, simple, old, or well
       known has been first appropriated by the claimant as his
       distinctive trademark, he may be registration secure the right
       to its exclusive use. While such legislation may be a judicious
       aid to the common law on the subjects of trademarks, and
       may be within the competency of legislatures whose general
       powers embrace that class of subjects, we are unable to see
       any such power in the constitutional provision concerning
       authors and inventors, and their writings and
       discoveries."                   (Emphasis Supplied)

Singer Manufacturing Company Vs. June Manufacturing Co., 163 U.S.
169 (1896) refused to prevent copying of another sewing machine design
after the expiration of design patent stated that the public domain right in

observed thus:-

        "It is self evident that on the expiration of a patent the monopoly
       created by it ceases to exist and the right to make the thing formerly
       covered by the patent becomes public property. It is upon this
       condition that the patent is granted. It follows as a matter of course
       that at the termination of the patent, there passes to the pubic right
       to make the machine in the form in which it was constructed during
       the patent. We may therefore dismiss without further comment the
       complaint, as to the form in which the defendant made his

</p><p id="p_174">78.    In US, The protection relating to shape of an article stemmed from
two regimes which are patent and copyright. The shape of an article was
always made protectable in both regimes. The courts in USA initially took
the view that both these rights are alternative/exclusive to each other and
therefore one necessarily had to elect between these two inconsistent rights
which preserved the sanctity of fine distinction of rights and also created a
room for public domain. The said view of applicability of law of election
between the two rights was taken in the case of Blood 23 Federal 2d 772
wherein the court held that while the subject matter might be eligible for
protection either in copyright or in design patent and obtaining of protection
under one constitutes an election of protection and there is an estoppel to
seek the other.

</p><p id="p_177"> 80.     Similar view accepting the applicability of election was taken by US
court in the case of Jones Bros (supra) which extends the applicability of
doctrine of election. Thereafter, all these decisions were analyzed by the US
Court of Customs and Patents Appeals in the case of application of Richard
Q. Yardley 493 Federal 2d 1389.             The court in the case analyzed two
questions which are reproduced hereinafter:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">        "Is there an area of overlap wherein a certain type of subject
        matter        is both      „statutory       subject    matter‟
        under the copyright statute (meaning a type of subject  matter
        which, by definition, may be copyrighted if the other
        statutory conditions and requirements are met) and „statutory
        subject matter‟ under the design patent statute (meaning a
        type of subject matter which, by definition, may be
        patented as a design if the other statutory conditions and
        requirements are met)?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">        "If      the     answer       to      question       (1)     is     in

        ct matter which is within the area of overlap, may the „author
        inventor‟ secure both a copyright and a design patent?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_178">81.     Answering the questions in affirmative, the US court proceeded to
observe that the intention of Congress is revealed from the reading of two
sections from copyright statute as well as from patent statute and there is no
provision preventing any such kind of overlapping. Therefore, the intention is
clearly to permit such overlapping. In the words of US court it was observed
thus:

        In      the     two      statutes,    the      Congress       has
       created an area of overlap with regard to at least one type of su
       bject matter. Thus, the Congress has provided that subject
       matter of the type involved in the instant appeal
       is „statutory    subject    matter‟   under      the   copyright
       Statute and *1394 „statutory subject matter‟ under the design
       patent        statute.       The       statutory       language
       clearly shows the intent of Congress."
</p>
<p id="p_180">82.    Thereafter the court reproduced the Sections of Patent Act and the
copyright Statute in US. The said sections are reproduced below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">               "The copyright statute, 17 U.S.C. § 5, states:

       elect     between     the     two     available    modes   of
       securing exclusive rights."
</p>
<p id="p_183">83.    Thereafter the said intention of Congress was extended by the court
permitting the area of overlapping and dual protection which infused the
acceptance of policy change relating to dual protection in law and the court
answered that the election principle is not applicable. If one considers the
position uptill Yardley (supra) in 1974, it is clear that even earlier in a given
circumstances, the courts accepted the principle of election of rights and
thereafter    repelled     the    same      on   the   grounds   of     intention        of
Congress/Parliament which as per the courts in US was always to confer
dual protection. The said intention of Congress in the case of Yardley (supra)
discovered from the reading of the section and no discussions on the objects
of the both the laws, policies underlying the laws. No analysis was made by
the courts in USA as to where such overlapping would extend the monopoly
rights. The courts in USA simply proceeded to observe that there is an
overlapping and statute permits the said overlapping.
</p><p id="p_184">84.    In sharp contradistinction to the same, the policy governing the
copyright vis-à-vis design overlap is very clear in India which is governed
by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1018906/" id="a_269">Section 15</a> of Copyright Act which prohibits such
overlapping. The judgment in the case of Microfibres (supra) passed by
Division Bench of Delhi High Court clearly analyzes the legislative intent
which is based upon the statement of objects of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_270">Designs Act</a> to confer the
limited monopoly right so that it should not be extended which makes the

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                             Page No.65 of 94
 legislative intent of Indian parliament very clear and unambiguous which is
that it is protective regime conferring limited rights with a balancing act of
preserving public domain. The said intention was missing in the case of
Yardley in USA.
</p><p id="p_185">85.    In India, the statutory provisions relating to <a href="/doc/1018906/" id="a_271">Section 15</a> of the
Copyright Act, 1957 clearly speak to the contrary from the Statute of USA
and the reasoning given by the US court in Yardley (supra).
</p><p id="p_186">86.    Let's now proceed further from Yardley (supra) by acceptance of the
said overlap regime and extension of monopoly rights, the courts in US
never looked back and proceeded to protect the interest of right holders of
design either by putting in the bracket of design or in copyright or in
trademark and extending the monopoly in relation to the shape of the articles
to the perpetuity which has hampered the underlying limits and bounds to
which the protection of law extends and undermines the principle of public
domain which started from Singer Co. (supra) in 1896. The Courts in US
granted the trade dress rights even after expiration of patents and designs.
</p><p id="p_187">87.    One such case was the case decided in the case of Moregen David
Wine Corpn, 328 F.2d 925. The said decision came up before the appellate
court which is United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has taken
the diametrically opposite view from that of Singer Co.(supra) which is by
observing that the patent expiration is nothing more than cessation of patent
right to exclude held under the patent law conversely. The trademark
conceivably could end through non use during the life of patent. The said
view taken in Moregen David (supra) ignores the underlying policy behind
the patent law which is that by declaring the embodiment and design to
Patent Office, a proprietor enjoys monopoly right for a limited period of

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.66 of 94
 time and upon expiration of the said right, the same is freely available to the
public.
</p><p id="p_188">88.    Such a trend continued in Honeywell Inc. 497 F2d 1344 (CCPA
1974) where again the court has held that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">       "Federal design patent laws were created to encourage the
       invention of ornamental designs. Federal trademark laws,
       which are independent in origin from the design patent laws,
       seek to prevent the public from encountering confusion,
       mistake, and deception in the purchase of goods and services
       and to protect the integrity of the trademark owner's product
       identity. With that distinction in mind, this court decided that
       the public interest - protection from confusion, mistake, and
       deception in the purchase of goods and services - must prevail
       over any alleged extension of design patent rights, when a
       trademark is non-functional and does in fact serve as a means
       to distinguish the goods of the trademark owner from those of
       others."
</blockquote><p id="p_189">89.    From the bare reading of above, it is clear that the court in US in the
case of Honeywell (supra) has taken the ground of protection of public
interest from confusion in order to accord protection of rights after the
expiration of patent. The court has also devised the distinction between
functional and non functional articles which is artificial in nature and is
purely a doctrinal one in order to arrive at the conclusion that what is
protected in the trademark law under the guise of passing off is non
functional articles. If the same is compared with the scheme of Indian
Design Act, then the functional aspect is clearly excluded from the definition
of Design under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_272">Section 2(d)</a> of the Indian Designs Act, 2000. Therefore,
what is designable in India is trademark protected in US.
</p><p id="p_190">90.    Going by that analogy, it is inconceivable to carve out such artificial
distinction of functional article in Indian context. So far as the public

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.67 of 94
 interests are concerned, there are two public interests which are competing
and militating against each other in the case of present nature involving dual
protection, One is the public interest of right to freely use the shape of the
article upon the expiration of patent/design as per the object of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_273">Designs
Act</a> and the competing interest is the interest of consumer to be protected as
per the object of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_274">Trade Marks Act</a>. Some balance approach is required to
be followed so that there should not exist any conflict with the two
competing public interests and policy and one does not outweighs the other.
Once the proprietor has already enjoyed the statutory monopoly with the
disclosure of the same to the authority and to the general public and with a
covenant with law that after expiration of the design, the right will be
available to the public to freely use the said design, it would be incongruous
to assume any further public interest to protect against confusion
outweighing the paramount public interest which is right to exploit the work
of lapsed patent so that further intentions and workings can be done upon the
same. Such an approach of US court in the case of Honeywell (supra) is
totally inconsistent being purely doctrinal one and overlooks the
fundamentals of monopoly akin to patent law and limits its examination of
the case purely on academic basis without considering its practical
implications.
</p><p id="p_191">91.    The view which has been taken in Honeywell (supra) might have been
persuaded or influenced by the economic policy of US to promote the
commerce and investment but from legal point of view the said extension of
monopoly basing upon artificially created doctrinal distinctions is alien to
the law in common law jurisdiction like India where the courts believe that
there should be consistency in the law and the precedents are holding the

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.68 of 94
 field and the laws should not be disturbed easily till the time there are
outweighing compelling circumstances. There is no such policy change
brought in India which compels this court to take the similar view in India
according dual protection and rendering the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_275">Design Act</a> otiose.
</p><p id="p_192">92.    In 1996 again the US District Court in Krueger Intl. Vs. Nightingale
Inc. 915 F. Supp 595 (SDNY 1996) held that trademarks rights do not
extend the patent monopoly. It was held thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">       "[T]rademark rights do not "extend" the patent monopoly.
       They exist independently of it, under different law and for
       different reasons. The termination of either has no legal effect
       on the continuance of the other. When the patent monopoly
       ends, it ends. The trademark rights do not extend it."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_193">93.    The said view is of District Court in US is again a slipshod with the
underlying policy behind the patent law. It is totally contrary to the
underlying policy of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_276">Designs Act</a> in India is that the commercial and
industrial articles enjoy lesser monopoly for a limited period of time and the
same should not be unnecessarily extended.
</p><p id="p_194">94.    Likewise in the case of TrafFix Devices, Inc. Vs. Marketing
Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23, 25 (2001), the Supreme Court again was
concerned with the question as to whether after expiration of patent right,
trade dress rights are foreclosed. The court noted several divergence of
opinion by circuits on the issue which includes 5 th, 7th Federal Circuit and
did not proceed to discuss the impact of expired design patent on trade dress
protection and left open the said legal question and rather concentrated more
on doctrine of functionality of the shape.
</p>


<p id="p_195">CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.69 of 94
</p><p id="p_196"> 95.    Therefore, the development of law as it goes in US clearly states that
there are conflicting views which are taken by several circuits in relation to
the effect of expired patent on the maintainability of trade dress protection
under the guise of passing off.
</p><p id="p_197">96.    The Supreme Court in US did not answer this question explicitly but
in the case of TrafFix Devices (supra) had held that the subject article in
that case was not protectable as it was a functional article. Therefore, it is
equally controversial area of law in US and it has not been decided by the
superior court that the expired design can be revalidated by way of passing
off action. The inconsistencies of views are prevailing in several circuits in
USA. The trends in 1990s are though leaning towards the pro protection
policy.
</p><p id="p_198">97.    In view of above discussion, it is clear that in US also the highest
court in the case of TrafFix (supra) has refrained from commenting upon the
said question when the proprietors and public were waiting for the Supreme
Court to comment on the said question.        The views taken in Moregen
(supra) and Honeywell (supra) and a few handful of decisions by circuits are
not giving complete and explicit analysis of law and the underlying policy of
patent and design law as discussed above. The said views are inconsistent
with the public policy and the statement of objects and reasons of the
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_277">Designs Act</a> in India which clearly does not permit any such extension of
monopoly rights.
</p><p id="p_199">98.    It is however not out of the place to mention that the decisions of US
courts are also put to severe criticism by several scholars and researchers of
the Universities in US as well as world over. The said decisions are said to
be against the pith and substance of the monopoly rights conferred by the

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.70 of 94
 Designs Patent as stated by the one of the authors. It is also not wrong to say
that even the US courts have taken contrary views on the subject from time
to time and acknowledge that the question of dual protection is one of the
most controversial area of law.
</p><p id="p_200">99.    In a celebrated Article written by David L. Lange who is from Duke
Law University titles as "The Intellectual Property Clause in a
contemporary trademark law: an appreciation of two reason essays and
some thoughts about why we ought to care", published as Law and
contemporary problems, Vol 59 (2) page no. 213. The learned Author has
discussed that by the passage of time the distinction between the trademark
rights vis-à-vis other intellectual property have become totally withered
away. In the words of learned Author, it has been stated:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">       "The passage of time, and with it the accretion of subsequent
       cases, new legislation, and regulations as well as commentary
       sacred and profane, not to mention accords tacit and explicit
       alike, have brought a measure of resolution to these issues at
       certain levels of doctrinal understanding. Certainly, no one
       doubts today that copyrightable subject matter may have
       additional protection under the Lanham Act when the
       separate requirements of that Act are met; the same
       apparently is true of patentable subject matter. 'Trademarks
       meanwhile, may be protected by copyright when they meet the
       requirements of authorship and originality Whether the
       subject matter of trademarks also may be patentable is less
       clear. But the Federal Circuit is currently considering a case
       in which the proprietors of trade dress are claiming the
       rights of a patentee. Assuming novelty, non-obviousness, and
       utility, nothing seems clearly to stand in the way of such
       a result."                     (Emphasis Supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_201">100. The learned Author proceeded to observe that by doing all this, we are
trying to accommodate the complexities in the field of law which are

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.71 of 94
 unguided and unrestrained by the constitution. It has also been observed by
the Author that by doing so, we are also equally unwise as we are tending to
forget the reasons behind the laws for which they were enacted. The learned
author also finds that we are unwise because we are forgetting the limits and
bounds of the trade mark protection and proceedings to impede with the
public domain by extending the doctrine unbridled by the law which is cause
of central concern. In the words of the learned Author, it has been observed
thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">         "We have learned, in short, to accommodate complexities in
         the field of intellectual property that would have confounded
         the Court that decided The Trademark Cases a little more
         than a century ago. And we have done so, as I say, largely
         unguided and unconstrained by the constitution. This is
         indeed why the Intellectual Property Clause matters now as it
         has not in the past.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">         In the view of many observers, myself among them, we have
         learned to be a bit too accommodating." The complexities in
         the interplay among our contemporary doctrines now allow a
         degree of slippage that is unwise twice over.</blockquote>
<p id="p_202">                                               (Emphasis Supplied)
         "We are unwise, first, in the confusion we have sown among
         doctrines once admirably self-contained. For what is implicit
         in The Trademark Cases is that there is a fundamental
         difference between copyright and patent rights, on the one
         hand, and trademarks on the other. Indeed, at the time, there
         was."                                (Emphasis Supplied)
         "The result is one I think Schecter himself would have
         denounced: We no longer know where the rational limits of
         trademarks lie. My colleague Paul Carrington likens the law to
         Mark Twain's River, rolling on forever and charting new
         meanders as it flows. It is a pretty metaphor. In the field of
         trademarks and unfair competition, though, it often seems

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.72 of 94
        that the river is over its banks; the boundaries among
       doctrines are no longer clear.' And we are unwise, I would
       insist again, in allowing that to happen-unwise for perfectly
       straightforward doctrinal reasons wholly internal to the field.
       Lawyers cannot help clients whom they cannot counsel, and
       lawyers cannot counsel clients effectively about law they cannot
       sensibly predict or explain or defend. (Emphasis Supplied)
       We are unwise, moreover, in the separate and additional
       degree to which we have allowed intellectual property
       doctrines to encroach upon the public domain. This is not a
       new problem in trademark law. The protean nature of
       trademark doctrines has been apparent for the better part of
       two decades. But one now senses a kind of critical mass as a
       new millennium approaches and new technologies converge
       with subject matters once the province of separate
       doctrines."                        (Emphasis Supplied)
</p><p id="p_203">101. All these observations were made with respect to encroachment of
trademark law regime with the public domain. I find that these observations
of the learned author summarizes the present problem which this court is
faced with quite aptly as the courts, in the process of protecting the rights
under the IP law regime, have forgotten the limits to which such monopoly
extends and the protection is permissible to the extent the policy and the law
provides for and therefore too much accommodation as the author puts it, is
unwise exercise as this would diminish and deplete the public domain which
is permitted in law.
</p><p id="p_204">102. Therefore, the position in US being purely doctrinal in nature and
after being severally criticized within US itself is more of a capitalistic
approach to follow rather than to serve the constitutional goals as provided
in the Indian Constitution which is for the welfare of the people and gives
right to carry on any business subject to the monopolies created by the law


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                    Page No.73 of 94
 and once the statutorily conferred monopoly expires then the right is equally
available for the public to freely use the said article without any further
judicially created fetters.

Marketing Displays, Inc.: The problem with Trade Dress Protection For
Expired Utility patents written by Keeley Canning Luhnow which was
published in the Buffalo Intellectual Property law Journal, 2002 edition Vol.
1 at page 224. The learned author has dealt with the purpose behind the
Designs and <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_278">Patents Act</a> and proceeded to observe that the extension of the
monopoly is against the policy of the Designs and <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_279">Patents Act</a>. In the words
of the author, it was observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">       "The term of a utility patent is twenty years from the date of the
       filing of the application. Once the patent has been granted, the
       application is made public so that others may determine what is
       covered by the patent." During the twenty years of the patent's
       validity, the patentee does not necessarily have the right to
       make, use, or sell the invention. The inventor does have the
       right to exclude others from making, using or selling the
       patented invention.</blockquote>
<p id="p_206">       The purpose of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_280">Patent Act</a>, as stated by the Court in Bonito
       Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,a3 is to create a
       "carefully crafted bargain for encouraging the creation and
       disclosure of new, useful, and non obvious advances in
       technology and design in return for the exclusive right to
       practice the invention for a period of years."'. The Supreme
       Court has identified three specific policies advanced by the
       <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_281">Patent Act</a>: First, patent law seeks to foster reward and
       invention; second, it promotes disclosure of inventions to
       stimulate further innovation and to permit the public to
       practice the invention once the patent expires; third, the
       stringent requirements for patent protection seek to assure



CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.74 of 94
        that ideas in the public domain remain there for the free use
       of the public."                     (Emphasis Supplied)
       The right to copy is believed by many commentators and
       courts to be implicit in the patent laws. The goals of the Act
       and the constitutional limits placed upon Congress by the
       Intellectual Property Clause "led the Supreme Court to
       articulate a right to copy flowing from the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_282">Patent Act</a> and
       the Constitution." Given that at the expiration of a patent
       the invention enters the public domain, many believe that
       by granting trade dress protection to anything included in a
       patent, the patent monopoly would be extended. This
       would defeat the main purpose of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_283">Patent
       Act</a>."                                 (Emphasis Supplied).
</p><p id="p_207">104. Therefore, the said judgments passed in US courts as cited by the
learned counsel appearing at the bar should not be readily accepted
considering the difference in the policies as well as the difference in the
legal position between India and US. The said judgments are thus
distinguishable and not applicable in Indian context. Likewise, the US
authority Mcarthy on Trademarks mentioning about the trade dress rights in
the cases relating to expired designs by placing reliance on the judgment of
Morgan Davies (supra) equally is not applicable due to difference between
US and Indian law relating to Designs.
</p><p id="p_208">105. It is not that the court is witnessing this approach of proprietors of the
monopoly rights seeking to extend the monopoly in the field Intellectual
property for the first time in cases where there is conferment of limited
monopoly rights by the Act. As the scholars and researches across the globe
themselves acknowledge, in the field of patents, we have seen the similar
attempt by the innovators attempting to indefinitely enjoy the patent
monopoly by making similar kind of substances which are subject matter of


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.75 of 94
 patent especially in the field of pharmaceuticals leading to dual monopoly
type situation. The said concept is more popularly known as ever greening.
More, recently, the said proposition has been witnessed by the Supreme
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_284">Novartis AG v. Union of India &amp; Others</a> while deciding
Civil Appeal No. 2728 OF 2013 decided on April 01, 2013.
</p><p id="p_209">106. In sharp contradistinction, the said views which are prevalent in USA
and UK which are due to the change in policy and jurisprudential differences
as they are existing in those countries with that of India, The legislative
policy in India in relation to <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_285">Designs Act</a>, 2000 remains the same which is
that the shape of the articles are granted limited monopoly rights which
should not be unnecessarily extended. The said policy governs the field and
cannot be departed with. The countries like US and UK have adopted a
significantly new policy towards never ending protection of the rights in
relation to shape of the commercial articles which in their economic state of
affairs may be permissible. But India being a Welfare State has to serve
several important goals as provided in the Preamble of Constitution of India.
The fundamental rights to do any business under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_286">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> is one
such fundamental right. The same is however subject to reasonable
restrictions as contained in <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_287">Article 19 (6)</a> which can be imposed by the Act
of Parliament. Once the restrictions contained in the law cease to have effect
and legislative policy also states the same, it would be impermissible to
judicially extend the said restriction by putting the same in another bracket
of common law (more so when there exists no such common law right)
which would violate the fundamental rights of the citizens to use such
inventions or designs which were earlier subjected to monopoly rights
conferred by the Sovereign. Therefore, in the interest of proprietors and right

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.76 of 94
 holders, the courts of justice cannot permit the proprietors to enjoy
monopoly rights in perpetuity when the position in law says that the said
rights extinguish once the patents and designs expire and the articles go in
public domain. The said right of the public which exists in law and policy
cannot be abridged by the judgment of this court. As such, the said view of
extending the monopoly right even after expiration of the patent shall also be
against the public policy. Therefore, there exists a policy difference between
the view prevalent in USA and UK as against in India and till the time this
policy change is brought into force very clearly by the Parliament, such
extension of rights is seemingly impermissible.
</p><p id="p_210">107. An argument which can straightaway be raised against the
aforementioned reasoning is that what about consumer confusion as the
court is equally concerned about the consumer confusion and protect the
public interest. The answer to the said proposition is that what goes in public
domain is the shape of the articles by virtue of the expiration of design and
not the trade dress of the label or what has been represented on the outer
packaging indicating the source of the product or what is outside the scope
of the monopoly claimed in the Design right. The remedy of the passing off
would lie in case the competitor not merely copies the shape of the article
existing in public domain but also copies the trade dress, get up or any other
feature in which case proprietor can take action to the extent there is
confusion as to source as indicated on the packaging of the article. The
reason is very simple, the design or shape of the article is distinct from trade
dress action. The trade dress action, on the contrary cannot be extended to
include the shape of the goods which are in public domain after expiration of
the design.

100 wherein the learned single judge of Bombay High Court while
considering the case of passing off premised on shape marks has also
considered the Design registration of defendant under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_288">Designs Act</a>, 2000
and proceeded to observe that the same is inconsequential for maintaining
the passing off action. I find that the said judgment is clearly distinguishable
from the proposition with which this court is concerned with. This is due to
the reason that in the instant case, we are concerned with the proprietor's
attempt to enjoy both the inconsistent rights for the purposes of extension of
monopoly right. In Gorbatschow (supra), the stand of the plaintiff was that
the bottles manufactured by the company are forming part of distinctive
shape mark as such entitled to protection, the said plaintiff no where claimed
the monopoly of Design right before the court. It is rather the Defendant
who had set up the registration of Design as a Defence in the said suit. In
response to which, the learned single judge observed that it is not necessary
for the plaintiff to go for Design registration and the shape are as such
protectable. There is no quibbling to the said proposition and as such the
said case does not come in the way of mine to take the view which I am
taking. This is due to the reason that I have reconciled the conflict between
the two inconsistent rights by adopting the principle of election of rights.
Once the proprietor elects to treat the shape of the product as a trade mark
and proceeds to approach the court on the very same premise, the mere fact
that the defendant has registered a design of the said product is
inconsequential so far as the claim of the trade mark rights of the proprietor
is concerned if his election is found to be consistent throughout. On the

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.78 of 94
 contrary, if the proprietor elects to proceed with the limited monopoly right
of Design, then it seems impermissible for him to place reliance on common
law right in the event his action fails on the statutory rights as there exists no
such common law rights in addition to the limited monopoly rights granted
by the statute of Designs.
</p><p id="p_213">Effect of Saving or Non Saving of Common law Rights
</p><p id="p_214">109. After analyzing the nature and characteristic of both Design Right and
passing off remedy, I have come to the conclusion that where as the Design
right is the monopoly based on the policy akin to patent which is true
monopoly based on statute. On the contrary, the passing off is a common
law right existing for different reasons which undermines the public policy
operating behind the statutory rights like patents and designs. Thus, clearly,
the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_289">Design Act</a>, 2000 required no saving of any common law right due to the
very nature of the Design right being statutory cannot accommodate
common law right along side the same as doing it would be against the
principle which forms the basis of patent and design right which is
conferment of limited monopoly rights. That is the reason why the patents
and the design acts do not contemplate any such common law right or saves
the same as they are not aimed at granting the monopoly rights in perpetuity
but only aimed at granting the limited rights.
</p><p id="p_215">110. The position in law in relation to saving of common law right
however is that the common law rights are not readily inferred by the courts
in the cases where there exists a special legislation occupying the field
having its own distinct objects unless established by way of practice or
saved by the provisions of the Act. The said position in law is well settled by
the Supreme Court in the case of            the judgment of Kedarlal Seal and

</blockquote><p id="p_220">113. In view of the aforementioned exposition of law by the Supreme
Court from time to time, it can be said that normally the common law right
stands excluded in the cases of statutory right. In the present case, I have
already discussed above that the saving of the common law right in the case
of the Design Right was not necessitated as the same is inconsistent with the
nature and characteristic of the Design right which disturbs the policy to
confer the limited rights on the proprietor. Thus, the said common law right
could not have been saved by the Legislature in view of the clear legislative
intent to grant limited rights. The said absence of saving clause in the Design


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.82 of 94
 Act unlike 27 (2) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_298">Trade Marks Act</a> is thus not inconsequential but is a
conscious omission on the part of the legislature as the legislature never
intended to confer the rights in perpetuity to the Design right holder. Thus,
the said absence of saving is consistent with the nature and legislative policy
operating behind the design right. Therefore, to say that the said distinction
between common law and statutory right as emanating from the view
propounded by Justice G.R. Luthra in the Tobu Vs. Megha (supra) is
meaningless is not correct understanding of law and policy behind the
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_299">Design Act</a>. The said view is the only correct exposition of the law on the
subject. This discussion also creates one major reason for us to adopt the
view that a person who is availing his design monopoly cannot avail
simultaneously the common law right of passing off when there exists no
such right considering the legislative intendment behind the conferring of
Designs right.
</p><p id="p_221">Co-existence of Passing off Right/Remedy alongside Design Right
</p><p id="p_222">114. The proposed reference of question (2) does not seek to challenge the
very existence of the passing off as a remedy but is rather concerned with a
specific question which is that whether a person who is registered proprietor
of the Design right can avail the passing off remedy along side the same and
what can be harmonious construction so that the protection under both the
statutes should operate in their respective fields without impinging on the
objects of the each other. After having analyzed the nature and characteristic
of the Design Right and passing off right, I shall proceed to address these
specific aspects.
</p><p id="p_223">115. The contention that there exists a passing off right in addition to the
Design Right has been argued by the learned counsel for the parties under

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.83 of 94
 the two heads, one being that the existence of the common law right of the
passing off during the subsistence of the Design right and also the
conferment of the passing off right after the expiration of the Design right. I
have already discussed above in great detail that there cannot exist any
passing off right after the expiration of the design as this would be against
the objects and legislative policy of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_300">Design Act</a>. I shall now proceed to
evaluate the proposition as to the possibility of the passing off right during
the subsisting design right.
</p><p id="p_224">Existence of Passing off Right during the Subsistence of Design Right
</p><p id="p_225">116. I have already discussed this aspect in great detail while arriving at the
finding that the very nature of the Design right is such which is statutory in
nature and provides a protection for the limited period of time. The common
law right or action in deceit in common law in relation such novel shapes
which are subject matter of Design protection thus cannot be given
protection in addition to the statutory right conferred by the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_301">Design Act</a> as
the same would be undermining the legislative intention and policy for
which the Design right was conferred upon registrant. This is due to the
reason that the very existence of the unregistered right in common law
would make the statutory grant of design right meaningless or redundant.
Secondly, once the nature and characteristic of the monopoly is such that it
is a true monopoly based on statutory right akin to patent, it is inconceivable
as to how there can be any monopoly be available under the common law
which can exists besides the registered design right itself as the same would
again mean that without disclosing the date of novelty, claim and scope of
the monopoly in the design application, any person can claim anything in
relation to the shape of the article in common law as a design right without

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.84 of 94
 any need to register the same and disclosing the authority about the newness
in the shape. I find that such exposition of the law wherein the Designs are
protected in common law in addition to the statutory right would defeat the
existence of the Statutory right itself. Additionally, the said common law
right of passing off if allowed to be given to the proprietor of the Registered
Design while enforcing his Design right would also come in the way of
expiration of the monopoly of Design right as the said right would never
expire and continue to exist in common law. Thus, the action premised on
Design right cannot claim the passing off right in relation to same subject
matter which is in relation to shape of the articles as both are inconsistent
with each other.
</p><p id="p_226">117. Having said so that during the subsistence of the Design right, the
action in deceit in common law is unavailable in relation to same subject
matter is not an absolute proposition. The action in deceit which is passing
off right cannot altogether be withered away as it seeks to prevent mainly
confusion and deception. As per the learned counsel for the parties the trade
mark is something extra which is applied to the design where as the design is
merely a part of shape which has been propounded by House of Lords in the
case of Smithkline &amp; French Laboratories Ltd Vs. Sterling- Withrop
Group Ltd., (1975) 1 WLR 914, going by that view, the action for the
passing off is maintainable on the ground of trade dress right which seeks to
prevent confusion as to source on the basis of the adopting similar get up or
label or affixing a get up which may cause confusion as to the source of the
product.
</p><p id="p_227">118. In the subsisting Design right, the shape of the product would be
subject matter of statutory protection of the rights conferred by the Act of

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.85 of 94
 2000, in the cases involving infringement of the said Design right, the
passing off right or action is permissible in law in order to prevent confusion
which can be caused by all other modes except the shape of the products
which are subject matter of the Design right. Thus, to say that preventing
the passing off right in shape of the article would lead to anomalous situation
leaving the confusion to happen in the market is not correct understanding of
law. In the subsisting Design right, the shape of the article would enjoy the
monopoly conferred for limited period of time by the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_302">Design Act</a> and the
confusion in the market can still be prevented by filing a passing off action
on the basis of the trade dress right if the infringer or any person besides
using the shape also uses get up or name or mark or any other sign which
may lead the consumer or unwary purchaser to believe the product is
emanated from the proprietor. This is the only reconciliation where under
one can preserve both the legislative intendments of Design right as well as
the public interest involving the confusion. Extending the bounds of passing
off action in the subsisting Design right would make the Design right under
the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_303">Designs Act</a> otiose and the said construction should be eschewed.
</p><p id="p_228">119. The principle of election of right is the only way in which both the
laws trade mark and <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_304">Design Act</a> can be harmoniously construed so that the
interpretation of one law may not have effect on the other adversely. This
will also preserve the policy underlying both the laws. The election of rights
principle was also followed by the Courts in America in the cases where
Design right was protected both by copyright as well as by patent. It is
altogether different matter that USA abandoned such principle later on after
accepting the policy of dual monopoly which acted in the interest of the
proprietors.

Benefits of multiple forms of Intellectual property protection authored by
Gordon J. Zimmerman published in Canadian Intellectual Property Review
volume 17 at page 345 published in Canada, the learned author in the said
article has extensively discussed about the overlapping of the rights in trade
marks rights in trade dress with that of Design right. After noticing the
various precedents from US courts which has been seen in the present case,
the learned author in conclusion of his paper suggested that the election of
rights as one of the safest mode to reconcile the conflicting overlap of the
monopoly rights. In the words of the learned author, it has been observed
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">        "Perhaps it is fair to put the creator of an industrial design to
        a choice: either accept a 10-year exclusive term of protection
        without proof of reputation, or risk losing any claim to
        distinctiveness by forgoing such protection. If the creator
        forgoes any monopoly design protection and nonetheless
        succeeds in establishing distinctiveness for the design, then
        the creator will be entitled to receive a potentially unlimited
        term of protection as a distinguishing guise or trade-mark.</blockquote>
<p id="p_231">        Perhaps that should be the reward for taking the risk that
        exclusivity will not be achieved. In contrast, the bargain for
        achieving a 10-year up-front monopoly by way of industrial
        design registration may be that no protection of the
        design thereafter, by trade-mark or otherwise, will be
        possible.                              (Emphasis Supplied)
        "Thus, it may be fair to deny the holder of an industrial design
        the option of effectively extending protection in the design
        itself, as a trademark, beyond the industrial design term of
        protection. However, if the creator of the design is willing to
        accept the risk that the mark may not become or remain
        distinctive, and forgo industrial design protection, it may be
        entitled to claim the benefit of trade-mark protection when it

        can show distinctiveness through extensive use. In contrast, the
       extension of protection for a design as a distinguishing guise
       or otherwise following expiry of an industrial design
       registration may be found to be likely unreasonably to limit
       the development of the art or industry in which the design has
       been used, and thus be prohibited." (Emphasis Supplied)
</p><p id="p_232">121. I find that the aforementioned excerpts from the paper presented by
the learned author in Canadian law journal fortify the view which I am
taking in the instant case which is that the conflict between the Design right
and passing off right which are mutually inconsistent from each other can be
resolved by putting a choice upon the proprietor by adopting the principle of
election of the rights.
</p><p id="p_233">122. The applicability of the principle of election of rights in the present
case would also translate the real intention of the proprietor who may either
genuinely intend to treat his product as novel shaped article or in alternative
intend to use it as trade mark. The proprietors who have genuine
intentions to get their products identified in the market as shape of the
goods shall continue to enjoy trade mark rights when they rightfully conduct
election between the remedies. The abuse of the process and policy of the
law would not stop till the time proprietors in order to extend their
monopoly rights continue to adopt inconsistent approaches to first treat
their article as novel shaped design after expiration of which gives right
to public to use free and thereafter attempting to again enjoy another
round of monopoly by violating the policy behind the law.
</p><p id="p_234">123. It is well settled that when there are two inconsistent remedies
prescribed under the law to a party and the party elects one of the remedies
and proceed further on one premise, then the party is by virtue of law of


CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.88 of 94
 election of the said remedy is estopped from going back and switching over
to other inconsistent remedy.
</p><p id="p_235">124. In this regard, kindly see the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Transcore Vs. Union of India &amp; Anr. (2008) 1 SCC 125 in paragraph 64 at
page 162. The observations being relevant are culled out hereinafter:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">       "In the light of the above discussion, we now examine the
       doctrine of election. There are three elements of election,
       namely, existence of two or more remedies; inconsistencies
       between such remedies and a choice of one of them. If any
       one of the three elements is not there, the doctrine will not
       apply. According to American Jurisprudence, 2d, Vol. 25, p.
       652, if in truth there is only one remedy, then the doctrine of
       election does not apply. In the present case, as stated above, the
       <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_305">NPA Act</a> is an additional remedy to the <a href="/doc/1683455/" id="a_306">DRT Act</a>. Together
       they constitute one remedy and, therefore, the doctrine of
       election does not apply. Even according to Snell's Principles of
       Equity (31st Edn., p. 119), the doctrine of election of
       remedies is applicable only when there are two or more co-
       existent remedies available to the litigants at the time of
       election which are repugnant and inconsistent. In any event,
       there is no repugnancy nor inconsistency between
       the two remedies, therefore, the doctrine of election has no
       application."                          (Emphasis Supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_236">125. It is clear from the definition that the Design includes shape and
configuration of the article and on the other hand definition of the mark
under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_307">Trade Marks Act</a> also includes the shape of the goods, which make
it clear that there exist two remedies on the same subject matter. The said
remedies are mutually inconsistent from each other concept wise (right to
prevent use versus right to exclude others), policy wise, monopoly wise and
many other respects as seen in above analysis, It has also been made clear
that the right of passing off cannot co-exist with the Design right as the very

 existence of the same along with Design right on the same subject
undermines the policy behind the Design law which is to confer limited
rights with no further extension. In such a case, proprietor or a suitor has to
necessarily elect the remedy either under the common law permissible in the
law of trademarks, or in the alternative, under the purely statutory remedy
which is the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_308">Designs Act</a> and the courts will then evaluate the rights
depending upon the provisions of the respective laws applicable.

the right holder in alternative to the design right under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_309">Design Act</a> to the
extent there exists an overlap relating to the shape of the articles. The rights
and actions in the passing off shall continue to be available if there
exists similarities in the trade dress or in any other way there is a
likelihood of confusion as to source which does not conflict with the
legislative policy of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_310">Designs Act</a> and subject matter of the Design
right.
</p><p id="p_238">127. It is equally noteworthy to mention that this court is concerned with a
limited question of the availability of the remedy of passing off in relation to
shape of the articles so far as it conflicts Design right forming subject matter
of registration, thus the features of the shape of the articles which do not
form the subject matter of the protection under the claim statement made in
the Design certificate can be a subject matter of the protection under the law
of passing off provided that the said features qualify all the tests for the
availability of the passing off right and distinctiveness as envisaged under
the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_311">Trade Marks Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_239">128. Thus, the answers to question (2) would be that there is no availability
of the remedy of passing off right seeking to protect the shape of the articles

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                      Page No.90 of 94
 which may be enforced alongside the enforcement of the statutory rights
conferred by the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_312">Design Act</a>. However, the remedy of passing off shall
continue to be available to prevent consumer confusion by all other modes
so far as they do not conflict with the protection of the Design right. All the
decisions of this court which seek to protect the shape of articles which are
subject matter of the Design registration by way of common law right and
creates an overlapping protection kind of situation hence contrary to law in
view of my discussion above.
</p><p id="p_240">129. In the end of the my answer to question no. 2 under reference, I would
like to reemphasize that the view which I have taken in relation to the
nonexistent right in common law in relation to expired design is based on the
avowed purpose of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_313">Design Act</a> and the nature of Design monopoly
which is akin and has trappings of patent. It needs no reiteration that once
the Design patent expires, the shape or embodiment of the article goes in
public domain. The authorities across the globe acknowledge the said
proposition. In such circumstances, it is too pressing for me to take a
contrary view which is legally unsustainable which is that the public domain
right which is implicit in the statutory cannot be encroached upon by judicial
extension of the monopoly rights.
</p><p id="p_241">130. The argument which has been sought to be canvassed against the right
of the public to use the shape of the goods in relation to expired design is
that such shape may have become distinct during the course of the time of
the use and might have attained a trade mark signification. I am of the view
that the said argument is fundamentally flawed and is against the basics
underlying the regime of Patent and Designs. Once, the proprietor has
chosen the root of the patent or monopoly akin to patent, the exclusive rights

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                     Page No.91 of 94
 vest in him for a limited period of time, at that point of time he enjoys
exclusively to the exclusion of the others. However, after the expiry, the
proprietor has a covenant with the law that the said shape, embodiment or
function which are subject matter of the patent or design shall go in public
domain. It is as a matter of law or operation of law, such shape or features as
a mandate of policy going into public domain. In such circumstances, it can
be said that now once the rights under the statute are exhausted, there subsist
another right under the distinguishing guise which may encroach of the right
of the public domain for all times to come and will inhibit the law to take its
own course.
</p><p id="p_242">Answer to Question 3
</p><p id="p_243">131. I have already arrived at the conclusion that there exists no possibility
where there can be an availability of the passing off right under the common
law in relation to the same subject matter which are shape of the articles
forming subject of the registration of Design. Thus, the answer to the
question No. 3 in so far as joining of the remedy of passing off during the
subsisting design right seeking a protection of the designable subject matter
in common law is concerned is in negative.
</p><p id="p_244">132. Therefore, the remedy of the passing off as available under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_314">Trade
Marks Act</a> cannot be joined with the suit for infringement of registered
Design so far as the said protection seeks to protect the shape of the product
comprising the same subject matter. The said remedy of passing off right
under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_315">Trade Marks Act</a> is available in alternative to Design right
conferred by the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_316">Design Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_245">133. I have also discussed in the preceding paragraphs that the remedy of
the passing off is still available in the relation to aspects relating to articles

CS(OS) No.1446/2011 &amp; CS(OS) No. 384/2008                       Page No.92 of 94
 like trade dress, signs, labels, trade name or in any other manner which seeks
to prevent the confusion so far as the same does not conflict with the Design
right. The passing off actions premised on such causes of action excepting
the designable subject matter which are not inconsistent with the scheme and
object of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_317">Design Act</a> can be joined together with the suit involving the
infringement of the Design right.
</p><p id="p_246">134. I shall now sum up my answers to the questions under the reference in
the following manner:
</p><p id="p_247">a)     A suit by the registered proprietor of Design for infringement of
       the registered design is not maintainable against another
       registered proprietor under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_318">Designs Act</a>, 2000 in so far as
       the registration covers the same features of the shape and
       configuration of the same article under the Design.
</p><p id="p_248">b)     The remedy of passing off in so far as it relates to claim of
       protection for shape of articles is not available for the purposes
       of enforcement of rights and remedies under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_319">Design Act</a>.
       The said remedy is clearly absent under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_320">Designs Act</a>
       considering the avowed objective of the Act of 2000 which is to
       provide limited protection with no unnecessary extension.
</p><p id="p_249">c)     The remedy of passing off in so far as it relates to claim of
       protection for shape of articles cannot be joined with the suit for
       infringement of the registered Design. The said remedy of
       passing off is available in alternative to the statutory protection
       conferred by the Design Right. For the purposes of the same,
       the suitor has to elect between the two inconsistent rights and
       remedies having distinct objects and policies.

 Additional legal points determined
</p><p id="p_251">a)     Notwithstanding the above said conclusion in (b) and (c), the
       remedy of passing off would continue to be available along
       with the infringement of registered designs and can be joined
       with the same in order to prevent consumer confusion which
       may be caused by the use of trade mark, get up, trade dress or in
       any other manner excepting the shape of the goods which is or
       was forming the subject matter of the registration of the Design.
</p><p id="p_252">b)     The remedy of the passing off in so far as the shape of the
       article is concerned shall also be available even during currency
       of the design monopoly or even after the expiry of same to the
       extent that the claim of the feature of the shape is not covered
       within the novelty claim under the Design monopoly rights and
       the said claim of the protection qualifies all the necessary
       ingredients of the Trade Mark.
</p><p id="p_253">c)     A remedy of passing off in so far as the shape of the article is
       concerned shall not be available even after the expiry of the
       Design to the extent the said feature of the shape of the article is
       covered within the novelty claim as made under the Design
       Right as after expiration of the Design, the novel shape claimed
       under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_321">Design Act</a> goes in public domain.
