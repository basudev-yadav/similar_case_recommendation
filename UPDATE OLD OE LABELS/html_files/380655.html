CIVIL APPEAL NO.   2408      OF 2007
(Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.19327 of 2006)




MARKANDEY KATJU, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.	Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3">2.	This appeal by special leave has been filed against the impugned 
judgment &amp; order 22.6.2006 of the Jharkhand High Court in Writ 
Petitions Nos. 482, 467, 493 and 466 of 2005.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">3.	Heard learned counsel for parties and perused the record.
</p>	
<p id="p_5">4.	The respondent, a company registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_1">Indian 
Companies Act</a>, 1913 is engaged inter alia in the execution of works 
contracts of designing, supplying, installation, fabrication, testing and 
commissioning of air-conditioning plants. The assessing authority 
acknowledged that the contracts in question were works contracts and 
the material supplied in the execution of the works contracts only are 
liable to be taxed.  However, the Sales Tax Authorities had sought to 
levy a uniform rate of tax @ 16% holding that in the instant case the 
incidence of tax is commensurate with actual transfer of property that 
takes place in the execution of works contract.   
</p>	
<p id="p_6">5.	Although the respondent had deposited with the appellant the 
entire amount of the sales tax charged and demanded @ 16%, it passed 
on to its customers sales tax restricted to the rate of 8% because in 
terms of the Circular letter No. 3971 dated 18.5.1984 issued by the 
Government of Bihar, Finance (Commercial Tax) Department 
(Annexure P-4 of the affidavit on behalf of the respondent with 
additional documents), the appellant was entitled to charge sales tax 
only @ 8%.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.	<a href="/doc/1425329/" id="a_2">In State of Madras vs. Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co. (Madras</a>) 
1959 SCR 379, this Court held that the State legislature cannot impose 
sales tax on a works contract because a works contract is an indivisible 
contract whereas sales tax can only be imposed on a sale.  The Court 
held that a works contract is not a sale.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.	Parliament, thereafter amended the Constitution of India by the 
Constitution (Forty Sixth) Amendment Act, 1982 introducing clause 
29A (b) in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_3">Article 366</a> therein.  The aforesaid clause 29-A states that 
the words "tax on the sale or purchase of goods" include inter alia  "(b) 
a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some 
other form) involved in the execution of a works contract". 
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.	<a href="/doc/557776/" id="a_4">In Gannon Dunkerley and Co. &amp; Ors. vs. State of Rajasthan 
&amp; Ors</a> (1993) 1 SCC 364, this Court specified the principles as to what 
could be taxed in a works contract.  In paragraph 47 of the judgment it 
has been observed that the value of the goods involved in the execution 
of a works contract will have to be determined after taking into account 
the value of the entire works contract and deducting therefrom the 
charges towards labour and services which would cover 

</p><p id="p_10">(a)	Labour charges for execution of the works;
</p><p id="p_11">(b)	Amount paid to a sub-contractor for labour and 
services;
</p>
<p id="p_12">(c)	Charges for planning, designing and architect's fees;
</p><p id="p_13">(d)	Charges for obtaining on hire or otherwise machinery 
and tools used for the execution of the works contract;
</p>
<p id="p_14">(e)	Cost of consumables such as water, electricity, fuel, 
etc. used in the execution of the works contract the 
property in which is not transferred in the course of 
execution of a works contract; and 


</p><p id="p_15">(f)	Cost of establishment of the contractor to the extent it 
is relatable to supply of labour and services;
</p>
<p id="p_16">(g)	Other similar expenses relatable to supply of labour 
and services;
</p>
<p id="p_17">(h)	Profit earned by the contractor to the extent it is 
relatable to supply of labour and services".
</p>

<p id="p_18">The value of these items, therefore, have to be deducted from the value 
of the entire works contract, because what can be taxed is only on the 
sale of goods and not anything else. The State legislature under Entry 
54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule can tax only on the sale or 
purchase of goods.  If an item does not come within List II or List III of 
the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, then it can only be the 
Central legislature i.e. the Parliament which can levy tax either under 
List I or under the residual provision contained in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_5">Article 248</a> thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_19">9.	Section 21 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, as amended states:
</p>
<p id="p_20">"Sec. 21. - Taxable Turnover  (1) For the purpose of 
this part the taxable turnover of a dealer shall be that 
part of his gross turnover which remains after 
deduction therefrom -
</p>
<p id="p_21">(a)(i) in case of the works contract the amount 
of labour and any other charges in the manner and to 
the extent prescribed".
</p>

<p id="p_22">10.	Rule 13A of the Bihar Sales Tax Rules which was also amended 
by a notification dated 1st February, 2000 read as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_23">"Rule 13A.  Deduction in case of works contract on 
account of labour charges.   [if the dealer fails to 
produce any account or the accounts produced are 
unreliable] deduction under sub-clause (i) of clause 
</p><p id="p_24">(a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_6">section 21</a> on account of 
labour charges in the case of works contract from 
gross turnover shall be equal to the following 
percentages."
</p>
<p id="p_25">11.	The aforesaid provisions have been adopted by the State of 
Jharkhand vide notification dated 15.12.2000 and thus are applicable in 
the State of Jharkhand.
</p>
<p id="p_26">12.	Interpretation of the amended <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_7">Section 21(1)</a> and the newly 
substituted Rule 13A fell for consideration of a Division Bench of the 
Patna High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1075561/" id="a_8">Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd. vs. State of 
Bihar</a> 134 STC 354.  The Patna High Court in the said decision 
observed as under: 
</p>
<p id="p_27">"Rule 13A unfortunately does not talk of "any other 
charges".  Rule 13A unfortunately does not take into 
consideration that under the Rules the deduction in relation 
to any other charges in the manner and to the extent were 
also to be prescribed.  Rule 13A cannot be said to be an 
absolute follow-up legislation to sub-clause (i) of clause (a) 
of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_9">section 21(1)</a>.  When the law provides that something is 
to be prescribed in the Rules then that thing must be 
prescribed in the Rules to make the provisions workable 
and constitutionally valid.  In the matter of Gannon 
Dunkerley &amp; Co. (1993) 88 STC 204 the Supreme Court 
observed that as sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_10">section 5</a> and sub-rule 
(2) of rule 29 of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act and the Rules 
were not providing for particular deductions, the same were 
invalid.  In the present matter the constitutional provision 
of law says that particular deductions would be provided 
but unfortunately nothing is provided in relation to the 
other charges either in <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_11">section 21</a> itself or in the rules 
framed in exercise of the powers conferred by section 58 of 
the Bihar Finance Act.
</p>
<p id="p_28">					...
</p>
<p id="p_29">In our considered opinion sub-clause (i) of clause (a) 
of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_12">section 21(1)</a> read with rule 13A of the Rules did not 
make sub-clause (1) fully workable because the manner and 
extent of deduction relating to any other charges has not 
been provided prescribed by the State."
</p>

<p id="p_30">13.	We fully agree with the view taken by the Patna High Court in 
the aforesaid decision.  It is not merely the labour charges which are 
deductible from the value of the works contract, but all other 
charges/amounts also, except the value of the goods sold in execution 
of the works contract.  This is because only the value of the goods sold 
can be taxed as sales tax.  It may be mentioned that the respondent had 
initially only claimed deduction of labour charges, but that was in view 
of the understanding of the law at that time.  The matter became clear 
only after the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/557776/" id="a_13">Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co. vs. 
State of Rajasthan</a> (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_31">14.	It may further be mentioned that the observations made by the 
Division Bench of the High Court about the rate of tax were 
unnecessary, and they are therefore set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_32">15.	We also agree with the view taken in the impugned judgment that 
the proceedings in question were beyond limitation.  It appears that 
against three assessment orders for the period 1990-91, 1991-92 and 
1992-93, the respondent preferred three appeals i.e. JUSTA 56/97-98, 
57/97-98 and 58/97-98 before the Joint Commissioner, Commercial 
Taxes (Appeal), Jamshedpur Division, Jamshedpur.  The appellate 
authority passed a common order on 31st August, 1998 and 
communicated the decision vide Memo No. 2177 dated 5th November, 
1998 to the assessing authority and other officers.  The assessing 
authority was directed to make a re-assessment.  As per the proviso to 
Section 24 of the Bihar Finance Act, the assessing authority was 
supposed to complete and pass the re-assessment order pursuant to the 
remand by 5th November, 2000, two years from the date of 
communication of such order to the assessing authority.  However, the 
assessment was not concluded and fresh assessment on remand was 
made on 27th November, 2004 i.e. after more than six years of 
communication of the said order.  Hence, it was clearly time barred.
</p>
<p id="p_33">16.	From the records, it appears that the appellate order passed on 
31st August, 1998 was communicated to the assessing authority vide 
Memo No. 2177 dated 5th November, 1998.  The respondent obtained a 
certified copy of the same in January, 1999.  Memo No. 204 dated 6th 
August, 2003, as referred to by the counsel for the State is the second 
time communication, which was only a reminder.  Thus, the appellate 
order having been communicated to the assessing authority vide Memo 
No. 2177 dated  5th November, 1998 for the purposes of limitation the 
period will start from 5th November, 1998 and will be complete on 5th 
November, 2000 i.e. two years from the date of communication of such 
order to the assessing authority. We accordingly hold that the 
assessment order made after remand on 27th November, 2004 and the 
consequential demand of notice raised in pursuance of such order of re-
assessment, all dated 29th November, 2004 are time-barred under 
Section 24 of the Bihar Finance Act.
</p>
<p id="p_34">17.	However, the contention of the respondent herein is that the 
assessment should be directed to be completed on the basis that the rate 
of tax would be 8%.  As at present advised, this Court need not go into 
the said question.
</p>
<p id="p_35">18.	Thus we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment.  The appeal 
is accordingly dismissed.   No costs.
