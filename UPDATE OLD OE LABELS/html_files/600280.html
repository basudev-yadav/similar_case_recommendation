HEADNOTE:
%
     The  first	  respondent  was  appointed  a	 Sub-Charge,
Cantonment General Hospital, Lucknow by the Cantonment Board
by an  appointment letter dated 23.4.1969, and was confirmed
in that	 post on 1.12.1969. The conditions of service of the
employees of  the Cantonment  Board, a statutory board, were
governed by  the provisions of the Cantonment Funds Servants
Rules, 1937. At the time of appointment, the services of the
respondent were	 not transferable  as per  the provisions of
the Rules  as then  prevailing. His  appointment letter also
did not include any condition for transfer from one Board to
another.
     By a  notification dated  16.12.1972,  the	 Rules	were
amended and  a new rule, being rule 5-C was added to provide
for the	 transfer of  the services  of the  employees of the
Cantonment Boards from one post in one Board to another post
in another Board within the same State.
     The G.O.C.-in-Chief, Central Command by his order dated
October 27,  1986 transferred  the first respondent from the
Cantonment General  Hospital,  Lucknow,	 to  the  Cantonment
General Hospital, Varanasi, and the incumbent at Varanasi in
turn being  transferred to  the Cantonment General Hospital,
Bareilly.
     Being aggrieved  by the  order of transfer passed under
rule 5-C  of the  Rules, the  first respondent	filed a writ
petition in  the High  Court challenging the validity of the
order of  transfer on  the ground  that rule  5-C was  ultra
vires the  provisions of  the <a href="/doc/229158/" id="a_4">Cantonments  Act</a> and  as such,
void.
63
     The High  Court struck  down rule	5-C as	being  ultra
vires the  provisions of  the <a href="/doc/229158/" id="a_5">Cantonments Act</a>, 1924 and held
that the  services of  the employees of the Cantonment Board
are neither  centralised nor  is there	a common State level
service and  that rule	5-C having provided for the transfer
of the	employees of  one Board to another Board by the GOC-
in-Chief, Central Command is beyond the rule making power of
the Central  Government as  contained in  clause (c) of sub-
section (2)  of <a href="/doc/812859/" id="a_6">section	 280</a> of	 the Cantonments  Act as  it
stood before  it was  amended. It  accordingly	quashed	 the
order of  transfer dated October 27, 1988 passed by the GOC-
in-Chief, Central Command.
     In the  appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf
of the	appellants: (1)	 that after  the amendment of clause
(c) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/812859/" id="a_7">Section 280</a> of the Cantonments Act
conferring on  the Central  Government the power to lay down
the conditions	of service  of the  employees of the Boards,
which include the power to make rules for transfer, rule 5-C
is valid being in conformity with the provisions of the rule
making power  under <a href="/doc/512721/" id="a_8">section  7</a>.80(2)(c) of  the Act, and (2)
that the  respondent would not be in the least prejudiced by
the transfer  inasmuch as  full safeguard  has been provided
for in rule 5-C.
     On behalf	of the respondent it was contended that: (1)
service under  the Cantonment  Board is	 not  a	 centralised
service or  a service  at  the	State  level,  and  (2)	 the
transfer of an employee from one Cantonment Board to another
would  mean  the  termination  of  the	appointment  of	 the
employees  in	the  Cantonment	  Board	 from  which  he  is
transferred and a fresh appointment in the Board where he is
so transferred.
     Dismissing the Appeal,
^
     HELD: 1.  The High Court was justified in striking down
rule 5-C  of the Rules and in quashing the order of transfer
of the respondent. [172G]
     2. Rules  framed under the provisions of a statute form
part of	 the statute. Rules have statutory force. But before
a rule	can have  the effect  of a  statutory provision	 two
conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (1) it must conform to
the provisions	of the statute under which it is framed; and
(2) it	must also  come within	the scope and purview of the
rule making  power of  the authority  framing the  rule.  If
either of  these two conditions is not fulfilled the rule so
framed would be void. [69F-G]
     3. When Rule 5-C was inserted in the Rules, it was void
as being
64
contrary to  and in  excess of	the rule making power of the
Central Government  as contained in the unamended clause (c)
of sub-section	(2) of	<a href="/doc/812859/" id="a_9">Section 280</a>  of the Act. It does not
become valid  merely because of the amendment of clause (c),
conferring power  on the  Central Government  to frame rules
relating to conditions of service.[69C]
     4. The  position remains  the  same  even	though	sub-
section (2)  of <a href="/doc/1236436/" id="a_10">Section	 281</a> of	 the  Act  has	specifically
provided that  after the rules are framed and published they
shall have  effect as if enacted in the Act. In spite of the
provision of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1236436/" id="a_11">Section 281</a>, any rule framed
under the  <a href="/doc/229158/" id="a_12">Cantonments Act</a>  has to fulfil the aforementioned
two conditions regarding their validity. [69G-<a href="/doc/1302397/" id="a_13">H]
     Jestamani v. Scindia Steam Navigation Company</a>, [1961] 2
SCR 811, distinguished.
     5. The  Cantonment Board  are statutory  and autonomous
bodies controlled  entirely by	the  <a href="/doc/229158/" id="a_14">Cantonments  Act</a>.	Each
Cantonment Board  is an	 independent body functioning within
its  limited  jurisdiction.  The  Board	 is  the  appointing
authority  of	its  employees.	  The  services	  under	 the
Cantonment Board  is not  a centralised	 service nor is it a
service at the State level. [70C]
     6. One  autonomous body cannot transfer its employee to
another autonomous  body even  within the same State, unless
the services  of the employees of these two bodies are under
a centralised or State-level service. [70E-F]
     In the  instant case, the GOC-in-Chief, Central Command
is not	the appointing	authority of  the respondent  or the
employees of  the Cantonment  Board, and  so transfer of the
respondent by the GOC-in-Chief is not permissible. [70E]
     <a href="/doc/1571654/" id="a_15">Om Prakash	 Rana v.  Swarup Singh	Tomar</a>, [1986]  3 SCC
118, referred to.
     7. Even  in spite	of substituted	clause (c)  of	sub-
section (2)  of <a href="/doc/133595906/" id="a_16">Section	 280</a> the Central Government will not
be entitled  to frame rules for transfer of an employee from
one Cantonment	Board to  another within  the State  for the
reasons: (t)  the Cantonment  Boards are  autonomous bodies;
(2) the	 service under	the Cantonment	Board is  neither  a
centralised service  nor is  it a service at the State-level
and  (3)   any	such  transfer	of  an	employee  will	mean
termination of service of the
65
employee  in   the  Cantonment	 Board	from   where  he  is
transferred and	 a fresh appointment by the Cantonment Board
which he joins on such transfer. [72B-C]
     8. The  Central Government, however, has power to frame
rules about transfer of servants of the Board in exercise of
its powers under clause (c) of subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/812859/" id="a_17">Section 280</a>
of the	Act within  the region	in respect  of which  it has
jurisdiction. For  example, the	 respondent in	the  instant
case,  could   be  transferred	from  one  hospital  of	 the
Cantonment Board,  Lucknow, to	another hospital  under	 the
same Board. [72E-F]
     9. The  Central  Government  had  better  consider	 the
question  of   making  the   Cantonment	 Board	 Service   a
centralised service  so 85 to enable one Cantonment Board to
transfer its employees to another Cantonment Board. [72D],,

<p id="p_5">     The respondent, Dr. Subhas Chandra Yadav, was appointed
a Sub-Charge,  Cantonment General  Hospital, Lucknow, by the
Cantonment Board  by the appointment letter dated 23.4.1969.
He was	confirmed in  that post	 on 1.12.1969  by  an  order
issued by the Cantonment Board. The conditions of service of
the employees  of the Cantonment Board, which is a statutory
body, are  governed by	the provisions	of the Rules. At the
time of the appointment of the respondent, his services were
not transferable  as per  the provisions  of the  Rules then
prevailing. His	 appointment letter also did not include any
condition for transfer from one Board to another.
</p><p id="p_6">     By a  notification dated  16.12.1972,  the	 Rules	were
amended and  a new  rule, being	 rule 5-C  was added  to the
Rules. Rule S-C reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "R.5-C. (1)  The service  of a  servant  shall  be
	  transferable from one post in one Board to another
	  post in another Board.

<p id="p_7">     For the  first time, rule 5-C provided for the transfer
of the	services of  the employees  of the Cantonment Boards
from one  post in one Board to another post in another Board
within the same State. The GOC-in-Chief, Central Command, by
his order  dated October 27, 1986 transferred the respondent
from  the  Cantonment  General	Hospital,  Lucknow,  to	 the
Cantonment General  Hospital, Varanasi,	 in place of one Dr.
Bansal, who  was also  transferred by  the same order to the
Cantonment General Hospital, Bareilly.
</p><p id="p_8">     Being aggrieved  by the  said order  of transfer passed
under rule  5-C of  the Rules,	the respondent	filed a writ
petition  in   the  Allahabad  High  Court  challenging	 the
validity of the order of transfer on the ground that rule 5-
C was  ultra vires the provisions of the Cantonment Act and,
as such, void.
</p><p id="p_9">     As has  been stated  already, the High Court has struck
down rule  5-C holding, inter alia, that the services of the
employees of  the Cantonment  Board are	 neither centralised
nor is	there a	 common State-level  service  and  that	 the
impugned rule  5-C, having  provided for the transfer of the
employees of one Board to another Board by the GOC-in-Chief,
Central Command, is beyond the rule making power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">68</span>
of the Central Government as contained in clause (c) of sub-
section (2) of section 280 of the Cantonment Act as it stood
before it was amended. Hence this appeal.
</p><p id="p_10">     Section 280  of the Cantonment Act confers power on the
Central Government  to make  rules. The	 relevant portion of
section 280 of the Cantonment Act is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "S.  280.   POWER  To	  MAKE	RULES:	The  Central

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">     Clause (c)	 of  sub-section  (2)  of  <a href="/doc/812859/" id="a_18">section  280</a>	 was
substituted by the amendment of the Cantonment Act by Act XV
of 1983.  Before such  amendment in  1983, clause (c) was as
follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	  "(c).	 the   appointment,   control	supervision,
	  suspension, removal,	dismissal and  punishment of
	  servants of Boards;"</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     It is  apparent that  before the  amendment, clause (c)
did not	 confer on  the Central	 Government power  to  frame
rules regarding	 conditions  of	 service  which	 necessarily
include transfer  of the  employees of the Boards. Rule 5-C,
which was  inserted in	the Rules  by a	 notification  dated
November  23,	1972  providing	 for  the  transfer  of	 the
employees of  the Cantonment  Boards, is  on the  face of it
contrary to the rule making power of the Central Government,
as it stood before the amendment of the Act in 1983.</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">69</span>
<p id="p_11">     It is,  however, contended	 by Mr.	 Raja Ram  Aggarwal,
learned Counsel	 appearing on behalf of the appellants, that
after the  amendment of	 clause (c)  of sub-section  (2)  of
section 280 of the Cantonment Act, conferring on the Central
Government the	power to  lay down the conditions of service
of the	employees of  the Boards, which include the power to
make rules  for transfer,  rule 5-C is valid, being quite in
conformity with	 the provisions	 of the	 rule  making  power
under section 280(2)(c) of the Cantonment Act. We are unable
to accept the contention.
</p><p id="p_12">     When rule	5-C was inserted into the Rules, it was void
as being  contrary to and in excess of the rule making power
of the	Central Government  as contained  in  the  unamended
clause	(c)  of	 sub-section  (2)  of  section	280  of	 the
Cantonment Act.	 It does  not become valid merely because of
the amendment of clause (c), inter alia, conferring power on
the Central Government to frame rules relating to conditions
of service.
</p><p id="p_13">     Our attention  has been  drawn to the provision of sub-
section (2)  of section	 281 of	 the Cantonment	 Act,  which
provides  that	all  rules  made  under	 the  Act  shall  be
published in  the official Gazette and in such other manner,
if any,	 as the	 Central Government  may direct and, on such
publication, shall  have effect as if enacted in the Act. It
is urged  on behalf  of the  appellants that in view of sub-
section (2)  of <a href="/doc/1236436/" id="a_19">section	 281</a>, rule  5-C became a part of the
statute and, accordingly, the question of its being contrary
to the	provisions of  the Cantonment  Act does	 not at	 all
arise.
</p><p id="p_14">     This contention  is unsound.  It is  well settled	that
rules framed  under the provisions of a statute form part of
the statute. In other words, rules have statutory force. But
before a  rule can have the effect of a statutory provision,
two conditions	must  be  fulfilled,  namely,  (1)  it	must
conform to  the provisions  of the statute under which it is
framed; and  (2) it  must also	come within  the  scope	 and
purview of  the rule  making power  of the authority framing
the  rule.   If	 either	 of  these  two	 conditions  is	 not
fulfilled, the	rule so	 framed would  be void. The position
remains the  same even though sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1236436/" id="a_20">section 281</a>
of the	Act has	 specifically provided	that after the rules
are framed  and published  they	 shall	have  effect  as  if
enacted in  the	 Act.  In  other  words,  in  spite  of	 the
provision of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1236436/" id="a_21">section 281</a>, any rule framed
under the  Cantonment Act  has to  fulfil the two conditions
mentioned above	 for their validity. The observation of this
Court in  <a href="/doc/1302397/" id="a_22">Jestamani v.	Scindia	 Steam	Navigation  Company</a>,
[1961] 2 SCR 811,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">70</span>
relied upon  by Mr. Aggarwal, that a contract of service may
be transferred	by a  statutory provision,  does not  at all
help the  appellants. There  can be no doubt that a contract
of service  may be  transferred by statutory provisions, but
before a rule framed under a statute is regarded a statutory
provision or a part of the statute, it must fulfil the above
two  conditions.   Rule	 5-C   was  framed  by	the  Central
Government in  excess of  its rule making power as contained
in clause  (c) of  sub-section (2)  of section	280  of	 the
Cantonment Act	before its  amendment by the substitution of
clause (c); it is, therefore, void.
</p><p id="p_15">     It is  not disputed  that	the  Cantonment	 Boards	 are
statutory and  autonomous bodies  controlled entirely by the
Cantonment Act. Each Cantonment Board is an independent body
functioning within  its limited	 jurisdiction. The  Board is
the appointing authority of its employees. The service under
the Cantonment	Board is not a centralised service nor is it
a service at the State-level.
</p><p id="p_16">     There is much force in the contention of the respondent
that  as  service  under  the  Cantonment  Board  is  not  a
centralised service  or a  service at  the State-level,	 the
transfer of an employee from one Cantonment Board to another
would mean the termination of appointment of the employee in
the Cantonment	Board from  which he  is transferred  and  a
fresh appointment  in the  Board where he is so transferred.
The GOC-in-Chief,  Central Command,  is not  the  appointing
authority  of	the  respondent	 or  the  employees  of	 the
Cantonment Board,  and so  transfer of the respondent by the
GOC-in-Chief  is   not	permissible.   In  any	 event,	 one
autonomous body	 cannot transfer  its  employee	 to  another
autonomous body	 even within  the  same	 State,	 unless	 the
services of  the employees  of these  two bodies are under a
centralised or a State-level service. In this connection, we
may refer  to a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1571654/" id="a_23">Om Prakash Rana v.
Swarup Singh  Tomar</a>, [1986]  3 SCC  118. Pathak,  J. (as His
Lordship then  was)  speaking  for  the	 Court	observed  as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	  "As is  clear by now, the fundamental basis of the
	  contention that  the power  of transfer  under the
	  Education Act	 and its  Regulations  continues  in
	  force even  after the	 enactment of  the  <a href="/doc/1340538/" id="a_24">Services
	  Commission Act</a>  rests on  the assumption  that the
	  power of appointment does not include the power of
	  transfer.  In	  our  opinion,	 the  assumption  is
	  unsustainable. The  scheme under the Education Act
	  envisages  the   appointment	of  a  Principal  in
	  relation to a specific college. The appointment is
	  in relation to that college and to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">71</span>
	  no other Moreover, different colleges may be owned
	  by different bodies or organisations, so that each
	  Principal serves  a different employer. Therefore,
	  on filling the office of a Principal to a college,
	  a new	 contract of  employment with  a  particular
	  employer comes  into existence. There is no State-
	  level service	 to which  Principals are appointed.
	  Had that  been so,  it would have been possible to
	  say that  when a Principal is transferred from one
	  college  to	another	 no   fresh  appointment  is
	  involved. But	 when a	 Principal is  appointed  in
	  respect of  a particular college and is thereafter
	  transferred as  a Principal  of another college it
	  can hardly be doubted that a new appointment comes
	  into existence.  Although the	 process of transfer
	  may be governed by considerations and move through
	  a  machinery	different  from	 the  considerations
	  governing the appointment of a person ab initio as
	  Principal, the  nature of  the transaction  is the
	  same, namely,	 that of appointment, and that is so
	  whether  the	 appointment   be   through   direct
	  recruitment, through	promotion from	the teaching
	  staff of  the same institution or by transfer from
	  another institution."</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">     The observation  extracted above  clearly supports 'the
contention  made  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  that	 the
employees of  one Cantonment  Board cannot be transferred to
another Cantonment  Board inasmuch  as the service under the
Cantonment Board  is not  a centralised service or a service
at the State-level.
</p><p id="p_18">     Mr. Aggarwal,  however,  submits  that  the  respondent
would not  be in  the least prejudiced by the transfer in as
much as	 full safeguard	 has been  provided for in rule 5-C.
The question whether the interest of the transferee has been
protected or  full safeguard  has been	provided for by rule
5-C  is	 quite	irrelevant,  if	 it  is	 invalid  and  void.
Moreover, the  provisions of  rule 5-C	are clumsy  and lack
clarity	 and   a  transfer   may   affect   the	  transferee
prejudicially. It is not necessary for us to discuss how the
provisions of rule 5-C may be prejudicial to the interest of
an employee  transferred to  another Cantonment Board within
the State,  for, we  are of  the view that rule 5-C is ultra
vires the  provision of the rule making power of the Central
Government under the Cantonment Act.
</p><p id="p_19">     The  question,   however,	is   whether   the   Central
Government is  entitled to  frame rules	 for transfer of the
employees of  the Cantonment  Boards under  the	 substituted
clause (c) of sub-section (2) of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">72</span>
section 280  of the  Cantonment Act.  It is  true that under
clause (c),  as it  now stands,	 the Central  Government can
frame rules  pertaining to  conditions	of  service  of	 the
Cantonment Board  employees. But,  in our  opinion, even  in
spite of substituted clause (c), the Central Government will
not be	entitled to  frame rules for transfer of an employee
from one  Cantonment Board  to another	within the State for
the reasons  stated  already,  namely,	(1)  the  Cantonment
Boards are  autonomous bodies;	(2) the	 service  under	 the
Cantonment Board  is neither a centralised service nor is it
a service  at the  State level; and (3) any such transfer of
an employee will mean termination of service of the employee
in the	Cantonment Board  from where he is transferred and a
fresh appointment  by the Cantonment Board which he joins on
such transfer.
</p><p id="p_20">     So long  as the  Cantonment Board service is not made a
centralised service or at least a State-level service, there
can be	no transfer  from one  Cantonment Board	 to  another
Cantonment  Board   within  the	  same	State.	The  Central
Government has	better consider	 the question  of making the
Cantonment Board  service a  centralised service  so  as  to
enable one  Cantonment Board  to transfer  its employees  to
another Cantonment Board.
</p><p id="p_21">     As has  been  held	 by  the  High	Court,	the  Central
Government has	power to  frame rules  about the transfer of
the servants  of the  Board in	exercise of its powers under
clause (c)  of sub-section  (2) of  <a href="/doc/812859/" id="a_25">section 280</a>	 of the	 Act
within the  region in  respect of which it has jurisdiction.
For example,  the respondent  could be	transferred from one
hospital  of  the  Cantonment  Board,  Lucknow,	 to  another
hospital  under	  the  same   Board.  But  that	 apart,	 the
Cantonment Act	does not authorise the Central Government to
frame rules  for  transfer  from  one  Cantonment  Board  to
another.
</p><p id="p_22">     The High  Court  was,  therefore,	quite  justified  in
striking down  rule 5-C	 of the	 Rules and  in quashing	 the
impugned order of transfer of the respondent.
</p><p id="p_23">     For the  reasons aforesaid,  the judgment	of the	High
Court is  affirmed and this Appeal is dismissed. There will,
however, be no order as to costs.
</p><pre id="pre_2">N.V.K.					   Appeal dismissed.
