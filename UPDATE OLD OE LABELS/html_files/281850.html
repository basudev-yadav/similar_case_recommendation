</p>
<p id="p_2">	The validity of Rule 10(1) of the West Bengal Services 
(Death-cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules, 1971 [for short 'the 
Rules'] is in question in this appeal.  The Rules have been 
framed in exercise of power under proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_1">Article 309</a> of 
the Constitution of India.  Rule 10(1) provides for 
withholding of pension and reads as under :
"10. Right of the Governor to 
withhold pension in certain cases.
(1) The Governor reserves to himself 
the right of withholding of withdrawing 
a pension or any part of it whether 
permanently or for a specified period, 
and the right of ordering the recovery 
from a pension of the whole or part of 
any pecuniary loss caused to 
Government, if the pensioner is found 
in a departmental or judicial 
proceeding to have been guilty of grave 
misconduct or negligence, during the 
period of his service, including service 
rendered on re-employment after 
retirement :
</p><p id="p_3">	Provided that 
</p><p id="p_4">(a)	such departmental proceeding if 
instituted while the officer was in 
service, whether before his 
retirement or during his re-
</p><p id="p_5">employment, shall after the final 
retirement of the officer, be 
deemed to be a proceeding under 
this article and shall be continued 
and concluded by the authority 
by which it was commenced in 
the same manner as if the officer 
had continued in service;
</p><p id="p_6">(b)	such departmental proceedings, if 
not instituted while the officer 
was in service, whether before his 
retirement or during his re-
</p><p id="p_7">employment
</p><p id="p_8">(i)	shall not be instituted save 
with the sanction of the 
Governor;
</p><p id="p_9">(ii)	shall not be in respect of any 
event which took place more 
than four years before such 
institution; and
</p><p id="p_10">(iii)	shall be conducted by such 
authority and in such place 
as the Governor may direct 
and in accordance with the 
procedure applicable to 
departmental proceedings in 
which an order of dismissal 
from service could be made 
in relation to the officer 
during his service;
</p><p id="p_11">(c)	no such judicial proceeding, if not 
instituted while the officer was in 
service, whether before his 
retirement or during his re-
</p><p id="p_12">employment shall be instituted in 
respect of a cause of action which 
arose on an event which took 
place more than four years before 
such institution; and
</p><p id="p_13">(d)	the Public Service Commission, 
West Bengal, shall be consulted 
before final orders are passed.
</p><p id="p_14">Explanation.For the purpose of this 
article
</p><p id="p_15"> (a)	a departmental proceeding shall 
be deemed to have been instituted 
on the date on which the 
statement of charges is issued to 
the officer or pensioner, or if the 
officer has been placed under 
suspension from an earlier date, 
on such date; and
</p><p id="p_16">(b)	a judicial proceeding shall be 
deemed to have been instituted
</p><p id="p_17">(i)	in the case of criminal 
proceeding, on the date on 
which the complaint or 
report of police officer, on 
which the Magistrate takes 
cognizance, is made, and
</p><p id="p_18">(ii)	in the case of a civil 
proceeding, on the date on 
which the plaint is presented 
or, as the case may be, an 
application is made to a Civil 
Court."	
</p>
<p id="p_19">While granting leave to examine the vires of Rule 10(1), 
it was directed that even if the appeal succeeds, the benefit 
available to respondent No. 1 as per the judgment of the 
High Court will not be recalled.
</p><p id="p_20">	The High Court by the impugned judgment has held 
Rule 10(1) to be ultra vires the provisions of Articles 19(1)(f) 
and 31(1) of the Constitution.  It was held that the pension 
was a property and its payment does not depend upon the 
discretion of the Government.
</p><p id="p_21">	Pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet-will and 
the pleasure of the Government and to receive pension is a 
valuable right of a Government servant is a well-settled legal 
proposition.  The question in the present case, however, is 
not about the deprivation of the said right by the 
Government by an executive order but is about the 
constitutional validity of Rule 10(1) providing for 
withholding of pension or part thereof in certain cases.
	Articles 19(1)(f) and 31(1) have been repealed by the 
Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 w.e.f. 
20th June, 1979.  The right to property is no longer a 
fundamental right.  It is now a constitutional right, as 
provided in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution.  Right to 
receive pension was a fundamental right at the time of 
framing of Rules in 1971. The question is whether a Rule 
framed under proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_3">Article 309</a> of the Constitution 
providing for withholding of the pension would ipso facto be 
ultra vires, being violative of <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_4">Article 19(1)(f)</a> as it stood in 
1971 when Rules were framed.
</p><p id="p_22">	The High Court has, in the impugned judgment, made 
reference to a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1566/" id="a_5">Deokinandan 
Prasad v. The State of Bihar and Ors</a>. [(1971) 2 SCC 
330]  for coming to the conclusion that the rule in question 
is ultra vires.  In the said case, this Court held that the right 
to receive pension was wrongly withheld by an executive 
order.  The Judgment in Deokinandan Prasad's case in 
fact lends support to the vires of the rule since it was held 
in that case that an employee can be deprived of the 
pension by an authority of law.  That authority, in the 
present case, is contained in the rules [Rule 10(1)], that 
were framed providing for withholding of the pension.
	Various State Rules or Regulations vest power for 
withholding or reduction of pension on compliance of 
principles of natural justice.  The question of an order 
withholding or reducing pension being invalid and bad in 
law on a legally permissible ground is one thing but to hold 
the rule ultra vires is another.  <a href="/doc/592033/" id="a_6">In State of Uttar Pradesh 
v. Brahm Datt Sharma and Anr</a>. [(1987) 2 SCC 179], this 
Court observed that if the Government incurs pecuniary 
loss on account of misconduct or negligence of a 
Government servant and if he retires from service before any 
departmental proceedings are taken against him, it is open 
to the State Government to initiate departmental 
proceedings, and if in those proceedings, he is found guilty 
of misconduct, negligence or any other such act or omission 
as a result of which Government is put to pecuniary loss, 
the State Government is entitled to withhold, reduce or 
recover the loss suffered by it by forfeiture or reduction of 
pension.  <a href="/doc/315432/" id="a_7">In State of Punjab v. K.R. Erry</a> [(1973) 1 SCC 
120], it was held that the State Government could not direct 
cut in pension of officers without giving a reasonable 
opportunity of hearing.  <a href="/doc/1867924/" id="a_8">In State of Maharashtra v. M.H. 
Mazumdar</a> [(1988) 2 SCC 52], it was observed that the 
State Government's power to reduce or withhold pension by 
taking proceedings against a Government servant, even 
after his retirement is expressly preserved by the rules.
	Rule 10(1) is the authority of law under which the 
pension could be withheld on compliance of stipulations of 
the rule.  We are unable to appreciate how such a rule could 
be held ultra vires even at a point of time when pension was 
a property to which <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_9">Article 19(1)(f)</a> was applicable.
	In view of the above, we set aside the impugned 
judgment to the extent it declares Rule 10(1) ultra vires.  
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
