JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">			 O R D E R
     This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment
of the	Division Bench of the Madras High Court made in W.P.
No. 6169  of 1983  on April  22,  1991.	 Notification  under
<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_1">Section 4(1)</a>  of the  Land Acquisition	Act (Act  1 of 1894)
(for short,  'the Act')	 was published	on August  29,	1975
acquiring large	 extent of  land for  planned development of
K.K. Nagar  in Madras  City. The declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_2">Section 6</a>
of the	Act was	 published on  September 28, 1978. The award
under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_3">Section  11</a> of the Act was made in February, 1983. The
writ petition  was filed  on July  28, 1983  questioning the
notification under  <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_4">Section 4(1)</a>  of the  Act on  the ground
that the  notification	was  vague  and	 invalid  since	 the
Government  had	  not	formulated   specific	scheme	 for
construction of	 the houses.  That contention  found  favour
with  the   High  Court	 and  consequently  it	quashed	 the
notification in	 the first  instance, which order was upheld
by this	 Court in <a href="/doc/648753/" id="a_5">State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr. vs. A. Mohammed
Yousef &amp;  Ors</a>.	[(1991)	 4  SCC	 224].	Following  the	said
decision, this writ petition along with other writ petitions
was allowed  by the  Division Bench.  This Court in <a href="/doc/488907/" id="a_6">State of
Tamil Nadu  &amp; Ors.  vs. L. Krishnan &amp; Ors</a>. etc. [JT 1995 (8)
SC 1]  had held that the scheme as envisaged under the Tamil
Nadu Housing  Board Act	 was not  required to  be completely
formulated before  publication	of  the	 notification  under
<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_7">Section 4(1)</a>  of the  Act. The notification on that account,
therefore, was not vague. Same contention has been raised in
this appeal; but specific argument was made at the time that
there is  distinguishing feature  on factual  background and
that, therefore,  it was  required to  be  separately  death
with. Accordingly,  this appeal	 was separated. Thus, we are
hearing this appeal independently.
</p><p id="p_2">     Shri  A.	Mariarputham,  learned	 counsel   for	 the
appellants, contended  that the	 respondents had  laid their
claim on  the basis  that the  sanction for  layout from the
Director, Town Planning was obtained as early as in 1970 and
the notifications were issued by the Government from time to
time  excluding	  such	lands	and  on	  that	premise	 the
respondents claimed  exclusion.	 But  the  Government  after
elaborate consideration	 in G.O.Ms.  No. 583 dated March 11,
1983 had  withdrawn the	 earlier notifications	and  several
writ petitions	were filed  after that order was passed. The
foundation on the basis of which the writ petition was filed
was  knocked   of  its	bottom.	 The  High  Court  was	not,
therefore, right  in granting the relief to the respondents.
Dr.  Shankar   Ghosh,  learned	 senior	 counsel   for	 the
respondents, contended that since the notifications had been
quashed in  respect of	some other lands covered in the same
notifications, the respondents stand on the same position as
others and  are entitled  to the same benefit. Though we had
adjourned the  appeal to  get	particulars relating  to the
cases in  which exclusion  of the  lands covered in the same
notification and for what grounds was made, Mr. Mariarputham
stated that  in spite of his best efforts to get the correct
information, he	 was unable  to get the information from the
Government and	that, therefore,  he is not in a position to
place and  factual material  on the basis of which the lands
were withdrawn	either by  the orders  of the  Court and for
what purpose. Reasons for such omission are not far to seek.
</p><p id="p_3">     However, he  has pointed out that the earlier orders by
the Court  relate to the lands for the establishment of out-
station bus  stand and	also wholesale	fruit market.  Since
they also  serve  public  purpose,  the	 withdrawal  of	 the
notifications in respect thereof does not have any effect on
the planned  development under	the  scheme.  Therefore,  it
cannot	be   said  that	 there	is  any	 invalidity  in	 the
notification  for  being  quashed.  We	find  force  in	 the
contention. Dr.	 Ghosh submitted that though the respondents
are two	 families, the	numbers are  as many  as 19 and they
require construction  of  houses  for  self-occupation.	 The
scheme being  for the  planned development  of a residential
township and  since the	 land acquired	by them	 is for that
purpose, the  land required  by them  may also be considered
for exclusion  for the	construction of their own houses for
residential purpose.  The extent of land in question in this
appeal is 20 acres and odd.
</p><p id="p_4">     The question is : whether the view of the High Court is
correct	 in   law?  The	  question  of	 vagueness  of	 the
notification published	under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_8">Section  4(1)</a> is no longer res
integra. The  ratio in L. Krishnan's case (supra) covers the
field. In State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr. etc. vs. v. Mahalakshmi
Ammal &amp; Ors. (C.A. 11555 of 1995), this Court has considered
the effect  of G.O.  Ms.No.583 dated  March 11, 1983 wherein
guidelines issued  for exemption were withdrawn. It was held
that the  though  Government  had  issued  notifications  on
earlier occasions  giving benefit  for exclusion  of certain
lands covered  under the  guidelines formulated	 therein, in
view of	 large-scale misapplication  of the  guidelines	 for
seeking exclusion of the lands covered under the scheme, the
schemes are getting frustrated. Consequently, Government was
justified in  withdrawing the guidelines issued earlier. The
view of the High Court that they are statutory notifications
and confer  right to  get exemption  from acquisition as per
guidelines mentioned  therein, is not correct. They are only
administrative instructions issued by the Government for the
purpose of  consideration by  the Housing  Board  but  these
guidelines being  misused and  misapplied,  the	 Government,
when it	 had power  to issue  guidelines, has  same  plenary
power to  withdraw the	same.  It  is  seen  that  the	writ
petition came  to be  filed not	 only  after  the  concerned
G.O.Ms. was  withdrawn but  also after	the award came to be
passed. After taking possession, all acquisition proceedings
would become  final except  determination of compensation at
different stages.  Consequent to  passing of  the award, the
State Government is entitled to take possession of the lands
and after  issuance of	the notices  under <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_9">Section 12</a> of the
Act, the  lands stand  vested in  the State under <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_10">Section 16</a>
free from all encumbrances. Consequently, we do not find any
infirmity in  the notifications	 issued under  <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_11">Sections 4(1)</a>
and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_12">6</a>  of the Act and the award made by the Land Acquisition
Officer.
</p><p id="p_5">     It is seen that the very public purpose envisaged under
the  scheme   is  planned   development	 of   the  city	 for
residential purposes  to relieve  housing scarcity. Though a
part  of   the	lands  was  withdrawn  for  the	 purpose  of
establishing outstation	 bus stand  and also wholesale fruit
market, they  being equally  for other	public purposes, the
withdrawl of  acquisition for  those purposes  will not have
nay effect  on the  notification issued	 under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_13">Section 4(1)</a>.
But the	 respondents being  the owners	of the lands and the
scheme being   for  the planned	 development for residential
purpose, they  too required  the lands	for construction  of
their own houses for their personal residence.
</p><p id="p_6">     Under  these   circumstances,  we	 think	that   while
upholding the action of the State in acquiring the lands for
planned development of the city, reasonable land may also be
excluded for  the actual personal residential purpose of the
respondents who	 are 19	 in number.  In view  of  the  large
numbers of  families, we  think that  1 acre 50 cents of the
land would  be reasonable for the members of the families of
the respondents	 to construct  their own houses for personal
occupation. On our direction, Mr. M.N. Krishnamani, with the
assistance  of	the  local  counsel,  identified  north-east
corner	of   the  land	in  Survey  No.167/1B  abutting	 the
Punamally Highway  road. The  total extent of the land under
Survey No.  167/1B is  7 acres 81 cents. Out of which 1 acre
50  cents  in  a  contiguous  place  towards  north-east  is
directed to  be released  from the  acquisition so  that the
respondents would be able to construct their own residential
houses for their personal residence in a compact block.
</p><p id="p_7">     The order	of the	High Court  is	set  aside  and	 the
notification stands  upheld except  to the above extent. The
notification of	 withdrawal in	respect of  excluded land be
issued under <a href="/doc/983800/" id="a_14">Section 48(1)</a> within three months from the date
of receipt  of the  order. This order of exclusion is not to
be treated  as a  precedent. Only as a special case, in view
of the	special fact  that large  number of  persons in	 two
families require  personal accommodation,  we have given the
above directions  - that  too on  an  undertaking  that	 the
respondents  would  use	 the  same  only  for  the  personal
residence.
</p><p id="p_8">     The appeal	 is accordingly	 disposed of  in  the  above
terms. No costs.
