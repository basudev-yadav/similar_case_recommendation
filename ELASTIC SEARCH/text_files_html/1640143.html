Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	These I.As. are in essence oft shoot of a judgment of this 
Court in IA 670 of 2001 in Writ Petition (C) 202 of 1995 in 
K.M. Chinnappa (applicant in  <a href="/doc/1026316/" id="a_1">T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad 
v. Union of India and Others</a>  (2002 (10) SCC 606).  It related 
to the question whether functioning of Kudremukh Iron and 
Ore Company Ltd. (in short 'KIOCL') was having adverse effect 
on the environment and ecosystem.  In paras 51 and 52 of the 
judgment it was inter alia directed as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_3">"51. Taking note of the factual background and 
the legal position highlighted above, we think it 
proper to accept the time period fixed by the 
Forest Advisory Committee constituted under 
<a href="/doc/960986/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of the Conservation Act. That means 
mining should be allowed till the end of 2005 
by which time the weathered secondary ore 
available in the already broken area should be 
exhausted. This is, however, subject to 
fulfilment of the recommendations made by 
the Committee on ecological and other aspects.
</p>
<p id="p_4">52. The modalities as to how these have to he 
worked out shall be done in the manner 
recommended by the Committee. It was 
submitted by the learned counsel for the State 
of Karnataka that the recommendation made 
about transfer of buildings and other 
infrastructure to the Forest Department of the 
State Government at book value is not 
acceptable to it. This is a matter which can be 
considered by the Committee on an 
appropriate motion being made by the State 
before it. The modalities to be adopted to 
effectuate the order passed by this Court and 
recommendations of the Committee shall be 
worked out by the Ministry of Environment 
and Forests, the State Government and the 
Company under the supervision and guidance 
and monitoring of the Committee."
</p>
<p id="p_5">	Unfortunately the Central Government for reasons best 
known to it notwithstanding the clear position indicated in the 
judgment construed that the expression "Committee" meant 
"Forest Advisory Committee" (in short 'FAC'). There was no 
scope for taking the stand in view of what has been stated in 
para 5 of the judgment. It has been stated that FAC is also a 
statutory committee.  By order dated 20th January, 2006 it has 
been observed that the constitution of the Monitoring 
Committee is not in consonance with the directions of this 
court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	Learned counsel appearing for KIOCL submitted that in 
line with direction of this Court and keeping in view the Rule 
23C of the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 
1988 (in short the 'Rules')  which became operative with effect 
from 10.4.2003, an approved final Mine Closure Plan was 
submitted.  Views of expert bodies were taken.  It has been 
stated that in line with the statutory prescriptions, which even 
though became operative after the judgment various steps 
have been taken.  Indian Bureau of Mines (in short the 'IBM') 
has also given its report. It is, therefore, stated that though IIT 
Delhi was asked to give its view but that has no relevance. If 
there would have been non-compliance with the statutory 
requirement of Rule 23C of the Rules, it would have exposed it 
to penal consequences.  In essence the stand is taken that IIT 
Delhi's report should not be accepted and the following 
modalities on the other hand should be adopted.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	(a)	It would utilize its machinery and workmen for the 
purpose of achieving slope stability by excavating the 33.81 
hectares on the basis that out of the net profit generated by 
the mining operation, 50% of the net profit would be paid over 
to a fund to be established and  operated by a committee 
constituted by the Government of Karnataka or in any other 
manner directed by this Court or a high powered statutory 
committee created for this purpose (in the nature of the 
Tennessee Valley Authority) for the purpose of utilizing this 
50% net profit for rehabilitation and eco-restoration for the 
Kudremukh Forest Area. (b) On a rough estimate, the 50% of 
net profit is likely to be in the range of Rs.50 to 75 crores per 
annum, for the purpose of rehabilitation and eco-restoration of 
the Kudremukh National Park and also establishing and 
promoting sustainable environmental development and eco-
tourism in the area. Towards this end, the existing buildings 
and infrastructure could also prove useful. (c) If this proposal 
is accepted, an amount in the range of (approximately) Rs.150 
Crores to 225 Crores could be available to the fund during the 
period of about 3 years which would be necessary for 
excavating 33.81 hectares.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	It is further submitted that in the judgment at paras 49 
and 51 had permitted mining of the weathered secondary ore 
in the already broken up area till the end of 2005, as this 
Court expected that the weathered ore would be exhausted. 
But in reality, about 20 million tons of weathered ore are still 
available in already broken up area.  This should be permitted 
to be used as it is likely to generate revenue of about rupees 
25 crores per annum.  If this is permitted nearly rupees 300 
crores would be available to the Kudremukh Authority for Eco 
Restoration Fund which would be able to bring about dramatic 
change in the eco-system of the Kudremukh National Park.  
</p>
<p id="p_9">Per contra,  learned Amicus Curiae has submitted that 
this Court clearly directed closure of mining operation by the 
end of 2005.   Time was not given for running the mines for 
profit, but as a winding down period at the end of which 
mining should have been closed.  The operations during the 
period had to be under the supervision of the Monitoring 
Committee which in turn function under the supervision of 
Central Empowered Committee (in short 'CEC'). What KIOCL 
wants now is to continue mining of 8 to 9 lakh tonnes of ore.  
</p>
<p id="p_10"> We have considered rival submissions. IIT, Delhi was 
appointed vide order dated 24th February, 2006.  It has been 
found that KIOCL has used the concerned period for carrying 
on commercial operations without taking necessary steps for 
winding down operations.  On 10th May, 2006 an affidavit was 
filed by KIOCL taking the stand that there was likelihood of 
serious pollution of Bhadra river if KIOCL was not allowed to 
do the operations for the purpose of avoiding pollution.  IIT, 
Delhi did not consider the exercise necessary. It has been 
pointed out by learned Amicus Curiae that contrary to what 
KIOCL thought to be inevitable, there was no damage 
whatsoever despite heavy monsoon.  It is to be noted that the 
IIT, Delhi in its report has observed that the solution has to be 
found by experts and the heart-beat of that solution is the 
stability of the slopes involving  "no or minimal disturbance to 
the unbroken area".  It is noted that at various times, petitions 
have been filed practically with a view to undo what had been 
definitely held to be imperative by this Court.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">At this juncture, it would be appropriate to take note of 
what IIT, Delhi stated in its various reports.
</p>
<p id="p_12">In their report dated 12th April, 2006 on the Stability of 
Slope and related issues during mine closure of KIOCL, it was 
inter alia observed as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_13">"3.0 Observations on Stability of Slopes
Based on the above methodology, the following 
observations are made concerning the stability of the 
slopes.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(a) The excavated slopes of the mine exist at varying 
degrees of steepness with benches of variable 
widths.
</p>
<p id="p_15">(b) Some slopes are stable with grass growing on 
them; others are observed to show signs of surficial 
erosion/debris flow/mud flow; yet others show 
signs of planar slippage or slides of limited depth.
</p>
<p id="p_16">(c) The instability of slopes at specific locations is 
observed to be on account of (i) excessive steepness, 
</p><p id="p_17">(ii) inadequate strength of soil/rock mass under 
saturated condition and (iii) seepage pressure 
exerted by infiltrating rain water during monsoons.
</p>
<p id="p_18">(d) Saturation of mine slopes and seepage pressure 
exerted on the slopes appear to be the two factors 
that have the greatest role in instability of slopes 
since these slopes are reported to be relatively 
stable during dry months and become unstable 
during monsoons. Saturation reduces the strength 
of the soil/rock mass and seepage pressure induces 
downward movement.
</p>

<p id="p_19">4.0 Observations on Instability of North West Part of 
the Mining Area
One part of the mining area on the north western side is 
observed to be particularly susceptible to slope instability 
due to collection of water in a catch pit constructed at 
the base of the broken area, above the unbroken area. 
The catch pit was constructed by excavation during 
mining operations and is observed to cause the following 
effects:
</p><p id="p_20">(a) The unbroken area on the downstream side of 
the catch pit is being destabilized as the collected 
water seeps into the unbroken area;
</p>
<p id="p_21">(b) When the catch pit overflows, uncontrolled flow 
of water cascades downhill in the form of surface 
water laden with silt which eventually reaches the 
Bhadra River at the base of the unbroken area; this 
has also resulted in the formation of gullies and 
erosion channels in the unbroken area.
</p>

<p id="p_22">5.0 Observations on Slope Stability Aspects in the 
Closure Plan 
Slope stability aspects have been covered in the following 
reports in the Closure Plan:
</p><p id="p_23">Report of NIRM: Slope Stability Investigations at 
Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines
Report of CWPRS: Desk Studies on Stability of Hill 
Slopes in Mining Area at Kudremukh Iron Ore Mine, 
Karnataka

The Closure Plan proposes stabilization of the slopes by 
flattening them and also by additional excavation of 
slopes in the broken region as well as the unbroken 
portion in the northwestern part of the mine. This would 
be followed by revegetation of slopes for controlling 
erosion of fine material. Check dams have been proposed 
to prevent siltation of the Bhadra River during the initial 
stages till vegetative growth gets established and causes 
reduction in silt erosion.
</p><p id="p_24">The following are the observations on slope stability 
aspects in the closure plan:
</p><p id="p_25">(a)	The suggested methodology of stabilizing the 
north west part of the mine by deep excavation in 
the unbroken portion over an area of 33.81 hectares 
can be one alternative but not necessarily the only 
one. Other methods which would minimize 
disturbance to the unbroken area could have been 
examined.
</p>
<p id="p_26">(b)	In addition, the following aspects have not 
been covered in the Closure Plan:
</p>
<p id="p_27">i) A surface water drainage plan for the entire 
mining area indicating location of surface 
water drains at the benches and along the 
perimeter of the base of the mining area;
</p>
<p id="p_28">ii)	Methodology for periodic removal and 
relocation of silt collected in check dams and 
catch pits;
</p>
<p id="p_29">iii) Provision of bio-geotechnical engineering 
measures for assisting vegetative growth in 
problematic areas where regular debris flow or 
mud flow is observed;
</p>
<p id="p_30">iv) Stability measures for north west part of the 
mine such as elimination of collection of water 
and overflow of water from the existing catch 
pit as well as stabilization measures for the 
unbroken area destabilized by the catch pit;
</p>
<p id="p_31">v)	The measures listed at (i) to (iv) above 
could result in significant additional costs.
</p>
<p id="p_32">6.0 Conclusions and Recommendations
</p><p id="p_33">(a) The slopes are not stable in the present state and 
need stabilization.
</p>
<p id="p_34">(b) If the mine is abandoned without stabilization of 
the slopes, as indicated earlier, it will result in 
excessive silt discharge due to erosion as well as in 
the sliding of the slopes at some locations in future 
years.
</p>
<p id="p_35">(c) The north west part of the mine needs immediate 
attention and remedial measures to prevent the 
possible occurrence of large scale movement during 
the forthcoming monsoon.
</p>
<p id="p_36">(d) A Closure Plan is necessary for stabilizing the 
slopes. The Closure Plan proposed at present is well 
conceptualized but falls short of adequacy in 
detailing (as indicated in 5.0 (a) and (b) above). This 
is perhaps so because there is inadequate 
experience in the country regarding closure of 
mines of such size in a short time. The regulations 
relating to closure have been notified only in recent 
years in the country and it will take time for the 
expertise to develop fully.
</p>
<p id="p_37">(e)	It is suggested that the task of mine closure be 
given, on a turnkey basis, to an Organization having 
requisite experience in similar works (on design-
and-build basis). Such an Organization can be 
selected through a global competitive bid. It should 
be the responsibility of such an Organization to 
reanalyze the stability of slopes and then draw up a 
Closure Plan and execute it with minimum 
disturbance to unbroken area of the mine. KIOCL 
could assist such an Organization in executing the 
closure. Since the execution of closure would 
involve a large expenditure and a time frame of 
several years for vegetation to be established, such 
a task could be overseen by a special cell/nodal 
agency created for this purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_38">(f)	The award of work as listed in (e) above could 
take several months. Till then, KIOCL need to 
monitor and maintain the slopes (in the entire mine 
area in general and the northwestern portion in 
particular) as well as maintain/operate the silt 
control measures at the site.
</p>


<p id="p_39">Again on 12th June, 2006 the report of Expert Committee 
made certain observations on the basis of presentation made 
by KIOCL officers on various dates.   The observations were to 
the following effects:
</p>
<p id="p_40">"Officers of KIOCL, headed by Mr. J.N. 
Kini, Director (Production &amp; Projects), made a 
presentation at IIT Delhi on 8th June 2006 on 
the measures taken to for controlling silt and 
for stability of north western portion. A report 
was also submitted containing conceptual 
design and detailed design of water pollution 
control measures. The following were present:
</p>
<p id="p_41">Mr. J.N. Kini KIOCL
Mr. K.S. Kasinath. KIOCL
Mr. G. Pai, KIOCL
Mr. MK. Rajagopalan, KIOCL

Prof. G.V. Rao, Member, Expert 
Committee
Prof. K.G. Sharma, Member, Expert 
Committee
Prof. Manoj Datta, Member, Expert 
Committee

All the three members of the Expert 
Committee visited the mine site on 10th and 
I1th June 2006 to study the measures taken."
</p>
<p id="p_42">The following are the observations of the Expert 
Committee members on the basis of the presentation by 
KIOCL officers, report submitted by them and the site visit.
</p>
<p id="p_43">"Silt Control Measures

</p><p id="p_44">1. It is observed that concerted efforts 
have been made by KIOCL for controlling the 
flow of silt from the mine site to the Bhadra 
river in the form of drainage channels, 
catchpits, berms and dykes, check bunds and 
check dams.
</p>
<p id="p_45">2. From amongst the two main pollution 
control dams, one is observed to be nearly full 
(PCD 1) whereas significant storage capacity 
exists in the other (PCD2).
</p>
<p id="p_46">3. Attempts have been made by KIOCL, to 
the extent feasible, to empty the reservoir 
behind PCD1 and these have been abandoned 
with the onset of monsoons. Further attempts 
can be tried during periods of extended lull in 
the monsoon, if any.
</p>
<p id="p_47">4. Diversion of silt laden water has been 
made at select locations from drainage channel 
of PCD1 to the drainage channel of PCD2.
</p>
<p id="p_48">5. It is stated by officers of KIOCL that 
the storage capacity of the main catchpit 
before PCD2 as well as the reservoir of PCD2 is 
sufficient to hold most of the silt for the 
present monsoon. However measures have to 
be taken for handling the silt of future years.
</p>
<p id="p_49">6. The upsteam slope of PCD2 is observed 
to exhibit evidence of piping. Remedial 
measures such as provision of geotextile filter 
and plugging have been undertaken by KIOCL. 
Suitable long term measures may be taken up 
after the monsoons. Careful monitoring of both 
PCD2 and PCDI may be done during and after 
the monsoons.
</p>
<p id="p_50">7. It is observed that silt laden water from 
the north-west portion does not reach either 
PCDI or PCD2 but overflows from the low lying 
area in the north west portion into the Bhadra 
river through an erosion gully. A gabion 
structure has been constructed to control the 
silt but the possibility of silt overflow during 
heavy rains can not be ruled out. Additional 
measures are required to control the silt 
release from this area. KIOCL has proposed 
the re-profiling of the north west portion to 
enable the silt laden water to reach PCD2. This 
would take around 6 months and can be taken 
up only after the monsoons. Other alternatives 
with conceptual and detailed plans need to be 
considered for this problem. 
</p>
<p id="p_51">Stability of North-West portion

</p><p id="p_52">1.	The stability of the North-West region 
is observed to be slightly improved on 
account of non-accumulation of water 
in the low-lying area. 
</p>
<p id="p_53">2. However, the stability could still be 
affected due to the presence of 
erosion gully because of overflowing 
water.
</p>
<p id="p_54">3.	Complete access to the periphery of the 
low-lying area is not available due to 
the absence of benches and access 
roads.
</p>
<p id="p_55">4. It is important that a few alternate 
solutions be ccnceptualized with the 
following features for the north west 
region as long term measures:
</p>
<p id="p_56">(a) Minimal accumulation of water,
</p><p id="p_57">(b) Drainage channel to reach PCD2,
</p><p id="p_58">(c) Benches to stabilize steep slopes,
</p><p id="p_59">(d) Access load all around the low-lying 
area, and
</p><p id="p_60">(e) Sealing of opening(s) to the erosion 
gully(ies).
</p>
<p id="p_61">Final Remarks

KIOCL may prepare revised conceptual 
designs and remedial measures on the basis of 
the observations made in this report."
</p>

<p id="p_62">On 13.7.2006 the opinion of IIT, Delhi in the background 
of the affidavit filed by KIOCL on 10th May, 2006 was as 
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_63">"The Expert Body of IIT Delhi has studied 
the affidavit filed by KIOCL. The following are 
the views of the Expert Body in respect of item 
3 titled "Achieving Slope Stability in the Entire 
Mine Area".
</p>
<p id="p_64">1. For stability of slopes of the mine area, 
the scope of work defined by KIOCL to NIRM 
for their study did not specify the condition of 
"no or minimal disturbance to unbroken area". 
As a consequence, the NIRM report presents 
only one solution, which disturbs the broken 
area. It does not give any other alternative 
solutions.
</p>
<p id="p_65">2. Other reports by IIT Kharagpur, CMRI 
Dhanhad, Monitoring Committee, CWPRS 
Pune, use the report of NIRM as the bases of 
analysis, hence give recommendations similar 
to that of NIRM.
</p>
<p id="p_66">3. As stated in the earlier Report 
submitted by the Expert Body on 10th April 
2006, it is reiterated that a solution to the 
stability of slopes with no or minimal 
disturbance to unbroken area is feasible.
</p>
<p id="p_67">4. Flattening of unstable slopes by 
excavation in broken area along with 
appropriate drainage and silt control measures 
can improve stability of the mined area. For 
this purpose the mechanism already suggested 
at item 6(e) of Expert Body Report dated 10th 
April 2006 submitted to Hon'ble Supreme 
Court may be adopted."
</p>

<p id="p_68">The significant aspects in the aforesaid report are as 
follows:
</p><p id="p_69">(a) The scope of work defined by KIOCL to NIRM for their 
study did not specify the condition of "no or minimal 
interference to unbroken area".
</p><p id="p_70">(b)	Other reports (i.e. of IIT, Kharagpur, CMRI, 
Dhanbad, Monitoring Committee, CWPRS, Pune used NIRM's 
report as the foundation for analysis and, therefore, their 
recommendations were similar to those of NIRM.
</p><p id="p_71">(c) Solution to the stability of slopes with no or minimal 
disturbances to unbroken area is feasible.
</p><p id="p_72">(d) By adopting certain measures, stability of the mined 
area can be improved.
</p>  
<p id="p_73">In the background of what has been noted above, and 
keeping in view the suggestions and recommendations of IIT, 
which we find to be founded on rational basis, we direct as 
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_74">(i) On the basis of the report dated 10.04.2006 
of IIT Delhi through a Global Competitive Bid 
an Agency to be selected for:
</p>
<p id="p_75">(a) re-analysing the stability of slopes
</p><p id="p_76">(b)drawing up of mine closure plan and
</p><p id="p_77">(c) implementation of the above plan.
</p>
<p id="p_78">(ii) IIT Delhi shall draw up detailed terms for 
the work to be done, consistent with the basic 
paradigm of "no or minimal disturbance to 
unbroken area" and submit to this Court 
within a period of four weeks for further 
directions.
</p>
<p id="p_79">(iii) The Ministry of Mines, Government of 
India, shall designate an officer to take over 
possession of the mines immediately. IIT Delhi 
shall depute a team of experts to go and do a 
survey of the mines and the surrounding area 
and submit a report to this Court regarding 
any immediate step(s) that need to be taken 
during the interregnum till the appointment of 
the expert agency. IIT Delhi can ask the 
designated officer to take any necessary steps 
on an emergent basis.
</p>
<p id="p_80">(iv) The expenditure for the purpose of inviting 
global competitive bid and evaluation such as 
on advertisement etc. may initially be met out 
of Rs.19 crores deposited by the KIOCL, and 
which are presently lying with the Adhoc-
CAMPA.
</p>
<p id="p_81">(v) If any funds are required in excess of the 
aforesaid amount, the Agency, or the 
Designated Officer shall move this Court for 
necessary directions."
</p>
<p id="p_82">I.A.s are accordingly disposed of.
</p>
