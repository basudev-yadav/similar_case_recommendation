BACKGROUND FACTS


</p><p id="p_6">3.    It arises in the following factual matrix.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      The Parliament enacted <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_1">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 (hereinafter referred to

as, "the said Act"). In exercise of its jurisdiction conferred by <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Section 178</a>

of the said Act, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (for short,

"CERC") made Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Procedure,

Terms and Conditions for Grant of Trading License and other related

matters), Regulation 2004 (for short, "the Regulation")


      Indisputably, in terms of the provisions of the said Act as also the

Regulations, inter alia, license is required to be taken by a person who is

desirous of dealing in inter-state trading, which in terms of Regulation 2(g)

means "transfer of electricity from the territory of one State to the territory

of another State by an electricity dealer".

<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">4.    Appellant No. 1 is a Public Limited Company incorporated and

registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_3">Indian Companies Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">5.    Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said Act and the Regulations, the

appellant No. 1 herein filed an application for grant of inter-State Trading

License under Category `A' before CERC on 23.3.2004. CERC published a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

notice as regards the said application filed by the appellant No. 1 for grant of

inter-state Trading License in all editions of `Indian Express', Financial

Express' and a vernacular daily `Jansatta'. Appellant No. 1 also filed an

interlocutory application seeking permission to trade in the electricity

pending final disposal of its petition for grant of inter-state trading license as

it had been engaged in inter-state trading of electricity prior to the

commencement of the said Act. By reason of an order dated 31.3.2004, the

said application was allowed.       Objections filed to the appellant No.1's

application for grant of license pursuant to the aforementioned notice were

also rejected by an order dated 30.6.2004.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">6.    On or about 6.9.2004, CERC directed as under:

             a year.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (ii) The CERC proposed to issue the license for

</p><p id="p_18">7.     After the publication of notices, objections were also received as

regards appellant No. 1's trading in inter-state supply of electrical energy

pursuant to the aforementioned interim order. The matter was taken to High

Court and interim license granted to appellant No. 1 was extended by the

High Court from time to time.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">       Draft Regulations were published to which appellant No. 1 filed

objection. The Amended Regulations were notified on 3.4.2006. By an

order dated 20.8.2006, CERC rejected the application filed by the appellant

No. 1 for grant of inter-state trading license opining that Regulation 6A

brought in through the amended Regulation will have a retrospective effect.

An appeal preferred thereagainst is pending before the Appellate Tribunal

for Electricity.

THE ACT


</p><p id="p_27">11.   The said Act was enacted to consolidate the laws relating to

generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity and

generally for taking measures conducive to development of electricity

industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interest of consumers

and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalization of electricity tariff,

ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and

environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity

Authority, Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate

Tribunal and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.


</p><p id="p_28">12.   Indisputably, one of the objects and reasons for enacting the said Act

was to encourage private sector's participation in generation, transmission

and distribution of electrical energy. Trading is considered to be a distinct

activity. Preamble of the Act also refers to distribution and trading as one of

the objects sought to be achieved by reason of the said Act.


</p><p id="p_29">13.   <a href="/doc/51837307/" id="a_8">Section 2(71)</a> defines "trading" to mean purchase of electricity for

resale thereof and the expression "trade" is construed accordingly. Part IV

of the Act providing for licensing, inter alia, mandates that no person shall
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>

undertake trading in electricity unless he is authorized to do so by a licence

issued under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_9">Section 14</a>, or is exempt under <a href="/doc/70993231/" id="a_10">Section 13</a>.


</p><p id="p_30">       <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_11">Section 14</a> of the Act, inter alia, provides for grant of licence to any

person inter alia trading in electricity as an electricity trader.


</p><p id="p_31">       <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_12">Section 15</a> provides for the detailed procedures for grant of licence as

also the exercises required to be undertaken by the appropriate commission

therefor. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_13">Section 16</a> of the Act empowers the Appropriate Commission to

lay down conditions for grant of licence, which is as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">              "16. Conditions of licence. - The Appropriate
              Commission may specify any general or specific
              conditions which shall apply either to a licensee or
              class of licensees and such conditions shall be
              deemed to be conditions of such licence:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                     Provided that the Appropriate Commission
              shall, within one year from the appointed date,
              specify any general or specific conditions of
              licence applicable to the licensees referred to in the
              first, second, third, fourth and fifth provisos to
              <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_14">section 14</a> after the expiry of one year from the
              commencement of this Act."

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_15">Section 17</a> imposes certain restrictions on activities of licensing.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32"><a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_16">Section 18</a> empowers the appropriate commission to amend the terms of an

existing licence in public interest. This power can be exercised by the

appropriate commission either on an application made in this connection by

the licensee or suo motu. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_17">Section 19</a> lists the grounds for revocation of a

Commission may specify the technical requirement, capital adequacy

requirement and creditworthiness for being an electricity trader.


</p><p id="p_35">      <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_19">Section 66</a> mandates that the Appropriate Commission shall

endeavour to promote the development of a market (including trading) in

power in such manner as may be specified and shall be guided by the

National Electricity Policy referred to in <a href="/doc/65558287/" id="a_20">Section 3</a> of the Act.

THE REGULATION


</p><p id="p_39">14.   Sub-Regulation (4) of Regulation 2 applies to trading carried out

bilaterally between the generating company, including captive generating

plant, distribution licensee and the electricity trader on the one hand and the

electricity trader and the distribution licensee on the other. Supply to

consumers is, thus, not a general function.

licence for inter-state trading.
</p>
<p id="p_42">

                    any consideration, as it deems fit,

(iii)   His reputation and character; and
(iv)    His efficiency and honesty."
INTERPRETATION


</pre><p id="p_52">17.     Regulation 6A has been inserted. The said provision is imperative in

character.     It is couched in negative language.            It provides for

disqualifications.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">        Indisputably, a subordinate legislation should be read in the context of

the Act. Thus read, Regulation 6A should be construed in terms of the

requirements contained in <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_28">Section 52</a> of the Act, namely, technical

requirement, capital adequacy, requirement and creditworthiness for being

an electricity trader.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">        It affects the creditworthiness of the applicant. It also affects the

credit effectiveness, namely, (1) financial integrity of the applicant; (2) his

competence; (3) his reputation and character; and (4) his efficiency and

honesty.
</p>
<p id="p_57">

</p><p id="p_58">        It affects a pending proceeding. Because of the said amendment, an

interim licence granted in favour of the appellant stood revoked.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    12</span>

</p><p id="p_59">       This, however, would not mean that an amendment made in a

regulation would under no circumstance, affect pending proceeding.


</p><p id="p_60">18.    It is now a well settled principle of law that the rule making power

"for carrying out the purpose of the Act" is a general delegation. Such a

general delegation may not be held to be laying down any guidelines. Thus,

by reason of such a provision alone, the regulation making power cannot be

exercised so as to bring into existence substantive rights or obligations or

disabilities which are not contemplated in terms of the provisions of the said

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">       We may, in this connection refer to a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1598183/" id="a_29">Kunj

Behari Lal Butail &amp; Ors. vs. State of H.P. &amp; Ors</a>. [(2000) 3 SCC 40],

wherein a Three Judge Bench of this Court held as under :

             power to legislate by making rules "for carrying
             out the purposes of the Act" is a general delegation
             without laying down any guidelines; it cannot be
             so exercised as to bring into existence substantive
             rights or obligations or disabilities not
             contemplated by the provisions of the Act itself."</blockquote><p id="p_63">

</p><p id="p_65">19.   The power of the regulation making authority, thus, must be

interpreted keeping in view the provisions of the Act. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_32">The Act</a> is silent as

regards conditions for grant of licence. It does not lay down any pre-

qualification therefor. Provisions for imposition of general conditions of

licence or conditions laying down the prequalifications therefor and/or the

conditions/qualifications for grant or revocation of licence, in absence of

such a clear provision may be held to be laying down guidelines by

necessary implication providing for conditions/qualifications for grant of

licence also.

</p><p id="p_67">20.   Mr. Tripathi had relied on a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/678704/" id="a_33">The Rampur

Distillery Co. Ltd. V. The Company Law Board &amp; Anr</a>. [(1969) 2 SCC 774].

This Court therein was considering the validity of a provision laying down

the concept of a `fit and proper person' for the purposes of <a href="/doc/590046/" id="a_34">Section 326(2)</a> of

the Companies Act, 1956 by reason whereof the Central Government has

been conferred power to refuse the approval of appointment of a Managing

Director, if in its opinion, he was not a fit and proper person. This Court

held that the satisfaction contemplated thereby must be the result of an

objective appraisal of relevant material and subject to the judicial scrutiny.

Stating that by reason thereof, the Central Government was not made the

final arbiter of the existence of the ground on which the satisfaction may be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                    14</span>

founded. Such a power was held to be a quasi judicial one and not an

administrative one, carrying with it a duty arising from the nature of the Act

empowered to be done the job for which it is to be done, the conditions in

which it is to be done and its repercussion upon the power of the company,

the shareholders, the creditors and the general public for whose benefit, the

power is to be exercised.
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">      This decision, therefore, itself may be considered to be an authority

for the proposition that where the Parliament thought it fit and proper to

confer such a power upon an authority exercising quasi judicial power, the

same is specifically conferred by the provisions of the Act itself and not by a

subordinate legislation.
</p>

arriving at a satisfaction that a person was fit and proper to be re-appointed

as managing agent, all past conduct and actings were required to be taken

however, does not provide for any machinery to collect independent material

for being placed before the proper authority as regards evaluation of credit

effectiveness and creditworthiness of the applicant.


CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE

</p><p id="p_72">21.   For deciding the question involved herein, we must notice the purport

and object for which such disqualifications have been brought into the

statute book. In terms of <a href="/doc/915975/" id="a_35">Section 52</a> of the Act, the creditworthiness of the

applicant must be apparent.        Creditworthiness of an applicant can be

considered from two angles. It may have two concepts, one is positive and

the other is negative.

<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">      Four aspects of creditworthiness are envisaged in the Regulations as

would appear from the Explanation appended thereto, which are as under:-


</p><pre id="pre_3">      (i)     financial integrity of the applicant;

      (ii)    his competence;

      (iii)   his reputation and character; and

restrictions by a statute. [<a href="/doc/1734497/" id="a_38">See Udai Singh Dagar v. Union of India</a>, {(2007)

satisfy the constitutional scheme as adumbrated in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_39">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution of India must receive a higher level of scrutiny than an ordinary

statute. Such a higher level of scrutiny is necessary not for the purpose of

determining the Constitutionality of the statute alone vis-`-vis the field of

legislative power as envisaged under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_40">Article 245</a> of the Constitution of India

but also having regard to the object and purpose, the statute seeks to achieve.

exceptions, was the monopoly of the State Electricity Boards, Public Sector

Undertakings.

by the provisions of the Act. Court's concern, therefore, would be not only

to see that the Statute is intra vires the Constitutional scheme including the

legislative field, but also as to whether it passes the test of reasonableness

having regard to the object and purpose of the Act.         For achieving the

aforementioned purpose not only the premise, relevancy of the constitutional

scheme in relation thereto is required to be taken into consideration as would

be noticed a little later but therefor the doctrine of purposive interpretation

should also be resorted to.   [ <a href="/doc/1944204/" id="a_41">See New India Assurance Company Ltd. v.

that when any criterion is fixed by a statute or by a policy, an attempt should

be made by the authority making the delegated legislation to follow the

such a competition now would give rise to a development of a proper market

in the long run.    The power of the Regulatory Commission to impose

qualification/restrictions should be read in line with the larger object of the

Act. The Consumer tariff is to be laid down by the Commission. How

licensees would operate their business to the extent permissible under law

should be subject to Regulation, which ordinarily should not be resorted to

discourage private participation in the power sector. A trader of electricity

does not deal with consumers; he is merely an intermediary between a

generating company and a distribution licensee. The tariff that a distribution

licensee will charge from its consumers is regulated. Even the margin that a

trader can make is regulated. It is, therefore, not correct to contend that

Regulation 6A is in consumer interest as it has not been shown how it will

protect the consumer interest.

Commission must be satisfied that grant of licence in the circumstance may

adversely affect the interest of the electricity sector or of the consumers.

Such legal proceedings are, apart from the judgment of convictions of an

offence involving moral turpitude or any economic offence on the part of the

applicant or his partner, or promoter, or Director, or associates at any time in

the past, as it may have something to do with the pending legal proceedings

in which the Commission is a party.

<p id="p_134">
</p><p id="p_135">      The correctness of the Commission's determination of a dispute

between the applicant and the Commission may be a subject matter of a

legal proceeding. Only because a legal proceeding had been pending and the

Commission is of the opinion that the same adversely affects the interest of

the electricity sector or of the consumers, in our opinion, cannot by itself be

an objective criteria as by reason thereof the statutory authority would

necessarily be required to enter into the merit of the proceeding.          The

members of the Commission need not necessarily be trained in law; they

may not be having legal background and, thus, a power conferred on it so as

to directly or indirectly enter into the merit of a legal proceeding in which it

may itself be involved, in our opinion, would not be a fair and reasonable

criteria.

<p id="p_136">
</p><p id="p_137">       We are unmindful of the fact that clause (f) to Regulation 6A of the

Regulations mandates recording of reasons in writing. In the event, thus, if

wrong reasons are recorded a judicial review would be maintainable. But

availability of judicial review itself, although is a relevant factor, by itself

cannot be a ground to declare a subordinate legislation valid which

otherwise it is not. {<a href="/doc/1308350/" id="a_71">See State of Kerala &amp; Ors. vs. Unni &amp; Anr</a>. [(2007) 2

       Judicial review from an administrative decision lies on a very narrow

compass. The superior courts in exercise of their jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_72">Article

regard to grant of licence. It may be so. But then it has a right to be

considered therefor. Consideration for such grant must be based on a legal

and valid statute.    The case of the applicant cannot be rejected at the

threshold relying on or on the basis of statutory provisions which are ultra

vires. Submission of Mr. Tripathi that the appellant had no locus standi to

question the validity of the Regulation, therefore, is not correct.

opining that applications for grant of mining lease should be dealt with

within a reasonable time but on that account the applicant would not be

clothed with a right for disposal thereof, stating:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">             "...No one has a vested right to the grant or
             renewal of a lease and none can claim a vested
             right to have an application for the grant or
             renewal of a lease dealt with in a particular way,
             by applying particular provisions. In the absence
             of any vested rights in anyone, an application for a
             lease has necessarily to be dealt with according to
             the rules in force on the date of the disposal of the
             application despite the fact that there is a long
             delay since the making of the application."</blockquote><p id="p_145">

interim licence. It has started trading in electricity. It, therefore, had a

legitimate expectation that in considering the application for grant of licence,

the same criteria as laid down in the statute shall be applied.

several stages holding that the `conditions precedent' laid down therein

unless satisfied no right can be said to have vested in the person concerned.


</p><p id="p_156">42.   The cases relied upon by Mr. Tripathi are distinguishable on fact. We

accept the general principle that an applicant by filing a mere application

cannot be said to have derived a vested right but we are of the opinion that

he has a right to be considered. It will bear repetition to state that such

consideration must be made not only on the basis of a valid statute but also

rationale and objective criteria should be applied therefor.



EPILOGUE

</p><p id="p_157">43.   The law sometimes can be written in such subjective manner that it

affects efficiency and transparent function of the government. If the statute

provides for point-less discretion to agency, it is in essence demolishing the

accountability strand within the administrative process as the agency is not

under obligation from an objective norm, which can enforce accountability

in decision-making process. All law making, be it in the context of delegated

legislation or primary legislation, have to conform to the fundamental tenets

of transparency and openness on one hand and responsiveness and

accountability on the other. These are fundamental tenets flowing from Due
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                     34</span>

Process requirement under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_81">Article 21</a>, Equal Protection clause embodied in

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_82">Article 14</a> and Fundamental Freedoms clause ingrained under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_83">Article 19.</a> A

modern deliberative democracy can not function without these attributes.

The constitutive understanding of aforementioned guarantees under the

Fundamental Rights chapter in the Constitution does not give rise to a mere

rhetoric and symbolic value inhered by the polity but has to be reflected in

minute functioning of all the three wings of state - executive, legislature and

judiciary. When we talk of state action, devil lies in the detail. The approach

to writing of laws, rules, notifications etc. has to showcase these concerns.

</p><p id="p_158">      The image of law which flows from this framework is its neutrality

and objectivity: the ability of law to put sphere of general decision-making

outside the discretionary power of those wielding governmental power. Law

has to provide a basic level of "legal security" by assuring that law is

knowable, dependable and shielded from excessive manipulation. In the

context of rule making, delegated legislation should establish the structural

conditions within which those processes can function effectively. The

question which needs to be asked is whether delegated legislation promotes

rational and accountable policy implementation.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                     35</span>

</p><p id="p_159">      While we say so, we are not oblivious of the contours of the judicial

review of legislative acts.    But, we have made all endeavours to keep

ourselves confined within the well-known parameters.



</p><p id="p_160">      A subjectively worded normative device also enables the agency to

acquire rents. It determines the degree of accountability and responsiveness

of officials and of political and judicial control of the bureaucracy.



</p><p id="p_161">      However, when the provision inherently perpetuates injustice in the

award of licenses and brings uncertainty and arbitrariness it would be best to

stop the government in the tracks. Since the vires of the regulation is under

challenge, we took the opportunity to consider the propriety and

constitutionality of generic decision-making process encapsulated under the

impugned legislation. Amongst others, in this context, we strike down the

impugned clause.
