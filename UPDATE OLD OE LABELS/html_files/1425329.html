HEADNOTE:
The  respondent company, doing business, inter alia, in	 the
construction  of  buildings,  roads  and  other	 works	 was
assessed  to  sales  tax by the sales  tax  authorities	 who
sought	to include, the value of the materials used  in	 the
execution of building contracts within the taxable  turnover
of  the	 respondent.   The validity of	the  assessment	 was
challenged by the respondent who contended that the power of
the Madras Legislature to impose a tax on sales under  Entry
48  in List II in Sch.	VII of the Government of India	Act,
1935,  did  not	 extend to imposing a tax on  the  value  of
materials  used	 in  construction works,  as  there  was  no
transaction of sale in respect of those goods, and that	 the
provisions  introduced in the Madras General Sales Tax	Act,
1939, by the Madras General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947,
authorising  the  imposition of such tax were  ultra  vires.
The  Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal rejected the	respondent's
contention but, on
380
revision, the High Court took the view that the expression "
sale  of goods " had the same meaning in Entry 48  which  it
has  in	 the  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_3">Indian  Sale of  Goods  Act</a>,  1930,  that	 the
construction contracts of the respondent were agreements  to
execute	 works to be paid for according to  measurements  at
the  rates specified in the schedule thereto, and  were	 not
contracts  for sale of the materials used therein, and	that
further,  they were entire and indivisible and could not  be
broken	up  into  a contract for sale  of  materials  and  a
contract  for payment for work done.  Accordingly,  it	held
that  the  impugned  provisions	 introduced  by	 the  Madras
General	 Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947, were	ultra  wires
the powers of the provincial Legislature.  On appeal to	 the
Supreme Court:
Held,  (1)  On the true interpretation of the  expression  "
sale  of  goods	 " there must be an  agreement	between	 the
parties	 for the sale of the very goods in which  eventually
property passes.

<a href="/doc/424874/" id="a_5">The  State  of	Bombay v. The United  Motors  (India)  Ltd.,
II9531 S.C.R</a>. 1069, relied on.
In a building contract, the agreement between the parties is
that the contractor should construct the building  according
to  the	 specifications contained in the agreement,  and  in
consideration therefor receive payment as provided  therein,
and in such an agreement there is neither a contract to sell
the  materials:used in the construction, nor  does  property
pass therein as moveables.
(2)  The expression " sale of goods" was, at the  time	when
the  Government of India Act, 1935, was enacted, a  term  of
wellrecognised	legal import in the general law relating  to
sale  of goods and in the legislative practice	relating  to
that topic and must be interpreted in Entry 48 in List II in
Sch.   VII of the Act as having the same meaning as  in	 the
sale of <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_6">Goods Act</a>, 1930.

(3)In	a  building  contract  which  is  One,	entire	 and
indivisible, there is no sale of goods and it is not  within
the competence of the Provincial Legislature under Entry  48
in  List  11 in Sch.  VII of the Government  of	 India	Act,
1935, to impose a tax on the supply of the materials used in
such a contract treating it as sale.

(4)The Madras General Sales Tax Act is a law relating not to
sale  of goods but to tax on sale of goods and	consequently
the
381
Madras	General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947, is not	 bad
under  s. 107 of the Government of India Act, 1935,  On	 the
ground	that it had not been reserved for the assent of	 the
Governor-General.

definition of sale of goods contained in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_13">Indian Sale  of

question is whether definition in the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_14">Sales Tax Act</a> enlarges
the  concept of sale of goods as in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_15">Sale of	 Goods	Act</a>.
The only requirement of a sale of goods is that there should
be transfer of property in goods for valuable consideration.
See  Hudson  on	 Building  Contracts,  7th  Edn.,  p.	386.
Building Contracts involve sale of materials.

<p id="p_5">S.M. Sikri, Advocate General for the State of Punjab,N.	  S.
Bindra	and T M. Sen, for the State of Punjab  (Intervener).
The  words  "taxes on the sale of goods" in  Entry  48	mean
taxes on a transaction the effect of Which is to transfer to
a  person for valuable considers tion, all the rights of  an
owner  in the goods.  Sale of goods need not necessarily  be
in pursuance of a contract.  Even an auction sale is a	sale
and can be subjected to sales tax.  Exchange is also a	sale
of goods.  See Blackstone; Chalmers Sales of Goods Act, 12th
Edn., pp. 3, 172; Benjamin on Sales 8th Ed., p. 2; Halsbury,
Vol.  29, 2nd Edn., p. 5, see p. 6, footnote (c);  Williston
on  Sales Vol. 1, revised Ed., p. 2, 433.  Sale has a  wider
meaning and a prior agreement to sell goods is not necessary
to constitute sale of goods.  See Great Western Railway	 Co.
v.  Commissioners of Inland Revenue, ([1894] 1 Q. B. 507  at
512, 515, 516); Kirkness v. Johib Hudson &amp; Co. Ltd., ([1955]

S.  W.,	 (  (1912) 15 C. L. R. 661  at	665).	The  entries
conferring  legislative power are flexible and	elastic	 and
should be so construed as to include the extended and  wider
meaning of the words used therein.  Entry 48 should  include
not  only  what was understood as sales at the time  of	 the
enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, but also all
that  which  may  be regarded as sales later  on.   See	 The

deduce from the proposition that because the contract is not
an agreement to sell goods but a contract of work and labour
no  sale  of  goods  takes place.  A  works  contract  is  a
composite  transaction which can be split up and a  sale  of
goods  in the sense of the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_16">Sales of Goods Act</a> can  be  spelt
out  of it and it is permissible for the State to do so	 and
to tax the sale of goods.  Benjamin on Sales, pp. 155,	156,

nothing	 but a transfer of property for a price, There	need

ranged over a number of items, but we are concerned in	this
appeal	with only two of them.	One is with reference  to  a
sum  of	 Rs.  29,51,528-7-4 representing the  value  of	 the

so  far as they are relevant for the purpose of the  present
appeal.	  <a href="/doc/1993798/" id="a_35">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act had defined " goods  "  as

pondents the sum of Rs. 29,51,528-7-4 being the value of the
materials used in the construction works as determined under
r. 4(3).  The respondents contest this claim on the ground I
that the power of the Madras Legislature to impose a tax  on
sales  under  Entry  48	 in List II  in	 Sch.	VII  of	 the
Government  of India Act, does not extend to imposing a	 tax
on  the	 value of materials used in works, as  there  is  no
transaction of sale in respect of those goods, and that	 the
provisions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">388</span>
introduced by the Madras General Sales Tax (Amendment)	Act,
1947,  authorising  the	 imposition of such  tax  are  ultra
vires.	 As  regards  the  sum	of  Rs.	 1,98,929-0-3,	 the
contention  of the respondents was that they were not  doing
business  in the sale of foodgrains, that they had  supplied
them  to the workmen when they were engaged in	construction
works in out of the way places, adjusting the price therefor
in  the wages due to them and that the amounts	so  adjusted
were  not liable to be included in the turnover.  The  Sales
Tax Appellate Tribunal rejected both these contentions,	 and
held that the amounts in question were liable to be included
in the taxable turnover of the respondents.
Against	 this  decision,  the  respondents  preferred  Civil
Revision  Petition  No. 2292 of 1952 to the  High  Court  of
Madras.	 That was heard by Satyanarayana Rao and Rajagopalan
JJ. who decided both the points in their favour.  They	held
that the expression "sale of goods" had the same meaning  in
Entry  48 which it has in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_40">Indian Sale of Goods Act</a>	(III
of 1930), that the construction contracts of the respondents
were agreements to execute works to be paid for according to
measurements at the rates specified in the schedule thereto,
and were not contracts for sale of the materials used there-
in,  and that further, they were entire and indivisible	 and
could not be broken up into a contract for sale of materials
and  a contract for payment for work done.  In	the  result,
they  held  that the impugned provisions introduced  by	 the
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_41">Amendment  Act</a> No. XXV of 1947, were ultra vires the  powers
of  the Provincial Legislature, and that the claim based  on
those provisions to include Rs. 29,51,528-7-4 in the taxable
turnover  of  the respondents could not be  maintained.	  As
regards the item of Rs. 1,98,929-0-3 they held that the sale
of  foodgrains to the workmen was not in the course  of	 any
business of buying or selling those goods, that there was no
profit	motive	behind	it, that the  respondents  were	 not
dealers	 as  defined  in <a href="/doc/1993798/" id="a_42"> s. 2(d)</a>  of  the  Act,  and  that,
therefore, the amount in question was not liable to be taxed
under  the  Act.   In  the result,  both  the  amounts	were
directed  to  be excluded from the taxable turnover  of	 the
respondents.  Against this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">		  389</span>
decision,  the	State of Madras has  preferred	the  present
appeal on a certificate granted by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1011888/" id="a_43">Art.
133(1)</a> of the constitution
Before	us, the learned Advocate-General of Madras  did	 not
press  the appeal in so far as it relates to the sum of	 Rs.
1,98,929-0-3,	and  the  only	question,  therefore,	that
survives  for our decision is as to whether  the  provisions
introduced by the Madras General Sales Tax (Amendment)	Act,
1947  and  set out above are ultra vires the powers  of	 the
Provincial  Legislature	 under	Entry 48 in  List  II`.	  As
provisions  similar  to those in the Madras  Act  now  under
challenge  are	to be found in the sales tax laws  of  other
States, some of those States, Bihar, Punjab, Mysore,  Kerala
and  Andhra  Pradesh,  applied for  and	 obtained  leave  to
intervene in this appeal, and we have heard learned  counsel
on their behalf.  Some of the contractors who are interested
in  the	 decision of this question,  Gurbax  Singh,  Messrs.
Uttam Singh Duggal and United Engineering Company, were also
granted leave to intervene, and learned counsel representing
them have also addressed us on the points raised.
The  sole  question  for determination	in  this  appeal  is
whether	 the provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax	 Act
are  ultra vires, in so far as they seek to impose a tax  on
the  supply  of	 materials in execution	 of  works  contract
treating  it as a sale of goods by the contractor,  and	 the
answer	to it must depend on the meaning to be given to	 the
words " sale of goods " in Entry 48 in List II of Sch.	 VII
to  the	 Government of India Act, 1935.	 Now, it  is  to  be
noted  that while<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_44"> s. 311(2)</a> of the Act defines " goods "  as
including  " all materials, commodities and articles  ",  it
contains no definition of the expression " sale of goods  ".
It  was	 suggested  that  the word  "  materials  "  in	 the
definition  of " goods " is sufficient to take in  materials
used  in  a works contract.  That is so;  but  the  question
still  remains	whether there is a sale of  those  materials
within the meaning of that word in Entry 48.  On that, there
has  been sharp conflict of opinion among the  several	High
Courts.	  In Pandit Banarsi Das v. State of  Madhya  Pradesh
(1), a Bench of the Nagpur High Court held,
(1)  [1955] 6 S.T.C. 93.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">390</span>
<p id="p_25">differing  from the view taken by the Madras High  Court  in
the  judgment now under appeal, that the provisions  of	 the
Act  imposing a tax on the value of the materials used in  a
construction  on the footing of a sale thereof	were  valid,
but  that  they	 were  bad in so  far  as  they	 enacted  an
artificial rule for determination of that value by deducting
out  of the total receipts a fixed percentage on account  of
labour charges, inasmuch as the tax might, according to that
computation,  conceivably  fall on a portion of	 the  labour
charges	 and that would be ultra vires Entry 48.  A  similar
decision  was  given  by  the High  Court  of  Rajasthan  in
<a href="/doc/758240/" id="a_45">Bhuramal  v.  State Of Rajasthan</a>(1).  <a href="/doc/1976177/" id="a_46">In Mohamed  Khasim  v.
State of Mysore</a> (2), the Mysore High Court has held that the
provisions  of	the Act imposing a tax	on  construction  of
works are valid, and has further upheld the determination of
the  value of the materials on a percentage basis under	 the
rules.	In Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co. v. Sales Tax Officer	(3),
the Kerala High Court has likewise affirmed the validity  of
both  the provisions imposing tax on construction works	 and
the  rules  providing  for  apportionment  of  value  on   a
percentage basis.  <a href="/doc/294359/" id="a_47">In Jubilee Engineering Co., Ltd. v. Sales
Tax</a>  officer (1) the Hyderabad High Court has  followed	 the
decision of the Madras High Court, and held that the  taxing
provisions   in	 the  Act  are	ultra  vires.	The   entire
controversy,  it will be seen, hinges on the meaning of	 the
words ',sale of goods " in Entry 48, and the point which  we
have now to decide is as to the correct interpretation to be
put on them.
</p><p id="p_26">The contention of the appellant and of the States which have
intervened  is that the provisions of a	 Constitution  which
confer	 legislative   powers  should  receive	 a   liberal
construction,  and that, accordingly, the expression "	sale
of  goods  " in Entry 48 should be interpreted	not  in	 the
narrow and technical sense in which it is used in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_48">Indian
Sale  of  Goods Act</a>, 1930, but in a broad sense.   We  shall
briefly refer to some of the authorities cited in support of
this position.	In

<p id="p_29">British	 Coal  Corporation  v. King (1),  the  question	 was
whether s. 17 of the Canadian Statute, 22 &amp; 24, Geo.  V,  c.
53, which abolished the right of appeal to the Privy Council
from  any  judgment or order of any court  in  any  criminal
case, was intra vires its powers under the, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_49">Constitution Act</a>
of  1867.   In	answering it in	 the  affirmative,  Viscount
Sankey L. C. observed:
</p><p id="p_30">"  Indeed, in interpreting a constituent or organic  statute
such  as the Act, that construction most beneficial  to	 the
widest	possible  amplitude of its powers must	be  adopted.
This  principle	 has  been again clearly laid  down  by	 the
Judicial Committee in Edwards v. A. G. for Canada (2) ".
In  James  v.  Commonwealth of Australia  (3),	Lord  Wright
observed  that a Constitution must not be construed  in	 any
narrow	and pedantic sense.  In In re the Central  Provinces
and <a href="/doc/560085/" id="a_50">Berar Act</a> No. XIV of 1938 (4), discussing the principles
of interpretation of a constitutional provision, Sir Maurice
Gwyer C. J. observed:
</p><p id="p_31">" I conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should  inspire
those  whose duty it is to interpret it; but I do not  imply
by  this  that	they  are free to  stretch  or	pervert	 the
language  of the enactment in the interests of any legal  or
constitutional theory, or even for the purpose of  supplying
omissions or of correcting supposed errors.  A Federal Court
will  not strengthen, but only derogate from, its  position,
if  it seeks to do anything but declare the law; but it	 may
rightly	 reflect  that a Constitution of a Government  is  a
living	and organic thing, which of all instruments has	 the
greatest  claim	 to be construed ut res	 magis	valeat	quam
pereat."
</p><p id="p_32">The  authority most strongly relied on for the appellant  is
the  decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1126318/" id="a_51">Navinchandra Mafatlal v.	 The
Commissioner  of Income-tax, Bombay City</a> (5), in  which	 the
question  was  as to the meaning of the word " income  "  in
Entry  54  of  List  1.	 The  contention  was  that  in	 the
legislative  practice of both England and India,  that	word
had been understood as

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">392</span>
<p id="p_37">not  including	accretion in value to capital, and  that  it
should	therefore  bear the same meaning in  Entry  54.	  In
rejecting this contention, this Court observed that the	 so-
called	"  legislative	practice was  nothing  but  judicial
interpretation	of  the	 word 'income as  appearing  in	 the
fiscal	statutes", that in " construing an entry in  a	List
conferring   legislative   powers   the	  widest    possible
construction according to their ordinary meaning must be put
upon the words used therein ", and that the cardinal rule of
interpretation	was  " that words should be  read  in  their
ordinary,  natural and grammatical meaning, subject to	this
rider that in construing words in a constitutional enactment
conferring  legislative power the most liberal	construction
should	be  put	 upon the words so that the  same  may	have
effect in their widest amplitude."
</p><p id="p_38">The learned Advocate-General of Madras also urged in further
support	 of  the above conclusion that the provisions  of  a
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_52">Constitution  Act</a>  conferring powers of taxation  should  be
interpreted   in  a  wide  sense,  and	relied	on   certain
observations  in  Morgan v. Deputy Federal  Commissioner  of
Land  Tax,  N.	S.  W. (1) and Broken  Hill  South  Ltd.  v.
Commissioner  of  Taxation (N.S. W.)(2) in  support  of	 his
contention.   In  Morgan v. Deputy Federal  Commissioner  of
Land  Tax, N.S. W. (1), the question was as to the  validity
of a law which had enacted that lands belonging to a company
were  deemed to be held by its shareholders as joint  owners
and  imposed  a land tax on them in respect of	their  share
therein.  In upholding the Act, Griffith C. J. observed :
"  In  my  opinion,  the  Federal  Parliament  in  selecting
subjects of taxation is entitled to take things as it  finds
them in re rum nature, irrespective of any positive laws  of
the  States prescribing rules to be observed with regard  to
the  acquisition or devolution of formal title to  property,
or  the institution of judicial proceedings with respect  to
it."
</p><p id="p_39">In Broken Hill South Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxation, N.   S.
W. (2), the observations relied on are the following:
(I)  (19I2) 15 C.L.R. 661, 666.	 (2) (1937) 56	C.L.R.	337,
</p><p id="p_40">379.

"In any investigation of the constitutional powers of  these
great  Dominion legislatures, it is not proper that a  court
should	deny  to  such a legislature the  right	 of  solving
taxation  problems unfettered by a priori  legal  categories
which  often derive from the, exercise of legislative  power
in the same constitutional unit."
</p><p id="p_41">On  these  authorities, the contention of the  appellant  is
well-founded that as the words " sale of goods " in Entry 48
occur in a <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_53">Constitution Act</a> and confer legislative powers on
the  State  Legislature in respect of a	 topic	relating  to
taxation,  they must be interpreted not in a restricted	 but
broad  sense.  And that opens up questions as to  what	that
sense is, whether popular or legal, and what its connotation
is  either in the one sense or the other.   Learned  counsel
appearing  for the States and for the assessees have  relied
in  support of their respective contentions on	the  meaning
given to the word " sale " in authoritative text-books,	 and
they  will now be referred to.	According, to Blackstone,  "
sale or exchange is a transmutation of property from one man
to another, in consideration of some price or recompense  in
value.	  "   This  passage  has,  however,   to   be	read
distributively	and  so read, sale would  mean	transfer  of
property for price.  That is also the definition of " sale "
in Benjamin on Sale, 1950 Edn., p. 2. In Halsbury's Laws  of
England,  Second Edn., Vol. 29, p. 5, para.  I, we have	 the
following:
</p><p id="p_42">" Sale is the transfer of the ownership of a thing from	 one
person	 to   another  for  a  money   price.	 Where	 the
consideration  for the transfer consists of other goods,  or
some  other  valuable consideration, not  being	 money,	 the
transaction  is	 called exchange or barter; but	 in  certain
circumstances it may be treated as one of sale.
The  law  relating  to contracts of exchange  or  barter  is
undeveloped,  but  the courts seem inclined  to	 follow	 the
maxim  of civil law, permutatio vicina est emptioni, and  to
deal with such contracts as analogous to contracts of  sale.
It  is clear, however, that statutes relating to sale  would
have no application to transactions by way of barter."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">59</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">394</span>
<p id="p_43">In Chaliner's <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_54">Sale of Goods Act</a>, 12th Edn., it is stated  at
p.  3  that  " the essence of sale is the  transfer  of	 the
property  in a thing from one person to another for a  price
",  and	 at  p.	 6  it is  pointed  out	 that  "  where	 the
consideration  for the transfer...... consists of the  deli-
very of goods, the contract is not a contract of sale but is
a  contract of exchange or barter ". In Corpus	Juris,	Vol.
55, p. 36, the law is thus stated:
</p><p id="p_44">"  Sale " in legal nomenclature, is a term of precise  legal
import, both at law and in equity, and has a well defined  "
legal  signification,  and  has been said to  mean,  at	 all
times, a contract between parties to give and pass rights of
property for money, which the buyer pays or promises to	 pay
to the seller for the thing bought or sold.  "
It is added that the word "sale" as used by the	 authorities
" is not a word of fixed and invariable meaning, but may  be
given a narrow. or broad meaning, according to the  context.
"  In  Williston on Sales, 1948 Edn., " sale  of  goods"  is
defined	 as " an agreement whereby the seller transfers	 the
property  in goods to the buyer for a  consideration  called
the  price " (p. 2). At p. 4439 the learned author  observes
that  " it has doubtless been generally said that the  price
must  be payable in money ", but expresses his opinion	that
it  may	 be any personal property.  In	the  Concise  Oxford
Dictionary, " sale " is defined as " exchange of a commodity
for money or other valuable consideration, selling ".
It  will be seen from the foregoing that there is  practical
unanimity  of opinion as to the import of the word " sale  "
in  its	 legal sense, there being only	some  difference  of
opinion in America as to whether price should be in money or
in money's worth, and the dictionary meaning is also to	 the
same  effect.  Now, it is argued by Mr. Sikri,	the  learned
Advocate-General  of Punjab, that the word " sale "  is,  in
its popular sense, of wider import than in its legal  sense,
and  that is the meaning which should be given to that	word
in  Entry 48, and he relies in support of this	position  on
the observations in Nevile Reid and Company Ltd.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">395</span>
<p id="p_45">v.   The  Commissioners	 of Inland Revenue (1).	  There,  an
agreement  was entered into on April 12, 1918, for the	sale
of  the	 trading  stock	 in  a	brewery	 business  and	 the
transaction  was  actually completed on June 24,  1918.	  In
between	 the two dates, the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_55">Finance Act</a>, 1918, had(  imposed
excess	profits	 tax,  and  the	 question  was	whether	 the
agreement dated April 12, 1918, amounted to a sale in  which
case the transaction would fall outside the operation of the
Act.  The Commissioners had held that as title to the  goods
passed only on June 24, 1918, the agreement dated April	 12,
1918,  was only an agreement to sell and not the sale  which
must  be held to have taken place on June 24, 1918, and	 was
therefore  liable to be taxed.	Sankey J. agreed  with	this
decision, but rested it on the ground that as the  agreement
left some matters still to be determined and was, in certain
respects, modified later, it could not be held to be a	sale
for the purpose of the Act.  In the course of the  judgment,
he  observed that " sale " in the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_56">Finance Act</a> should not  be
construed  in  the light of the provisions of  the  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_57">Sale  of
Goods  Act</a>,  but  must	be understood  in  a  commercial  or
business sense.
</p><p id="p_46">Now, in its popular sense, a sale is said to take place when
the bargain is settled between the parties, though  property
in  the	 goods	may not pass at that  stage,  as  where	 the
contract relates to future or unascertained goods, and it is
that  sense that the learned Judge would appear to have	 had
in his mind when he spoke of a commercial or business sense.
But apart from the fact that these observations were obiter,
this Court has consistently held that though the word " sale
"  in  its  popular sense is not restricted  to	 passing  of
title,	 and  has  a  wider  connotation  as   meaning	 the
transaction of sale, and that in that sense an agreement  to
sell  would,  as one of the essential ingredients  of  sale,
furnish	 sufficient nexus for a State to impose a tax,	such
levy could, nevertheless, be made only when the	 transaction
is  one	 of sale, and it would be a sale only  when  it	 has
resulted  in  the passing of property in the  goods  to	 the
purchaser.   <a href="/doc/1266379/" id="a_58">Vide Poppatlal Shah v. The State  of  Madras</a>(2)

in <a href="/doc/127667/" id="a_59">The Sales Tax Officer, Pilibhit v. Messrs</a>.  Budh  Prakash
Jai  Prakash (2) that the sale contemplated by Entry  48  of
the  Government	 of India Act was a   transaction  in  which
title to the goods passes and a mere executory agreement was
not a sale within that Entry.  We must accordingly hold that
the  expression	 "  sale of goods " in Entry  48  cannot  be
construed  in  its  popular  sense,  and  that	it  must  be
interpreted  in	 its legal sense.  What its  connotation  in
that  sense  is,  must now be ascertained.   For  a  correct
determination  thereof, it is necessary to digress  somewhat
into the evolution of the law relating to sale of goods.
The concept of sale, as it now obtains in our jurisprudence,
has  its  roots	 in the Roman law.  Under  that	 law,  sale,
emptio venditio, is an agreement by which one person  agrees
to  transfer  to another the exclusive	possession  (vacuagn
possesionem tradere) of something (merx) for  consideration.
In  the	 earlier  stages of its	 development,  the  law	 was
unsettled whether the consideration for sale should be money
or  anything  valuable.	  By  a	 rescript  of  the  Emperors
Diocletian and Maximian of the year 294 A.D., it was finally
decided that it should be money, and this law is embodied in
the  Institutes	 of  Justinian, vide  Title  XXIII.   Emptio
venditio is, it may be noted, what is known in Roman law  as
a  consensual  contract.  That is to say,  the	contract  is
complete when the parties agree to it, even without delivery
as  in contracts re or the observance of any formalities  as
in contracts verbis and litteris.  The common law of England
relating  to sales developed very much on the lines  of	 the
Roman  law  in insisting on agreement  between	parties	 and
price as essential elements of a contract of sale of  goods.
In his work on " Sale ", Benjamin observes:
</p><p id="p_50">"  Hence it follows that, to constitute a valid sale,  there
must be a concurrence of the following elements, viz.,
(1)  Parties competent to contract; (2) mutual assent; (3) a
thing,	the  absolute  or  general  property  in  which	  is
transferred from the seller to the buyer; and

called a sale; but where the transfer of the property in the
goods  is to take place at a future time or subject to	some
condition thereafter to be fulfilled the contract is  called
an agreement to sell.
</p><p id="p_56">(4)An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses
or  the	 conditions  are  fulfilled  subject  to  which	 the
property  in the goods is to be transferred." Coming to	 the
Indian law on the subject,<a href="/doc/170090888/" id="a_62"> s. 77</a> of the Indian Contract Act,
1872,  defined " sale " as " the exchange of property for  a
price involving the transfer of ownership of the thing	sold
from the seller to the buyer ". It was suggested that  under
this  section  it was sufficient to constitute a  sale	that
there  was a transfer of ownership in the thing for a  price
and that a bargain between the parties was not an  essential
element.  But the scheme of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_63">Indian Contract Act</a> is	that
it  enacts in ss.  I to 75 provisions applicable in  general
to all contracts, and then deals separately with  particular
kinds of contract such as sale, guarantee, bailment,  agency
and partnership, and the scheme necessarily posits that	 all
these transactions are based on agreements.  We then come to
the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_64">Indian Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1930, which repealed Ch.	 VII
of the Indian Contract Act relating to sale of goods, and<a href="/doc/928744/" id="a_65"> s.
4</a>  thereof is practically in the same terms as s. I  of	 the
English Act.  Thus, according to the law both of England and
of India, in order to constitute a sale it is necessary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">398</span>
that  there should be an agreement between the	parties	 for
the  purpose of transferring title to goods which of  course
presupposes capacity to contract, that it must be  supported
by  money  consideration,  and	that  as  a  result  of	 the
transaction  property  must  actually  pass  in	 the  goods.
Unless all these elements are present, there can be no sale.
Thus,  if  merely  title to the goods passes but  not  as  a
result	of  any	 contract between the  parties,	 express  or
implied, there is no sale.  So also if the consideration for
the transfer was not money but other valuable consideration,
it  may then be exchange or barter but not a sale.   And  if
under  the  contract  of sale, title to the  goods  has	 not
passed,	 then  there  is  an agreement to  sell	 and  not  a
completed sale.
</p><p id="p_57">Now,  it  is the contention of the respondents that  as	 the
expression  "  sale  of goods " was at	the  time  when	 the
Government  of	India  Act  was enacted,  a  term  of  well-
recognised legal import in the general law relating to	sale
of  goods and in the legislative practice relating  to	that
topic  both in England and in India, it must be	 interpreted
in Entry 48 as having the same meaning as in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_66">Indian Sale
of Goods Act</a>, 1930, and a number of authorities were  relied
on in support of this contention.  In United States v.	Wong
Kim Ark (1), it was observed:
</p><p id="p_58">"  In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted  in
the  light of the common law, the principles and history  of
which	were  familiarly  known	 to  the  framers   of	 the
Constitution.  The language of the Constitution, as has been
well said, could not be understood without reference to	 the
common law."
</p><p id="p_59">In South Carolina v. United States (2), Brewer J. observed:
"To  determine the extent of the grants of power,  we  must,
therefore,  place ourselves in the position of the  men	 who
framed	and adopted the Constitution, and inquire what	they
must  have understood to be the meaning and scope  of  those
grants.	 "

Ex-parte Grossman (1).
</p><p id="p_62">In  answer to the above line of authorities,  the  appellant
relies on the following observations in Continental Illinois
National  Bank and Trust Company of Chicago v. Chicago	Rock
Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company (1):
</p><p id="p_63">"  Whether a clause in the Constitution is to be  restricted
by  the	 rules of the English law as they existed  when	 the
Constitution  was  adopted  depends upon the  terms  or	 the
nature	of  the particular clause in  question.	  Certainly,
these  rules have no such restrictive effect in	 respect  of
any  constitutional grant of governmental power	 (Waring  v.
Clarke	(3) ), though they do, at least in  some  instances,
operate	  restrictively	 in  respect  of  clauses   of	 the
Constitution  which guarantee and safeguard the	 fundamental
rights and liberties of the individual, the best examples of
which, perhaps, are the Sixth and Seventh Amendments,  which
guarantee the right of trial by jury."
</p><p id="p_64">It  should,  however, be stated that the law  is  stated  in
Weaver on Constitutional Law, 1946 Edn., p. 77 and  Crawford
on  Statutory Construction, p. 258 in the same terms  as  in
South Corolina v. United States (4).  But it is	 unnecessary
to  examine  minutely  the precise scope  of  this  rule  of
interpretation	in American law, as the law on	the  subject
has  been  stated clearly and authoritatively by  the  Privy
Council	 in  construing the scope of the provisions  of	 the
British North America Act, 1867.  In L'Union St. Jacques  De

<p id="p_68">providing  for relief to a society in a state  of  financial
embarrassment  was  one	 with respect to  "  bankruptcy	 and
insolvency ". In deciding that it should be determined on  a
consideration  of what was understood as included  in  those
words in their legal sense, Lord Selborne observed :
"  The words describe in their known legal sense  provisions
made by law for the administration of the estates of persons
who may become bankrupt or insolvent, according to rules and
definitions  prescribed	 by  law, including  of	 course	 the
conditions  in	which  that  law  is  to  be  brought	into
operation,  the	 manner in which it is to  be  brought	into
operation, and the effect of its operation."
On  this test, it was held that the law in question was	 not
one  relating  to bankruptcy.  In Royal Bank  of  Canada  v.
Larue  (1), the question was whether<a href="/doc/278412/" id="a_69"> s. 11</a>, sub-s. (10),  of
the Bankruptcy Act of Canada under which a charge created by
a  judgment on the real assets of a debtor was postponed  to
an  assignment made by the debtor of his properties for	 the
benefit	 of his creditors was intra vires the powers of	 the
Dominion  Legislature,	as being one in respect of  "  bank-
ruptcy	and insolvency " within<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_70"> s. 91</a>, sub-cl. (21), of	 the
British North America Act.  Viscount Cave L. C. applying the
test  laid  down in L'Union St. Jacques De  Montreal  v.  Be
Lisle  (2),  held  that the impugned provision	was  one  in
respect of bankruptcy.
</p><p id="p_69">In  The Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John	East
Iron  Works Ltd. (3), the question arose under s. 96 of	 the
British	 North America Act, 1867, under which the  Governor-
General	 of the Dominion had power to appoint judges of	 the
superior  district  and	 county	 courts.   The	Province  of
Saskatchewan enacted the <a href="/doc/97606017/" id="a_71">Trade Union Act</a>, 1944,	 authorising
the  Governor  of  the Province	 to  constitute	 the  Labour

<p id="p_70">Simonds	 observed that the courts contemplated by<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_72"> s.  96</a>  of
the  Act  were those which were generally understood  to  be
courts	at the time when the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_73">Constitution Act</a>  was  enacted,
that  labour courts were then unknown, and that,  therefore,
the  reference to judges, and courts in<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_74"> s. 96</a> could  not  be
interpreted as comprehending a tribunal of the character  of
the Labour Relations Board.  In Halsbury's Laws 'of England,
Vol. 11, para. 157, p. 93, the position is thus summed up:
" The existing state of English law in 1867 is relevant	 for

in  conferring power and the extent of that power, e. g.  as
to customs legislation."
</p><p id="p_71">Turning next to the question as to the weight to be attached
to  legislative	 practice  in  interpreting  words  in	 the
Constitution, in Croft v. Dunphy (1), the question was as to
the  validity  of certain provisions in a  Canadian  statute
providing  for	the  search of	vessels	 beyond	 territorial
waters.	 These provisions occurred in a customs statute, and
were  intended	to  prevent evasion  of	 its  provisions  by

Lord Macmillan referred to the legislative practice relating
to customs, and observed:

for  Parliament must surely be presumed to have	 had  Indian
legislative  practice  in  mind	 and,  unless  the   context
otherwise   clearly  requires,	not  to	 have  conferred   a
legislative power intended to be interpreted in a sense	 not

<a href="/doc/334293/" id="a_78">In The State of Bombay v. F. N. Balsara</a> (2), in	 determining
the meaning of the word " intoxicating liquor " in Entry  31
of  List  11 of Sch.  VII to the Government  of	 India	Act,
1935,  this Court referred to the legislative practice	with
reference  to that topic in India as throwing light  on	 the
true scope of the entry. (Vide pp. 704 to 706).
On  the	 basis	of the above  authorities,  the	 respondents
contend	 that  the  true interpretation to  be	put  on	 the
expression " sale of goods " in Entry 48 is what it means in
the  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_79">Indian Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1930, and what it has  always
meant  in the general law relating to sale of goods.  It  is
contended   by	 the  appellants   quite   rightly-that	  in
interpreting  the  words of a Constitution  the	 legislative
practice  relative  thereto is not conclusive.	 But  it  is
certainly  valuable  and might	prove  determinative  unless
there are good reasons for disregarding it, and in <a href="/doc/127667/" id="a_80">The Sales

<p id="p_78">of the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_81">English Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1893, the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_82">Indian  Contract
Act</a>,  1872,  and  the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_83">Indian Sale of Goods  Act</a>,  1930,	 for
construing the word "sale" in that Entry and observed:
"Thus, there having existed at the time of the( enactment of
the Government of India Act; 1935, a well-defined and  well-
established  distinction between a sale and an agreement  to
sell, it would be proper to interpret the expression "	sale
of goods " in entry 48 in the sense in which it was used  in
legislation  both in England and India and to hold  that  it
authorises  the	 imposition of a tax only when	there  is  a
completed sale involving transfer of title."
This  decision,	 though	 not decisive of  the  present	con-
troversy,  goes	 far  to  support  the	contention  of	 the
respondents  that  the words " sale of goods " in  Entry  48
must  be  interpreted in the sense which they  bear  in	 the
<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_84">Indian Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1930.
</p><p id="p_79">The  appellant	and  the  intervening  States  resist	this
conclusion on the following grounds:
</p><p id="p_80">(1)  The provisions of the Government of India Act, read  as
a  whole, show that the words " sale of goods " in Entry  48
are  not to be interpreted in the sense which they  have  in
the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_85">Indian Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1930;
</p><p id="p_81">(2)  The legislative practice relating to the topic of sales
tax  does not support the narrow construction sought  to  be
put on the language of Entry 48;
</p><p id="p_82">(3)  The  expression  " sale of goods " has in law  a  wider
meaning than what it bears in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_86">Indian Sale of Goods	Act</a>,
1930,  and  that is the meaning which must be put on  it  in
Entry 48; and
(4)  the language of Entry 48 should be construed  liberally
so  as	to  take in new concepts of  sales  tax.   We  shall
examine these contentions seriatim.
</p><p id="p_83">(1)  As	 regards the first contention, the argument is	that
in  the	 Government  of India Act,  1935,  there  are  other
provisions which give a clear indication that the expression
"  sale of goods " in Entry 48 is not to be  interpreted  in
the  sense which it bears in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_87">Indian Sale of	 Goods	Act</a>,
1930.  That is an argument open
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">404</span>
to  the appellant, because rules of interpretation are	only
aids  for ascertaining the true legislative intent and	must
yield  to the context, where the contrary  clearly  appears.
Now, what are the indications contra ? Section 311(2) of the
Government  of India Act defines " agricultural income "  as
meaning " agricultural income as defined for the purposes of
the  enactments relating to Indian income-tax ". It is	said
that  if the words " sale of goods " in Entry 48 were  meant
to  have the same meaning as those words in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_88">Indian	Sale
of Goods Act</a>, that would have been expressly mentioned as in
the  case  of definition of agricultural  income,  and	that
therefore  that	 is not the meaning which should be  put  on
them in that Entry.
</p><p id="p_84">In  our opinion, that is not the inference to be drawn	from
the  absence of words linking up the meaning of the  word  "
sale  " with what it might bear in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_89">Indian Sale of  Goods
Act</a>.  We think that the true legislative intent is that	 the
expression  "  sale of goods " in Entry 48 should  bear	 the
precise and definite meaning it has in law, and that meaning
should	not  be left to fluctuate with the definition  of  "
sale  " in laws relating to sale of goods which might be  in
force for the time being.  It was then said that in some  of
the  Entries, for example, Entries 31 and 49, List  11,	 the
word it sale " was used in a wider sense than in the  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_90">Indian
Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1930.  Entry 31 is " Intoxicating liquors
and  narcotic  drugs,  that  is	 to  say,  the	 production,
manufacture,  possession,  transport, purchase and  sale  of
intoxicating  liquors, opium and other narcotic	 drugs.	  ".
The  argument  is  that	 "  sale "  in	the  Entry  must  be
interpreted  as including barter, as the policy of  the	 law
cannot be to prohibit transfers of liquor only when there is
money consideration therefor. But this argument proceeds  on
a misapprehension of the principles on which the Entries are
drafted.  The scheme of the drafting is that there is in the
beginning of the Entry words of general import, and they are
followed  by  words having reference to	 particular  aspects
thereof.   The operation of the general words,	however,  is
not cut down by reason of the fact that there are  sub-heads
dealing with specific aspects.	In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">405</span>
Manikkasundara	v.  R.	S.  Nayudu(1)  occur  the  following
observations pertinent to the present question :
" The subsequent words and phrases are not intended to limit
the  ambit of the opening general term or phrase but  rather
to  illustrate	the  scope and objects	of  the	 legislation
envisaged as comprised in the opening term or phrase."
A  law	therefore prohibiting any  dealing  in	intoxicating
liquor,	 whether by way of sale or barter or gift,  will  be
intra  vires  the  powers conferred  by	 the  opening  words
without resort to the words " sale and purchase ". Entry  49
in  List II. is " Cesses on the entry of goods into a  local
area  for consumption, use or sale therein ". It  is  argued
that  the word " sale " here cannot be limited to  transfers
for money or for even consideration.  The answer to this  is
that the words " for consumption, use or sale therein "	 are
a  composite  expression meaning octroi duties, and  have  a
precise	 legal connotation, and the use of the word  "	sale
therein " can throw no light on the meaning of that word  in
Entry  48.   We are of opinion that the	 provisions  in	 the
Government  of India Act, 1935, relied on for the  appellant
are too inconclusive to support the inference that " sale  "
in  Entry  48 was intended to be used in a  sense  different
from that in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_91">Indian Sale of Goods Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_85">(2)  It is next urged that, for determining the true meaning
of the expression " Taxes on the sale of goods " in Entry 48
it  would not be very material, to refer to the	 legislative
practice  relating to the law in respect of sale  of  goods.
It  is argued that " sale of goods " and " taxes on sale  of
goods " are distinct matters, each having its own incidents,
that  the scope and object of legislation in respect of	 the
two  topics are different, that while the purpose of  a	 law
relating to sale of goods is to define the rights of parties
to  a  contract, that of a law relating to tax oil  sale  of
goods  is to bring money into the coffers of the State,	 and
that,  accordingly, legislative practice with  reference  to
either topic cannot be of much assistance with reference  to
the other.  Now, it is trite that the object and
(1)  [1946] F.C.R. 67, 84.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">406</span>
<p id="p_86">scope  of the two laws are different, and if there  was	 any
difference  in	the legislative practice with  reference  to
these  two topics, we should, in deciding the question	that
is now before us, refer more appropriately to that  relating
to  sales tax legislation rather than that relating to	sale
of goods.  But there was, at the time when the Government of
India  Act was enacted, no law relating to sales tax  either
in  England  or	 in India.  The first sales tax	 law  to  be
enacted in India is the Madras General Sales Tax Act,  1939,
and that was in exercise of the power conferred by Entry 48.
In England, a purchase tax was introduced for the first time
only  by  the  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_92">Finance Act</a> No. 2  of  1940.   The  position,
therefore,   is	 that  Entry  48  introduces  a	  topic	  of
legislation  with respect to which there was no	 legislative
practice.
</p><p id="p_87">In  the	 absence of legislative practice with  reference  to
sales  tax  in this country or in England, counsel  for	 the
appellant and the States sought support for their contention
in  the	 legislative  practice	of  Australia  and   America
relating to that topic.	 In 1930, the Commonwealth Sales Tax
Act was enacted in Australia imposing a tax on retail sales.
A   question  ARose,  Whether  a  contractor  who   supplied
materials in execution of a works contract could be taxed as
on a sale of the materials.  In Sydney Hydraulic and General
Engineering Co. v. Blackwood &amp; Son (1), the Supreme Court of
New South Wales held that the agreement between the  parties
was  one to do certain work and to supply certain  materials
and  not  an agreement for sale or delivery  of	 the  goods.
Vide Irving's Commonwealth Sales Tax Law and Practice,	1950
Edn.,  p.  77.	 In 1932,  the	Legislature  intervened	 and
enacted in the Statute of 1930, a new provision,<a href="/doc/736534/" id="a_93"> s. 3(4)</a>, in
the following terms:
</p><p id="p_88">"  For the purpose of this Act, a person shall be deemed  to
have sold goods if, in the performance of any contract	(not
being  a contract for the sale of goods) under which he	 has
received, or is entitled to receive, valuable consideration,
he supplies goods the property in which (whether as goods or
in some other form) passes, under the terms of the contract,
to some other person."

<p id="p_90">After  this, the question arose in M. R.  Hornibrook  (Pty.)
Ltd.  v.  Federal  Commissioner	 of  Taxation(1)  whether  a
contractor   who   fabricated  piles  and   used   them	  in
constructing  a	 bridge was liable to pay sales tax  on	 the
value of the piles.  The majority of the( Court held that he
was.   Latham  C.  J. put his decision on  the	ground	that
though	there  was, in fact, no sale of the  piles,  in	 law
there  was  one by reason of<a href="/doc/736534/" id="a_94"> s. 3(4)</a> of the Act.   Now,	 the
judgment  of the learned Chief Justice is really adverse  to
the appellant in that it decides that under the general	 law
and  apart from<a href="/doc/736534/" id="a_95"> s. 3(4)</a> there was no sale of  the  materials
and  that it was only by reason of the deeming provision  of
s.  3(4)  that it became a taxable sale.  The  point  to  be
noted is that under the Australian Constitution the power to
legislate  on  the  items mentioned in s.  51  of  the	Con-
stitution  Act	is vested Exclusively  in  the	Commonwealth
Parliament.  Item (ii) in<a href="/doc/409932/" id="a_96"> s. 51</a> is " Taxation; but so as not
to discriminate between States or parts of States ". Subject
to  this condition, the power of Parliament is	plenary	 and
absolute, and in exercise of such a power it could impose  a
tax  on the value of the materials used by a  contractor  in
his  works  contracts;	and it could  do  that	whether	 the
transaction  amounts  in fact to a sale or not.	  It  is  no
doubt brought under the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_97">Sales Tax Act</a>, it being deemed to be
a  sale;  but that is only as a matter of  convenience.	  In
fact, two of the learned Judges in M.' R. Hornibrook  (Pty.)
Ltd.  V. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1)  rested  their
decision  on  the ground that the use of  materials  in	 the
construction  was itself taxable under the Act.	  But  under
the  Government of India Act, the Provincial Legislature  is
competent to enact laws in respect of the matters enumerated
in  Lists II and III, and though the entries therein are  to
be  construed liberally and in their widest  amplitude,	 the
law  must,  nevertheless,  be  one  with  respect  to  those
matters.  A power to enact a law with respect to tax on sale
of  goods  under Entry 48 must, to be intra  vires,  be	 one
relating  in  fact to sale of goods,  and  accordingly,	 the
Provincial Legislature cannot, in the purported exercise  of
its power
(1)  (1939) 62 C.L.R. 272.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">408</span>
<p id="p_91">to tax sales, tax transactions which are not sales by merely
enacting that they shall be deemed to be sales.
The  position in the American law appears to be the same  as
in  Australia.	In Blome Co. v. Ames (1), the Supreme  Court
of Illinois held that a sales tax was leviable on the value,
of  materials used by a contractor in the construction of  a
building  or  a fixture treating the transaction as  one  of
sale of those materials.  But this decision Was overruled by
a later decision of the same Court in Herlihy  Mid-Continent
Co.  v.	 Nudelman  wherein it was held	that  there  was  no
transfer of title to the materials used in construction work
as  goods, and that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_98">Sales Tax Act</a>	 had
accordingly no application.  This is in accordance with	 the
Generally  accepted  notion  of sale  of  goods.   This,  of
course,	 does not preclude the States in exercise  of  their
sovereign  power from imposing tax on construction works  in
respect	 of materials used therein.  Thus, position is	that
in 1935 there was no legislative practice relating to  sales
tax  either  in England or India, and that  in	America	 and
Australia,  tax on the supply of materials  in	construction
works was imposed but that was in exercise of the  sovereign
powers of the Legislature by treating the supply as a  sale.
But  apart, from such legislation, the expression  "sale  of
goods  " has been construed as having the meaning  which  it
has in the common law of England relating to sale of  goods,
and it has been held that in that sense the use of materials
in  construction works is not a sale.  This rather  supports
the conclusion that sale " in Entry, 48 must be construed as
having	the same meaning which it has in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_99">Indian Sale  of
Goods Act</a>, 1930.
</p><p id="p_92">(3)  It is next contended by Mr. Sikri that though the	word
"  sale " has a definite sense in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_100">Indian Sale  of  Goods
Act</a>,  1930,  it	 has a wider sense in law  other  than	that
relating  to sale of goods, and that, on the principle	that
words  conferring legislative powers should be construed  in
their  broadest amplitude, it would be proper  to  attribute
that sense to it in Entry
(1) (1937) 111 A.L.R. 940.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">409</span>
<p id="p_94">48.It  is  argued that in its wider sense the  expression  "
sale  of  goods " means all transactions  resulting  in	 the
transfer of title to goods from one person to another,	that
a, bargain between the parties was not an essential  element
thereof, and that even involuntary sales, would fall  within
its  connotation.  He relied in support of this position  on
various	 dicta	in  Ex Parte Drake In  re  Ware	 (1),  Great
Western Railway Co. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue	(2),
The  Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Newcastle  Breweries
Ltd. (3), Kirkness v. John Hudson &amp; Co. Ld. (4) and Nalukuya
v.  Director of Lands, Native Land Trust Board of Fiji	(5).
In  Ex Parte Drake In re Ware (1), the question was  whether
an  unsatisfied	 decree	 passed	 in  an	 action	 on  detinue
extinguished  the  title of the decree-holder to  the  thing
detained.   In	answering it in the negative, Jessel  M.  R.
observed:
</p><p id="p_95">" The judgments in Brinsmead v. Harrison and especially that
of Mr. Justice Willes, shew that the theory of the  judgment
in an action of detinue is that it is a kind of	 involuntary
sale of the Plaintiff's goods to the Defendant."
He went on to state that such sale took place when the value
of the goods is paid to the owner.  In Great Western Railway
Co.  v.	 Commissioners	of Inland Revenue  (2),	 an  Act  of
Parliament had provided for the dissolution of two companies
under  a scheme of amalgamation with a third  company  under
which  the  shareholders were to be given  in  exchange	 for
their shares in the dissolved companies, in the case of	 one
company,  stock	 in the third company in  certain  specified
proportions,  and in the other, discharge of  debentures  on
shares	already	 held  by them in the  third  company.	 The
question was whether a copy of the Act had to be stamped  ad
valorem as on conveyance on sale under the first schedule to
the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_101">Stamp Act</a>, 1891.  The contention of the company was that
there was no sale by the shareholders of their shares to it,

observed:
</p><p id="p_97">"  Turning  to	the  <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_102">Stamp  Act</a>, the  words  used  are	'  a

preceding it ? Is that the way to construe the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_103">Stamp Act</a>, or
does  it  mean a conveyance the same as if it  were  upon  a
contract of purchase and sale ? The latter seems to me to be
the meaning of the phrase as there used.
</p><p id="p_98">Kay L. J. said:
</p><p id="p_99">" And we must remember that the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_104">Stamp Act</a> has nothing to  do
with contracts or negotiations; it stamps a conveyance	upon
a  sale,  which is the instrument by which the	property  is
transferred upon a sale.  "
</p><p id="p_100">This  is a decision on the interpretation of the  particular
provision  of  the  <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_105">Stamp  Act</a>,	 and  is  not  relevant	  in
determining the meaning of sale under the general law.	And,
if  anything,  the observations above quoted  emphasise	 the
contrast  between the concept of sale under the general	 law
and  that which is embodied in the particular  provision  of
the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_106">Stamp Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_101">In   The  Commissioners	 of  Inland  Revenue  v.   Newcastle
Breweries  Ltd.(1),  the  point	 for  decision	was  whether
payments  made	by the Admiralty to the	 respondent  company
which  was  carrying on business as brewers, on	 account  of
stocks	of  rum	 taken over by	it  compulsorily  under	 the
Defence	 of Realm Regulations were liable to be assessed  as
trade  receipts to excess profits duty.	 The  contention  of
the  company was that the acquisition by the  Admiralty	 was
not  a sale, that the payments made were not price of  goods
sold but compensation for interference with the carrying  on
of  business by it, and that accordingly the  amounts  could
not be held to have been received in the course of trade  or
business.  In rejecting this contention, Viscount Cave L. C.
observed:
</p><p id="p_102">"If the raw rum had been voluntarily sold to other  traders,

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">411</span>
<p id="p_103">circumstance  that  the sale was compulsory and was  to	 the
Crown makes no difference in principle.	 "
</p><p id="p_104">In  Kirkness v. John Hudson &amp; Co. Ltd. (1), the	 facts	were
that railway wagons belonging to the respondent company were
taken  over  by	 the Transport	Commission  compulsorily  in
exercise  of the powers conferred by<a href="/doc/340758/" id="a_107"> s. 29</a> of the  Transport
Act, 1947, and compensation was paid therefor.	The question
was  whether  this amount was liable to	 income-tax  on	 the
footing	 of  sale  of  the  wagons  by	the  company.	 The
contention  on	behalf of the Revenue  was  that  compulsory
acquisition being treated as sale under the English law, the
taking	over  of  the wagons  and  payment  of	compensation
therefor  must	also  be regarded as  sale  for	 purpose  of
income-tax.   Lord Morton in agreeing with  this  contention
observed:
</p><p id="p_105">"........  the question whether it is a correct use  of	 the
English language to describe as a 'sale' a transaction	from
which the element of mutual assent is missing is no doubt an
interesting one.  I think, however, that this question loses
its  importance	 for  the purpose of the  decision  of	this
appeal	when  it  is realized that for the  last  100  years
transactions by which the property of A has been transferred
to  B, Oil payment of compensation to the owner but  without
the consent of the owner, have been referred to many  times,
in Acts of Parliament, in opinions delivered in this  House,
in  judgments of the Court of Appeal and the High  Court  of
Justice,  and  in  textbooks  as a  sale  '-generally  as  a
compulsory sale
"  The	case of Newcastle Breweries Ld.	 v.  Inland  Revenue
Commissioners  (2 ), referred to later, affords	 a  striking
modern instance of the use of the word I sale' as applied to

"  In  these  circumstances, whether this use  of  the	word
'sale'	was  originally	 correct or  incorrect,	 I  find  it

<p id="p_107">But  the  majority  of the House came to  a  different	con-
clusion, and held that the element of bargain was  essential
to constitute a sale, and to describe compulsory taking over
of property as a sale was a misuse of that word.
In Nalukuya v. Director of Lands, Native Land Trust Board of
Fiji, Intervener (1), it was held by the Privy Council	that
compensation money payable on the compulsory acquisition  of
land was covered by the words " the purchase money  received
in  respect of a sale or other disposition of native land  "
in s. 15 of the Native Land Trust Ordinance, c. 86 of  1945,
Fiji.	The decision, however, proceeded on  the  particular
terms  of the statute, and does not affect the	decision  in
Kirkness v. John Hudson &amp; Co. Ltd. (2) that mutual assent is
an element of a transaction of sale.
</p><p id="p_108">It  should  be	noted  that the main  ground  on  which	 the
decision of Lord Morton rests is that compulsory acquisition
of  property had been described in the legislative  practice
of  Great  Britain  as compulsory  sales.   The	 legislative
practice of this country, however, has been different.	 <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_110">The
Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894, refers to the compulsory  taking
over  of immovable property as acquisition.  In List  11  of
the  Government	 of India Act, this topic  is  described  in
Entry  9  as  " compulsory acquisition	of  land".   In	 the
Constitution,  Entry  42 in List III is	 "  acquisition	 and
requisition of property ". The ratio on which the opinion of
Lord  Morton  is based has no place in the  construction  of
Entry  48,  and the law as laid down by the majority  is  in
consonance with the view taken by this Court that bargain is
an  essential  element	in  a  transaction  of	sale.	<a href="/doc/1266379/" id="a_111">Vide

unnecessary  to discuss the other English cases cited  above
at  any	 length, as the present question  did  not  directly
arise for decision therein, and the decision in Kirkness  v.

<p id="p_113">of  view but more limited in its sweep is that urged by	 the
learned Solicitor-General of India, the Advocate General  of
Madras and the other counsel appearing for the States,	that
even  in the view that an agreement between the parties	 was
necessary  to  constitute a sale, that	agreement  need	 not
relate to the goods as such, and that it would be sufficient
if  there  is an agreement between the parties	and  in	 the
carrying out of that agreement there is transfer of title in
movables   belonging   to   one	 person	  to   another	 for
consideration.	 It  is argued that Entry 48  only  requires
that  there  should be a sale, and that	 means	transfer  of
title  in  the goods, and that to attract the  operation  of
that Entry it is not necessary that there should also be  an
agreement to sell those goods.	To hold that there should be
an agreement to sell the goods as such is, it is  contended,
to add to the Entry, words which are not there.
We are unable to agree with this contention.  If the words "
sale of goods " have to be interpreted in their legal sense,
that  sense can only be what it has in the law	relating  to
sale of goods.	The ratio of the rule of interpretation that
words  of  legal  import occurring in a	 statute  should  be
construed in their legal sense is that those words have,  in
law,  acquired	a  definite and	 precise  sense,  and  that,
accordingly, the legislature must be taken to have  intended
that   they  should  be	 understood  in	 that	sense.	  In
interpreting an expression used in a legal sense, therefore,
we  have only to ascertain the precise connotation which  it
possesses  in  law.  It has been already stated	 that,	both
under the common law and the statute law relating to sale of
goods  in England and in India, to constitute a	 transaction
of  sale there should be an agreement, express	or  implied,
relating  to  goods to be completed by passing of  title  in
those goods.  It is of the essence of this concept that both
the  agreement	and  the  sale should  relate  to  the	same
subject-matter.	   Where  the  goods  delivered	 under	 the
contract are not the goods contracted for, the purchaser has
got  a	right to reject them, or to accept  them  and  claim
damages	 for breach of warranty.  Under the law,  therefore,
there  cannot  be  an  agreement relating  to  one  kind  of
property and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">414</span>
a  sale as regards another.  We are accordingly	 of  opinion
that on the true interpretation of the expression " sale  of
goods  " there must be an agreement between the parties	 for
the  sale  of the very goods in	 which	eventually  property
passes.	  In a building contract, the agreement between	 the
parties	 is that the contractor should construct a  building
according to the specifications contained in the  agreement,
and  in consideration therefor receive payment	as  provided
therein, and as will presently be shown there is in such  an
agreement  neither a contract to sell the materials used  in
the   construction,  nor  does	property  pass	therein	  as
movables.  It is therefore impossible to maintain that there
is  implicit in a building contract a sale of  materials  as
understood in law.
</p><p id="p_114">(4)  It	  was  finally	contended  that	 the  words   of   a
Constitution   conferring   legislative	 power	 should	  be
construed in such manner as to make it flexible and  elastic
so  as	to enable that power to be exercised in	 respect  of
matters	 which might be unknown at the time it	was  enacted
but  might  come into existence with the march of  time	 and
progress  in  science,	and  that  on  this  principle	 the
expression " sale of goods " in Entry 48 should include	 not
only  what  was	 understood  as sales at  the  time  of	 the
Government  of India Act, 1935, but also whatever  might  be
regarded  as  sale in the times to come.  The  decisions  in
Attorney General v. Edison Telephone Company of London	(1),
Toronto Corporation v. Bell Telephone Company of Canada (2),
The Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada,
In  re (3) and.	 The King v. Brislan: Ex Parte Williams	 (4)
were quoted as precedents for adopting such a  construction.
In  Attorney General v. Edison Telephone Company  of  London
(1), the question was whether the Edison Telephone  Company,
London,	  had	infringed   the	  exclusive   privilege	  of
transmitting  telegrams	 granted to the	 Postmaster  General
under  an  Act of 1869 by installation of  telephones.	 The
decision turned on the construction of the definition of the
word " telegraph " in the Acts of
(1)  (1880) L.R. 6 Q.B.D. 244.
</p><p id="p_115">(2)  [1905] A.C. 52.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">415</span>
<p id="p_118">1863  and  1869.   It was contended  for  the  Company	that
telephones  were  unknown at the time when those  Acts	were
passed and therefore could not fall within the definition of
"telegraph".   The  Court negatived this contention  on	 the
ground	that the language of the definition was wide  enough
to include telephones. Toronto Corporation v. Bell Telephone
Company	 of Canada (1) is a decision on s. 92(10)(a) of	 the
British	 North America Act, 1867, under which  the  Dominion
Parliament  had	 the exclusive competence to  pass  laws  in
respect	 of  "	lines of steam	or  other  ships,  railways,
canals,	  telegraphs,  and  other  works  and	undertakings
connecting  the	 province with any other or  others  of	 the
provinces  or extending beyond the limits of the  province".
The  question  was whether a law incorporating	a  telephone
company	 and conferring on it powers to enter  upon  streets
and  highways  vested in a municipal corporation  was  intra
vires the powers of the Dominion Parliament under the  above
provision,  and	 whether in consequence a  provision  in  an
Ontario	  Act  requiring  the  consent	of   the   municipal
authorities  for  the carrying out of those  operations	 was
ultra  vires.	It was held by the Privy  Council  that	 the
Parliament of Canada was competent to enact the impugned law
under <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_113"> s. 92(10)(a)</a> and that, therefore, it  prevailed	over
the  <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_114">Provincial Act</a>.  This decision, however, would seem  to
have   been  reached  on  the  words  "	 other	 works	 and
undertakings " in the section.
</p><p id="p_119">In  The,  Regulation and Control of Radio  Communication  in
Canada, In re (2), the question was whether broadcasting was
covered	 by  the expression "telegraph and other  works	 and
undertakings  "	 in<a href="/doc/504161/" id="a_115"> s. 92(10)(a)</a> of  the  Constitution	Act,
1867.	The Privy Council answered it in the affirmative  on
the grounds, firstly, that broadcasting was an " undertaking
connecting  the province with other provinces and  extending
beyond	the  limits of the province and, secondly,  that  it
fell  within the description of telegraph ". In The King  v.
Bristan:  Ex Parte Williams (3), the question was whether  a
law of the Commonwealth
(1) [1905] A.C. 52.	    (2) [1932] A.C. 304.
</p><p id="p_120">(3)  (1935) 54 C.L.R. 262.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">416</span>
<p id="p_121">Parliament  with respect to radio broadcasting was one	with
respect to " Postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other	like
services  "  under s. 51(5) of the  Australian	Commonwealth
Act, and it was answered in the affirmative.
The  principle	of these decisions is that when,  after	 the
enactment  of a legislation, new facts and situations  arise
which  could  not  have	 been  in  its	contemplation,	 the
statutory  provisions could properly be applied to  them  if
the words thereof are in a broad sense capable of containing
them.  In that situation, " it is not ", as observed by Lord
Wright in James v. Commonwealth of Australia (1), " that the
meaning of the words changes, but the changing circumstances
illustrate and illuminate the full import of that meaning ".
The  question then would be not what the framers  understood
by those words, but whether those words are broad enough  to
include	 the  new  facts.  Clearly, this  principle  has  no
application  to	 the  present case.  Sales  tax	 was  not  a
subject which came into vogue after the Government of  India
Act, 1935.  It was known to the framers of that statute	 and
they made express provision for it under Entry 48.  Then  it
becomes merely a question of interpreting the words, and  on
the principle, already stated, that words having known legal
import	should be construed in the sense which they  had  at
the time of the enactment, the expression " sale of goods  "
must  be construed in the sense which it has in	 the  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_116">Indian
Sale of Goods Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_122">A  contention  was also urged on behalf of  the	 respondents
that even assuming that the expression " sale of goods "  in
Entry 48 could be construed as having the wider sense sought
to  be given to it by the appellant and that the  provisions
of  the	 Madras	 General Sales Tax Act	imposing  a  tax  on
construction  contracts	 could be sustained as	within	that
entry in that sense, the impugned provisions would still  be
bad  under  s. 107 of the Government of India Act,  and	 the
decision in D. Sarkar &amp; Bros. v. Commercial Tax Officer	 (2)
was  relied on in support of this contention.  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_117">Section	107</a>,
so far as is material, runs as follows:

provisions of this section, the Dominion law, whether passed

(2),  its  provisions are bad to the extent  that  they	 are
repugnant  to the definition of " sale " in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_120">Indian	Sale
of Goods Act</a>, 1930.  The short answer to this contention  is
that the Madras General Sales Tax Act is a law relating	 not
to  sale of goods, but to tax on sale of goods, and that  it
is not one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent	List
or over which the Dominion Legislature is competent to enact
a  law, but is a matter within the exclusive  competence  of
the  Province under Entry 48 in List II.  The only  question
that can arise with reference to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">53</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">418</span>
such  a	 law  is whether it is within the  purview  of	that
Entry.	If it is, no question of repugnancy under <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_121"> s.  107</a>
can arise.  The decision in D. Sarkar &amp; Bros. v.  Commercial
Tax Officer(1) on this point cannot beaccepted as sound.
It now remains to deal with the contention pressed on us  by
the  States  that even if the supply of	 materials  under  a
building  contract  cannot be regarded as a sale  under	 the
<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_122">Indian	Sale of Goods Act</a>, that contract is  nevertheless  a
composite agreement under which the contractor undertakes to
supply	 materials,  contribute	 labour	 and   produce	 the
construction, and that it is open to the State in  execution
of  its	 tax  laws  to split  up  that	agreement  into	 its
constituent  parts,  single out that which  relates  to	 the
supply of materials and to impose a tax thereon treating  it
as  a sale.  It is said that this is a, power  ancillary  to
the  exercise  of the substantive power to  tax	 sales,	 and
reliance  is  placed  on  the  observations  in	 The  United
Province v. Atiqa Begum (2) and <a href="/doc/1126318/" id="a_123">Navinchandra Mafatlal v. The
Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City</a> (3) at p. 836.	 The
respondents  contend that even if the agreement between	 the
parties	 could be split up in the manner suggested  for	 the
appellant, the resultant will not be a sale in the sense  of
the  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_124">Indian  Sale  of  Goods Act</a>, as there  is	in  a  works
contract neither an agreement to sell materials as such, nor
does property in them pass as movables.
</p><p id="p_127">The  nature and incidents of works contracts have  been	 the
subject	 of  consideration  in	numerous  decisions  of	 the
English courts, and there is a detailed consideration of the
points	 now  under  discussion,  in  so  far  as   building
contracts,  are concerned, in Hudson on Building  Contracts,
7th Ed., pp. 386-389 and as regards chattels, in Benjamin on
Sale,  8th Ed., pp.' 156-168 and 352-355.  It  is  therefore
sufficient to refer to the more important of the cases cited
before us. In Tripp v. Armitage (4), one Bennett, a builder,
had entered into an agreement with certain trustees to build
a hotel.  The agreement provided inter alia that
(1)  A.I.R. 1957 Cal. 283.

</p><p id="p_130">(4) (1839) 4 M &amp; W. 687 ; 15o E.R. 1597.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">419</span>
<p id="p_131">the articles which were to be used for the structure had  to
be  approved by the trustees.  Subsequently, Bennett  became
bankrupt,  and	the  dispute was between  his  assignees  in
bankruptcy,  and  the trustees as regards title	 to  certain
wooden sash-frames which had been approved on behalf of	 the
trustees  but had not yet been fitted in the building.	 The
trustees  claimed them on the ground that property  therein,
had passed to them when once they had approved the same.  In
negativing this contention, Lord Abinger C. B. observed:
"..  ............  this is not a contract for the  sale	 and
purchase  of goods as movable chattels; it is a contract  to
make  up  materials, and to fix them ; and  until  they	 are
fixed, by the nature of the contract, the property will	 not
pass."
</p><p id="p_132">Parke B. observed:
</p><p id="p_133">"............ but in this case, there is no contract at	 all
with  respect  to  these particular  chattels-it  is  merely
parcel	of  a larger contract.	The contract  is,  that	 the
bankrupt  shall build a house; that he shall  make,  amongst
other  things, window-frames for the house, and fix them  in
the house' subject to the approbation of a surveyor; and  it
was never intended by this contract, that the articles so to
be fixed should become the property of the defendants, until
they were fixed to the freehold."
</p><p id="p_134">In  Clark  v.  Bulmer  (1), the	 plaintiff  entered  into  a
contract  with	the defendant " to build an  engine  of	 100
horse  power  for the sum of E. 2,500, to be  completed	 and
fixed by the middle or end of December ". Different parts of
the  engine were constructed at the plaintiff's	 manufactory
and  sent  in parts to the defendant's colliery	 where	they
were fixed piecemeal and were made into an engine.  The suit
was  for the recovery of a sum of E. 3,000 as price for "  a
main  engine  and  other goods sold  and  delivered  ".	 The
contention  of the defendant was that there was no  contract
of  sale, and that the action should have been one for	work
and labour and material used in the course of that work	 and
not for price of goods
(1)  (1843) 11 M &amp; W. 243; 152 E- R. 793.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">420</span>
<p id="p_135">sold and delivered.  In upholding this contention, Parke  B.
observed :
</p><p id="p_136">"  The	engine was not contracted for to  be  delivered,  or
delivered,  as	an  engine,  in	 its  complete	state,	 and
afterwards affixed to the freehold; there was no sale of it,
as  an entire chattel, and delivery in that character ;	 and
therefore  it  could not be treated as an  engine  sold	 and
delivered.   Nor could the different parts of it which	were
used in the construction, and from time to time fixed to the
freehold,  and therefore became part of it, be deemed  goods
sold  and delivered, for there was no contract for the	sale
of  them as moveable goods; the contract was in effect	that
the plaintiff was to select materials, make them into  parts
of an engine, carry them to a particular place, and put them
together, and fix part to the soil, and so convert them into
a  fixed engine on the land itself, so as to pump the  water
out of a mine."
</p><p id="p_137">In Seath v. Moore(1), the facts were similar to those in   Tripp
v. Armitage (2).  A firm of engineers, A.    Campbell &amp; Son,
had entered into five agreements with the appellants, T.  B.
Seath  and  Co., who were ship-builders to  supply  engines,
boilers	 and machinery required for vessels to be  built  by
them.  Before the completion of the contracts, A. Campbell &amp;
Son  became  bankrupt, and the dispute was  as	regards	 the
title  to  machinery and other articles which  were  in	 the
possession of the insolvents at the time of their bankruptcy
but which had been made for the purpose of being fitted into
the  ships of the appellants.  It was held by the  House  of
Lords approving Tripp v. Armitage(2) that there had been  no
sale of the machinery and parts as such, and that  therefore
they vested in the assignee.  For the appellant, reliance is
placed	on the following observations of Lord Watson  at  p.
380:
</p><p id="p_138">The English decisions to which I have referred appear to  me
to establish the principle that, where it appears to be	 the
intention,  or in other words the agreement, of the  parties
to a contract for building a, ship, that a particular  stage
of  its construction, the :vessel, so far as then  finished,
shall be appropriated to
(1)  (1886) 11 App.  Cas. 35o.
</p><p id="p_139">(2)  (1839) 4 M &amp; W. 687; 15o E.R. 1597.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">421</span>
<p id="p_140">the contract of sale, the property of the vessel as soon  as
it  has	 reached that stage of completion will pass  to	 the
purchaser, and subsequent additions made to the chattel thus
vested	in  the	 purchaser  will,  accessione,	become	 his
property.  "
</p><p id="p_141">It is to be noted that even in this passage the title to the
parts  is  held to pass not under any contract	but  on	 the
principle  of  accretion.   The	 respondents  rely  on	 the
following  observations	 at p. 381 as  furnishing  the	true
ground of the decision
"  There  is  another principle which appears to  me  to  be
deducible from these authorities and to be in itself  sound,
and  that  is, that materials provided by  the	builder	 and
portions   of  the  fabric,  whether  wholly  or   partially
finished,  although intended to be used in the execution  of
the  contract,	cannot be regarded as  appropriated  to	 the
contract, or as ' sold', unless they have been affixed to or
in a reasonable sense made part of the corpus.	That appears
to me to have been matter of direct decision by the Court of
Exchequer  Chamber in Wood v. Bell(1).	In Woods v.  Russell
(2)  the  property of a rudder and some	 cordage  which	 the
builder	 had bought for the ship was held to have passed  in
property to the purchaser as an accessory of the vessel; but
that  decision was questioned by Lord Chief Justice  Jervis,
delivering the judgment of the Court in Wood v. Bell(1), who
stated	the real question to be 'what is the ship, not	what
is  meant for the ship', and that only the things  can	pass
with the ship I which have been fitted to the ship and	have
once  formed  part of her, although afterwards	removed	 for
convenience I assent to that rule, which appears to me to be
in accordance with the decision of the Court of Exchequer in
Tripp v Armitage (3)".
</p><p id="p_142"> In  Reid v. Macbeth &amp; Gray (4), the facts were that a	firm
of  ship-builders  who	had agreed to build  a	ship  became
bankrupt.  At the date of the bankruptcy, there was lying at
railway stations a quantity of iron 'and steel plates  which
were intended to be fixed in the

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">422</span>
<p id="p_145">ship.	The dispute was between the assignee  in  bankruptcy
and  the shipowners as to the title to these  articles.	  It
was held by the House of Lords following Seath v. Moore	 (1)
and in particular the observations of Lord Watson at p.	 381
that  the  contract was one for the purchase of	 a  complete
ship, and that under that contract no title to the  articles
in  question  passed  to  the  shipowners.   The   following
observations  of Lord Davey are particularly appropriate  to
the present question :
</p><p id="p_146">" There is only one contract--a contract for the purchase of
the ship.  There is no contract for the sale or purchase  of
these  materials  separatism  ; and unless you	can  find  a
contract  for the sale of these chattels within the  meaning
of the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_125">Sale of Goods Act</a>, it appears to me that the sections
of that Act have no application whatever to the case."
If  in	a works contract there is no sale  of  materials  as
defined	 in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_126">Sale of Goods Act</a>, and if an action  is	 not
maintainable for the value of those materials as for  price,
of   goods  sold  and  delivered,  as  held  in	 the   above
authorities,  then  even a disintegration  of  the  building
contract  cannot yield any sale such as can be	taxed  under
Entry 48.
</p><p id="p_147">The  decision in Love v. Norman Wright (Builders)  Ld.	(2),
cited by the appellant does not really militate against this
conclusion.  There, the defendants to the action had  agreed
with the Secretary of State to supply blackout curtains	 and
curtain rails, and fix them in a number of police  stations.
In  their turn, the defendants had entered into	 a  contract
with the plaintiffs that they should prepare those  curtains
and rails and erect them.  The question was whether the sub-
contract was one for sale of goods or for work and services.
In deciding that it was the former, Goddard L. J. observed :
"  If  one orders another to make and fix curtains   at	 his
house the contract is one of sale though work and labour are
involved  in the making and fixing, nor does it matter	that
ultimately the property was to pass to the War Office, under
the head contract.  As
(1) (1886) 11 App.  Cas. 350.
</p><p id="p_148">(2) [1944] 1 K.B. 484, 487.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">423</span>
<p id="p_149">between	 the plaintiff and the defendants the former  passed
the property in the goods to the defendants who passed it on
to the War Office.  "
</p><p id="p_150">It  will be seen that in this case there was no question  of
an agreement to supply materials as parcel of a contract  to
deliver	 a  chattel;  the  goods to  be	 supplied  were	 the
curtains  and  rails which were the  subject-matter  of	 the
contract itself.  Nor was there any question of title to the
goods passing as an accretion under the general law, because
the  buildings where they had to be erected belonged not  to
the  defendants	 but  to the Government,  and  therefore  as
between	 the parties to the contract, title could pass	only
under their contract.
</p><p id="p_151">The  contention that a building contract contains within  it
all  the elements constituting a sale of' the materials	 was
sought	to  be established by reference to the form  of	 the
action, when the claim is in quantum meruit.  It was  argued
that if a contractor is prevented by the other party to	 the
contract  from	completing  the	 construction  he  has,	  as
observed by Lord Blackburn in Appleby v. Myres (1), a  claim
against	 that party, that the form of action in such a	case
is  for	 work done and materials supplied, as  appears	from
Bullen	&amp; Leake's Precedents of Pleadings, 10th Ed., at	 pp.
285-286,  and that showed that the concept of sale of  goods
was  latent  in	 a building contract.  The  answer  to	this
contention  is that a claim for quantum, meruit is  a  claim
for  damages for breach of contract, and that the  value  of
the  materials	is a factor relevant only  as  furnishing  a
basis for assessing the amount of compensation.	 That is  to
say, the claim is not for price of goods sold and  delivered
but for damages.  That is also the position under<a href="/doc/206984/" id="a_127"> s. 65</a>	 of'
the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_128">Indian Contract Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_152">Another difficulty in the way of accepting the contention of
the appellant as to splitting up a building contract is that
the property in materials used therein does not pass to	 the
other  party to the contract as movable property.  It  would
so pass if that was the agreement between the parties.	 But
if there was no
(1)  (1867) L.R. 2 C.P. 651.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">424</span>
<p id="p_153">such  agreement	 and the contract was only  to	construct  a
building, then the materials used therein would be come	 the
property  of  the other party to the contract  only  on	 the
theory	of  accretion.	 The  position	is  thus  stated  by
Blackburn J. at pp. 659-660 in Appleby v. Myres (1):
"  It  is quite true that materials worked by one  into	 the
property  of another become part of that property.  This  is
equally	 true,	whether	 it be fixed  or  movable  property.
Bricks	built into a wall become part of the  house;  thread
stitched  into a coat which is under repair, or	 planks	 and
nails  and pitch worked into a ship under repair,  become  a
part of the coat or the ship.
</p><p id="p_154">When  the work to be executed is, as in the present case,  a
house,	the  construction imbedded on the  land	 becomes  an
accretion  to it on the principle quicquid  plantatur  solo,
solo  cedit and it vests in the other party not as a  result
of  the contract but as the owner of the land.	Vide  Hudson
on Building Contracts, 7th Edn. p. 386.	  It is argued	that
the maxim, what is annexed    to  the  soil  goes  with	 the
soil, has not been accepted as	   a  correct  statement  of
the  law  of  this country, and reliance is  placed  on	 the
following  observations	 in the Full Bench decision  of	 the
Calcutta  High	Court  in  Thakoor  Chunder  Poramanick	  v.
Ramdhone Bhuttacharjee (2) :
</p><p id="p_155">We  think it should be laid down is a general rule that,  if
he  who makes the improvement is not a mere trespasser,	 but
is  in	possession  under any bona fide title  or  claim  of
title,	he  is	entitled either	 to  remove  the  materials,
restoring  the land to the state in which it was before	 the
improvement  was  made, or to obtain  compensation  for	 the
value  of  the building if it is allowed to remain  for	 the
benefit	 of the owner of the soil,-the option of taking	 the
building, or allowing the removal of the material, remaining
with  the  owner  of the land in those cases  in  which	 the
building,  is  not  taken down by  the	builder	 during	 the
continued ance of any estate he may possess."
The statement of the law was quoted with approval
(1) (1867) L.R. 2 C.P. 651.
</p><p id="p_156">(2) (1866) 6W.R. 228.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">425</span>
<p id="p_157">by  the Privy Council in <a href="/doc/168023/" id="a_129">Beni Ram v. Kundan Lall</a> (1) and  in
Narayan	  Das  Khettry	v.  Jatindranath  (2).	 But   these
decisions  are	concerned with rights of  persons  who,	 not
being  trespassers, bona fide put up constructions on  lands
belonging to others, and as to such persons the	 authorities
lay down that the maxim recognised in English law,  quicquid
plantatur solo, solo cedit has no application, and that they
have  the right to remove the superstructures, and that	 the
owner  of the land should pay compensation if he  elects  to
retain	them.	That exception does not apply  to  buildings
which are constructed in execution of a works contract,	 and
the law with reference to them is that the title to the same
passes	to  the owner of the land as an	 accretion  thereto.
Accordingly,  there  can  be no question  of  title  to	 the
materials  passing as movables in favour of the other  party
to  the contrat.  It may be, as was suggested by Mr.  Sastri
for  the  respondents, that when the thing  to	be  produced
under  the contract is moveable property, then any  material
incorporated into it might pass as a movable, and in such  a
case  the conclusion that no taxable sale will	result	from
the disintegration of the contract can be rested only on the
ground that there was no agreement to sell the materials  as
such.	But we are concerned here with a building  contract,
and  in the case of such a contract, the theory that it	 can
be broken up into its component parts and as regards one  of
them  it can be said that there is a sale must fail both  on
the grounds that there is no agreement to sell materials  as
such, and that property in them does not pass as movables.
To sum up, the expression " sale of goods " in Entry 48 is a
nomen juris, its essential ingredients being an agreement to
sell  movables	for  a price and  property  passing  therein
pursuant  to that agreement.  In a building  contract  which
is, as in the present case, one, entire and indivisible	 and
that  is its norm, there is no sale of goods, and it is	 not
within	the competence of the Provincial  Legislature  under
Entry 48 to
(1)  (1899) L. R. 26 1. A. 58.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">426</span>
impose	a tax on the supply of the materials used in such  a
contract treating it as a sale.
</p><p id="p_159">This  conclusion  entails  that	 none  of  the	legislatures
constituted  under  the Government of India Act,  1935,	 was
competent  in the exercise of the power conferred by<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_130"> s.	 100</a>
to  make laws with respect to the matters enumerated in	 the
Lists,	to impose a tax on construction contracts  and	that
before	such  a	 law could be enacted  it  would  have	been
necessary to have had recourse to the residual powers of the
GovernorGeneral	 under	s. 104 of the Act.  And it  must  be
conceded  that a construction which leads to such a.  result
must, if that is possible, be avoided.	Vide  Manikkasundara
v.  R. S. Nayudu (1).  It is also a fact that acting on	 the
view  that Entry 48 authorises it, the States  have  enacted
laws  imposing	a tax on the supply of	materials  in  works
contracts,  and have been realising it, and  their  validity
has  been affirmed by several High Courts.  All	 these	laws
were  in  the statute book when the Constitution  came	into
force, and it is to be regretted that there is nothing in it
which  offers a solution to the present question.  We  have,
no  doubt,  <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_131">Art.  248</a>  and Entry 97  in	 List  I  conferring
residual power of legislation on Parliament, but clearly  it
could not have been intended that the Centre should have the
power  to  tax	with respect to	 works	constructed  in	 the
States.	 In view of the fact that the State Legislatures had
given  to  the expression " sale of goods " in	Entry  48  a
wider  meaning than what it has in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_132">Indian Sale of  Goods
Act</a>, that States with sovereign powers have in recent  times
been  enacting laws imposing tax on the use of materials  in
the construction of buildings, and that such a power  should
more  properly	be lodged with the States  rather  than	 the
Centre,	 the  Constitution  might have	given  an  inclusive
definition  of	"  sale " in Entry 54 so  as  to  cover	 the
extended sense.	 But our duty is to interpret the law as  we
find  it, and having anxiously considered the  question,  we
are  of opinion that there is no sale as such  of  materials
used  in  a  building  contract,  and  that  the  Provincial
Legislatures had no competence to impose a tax thereon under
Entry 48,

<p id="p_160">To  avoid  misconception, it must be stated that  the  above
conclusion  has	 reference  to works  contracts,  which	 are
entire and indivisible, as the contracts of the	 respondents

be.   The  several forms which such kinds of  contracts	 can
assume	are set out in Hudson on Building Contracts,  at  p.
</p><p id="p_161">165.   It  is  possible that the parties  might	 enter	into
distinct  and  separate contracts, one for the	transfer  of
materials for money consideration, and the other for payment
of  remuneration for services and for work done.  In such  a
case,  there  are really two agreements, though there  is  a
single instrument embodying them, and the power of the State
to separate the agreement to sell, from the agreement to  do
work  and render service and to impose a tax thereon  cannot
be  questioned,	 and  will stand untouched  by	the  present
judgment.
