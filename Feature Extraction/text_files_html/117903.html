ACT:
     Code of  Criminal Procedure 1898-S. 195(1)(b)-Scope of-
'In relation  to any  proceedings in  any court' meaning of-
Police submitting  final report	 under<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1"> s.  173</a> Cr.  P.C. and
Magistrate passing  an order thereon-Whether judicial order-
Attracting the bar in<a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_2"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>.



HEADNOTE:
     <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_3">Section 195(1)(b)</a>	of the	Code of	 Criminal  Procedure
provides that  no court shall take cognizance of any offence
punishable under any of the sections enumerated therein (one
of which  is<a href="/doc/35598/" id="a_4"> s. 211</a>) if such offence is alleged to have been
committed in or in relation to any proceedings in any court.
     The appellant  filed a  complaint with  the police that
the accused  criminally trespassed, assaulted and abused him
in filthy language and committed theft of money and valuable
documents of the school of which he was the secretary. After
investigation the  police found	 that there  was no evidence
against the accused and therefore, the Magistrate discharged
all the accused.
     One of  the accused  thereupon  preferred	a  complaint
under<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_5"> s.  211</a> IPC alleging that the appellant had instituted
criminal proceedings  with the intent to cause injury to him
and others  knowing that  there was no just or lawful ground
and thereby caused pecuniary loss and agony to him.
     The appellant  moved the  High Court  for quashing	 the
proceedings before  the Magistrate because in the absence of
a complaint  in	 writing  of  the  Magistrate  himself,	 the
Magistrate had	no jurisdiction	 to take  cognizance of	 the
offence under  s.211 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> in view of the provisions of<a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_7"> s. 195</a>
(1)(b) of  the Cr.  P.C. The High Court refused to quash the
proceedings.
     On further appeal it was contended that an order passed
by a Magistrate on a report submitted by the police under<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_8"> s.
173</a> Cr. P. C. being a judicial order the bar of<a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_9"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>
would be attracted.
     Allowing the appeal,
^
     HELD: Per	Koshal, J.  (with  whom	 Jaswant  Singh,  J.
agreed) 1.  The	 complaint  against  the  appellant  was  in
respect of  an offence	alleged to  have been  committed  in
relation to  a proceeding  in court. In taking cognizance of
it  the	  Magistrate  acted  in	 contravention	of  the	 bar
contained in <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_10"> s. 195(1)(b)</a> because there was no complaint in
writing either	of the	Magistrate or  of a  superior court.
[756 D]
     2. Taking	cognizance of  any offence  by a  Magistrate
under<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_11"> s.  190</a> is  not a	 condition precedent  for him  to be
regarded as  a court.  Magistrates are specifically labelled
as courts  by<a href="/doc/909219/" id="a_12"> s.  6</a> of	the Code  of Criminal Procedure and,
therefore, have	 to be	regarded as  such. It is true that a
Magistrate also performs functions which are of an executive
nature and do not fall within
718
the sphere of judicial duties and it may plausibly be argued
that in	 the discharge of those functions he does not act as
a court.  But then he cannot but be regarded as a court when
he  acts   judicially.	<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">Sections  496</a>  and  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">497</a>	 which	make
provision for  bail  matters  describe	a  Magistrate  while
dealing with  those matters  as a  court and  these sections
operate at  all stages	of a  case including  that when	 the
investigation has  just started.  Neither in  these sections
nor in	s. 195	is there  anything to  show  that  the	word
"court" has  been used in two different senses and therefore
the legislature	 must be deemed to have used it in one sense
wherever it occurs in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15"> the Code</a>. [743 B, 742 D-H]
     3. The  well accepted  position is that a court created
by a  statute, when it performs judicial functions, would be
deemed to  act as  a  court;  and  Magistrates'	 courts	 are
regarded as  such unless  they are  performing executive  or
administrative functions. [744 F-G].
     Shell Co.	of Australia Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of
Taxation, [1931]  AC 275  PC and  Halsbury's Laws of England
(3rd Edn.)  Vol. 9  p. 342;  <a href="/doc/197199/" id="a_16">Virinder Kumar Satyawadi v. The
State of  Punjab</a>, [1955] 2 SCR 1013; <a href="/doc/673012/" id="a_17">Smt. Ujjam Bai v. State
of U.P</a>., [1963] 1 SCR 778; referred to.
     4. The source of power exercised by the authority, i.e.
whether it  is executive  or judicial  power, would make all
the difference	in the determination of the question whether
the authority  acts as a court or merely as a quasi judicial
tribunal. [746 F].
     5. <a href="/doc/708036/" id="a_18">Section	 4(2)</a> of  the  Code  of	 Criminal  Procedure
provides that  "all words  and expressions  used herein	 and
defined in  the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">IPC</a>  and not  hereinabove defined  shall  be
deemed to  have the meanings respectively attributed to them
by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_20"> the	Code</a>." In  the matter  of dispensation	of  criminal
justice<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">	 the   Indian  Penal   Code</a>  (which   contains	 the
substantive law)  and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22"> the  Criminal  Procedure	Code</a>  (which
deals with  procedure) may  be regarded	 as supplementary to
each other.  The term "Judge" and "Court of justice" used in
ss. 19 and 20<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_23"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> give an indication of
the attributes of a court as used in criminal law generally.
Although the  term "court  of justice"	has not been used in
the Cr.	 P.C. the  expression "Judge" is used in<a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_24"> s. 197</a> and,
therefore, when	 a judge  (including a	Magistrate)  who  is
empowered to act judicially and does so act, constitutes not
merely a Court but a Court of Justice. [747 E, D, C, F-G].
     6. The  caption of	 Chapter XIV  is not decisive of the
question whether  a particular	provision contained in it is
limited to the supervisory jurisdiction of the Magistrate in
relation to  the investigation being conducted by the police
or deals  with his  judicial functions	as a court. Although
Chapter XIV  is headed	"Information to the police and their
powers to  Investigate", it is not confined to matters which
are strictly concerned with the investigation stage but also
deals with  situations arising	after the  investigation has
been finalised.	 For example, <a href="/doc/643569/" id="a_25"> s. 172(2)</a>  clearly deals with
the use	 of police  diaries at	an inquiry  or trial which a
Magistrate holds  not in  his  administrative  or  executive
capacity but  as a court. Similarly <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_26">sections 169</a> and <a href="/doc/1367808/" id="a_27">170</a> are
another instance  in point  in which  an order	passed by  a
Magistrate is a judicial order determining the rights of the
parties after application of his mind. If that
719
be so the order passed by the Magistrate in the instant case
must be characterised as a judicial act and therefore as one
performed in  his capacity  as a court. [748 D, 747 G-748 C,
750 G, 751 E]
     7. For  a tribunal	 to be	acting as a court, it is not
necessary that	the parties  must have a right of hearing of
adducing evidence  at every  stage of the proceedings before
it. While  passing interlocutory  orders, issuing  temporary
injunctions etc.,  the presiding officer of a court does act
as a court. [751 H-752 B].
     8. All  orders passed by a Magistrate acting judicially
(such as orders of bail and those passed under sub-s. (3) of
s. 173<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_28">	of the Code</a> discharging the accused or orders taking
cognizance of  an offence  complained of)  are parts  of  an
integral whole	which may  end with  a	definitive  judgment
after an  inquiry or  a trial  or earlier,  according to the
exigencies of  the situation obtaining at a particular stage
and which involves, if the need be, the adducing of evidence
and the	 decision  of  the  Magistrate	on  an	appreciation
thereof. They  cannot be  viewed in  isolation and  given  a
character different  from the  entire  judicial	 process  of
which they are intended to form a part. [752 E-F].
     <a href="/doc/49832/" id="a_29">Abhinandan Jha  &amp; Ors.  v. Dinesh	Mishra</a>, [1967] 3 SCR
668; <a href="/doc/340501/" id="a_30">M.	 L. Sethi  v. R.  P. Kapur &amp; Anr</a>., [1967] 1 SCR 520;
referred to.
     Kailasam, J. (dissenting)
     The restricted  meaning given  to "Court"	in<a href="/doc/953835/" id="a_31"> s. 195(2)</a>
Cr. P.C.  read along  with the	conditions to  be  specified
before a  complaint is preferred by the court, indicate that
the proceedings	 before a Magistrate in which he agrees with
the report  by the  police under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_32"> s. 169</a>  Cr. P.C.  and	 the
proceedings  in	  remand   or	bail   applications   during
investigations will  not amount	 to proceedings	 'in  or  in
relation to court.' [737 H].
     1. The  policy behind  the bar  against institution  of
criminal  proceedings  by  a  private  party  is  that	when
offences are  committed against	 lawful authority  or  false
evidence is  given or  offence is  committed against  public
justice, it  should be	the concerned  authority that should
prefer a complaint and no one else. [723 H].
     2. A court is charged with a duty to decide disputes in
a judicial  manner and	declare the  rights of	parties in a
definitive judgment. To decide in a judicial manner involves
that the  parties are  entitled as  a matter  of right to be
heard in  support of  their claim  and to adduce evidence in
proof of  it. It  also imparts	an obligation on the part of
the authority to decide the matter on a consideration of the
evidence adduced and in accordance with law [725 B-C].
     3. It is settled law that when a Magistrate applies his
mind on complaints, he must be held to have taken cognizance
of the	offence mentioned  in  the  complaint  but  when  he
applies his mind not for such purpose but for the purpose of
ordering investigation	under<a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_33"> s. 156(3)</a> Cr. P.C. or issues a
search warrant	for the	 purpose of investigation, he cannot
be said to have taken cognizance of any offence. [727 E]
     4. When  the Magistrate  receives a report under<a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_34"> s. 169</a>
of the	Cr. P.C.  that there  is not  sufficient evidence or
reasonable ground for suspicion and agrees
720
with it,  he may  be doing  so in  exercise of	his judicial
function but  the question  is whether	he is  acting  as  a
court. Most  of the  requirement of  a court  are lacking at
this stage. [727 F, 729 C].
     5. To  be classified  as a	 court, an authority must be
charged with  a duty to decide disputes in a judicial manner
and declare  the rights of parties in a definitive judgment.
This involves  that the	 parties are entitled as a matter of
right to  be heard  in support	of their claim and to adduce
evidence in proof of it and an obligation on the part of the
authority to  decide the  matter on  a consideration  of the
evidence adduced and in accordance with law. [729 D-E].
     6. Though	the Magistrate in deciding whether or not to
accept the  report of a police officer under<a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_35"> s. 169</a> Cr. P.C.
may be	exercising his judicial mind and though there may be
some of	 the trappings of the court, at this stage he cannot
be termed  as a	 court within  the provisions  of<a href="/doc/953835/" id="a_36"> s.  195(2)</a>
Cr.P.C. At  this stage	the rights  of the  parties are	 not
finally decided	 as the	 complainant is	 entitled to  file a
complaint directly  to the  Magistrate. The  persons accused
are not	 before the  Magistrate and  neither the complainant
nor the	 accused are  entitled to  be  heard  or  to  adduce
evidence before	 the Magistrate	 at this  stage. It  cannot,
therefore, be  said that the Magistrate has a duty to decide
the matter on a consideration of the evidence adduced before
him. [729 B, F-H]
     7. The  proceeding under <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_37"> s. 167</a>  Cr.  P.C.  is  during
investigation.	The   Magistrate  to  whom  the	 accused  is
produced can  from  time  to  time  authorise  detention  of
accused in  such custody as such Magistrate thinks fit for a
term not  exceeding 15	days in	 whole. If  he has  not	 the
jurisdiction to	 try the  case or  commit it  for trial	 but
considers further  detention is	 necessary, he may order the
accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having jurisdiction.
In investigation  by the police the Magistrate is associated
in  a	supervisory  capacity.	 The  action  taken  by	 the
Magistrate cannot  be taken  to be  that of  a court for the
Magistrate who	has no	jurisdiction to	 try the  case has a
limited power.	The trial  commences only  after the offence
has been taken cognizance of. [735 E-F]
     8. <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38">Section 496</a> provides as to when bail may be taken in
non-bailable offences.	The provisions	of<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_39"> s. 496</a> and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_40"> s. 497</a>
speak of  an accused  person in	 custody charged with a non-
bailable offence being produced before court at any stage of
the proceedings.  The section deals with the exercise of the
power of  a court  at any  stage  of  proceedings  when	 the
accused is  brought before  a Court  while in the custody of
the police  officer. Though there may be some trappings of a
court and  the section itself mentions the word 'court', the
requirements for  being a court for the purpose of<a href="/doc/953835/" id="a_41"> s. 195(2)</a>
have not been satisfied. [735 H-736 D]
     9(i) There is a conflict between various High Courts as
to whether  a complaint is necessary when on a police report
under s.  169 the  Magistrate  does  not  take	any  further
action. The  Bombay,  Saurashtra  and  Andhra  Pradesh	High
Courts in  1946 Bom.  7(11), 1952 Saurashtra 67(68) and 1969
AP 281 (287) have held that a Magistrate passing an order on
a final	 report of police under<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_42"> s. 173</a> referring the case as
false should  be deemed	 to be	a court	 passing a  judicial
order disposing	 of the	 information to the police, and that
in such a case, the complaint of the Magistrate is necessary
for the	 prosecution of	 the informant under<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_43"> s. 211</a> IPC. The
Madras, Calcutta and
721
Allahabad High Court in AIR 1934 Mad. 175, AIR 1948 All. 184
FB and AIR 1916 Cal. 593 have held the other view. (ii) When
no further  proceedings	 are  taken  by	 the  Magistrate  or
receipt of  a  police  report  under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_44"> s.  169</a>  there  is  no
proceeding in  or in relation to any court and therefore, no
complaint by the court is necessary. [733 G-734 B].

inclined to  agree with	 the opinion  of and  the conclusion
arrived at by my learned brother Koshal.
</p><p id="p_7">     KAILASAM, J.  This appeal	is filed by special leave by
Kamlapati Trivedi  against the judgment of the Calcutta High
Court in  Criminal Revision  No. 1006  of 1970	by which  it
refused to quash the proceedings which were taken cognizance
of by  the Magistrate,	on a  complaint given  by one  Satya
Narayan Pathak.
</p><p id="p_8">     Satya Narayan  Pathak  is	the  Secretary	of  Bhartiya
Primary School in Howrah. The appellant before us, Kamlapati
Trivedi, was  a Head Teacher of the Bhartiya Primary School.
On 18th	 April, 1970 Satya Narayan Pathak served a Notice on
the appellant  calling upon  him to show cause why he should
not be found guilty of negligence of duty. On receipt of the
Notice, the  appellant attempted  to remove  certain records
from the  school but he was prevented. On the same day, that
is, on	18th April, 1970 the appellant complained in writing
to the	Officer In-charge of Bally Police Station, Howrah at
21.40 hours  that Satya Narayan Pathak and others criminally
trespassed, assaulted  and abused him in filthy language and
committed theft	 of money  and	valuable  documents  of	 the
school. The  Police treating  the complaint of the appellant
as First  Information Report  took cognizance  of an offence
under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_45">Sections 147</a>, <a href="/doc/1947545/" id="a_46">448</a> and
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_47"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">722</span></a>
<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_48">379</a> I.P.C. and registered it. A warrant of arrest was issued
against Satya  Narayan	Pathak	and  others.  Satya  Narayan
Pathak attended	 the Court  on 21-5-1970  and 21-7-1970	 the
dates fixed  for submission of the Police report. The Police
Officer who  investigated the  case on	finding no  evidence
against Satya  Narayan Pathak  and others, named as accused,
submitted a  final report  and the  magistrate agreeing with
the report discharged all the accused.
</p><p id="p_9">     As	 Satya	 Narayan  Pathak  felt	that  the  appellant
instituted criminal  proceedings with intent to cause injury
to him	and others, for offences under <a href="/doc/1154131/" id="a_49">Sections 147</a>, <a href="/doc/1356222/" id="a_50">448</a> and
<a href="/doc/1524736/" id="a_51">379</a> knowing  that there was no just or lawful ground and had
caused pecuniary  loss and  agony to  him,  he	preferred  a
complaint against  the appellant for offences under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_52">Sections
211</a> and <a href="/doc/534484/" id="a_53">182</a> of the I.P.C. on 20th October, 1970. The learned
Magistrate took	 cognizance of	the case  and  summoned	 the
appellant under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_54">Section 211</a> of the Indian Penal Code. fixing
10th December, 1970 for appearance of the appellant. On 16th
November, 1970	the appellant  appeared	 in  court  and	 was
released on  bail. The	appellant moved	 the High  Court  of
Calcutta for  quashing the  proceeding of  the Magistrate on
the ground  that the  cognizance taken by the Magistrate was
bad and	 without  jurisdiction	for  non-compliance  of	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_55">Section 195(1)</a> (b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_56"> of Criminal Procedure Code</a>.
The learned  Judge refused  to	quash  the  proceedings	 and
discharge the  accused, by judgment dated 18th August, 1971.
Against the order of the Single Judge of the High Court, the
present appeal to this Court has been filed.
</p><p id="p_10">     The main  ground of  attack in  this appeal is that the
High Court failed to appreciate the meaning of the words "in

</p><p id="p_11">(b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_58"> of	the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure. It is submitted that

<p id="p_15">     In this  appeal we	 are  concerned	 with  the  question
whether the  offence under  <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_110">Section 211</a> I.P.C. is "committed
in or  in relation to any proceeding in any court". Before I
deal with  the question	 whether the offence is committed in
or in  relation to  any proceeding  in	any  court,  I	have
determined the	meaning of  the word 'court' for the purpose
of this	 Section. Sub-section (2) to <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_111">Section 195</a> states that
in clauses  (b) and  (c) of sub-section (1), the term "Court
includes a  Civil, Revenue  or Criminal	 Court, but does not
include	 a  Registrar  or  Sub-Registrar  under	 the  Indian
Registration Act,  1877. It  may  be  noted  that  the	word
'includes' was	introduced by an amendment to sub-clause (b)
Act 18	of 1923 instead of the word "means". In<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_112"> the Criminal
Procedure Code</a>	1974 the word 'means' has been introduced in
the place  of 'includes'. To some extent the use of the word
'includes'  may	 widen	the  scope  of	the  definition.  In
Halsbury's Laws	 of England, third edition, volume 9 at page
342, the  meaning of  court is	given. At  page	 343  it  is
stated: "many  bodies are  not courts, although they have to
decide questions,  and in so doing have to act judicially in
the sense  that	 the  proceedings  must	 be  conducted	with
fairness and  impartiality". Lord  Sankley in  Shell Co.  of
Australia Ltd.	vs. Federal  Commissioner  of  Taxation	 has
enumerated some	 negative propositions as to when a Tribunal
is not	a court. The learned Judge observed "The authorities
are clear  to show that there are Tribunals with many of the
trappings of  a court  which nevertheless  are not courts in
the  strict   sense  of	  exercising  judicial	 power".  In
enumerating the propositions Lord Sankey observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	  "In that  connection it may be useful to enumerate
     some negative  propositions  on  this  subject:  (1)  A
     tribunal is  not necessarily  a Court  in	this  strict
     sense because  it	gives  a  final	 decision.  (2)	 Nor
     because it hears witnesses on oath. (3) Nor because two
     or more  contending parties  appear before	 it  between
     whom it  has  to  decide.	(4)  Nor  because  it  gives
     decisions which  affect the rights of subjects. (5) Nor
     because there  is an appeal to a Court. (6) Nor because
     it is  a body  to which a matter is referred by another
     body".</blockquote>

<p id="p_18">tinction between  Courts  and  tribunals  exercising  quasi-
judicial functions  is well  established, though  whether an
authority constituted by a particular enactment falls within
one category  or the  other may,  on the  provisions of that
enactment, be  open to	argument.  After  referring  to	 the
various decisions,  the learned	 Judge observed	 "it may  be
stated broadly that what distinguishes a Court from a quasi-
judicial tribunal  is that  it is  charged with	 a  duty  to
decide disputes	 in a judicial manner and declare the rights
of parties in a definitive judgment. To decide in a judicial
manner involves that the parties are entitled as a matter of
right to  be heard  in support	of their claim and to adduce
evidence in  proof of  it. It  also imparts an obligation on
the part  of  the  authority  to  decide  the  matter  on  a
consideration of the evidence adduced and in accordance with
law.

</p><p id="p_20">     The answer to the question as to what is 'court' in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_115"> the
Criminal Procedure  Code</a> is  not free from difficulty for in
many places  the word Magistrate as well as court is used in
identical situations.  <a href="/doc/909219/" id="a_116">Section 6</a>  of the  Criminal Procedure
Code states  that besides  the High  Courts and	 the  Courts
constituted under  any law other than this Code for the time
being in  force there  should be  five classes	of  Criminal
Courts in  India,  namely:  (i)	 Courts	 of  Sessions;	(ii)
Presidency Magistrate,	(iii) Magistrates of the first class
</p><p id="p_21">(iv) Magistrates of the second class, (v) Magistrates of the
third class.  Criminal	courts	according  to  this  section
therefore, consist  of courts  specified  besides  the	High
Court and  courts that	are constituted	 under any other law
other than<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_117">  Criminal Procedure	Code</a>. The  Code of  Criminal
Procedure provides not merely judicial enquiry into or trial
of  alleged   offences	but  also  for	prior  investigation
thereof. <a href="/doc/1007660/" id="a_118">Section  5</a> of	the Code  provides that all offences
under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_119"> Indian Penal Code</a> shall be investigated, inquired into
and tried  and otherwise  dealt with  in accordance with the
provisions  hereinafter	  contained.  For  the	purposes  of
investigation  offences	 are  divided  into  two  categories
'cognizable' and  non-cognizable. When	information  of	 the
commission of  a cognizable  offence  is  received  or	such
commission is  suspected, the appropriate police officer has
the authority to enter on investigation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">726</span>
<p id="p_22">In case	 of non-cognizable  offence the	 officer  shall	 not
investigate without  the order	of a  competent	 Magistrate.
According to scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_120"> of the Code</a> investigation is preliminary
to a  case being  put up for trial for a cognizable offence.
Investigation  starts	on  an	 information   relating	  to
commission of  an offence  given to  an officer in-charge of
Police Station	and recorded  under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_121">Section 154</a> of the Code.
Investigation consists	generally of  various steps,  namely
proceeding  to	 the   spot-ascertainment   of	 facts	 and
circumstances of the case, discovery and arrest of suspected
offender, collection  of evidence relating to the commission
of the	offence which  may consist of examination of various
persons including  the accused,	 and the  reduction  of	 the
statement into	writing such as places and seizure of things
and formation of opinion as to whether on material collected
there is  a case  to place the accused before the Magistrate
for trial  and filing  of the charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_122">Section 173</a>
of the	Criminal Procedure  Code. After the investigation is
completed and  a chargesheet  is filed	under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_123">Section 173</a> of
the  Criminal	Procedure  Code	  the  question	  of  taking
cognizance arises.  <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_124">Section 190</a>	 of the	 Criminal  Procedure
Code  lays  down  conditions  necessary	 for  initiation  of
proceedings. It provides for that any Presidency Magistrate,
District Magistrate  or	 Sub-Divisional	 Magistrate  or	 any
other Magistrate specially empowered in this behalf may take
cognizance of any offence.
</p><p id="p_23">	  (a)  upon receiving  a complaint  of	facts  which
	       constitute such offence;
</p><p id="p_24">	  (b)  upon a  report in  writing of such facts made
	       by any police officer; and
</p><p id="p_25">	  (c)  upon information	 received  from	 any  person
	       other than  a police-officer  or upon his own
	       knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has
	       been committed.
</p><p id="p_26">     One mode of taking cognizance by the Magistrate is upon
a report  in writing  of  such	facts  made  by	 any  police
officer. This  stage is	 reached  when	the  police  officer
submits a  report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_125">Section 173</a>. When the Police Officer
upon investigation forms an opinion that there is sufficient
evidence or  reasonable ground	he shall forward the case to
the Magistrate	empowered to  take cognizance of the offence
upon a	Police report.	Under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_126">Section  190</a> of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code, if the Magistrate to whom the report is sent
by the Police Officer, agrees with the opinion of the police
officer, he  proceeds to take cognizance, and issues process
under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_127">Section  204</a>. The	 judicial opinion  is unanimous that
when once  Magistrate taking  cognizance of an offence finds
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding and issues
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">727</span>
summons	 or   a	 warrant  as  the  case	 may  be,  he  takes
cognizance, and	 the trial  begins, and	 further proceedings
will be undoubtedly before a criminal court.
</p><p id="p_27">     <a href="/doc/1915325/" id="a_128">In Jamuna Singh and others v. Bhadai Sah, Das Gupta, J</a>.
observed "The  Code does  not contain  any definition of the
words 'institution  of a  case'. It  is clear,	however, and
indeed	not  disputed,	that  a	 case  can  be	said  to  be
instituted in  a court	only when the court takes cognizance
of the	offence alleged	 therein." When	 once this  stage is
reached the  requirement of  <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_129">Section 211</a> of the Indian Penal
Code "institutes  or causes  to be  instituted any  criminal
proceeding" is	satisfied. The	second part  of <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_130">Section	 211</a>
I.P.C. refers  to falsely  charging  a	person	with  having
committed an offence. A person falsely charging another of a
cognizable offence  before a police officer will come within
the mischief of the second part of the Section.
</p><p id="p_28">     The crucial  question  that  arises  in  this  case  is
whether it  can be  said that  when a person falsely charges
another person	of a  cognizable  offence  before  a  Police
Officer and when the Police Officer upon investigation finds
that there  is no  sufficient evidence	or reasonable ground
for suspicion  to justify  the forwarding  of the accused to
the Magistrate	under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_131">Section  169</a> and the Magistrate agrees
with him, an offence under <a href="/doc/35598/" id="a_132">Section 211</a> is committed in or in
relation of  any proceeding in any court'. It is settled law
that when  a Magistrate	 applies his  mind under Chapter XVI
that is	 on complaints,	 he  must  be  held  to	 have  taken
cognizance of  the offence  mentioned in  the complaint	 but
when he	 applies his  mind not	for  such  purpose  but	 for
purpose of  ordering investigation  under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_133">Section 156</a> (3) or
issues a search warrant for the purpose of investigation, he
cannot be  said to have taken cognizance of any offence vide

169</a> of	the  Criminal  Procedure  Code	that  there  is	 not
sufficient evidence  or reasonable  ground for suspicion and
agrees with  it, he  may be  doing so  in  exercise  of	 his
judicial function  but the  question is whether he is acting
as a court.

has pointed  out the  difference between  the report  by the
police filed  under <a href="/doc/1367808/" id="a_138">Section  170</a> of  the Criminal  Procedure
Code which  is referred	 to as	a charge-sheet	and a report

different States as either 'referred charge', 'final report'
or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">728</span>
summary. This  court observed that when the police submitted
a report  that no  case has  been made	out for	 sending  up
accused for trial it is not open to the Magistrate to direct
the  police   officer  to   file  a   chargesheet.  In	such
circumstances the  Magistrate is not powerless as it is open
to him	to take	 cognizance of	an  offence  on	 the  report
submitted by  the Police  under	 <a href="/doc/731740/" id="a_140">Section  190(1)(c)</a>  of	 the
Criminal Procedure  Code. Dealing  with the  position of the
Magistrate when	 a report is submitted by the police that no
case is	 made out  for sending	a case	for trial  the court
observed that it is open to the magistrate to agree with the
report and close the proceedings. Equally it will be open to
the  Magistrate	 if  he	 takes	a  different  view  to	give
directions to  the  police  under  <a href="/doc/236880/" id="a_141">Section  163(1)</a>  to	make
further investigations.	 After receiving  a report  from the
police on  further investigation  if the Magistrate forms an
opinion on  the fact  that it  constitutes an offence he may
take cognizance	 of an	offence	 under	<a href="/doc/954690/" id="a_142">Section	 190(1)</a>	 (c)
notwithstanding the opinion of the police expressed in final
report. This court held in conclusion that there is no power
expressly or impliedly conferred on the Magistrate under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_143"> the
Code</a> to	 call upon  the police to submit a charge-sheet when
they have  sent a  report under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_144">Section 169</a> of the Code that
there is  no case  made out  for sending the case for trial.
The same  view is  expressed in the decision in <a href="/doc/490181/" id="a_145">Kamla Prasad
Singh v.  Hari Nath Singh and another</a>. <a href="/doc/1985351/" id="a_146">In R. N. Chatterji v.
Havildar Kuer  Singh, A.  N. Ray J</a>. as he then was, followed
the decision  in <a href="/doc/49832/" id="a_147">Abhinandan  Jha &amp;  Ors.  v.  Dinesh  Mishra</a>
(supra)	 and  held  that  the  provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_148">  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code</a>	do not	empower the Magistrate to direct the
police officer	to submit a charge-sheet but if he is of the
opinion that  the repot	 submitted by  the  police  requires
further	  investigation,    the	  Magistrate	may    order
investigation, under  <a href="/doc/1184284/" id="a_149">Section 163</a>  of the Criminal Procedure
Code. It was held that directing further enquiry is entirely
different from	asking police  to submit a charge-sheet. The
only source  open for  the Magistrate if he is not satisfied
with  the  police  report  under  <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_150">Section  169</a>	is  to	take
cognizance of  an offence  under <a href="/doc/954690/" id="a_151">Section  190(1)</a> (c)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_152">  of the
Criminal Procedure Code</a>. It may be noted that in <a href="/doc/340501/" id="a_153">M. L. Sethi
v. R.  P. Kapur	 &amp; Anr</a>.,  it was held that if the Magistrate
disagrees with	the opinion  of the police he may proceed to

<a href="/doc/954690/" id="a_154">Section 190(1)</a> (b).
</p><p id="p_30">     It is  clear that when a Magistrate applies his mind to
the contents  of a  complaint before  him for the purpose of
proceeding under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_155">Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">729</span></a>

decision of  this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1644123/" id="a_158">Mowu  v.	The  Superintendent,
Special	 Jail,	Nowgong,  Assam	 and  Others</a>.  The  position
regarding the  case in	which Magistrate  accepts  a  report
under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_159">Section  169</a> Criminal  Procedure Code is different. On
an analysis  of the  various sections,	it  appears  that  a
report under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_160">Section 169</a> of the Cr. P. C. and the magistrate
agreeing with  it, are	proceedings under  Chapter XIV which
relates to  information to  the police	and their  power  to
investigate. The  Chapter provides  for supervision  by	 the
Magistrates of	the investigation by the police. It has been
laid down that Magistrate has no option except to agree with
the report  of the Police Officer unless he proceeds to take
cognizance of  the offence  under <a href="/doc/954690/" id="a_161">Section 190(1)</a> (c). Though
the Magistrate	in deciding  whether to accept the report or
not may	 be exercising	his judicial mind, it cannot be said
that he	 is acting as a court. The Magistrate acting at this
stage cannot  be said  to fulfil  the positive	requirements
enumerated by  Venkatarama Ayyar,  J. in Shri Virinder Kumar
Satvawadi v.  The State	 of Punjab (supra). To be classified
as court  it must  be charged with a duty to decide disputes
in a  judicial manner and declare the rights of parties in a
definitive judgment  and to  decide in a judicial manner. It
involves that  the parties are entitled as a matter of right
to be heard in support of their claim and to adduce evidence
in proof  of it	 and  an  obligation  on  the  part  of	 the
authority to  decide the  matter on  a consideration  of the
evidence adduced  and in accordance with law. As pointed out
by Lord Sankey in Shell Co. case (supra) though there may be
some of	 the trappings	of the	court the magistrate at this
stage cannot  be termed	 as a court within the provisions of
<a href="/doc/953835/" id="a_162">Section 195(2)</a>	Cr. P.	C. The	magistrate  may	 decide	 the
question finally  which may  affect parties  but that is not
enough. Even  when a  tribunal bears  witnesses on  oath and
decides rights of parties and a right of appeal is provided,
it may not, as observed by Lord Sankey, become a court. Most
of requirements	 of a  court are lacking when the Magistrate
agrees with  the report	 of the police officer under Section
</p><p id="p_31">169. At this stage the rights of the parties are not finally
decided as  the complainant  is entitled to file a complaint
directly to  the Magistrate.  The persons  accused  are	 not
before the  Magistrate and  neither the	 complainant nor the
accused are  entitled to  be heard  or	to  adduce  evidence
before the  Magistrate at this stage. It cannot be said that
the Magistrate	has  a	duty  to  decide  the  matter  on  a
consideration of the evidence adduced before him.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">730</span>
<p id="p_32">     Taking  into   account  the   scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_163">  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code</a>,	 the function  of the Magistrate in agreeing
with a	report under  <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_164">Section 169</a>  can only be said to be in
the course  of investigation  by the  police. In Chapter XIV
which relates  to information to the police and their powers
to investigate,	 the Magistrate having jurisdiction over the
area and  empowered to	take  cognizance  is  given  certain
supervisory powers.  Thus the  Police  Officer	incharge  of
Police Station	is required  to refer  the informant  to the
Magistrate when	 information as	 to a non-cognizable offence
is received by him. The Police Officer shall not investigate
a non-cognizable  case without	the orders of the Magistrate
though the  Police Officer  is	entitled  to  investigate  a
cognizable offence  without the order of the Magistrate. The
Magistrate  under  <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_165">Section  190</a>	 is  entitled  to  order  an
investigation into  a cognizable  offence. <a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_166">Section  157</a>	 Cr.
P.C. requires  the officer incharge of the Police Station to
send a report to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance
of the	offence of  which he has received information. Under
Section 159 Crl.P.C. the Magistrate receiving a report under
<a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_167">Section 157</a> may proceed or depute any magistrate subordinate
to him	to proceed  to hold  a preliminary  inquiry into the
case. <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_168">Section  164</a> empowers  Presidency	 Magistrate  or	 any
Magistrate of  first-class or any Magistrate of second class
specially empowered  by the  State Government  to  record  a
statement or  confession made  to him  in the  course of  an
investigation under this Chapter. When a search is conducted
by a  Police Officer,  he is  required to send copies of the
record	to   the  nearest   Magistrate	empowered   to	take
cognizance. Section  167 of  the Crl.P.C. requires that when
investigation cannot  be completed  within 24 hours and when
there are  grounds  of	believing  that	 the  accusation  or
information is	well-founded, the  Officer incharge  of	 the
Police Station	shall transmit to the nearest Magistrate the
copy of	 the entries  in the  diary relating to the case and
forward the  accused to	 such Magistrate.  The Magistrate to
whom the  accused is forwarded is empowered to authorise the
detention of  the accused  in such  custody as he thinks fit
for a term not exceeding 15 days. If the period is to exceed
15 days	 he is	required  to  forward  the  accused  to	 the
Magistrate having  jurisdiction. When  an  investigation  is
completed and when the Police Officer is of the opinion that
there is  sufficient evidence,	he shall forward the accused
to the Magistrate along with his report. The final report of
the Police  Officer is to be submitted under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_169">Section 173</a>. It
may be	noticed that <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_170">Section 169</a> does not require the Police
Officer to send a report as he is required under <a href="/doc/1367808/" id="a_171">Section 170</a>
when he	 is of	the opinion  that  there  is  no  sufficient
evidence or  reasonable ground	of suspicion  to justify the
forwarding of  the  accused  to	 the  Magistrate.  The	only
precaution he  has to  take is	to take	 steps to ensure the
appearance of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">731</span>
the accused in the event of the Magistrate empowered to take
cognizance wants  his presence.	 A perusal  of	the  various
Sections under	Chapter XIV  shows that	 the  Magistrate  is
associated  with  the  investigation  by  the  Police  in  a
supervisory capacity.  It has  been laid  down that when the
Magistrate applies  his mind  for ordering  an investigation
under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_172">Section 156(3)</a> of the Cr.P.C. or for issue of a search
warrant for  the purpose of investigation, he cannot be said
to have	 taken cognizance  of the  offence.  The  Magistrate
during	this   stage  functions	  as  a	  Magistrate  during
investigation. As the trial has yet to commence it cannot be
said that he is acting as a court.
</p><p id="p_33">     Before leaving this aspect of the case I would refer to
some of	 the decisions	which were  cited before  us on this
point. Strong reliance was placed by the learned counsel for
the appellant  on a  decision in  <a href="/doc/230090/" id="a_173">J. D.	 Boywalla  v.  Sorab
Rustomji Engineer</a>.  Boywalla, the  appellant  in  the  case,
lodged a  complaint with  the police  against the respondent
Sorab Rustomji	Engineer for  cheating in  respect of  three
rupees. The  police after  investigation submitted  a report
stating that  no offence has been disclosed against him with
a request  that he  may be  discharged	and  his  bail	bond
cancelled.  On	 receipt  of   the  report   the  Magistrate
discharged the	accused and  cancelled the  bail bond. Sorab
Rustomji Engineer,  against whom  the complaint	 was  filed,
filed a	 case under  <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_174">Section 211</a> of the I.P.C. alleging that
the  appellant	 Boywalla  instituted  criminal	 proceedings
against him  knowing that  there is no just or lawful ground
for such proceedings. The appellant contended that it is the
Magistrate that	 can lodge a complaint under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_175">Section 195</a> (b)
of the	<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_176">Cr.P.C</a>. and  that no  court shall take cognizance of
the offence  punishable under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_177">Section 211</a> of the I.P.C. when
such offence  is alleged  to have  been committed  in or  in
relation to  any proceeding to a court except on a complaint
in writing  of such  court. John Beaumont Chief Justice held
that in	 doing what  he had  done the  Magistrate had  taken
cognizance of  the case	 and therefore	under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_178">Section 195(b)</a>
Cr.P.C. it  was the  Magistrate	 alone	who  could  lodge  a
complaint. Two	reasons were given by the Chief Justice. The
second ground  with which  we are  concerned at	 the  moment
deals as  to the  capacity in which Magistrate acted when he
accepted the  police report under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_179">Section 169</a> and discharged
the  accused.	The  Chief   Justice  expressed	 that  after
considering the	 report if  the Magistrate thinks that there
is no  sufficient ground  of proceeding he may discharge the
accused and though<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_180"> the Code</a> does not expressly provide there
can be	no doubt  that when  the Magistrate can act upon the
report of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">732</span>
police officer	and  discharge	an  accused  person  without
further inquiry	 only by  acting in  his  judicial  capacity
which should  be open  to review  by  the  High	 Court.	 The
learned Chief  Justice proceeded  on the basis that before a
magistrate passed  orders on  the report of the police under
<a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_181">Section 169</a>  he should	take cognizance	 of the offence. The
Chief Justice  thus took  the view  that (1)  the Magistrate
before discharging  the accused	 in pursuance  of  a  police
report under  <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_182">Section 169</a>  takes cognizance  and (2) acts in
his judicial  capacity. While  there could  be no doubt that
the magistrate	is acting  judicially, I  am unable  to hold
that before a magistrate discharges an accused agreeing with
the report  of the  police under  <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_183">Section 169</a>  Cr. P.C.,  he
takes cognizance.  This Court  has held	 that the  stage  of
laking cognizance  arises only	when he	 acts under  <a href="/doc/954690/" id="a_184">Section
190(1)</a> (b).  Further this  Court has  taken the view that if
the magistrate	does not  agree with  a police	report under
<a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_185">Section 169</a>  Cr.P.C., he  can  only  proceed  under  <a href="/doc/731740/" id="a_186">Section
190(1)(c)</a>. The	facts of  the  case  were  the	accused	 was
arrested and  later after  the order  of discharge  the bail
bond was  cancelled. The  circumstances of the arrest of the
accused his  being released on bail during investigation and
his discharge  after the  police report were the reasons for
the learned  Chief Justice coming to the conclusion that the
Magistrate was	acting in  a judicial  capacity. The learned
Judge observed	"indeed it  is a  novelty to  me to  hear it
suggested that	there is  any authority	 which can  make  an
administrative order  discharging the  arrested person	from
judicial capacity".  But as  he has  pointed out acting in a
judicial capacity  alone is not enough. The Supreme Court in
M. L.  Sethi's case  (supra) expressed	its dissent from the
view taken  in <a href="/doc/318497/" id="a_187">Ghulam  Rasul v.	 Emperor</a> where	the  learned
Judge held  that a  complaint by criminal court is necessary
when a	false report  is made  in an  investigation  by	 the
police. The  facts of  the case are that Ghulam Rasul made a
report to  the police  that a certain person stole his watch
from his  car. On  investigation  the  police  came  to	 the
conclusion that	 the report was false and that the watch had
been  removed  by  the	petitioner  himself.  The  case	 was
reported to the Magistrate for cancellation. A complaint was
given against  Ghulam Rasul  for offence  under <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_188">Sections 193</a>
and <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_189">211</a>	 I.P.C.	 and  the  Magistrate  took  cognizance	 and
recorded the  evidence	of  the	 prosecution  witnesses	 and
framed charge  against	him.  Accepting	 the  contention  on
behalf of  Ghulam Rasul	 the High Court held that in view of
<a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_190">section	  195(1)</a>   (b),<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_191">	  Criminal   Procedure	 Code</a>,	 the
Magistrate's taking  cognizance of  the offence was illegal.
The Court  observed: "I am clear that the words in this sub-
section 'in  relation to  any proceeding in any court' apply
to this case of a false report or a false
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">733</span>
statement made	in an  investigation by	 the police with the
intention that	there shall  in consequence  of this,  be  a
trial in  the Criminal	Court". The  facts of  the case show
that a report under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_192">Section 169</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_193"> Criminal Procedure Code</a> was
submitted by  the police for cancellation and the Magistrate
dropped further	 proceedings. The Supreme Court referring to
the view  of the  High Court  observed: "He  appears to have
held the  view that the Magistrate having passed an order of
cancellation, it  was necessary that the complaint should be
filed by  the  Magistrate,  because  <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_194">section  195(1)(b)</a>	 had
become inapplicable.  If the  learned Judge  intended to say
that without any proceeding being taken by the Magistrate in
the case  which was  investigated by the police it was still
essential that a complaint should be filed by the Magistrate
simply because	a subsequent proceeding following the police
investigation was contemplated we consider that his decision
cannot be accepted as correct". This decision makes it clear
that  even   though  the   Magistrate  passed  an  order  of
cancellation on	 the report  by the police under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_195">section 169</a>
if the	Magistrate has not taken any proceeding, a complaint
by the	Magistrate is  not necessary.  The decision  of	 the
Supreme Court covers the facts of the present case so far as
the discharge  of the  accused	on  a  police  report  under
<a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_196">section	 169</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_197">	Criminal  Procedure   Code</a>,  is	  concerned.
Referring to the Bombay decision, the Supreme Court observed
that "the  decision of	the  Bombay  High  Court  in  <a href="/doc/230090/" id="a_198">J.  D.
Roywalla  v.   Sorab  Rustomji	 Engineer</a>  (supra)  is	also
inapplicable because in that case also orders were passed by
a Magistrate  on the  final report  made by the police after
investigation of  the facts  in the  report, in	 respect  of
which complaint	 under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_199">section	211</a> I.P.C.  was	 filed".  In
Sethi's case  (supra) at  the stage  when the  complaint was
filed by the respondent under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_200">Section 211</a> I.P.C., the police
were enquiring into the appellant's report. When there is no
proceeding pending  before any	court at  the time  when the
applicability of  <a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_201">section 195(1)</a>  (b) is to be determined, a
complaint by  the court	 is not	 necessary. The	 decision in
Bombay case  is therefore  not applicable  to the  facts  in
Sethi's case as in the Bombay case orders were passed by the
magistrate on the final report of the police.
</p><p id="p_34">     There is  a conflict  between various High Courts as to
whether a  complaint is	 necessary when	 on a  police report
under Section  169 the	Magistrate does not take any further
action. The  Bombay,  Saurashtra  and  Andhra  Pradesh	High
Courts in 1946 Bombay 7(11), 1952 Saurashtra 67(68) and 1969
A.P. 281  (287) have held that a Magistrate passing an order
on a  final report of police under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_202">Section 173</a> referring the
case as	 false should  be deemed  to be	 a Court  passing  a
judicial order	disposing of  the information to the police,
and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">734</span>
that in	 such a	 case, the  complaint of  the Magistrate  is
necessary for the prosecution of the informant under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_203">Section
211</a> of	the I.P.C.  The Madras,	 Calcutta and Allahabad High
Courts in  A.I.R. 1934 Madras 175, A.I.R. 1948 Allahabad 184
Full Bench and A.I.R. 1916 Calcutta 593 following 1921 Patna
302 and	 1917 Calcutta 593 have held the other view. For the
reasons	 already   stated  I   hold  that  when	 no  further
proceedings are	 taken by  the Magistrate  on receipt  of  a
police report under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_204">Section 169</a> there is no proceeding in or
in relation to any court and, therefore, no complaint by the
court is necessary.
</p><p id="p_35">     The next  question which  arises in  this case  is that
whether a complaint by the court is necessary because of the
arrest and  release on	bail of	 the accused  Satya  Narayan
Pathak	in   consequence  of  the  complaint  given  by	 the
appellant.  The	  police  after	 taking	 cognizance  of	 the
complaint by  Kamlapati Trivedi, the appellant in this case,
took cognizance	 under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_205">Sections	 147</a>, <a href="/doc/1947545/" id="a_206">448</a>  and	<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_207">379</a>  I.P.C.,
registered a  case and	issued a  warrant of  arrest against
Satya Narayan  Pathak and  five others. They all surrendered
in court  on 6-5-1970 and were released on bail on a bond of
Rs. 200/-  each. They  attended court on 21-5-1970 and 21-7-
1970 when  the police  report was  expected to be filed. The
High Court  found that	there was a police investigation and
during investigation Satya Narayan Pathak surrendered before
the Magistrate who released him on bail and police submitted
a final	 report and  the Magistrate  discharged him from his
bail bond.  On this  evidence the  High Court  came  to	 the
conclusion that	 the proceedings  before the  court become a
criminal proceeding only when the court takes cognizance and
not before.  On these  facts the question arises whether the
proceedings when the accused were released on bail and later
after the  receipt of  the report  from the police they were
discharged, would  be in  or in	 relation to a court. It was
submitted that	when in pursuance of a complaint the accused
was  arrested	and  remand   and  bail	  proceedings	were
subsequently taken  before a  Magistrate in  connection with
the report to the police, they were proceedings in court and
a complaint  by the  court was	necessary. In support of the
proposition a decision in <a href="/doc/1069919/" id="a_208">Badri v. State</a> was relied upon. In
that case  the Allahabad  High Court  held that	 an  offence
under <a href="/doc/35598/" id="a_209">section  211</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_210"> Indian  Penal Code</a>, alleged to have been
committed by  the appellant by making a false report against
the complainant	 and others to the police, was an offence in
relation to  the remand proceedings and the bail proceedings
because those  proceedings were	 a direct consequence of the
making	of   the  report  and  the  subsequent	arrest	and,
therefore, the case is governed by <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_211">section 195(1)(b)</a> of Code
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">735</span>
Criminal  Procedure.  The  Supreme  Court  in  Sethi's	case
(supra) at page 538 did not consider it necessary to express
any opinion  whether remand  and bail proceedings before the
Magistrate can	be held to be proceedings in a court nor did
they consider  the question  whether the  charge of making a
false report  could be	rightly held  to be  in relation  to
these proceedings.  The position, therefore, is the question
whether remand and bail proceedings before the Magistrate in
pursuance of information given to the police of a cognizable
offence are proceedings in or in relation to a court is left
open.
</p><p id="p_36">     To determine whether the remand or bail proceedings are
proceedings in	a court	 it is	useful	to  refer  again  to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_212">
Chapter XIV  of the  Criminal Procedure Code</a>. On a complaint
by an  informant relating  to a	 commission of	a cognizable
offence the investigation starts. The information may not be
against	 any   person.	When   an  investigation  cannot  be
completed in  24 hours	after the  arrest of the accused and
when the  officer is  of the view that there are grounds for
believing that the accusation or information is well-founded
the  officer   is  required   to  transmit  to	the  nearest
Magistrate a copy of the entries in the diary and to forward
the accused  to the Magistrate. When the accused is produced
the Magistrate	is required  to act  under <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_213">Section 167(2)</a> of
the Criminal  Procedure Code.  The Magistrate  to  whom	 the
accused	 is   produced	can  from  time	 to  time  authorise
detention of  accused in  such custody	as  such  Magistrate
thinks fit  for a term not exceeding 15 days in whole. If he
has not	 the jurisdiction  to try  the case or commit it for
trial but  considers further  detention is necessary, he may
order the  accused to  be forwarded  to a  Magistrate having
jurisdiction. We  have seen  that in  investigation  by	 the
police	the   Magistrate  is  associated  in  a	 supervisory
capacity. The action taken by the Magistrate cannot be taken
to be  that of	a  court  for  the  Magistrate	who  has  no
jurisdiction to	 try the  case has a limited power. Even the
Magistrate who	has jurisdiction  to try  the  accused	when
acting under  the Section  is not  acting as a court for the
words used are the Magistrate having jurisdiction. The trial
commences only	after the  offence has been taken cognizance
of.  The   proceedings	under	<a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_214">Section	  167</a>,	 is   during
investigation. But it has to be noted that when the bail and
remand proceedings  are before the Magistrate, he has to act
judicially. If	the accused  applies for bail the Magistrate
has to act judicially and take into account the facts of the
case before  he decides	 to release  the accused  on bail or
refuse bail.  Chapter XXXIII  Cr. P.  C.  deals	 with  bail.
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_215">Section 496</a>  provides as  to when  bail may be taken of non-
bailable offences.  The provisions  of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_216">Sections	 496</a> and <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_217">497</a>
speak of  an accused  person in	 custody charged with a non-
bailable offence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">736</span>
being produced before court at any stage of the proceedings.
The Section  deals with the exercise of the power of a court
at any	stage of  proceedings when  the accused	 is  brought
before a  court while  in the custody of the police officer.
According to  the wording  of Section,	the bail proceedings
would be  before a court even though the accused is produced
while in  custody of  a police officer. Even though the word
'court' is used in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_218">Sections 496</a> and <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_219">497</a>, we have to consider
whether proceedings  can be  said to be taken before a court
as defined  in <a href="/doc/953835/" id="a_220">Section	195(2)</a> of  Cr. P. C. In deciding the
question we  have to  bear in  mind the	 restricted  meaning
given to  the word  in the  observations of  Lord Sankey  in
Shell Company's case reported in Shell Co. of Australia Ltd.
v. Federal  Commissioner of  Taxation (supra)  and the tests
laid down  by Venkatarama  Ayyar, J.  in <a href="/doc/1664246/" id="a_221">Shri Virinder Kumar
Satyawadi v.  The State	 of Punjab</a>  and Hidayatullah,  J. in
<a href="/doc/673012/" id="a_222">Smt. Ujjam  Bai v.  State of  Uttar Pradesh</a>  (supra). Though
there may  be some  trappings of  a court  and	the  section
itself	mentions   the	word   'court',	 I   feel  that	 the
requirements for  being a  court for  the purpose of <a href="/doc/953835/" id="a_223">Section
195(2)</a>	have  not  been	 satisfied.  The  intention  of	 the
legislature in	prescribing a  bar  when  an  offence  under
Chapter XI  of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_224">I.P.C</a>.  is committed,  that  is,	 when  false
evidence is  given or  offence	against	 public	 justice  is
committed  is	that  the  court  should  decide  whether  a
complaint should be given for an offence committed before it
and if	satisfied should prefer the complaint itself. Before
a court	 gives a  complaint, it	 will have to satisfy itself
that a	prima facie  case is  made out and that it is in the
interest of  justice that  a complaint should be lodged. The
purpose, therefore,  is that  a private	 party should not be
permitted to  make a  complaint regarding offences committed
in or  in relation to court proceedings. In an investigation
by the	police the complainant is only in the background. He
might not  have mentioned  the name  of any  person as being
involved in  the crime.	 Taking all  the circumstances	into
account, I  am, in the absence of the complainant, unable to
hold that  remand and  bail proceedings before cognizance of
the offence  is taken could be held to be proceedings before
a court	 bearing in mind the restricted meaning given to the
word 'court'.
</p><p id="p_37">     The second	 question is whether the charge of making of
the false  report could be rightly held to be in relation to
proceedings in	court. When  an information  is given  of  a
commission of  a cognizable  offence, the  police register a
case  and   start  investigation.   For	  facilitating	 the
investigation provision	 for remand  is provided for. If the
investigation is  not completed	 within 24  hours the police
may ask for further remand and the court may grant according
to provisions of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_225">section 167</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">737</span><a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_226">
Criminal Procedure Code</a>. At this stage though the remand and
bail proceedings  arise as a consequence of complaint given,
it cannot  be said  that it  is the direct result of a false
report to  a court  for no  one might have been mentioned in
the complaint  as a  suspect. Further,	it will be seen that
the complainant	 is not	 entitled to  appear  in  court	 and
oppose grant  of bail.	The court dealing with the remand or
bail proceedings  cannot be  said to  fulfil the  conditions
laid down  by Venkatarama  Ayyar  as  the  parties  are	 not
entitled as  a matter  of right	 to be	heard in  support of
their claim and adduce evidence in proof of it.
</p><p id="p_38">     The Magistrate  dealing with  remand proceedings  or  a
bail petition  does not hear the complainant. He acts on the
material that  is placed  before him  by the  police  during
investigation.	The   complainant  has	 no  opportunity  of
substantiating or  presenting his case before the Magistrate
at this	 stage. If  the action of the Magistrate in agreeing
with  the   report  under  <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_227">section  169</a>	 Cr.  P.C.  and	 the
proceedings taken  during investigation	 by way of remand or
bail are  understood to	 be proceedings in or in relation to
court a complaint may be preferred by the Magistrate without
giving an  opportunity to  the complainant  to	satisfy	 the
Magistrate about  the truth of his case. In this connection,
it is  useful to  refer to  <a href="/doc/1459095/" id="a_228">section 476</a> of the Cr. P. C. The
section provides  that when  any Civil,	 Revenue or Criminal
Court is,  whether on  application made to it in this behalf
or otherwise,  of  opinion  that  it  is  expedient  in	 the
interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into any
offence referred  to in <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_229">section 195</a>, sub-section (1), clause
</p><p id="p_39">(b) or	clause (c),  which appears to have been committed in
or in  relation to  a proceeding  in that  Court, such Court
may, after  such preliminary  inquiry, if  any, as it thinks
necessary, record  a finding  to  that	effect	and  make  a
complaint thereof in writing signed by the presiding officer
of the	Court, and shall forward the same to a Magistrate of
the  first   class  having  jurisdiction.  Before  making  a
complaint a  preliminary inquiry  is contemplated. Normally,
it would  mean that  the person	 against whom a complaint is
preferred has  an opportunity to show why a complaint should
not be	preferred against  him. These stages are not reached
in a  case when	 the Magistrate has still to take cognizance
of an  offence. The  restricted meaning given to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_230"> the Code</a> in
<a href="/doc/953835/" id="a_231">section 195(2)</a> Cr. P.C. read along with the conditions to be
specified before  a complaint  is preferred  by	 the  court,
inclines me to hold that the proceedings before a Magistrate
in which  he agrees  with the  report by  the  police  under
<a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_232">section 169</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_233"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>, and the proceedings in

amount to proceedings in or in relation to court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">738</span>
<p id="p_40">     In the  result I  agree with  the High Court that there
was no	proceeding in  or  in  relation	 to  a	court,	and,
therefore, <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_234">section  195(1)(b)</a> of  Criminal Procedure Code is
not attracted. The appeal is dismissed.

Having given  it my best consideration, I regret that I have
to differ with him.
</p><p id="p_42">     2. The facts giving rise to this appeal lie in a narrow
compass and  may be stated in brief. The appellant before us
is one	Kamlapati Trivedi  (hereinafter called	Trivedi)  on
whose complaint	 a case	 was registered	 under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_235">sections 147</a>,
<a href="/doc/1947545/" id="a_236">448</a> and	 <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_237">379</a> of	 the Indian  Penal Code	 at the Bally Police
Station	 on   the  18th	 April,	 1970  against	six  persons
including   one	   Satyanarayan	  Pathak    (called   Pathak
hereinafter). Warrants	were issued  for the  arrest of	 the
accused, all  of whom surrendered on the 6th of May, 1970 in
the Court  of the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Howrah
(referred  to	later  herein  as  SDJM)  who  who  was	 the
magistrate having  jurisdiction	 and  who  passed  an  order
releasing them on bail.
</p><p id="p_43">     The police	 held  an  investigation  culminating  in  a
report dated  the 25th	of July, 1970 which was submitted to
the  SDJM   under  <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_238">section  173</a>	 of  the  Code	of  Criminal
Procedure, 1898	 (the Code,  for short). The contents of the
report made  out the  complaint to  be false  and included a
prayer that  the accused  "may be released from the charge".
On the	31st of	 July, 1970  the  SDJM,	 agreeing  with	 the
report, passed an order discharging the accused.
</p><p id="p_44">     On the  20th of  October, 1970 Pathak filed a complaint
before the  SDJM  accusing  Trivedi  of	 the  commission  of
offences under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_239">sections 211</a> and <a href="/doc/534484/" id="a_240">182</a> of the Indian Penal Code
by reason  of the  latter having  lodged with the police the
false complaint	 dated the  18th  of  April,  1970.  Trivedi
appeared in  the Court	of the SDJM on the 16th of November,
1970 in	 response to  a summons issued by the latter only in
respect of  an offence under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_241">section 211</a> of the Indian Penal
Code and  was allowed  a fortnight to furnish security while
the case itself was adjourned to the 10th of December, 1970.
</p><p id="p_45">     It was then that Trivedi presented a petition dated the
23rd December,	1970 to	 the High  Court at Calcutta praying
that the  proceedings pending against him before the SDJM be
quashed inasmuch  as the  latter was  debarred	from  taking
cognizance of  the offence  under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_242">section  211</a> of the Indian
Penal Code  in the  absence of a complaint in writing of the
SDJM himself in view of the provisions of clause (b) of sub-
section (1) of <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_243">section 195</a> of the Code. Sub-sections (1) and
(2) of	that  section  may  be	reproduced  here  for  ready

     Registrar under the Indian Registration Act, 1977."</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">     It was  argued before  the High  Court that part of the
proceedings which  started with the registration of the case
by the	police on the 18th of April, 1970 at the instance of
Trivedi and  culminated in the order dated the 31st of July,
1970 discharging  Pathak and his five co-accused constituted
proceedings before  a Court,  that the offence under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_264">section
211</a> of	the Indian  Penal Code	attributed  to	Trivedi	 was
committed in  or, in  any case, in relation to such part and
therefore the  case against Trivedi fell within the ambit of
clause (b) above extracted. The argument did not find favour
with the High Court and the learned Single Judge before whom
it was made rejected it with the following observations:
</p><p id="p_47">     "The  police  submitted  a	 final	report	and  so	 the
Magistrate discharged  him from	 his bail bond but there was
no   criminal	 proceeding   before   the   Court   against
Satyanarayan. The  proceeding before  the  Court  becomes  a
criminal proceeding  only when	a Court takes cognizance and
not before. Whatever the view of the other High Courts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">740</span>
may be,	 the consistent	 view of  this High Court is that so
long as cognizance is not taken it cannot be said that there
was a  proceeding pending  in the  Court in  respect of that
offence and since no proceeding was pending before the Court
<a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_265">section 195</a> (1)(b)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_266"> of the Code</a> is not attracted."
</p><p id="p_48">     It is  against the	 order of  the High  Court (which is
dated the  18th of August, 1971) that Trivedi has instituted
this appeal by special leave.
</p><p id="p_49">     3. Before	us the	argument which	was put	 forward  on
behalf of  Trivedi for	the consideration  of the High Court
has been  repeated and	it has been urged strenuously by his
learned counsel	 that in  so far as the SDJM passed an order
on the	6th of	May, 1970  releasing him  on bail  and	then
another on  the 31st of July, 1970 discharging him, the SDJM
acted judicially  and therefore	 as a  Court, that it cannot
but be	held that these orders were passed in proceedings in
relation to  which the	offence under  <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_267">section	211</a>  of	 the
Indian Penal  Code was	alleged to  have been  committed and
that consequently  the SDJM  had  no  jurisdiction  to	take
cognizance of that offence.
</p><p id="p_50">     4. The points requiring determination therefore are:
</p><p id="p_51">	  (a) Whether  the SDJM	 acted as  a Court  when  he
     passed the	 orders dated  the 6th	of May, 1970 and the
     31st of July, 1970 or any of them?
</p><p id="p_52">	  (b) If  the answer  to  question  (a)	 is  in	 the
     affirmative, whether  the offence	under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_268">section 211</a> of
     the Indian	 Penal Code  attributed to  Trivedi could be
     regarded as  having been  committed in  relation to the
     proceedings culminating  in either	 or both of the said
     orders?
</p><p id="p_53">     5. In  finding an answer to question (a) I attach quite
some importance	 to the provision of <a href="/doc/909219/" id="a_269">sections 6</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_270">496</a> and <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_271">497</a>

<p id="p_54">     Magistrates are  specifically labelled as Courts by the
statutory provisions  of <a href="/doc/909219/" id="a_274">section  6</a> and therefore have to be
regarded as  such. It is no doubt true that<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_275"> the Code</a> assigns
to a  Magistrate various  functions which do not fall within
the sphere  of judicial	 duties and  are, on the other hand,
functions of  an executive  nature such	 as the	 exercise of
supervisory  jurisdiction   in	relation   to  investigation
carried out by the police or work done on the administrative
side; and  it may  plausibly be argued that in the discharge
of such	 functions a Magistrate does not act as a Court. But
then in	 my opinion a Magistrate cannot but be regarded as a
Court  when  he	 acts  judicially.  This  follows  from	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/909219/" id="a_276">section 6</a>  itself. The  Code does not contain
any provision to the effect that no functions performed by a
Magistrate  in	relation  to  criminal	proceedings  whether
handled by him or dealt with by the police would be regarded
as functions  performed by a Court unless they are posterior
in point of time to the stage when he acts under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_277">section 190</a>
of the	Code. On  the contrary,	 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_278">sections 496</a>  and <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_279">497</a> which
embrace bail  matters  specifically  describe  a  Magistrate
while dealing  therewith  as  a	 Court	and  these  sections
operate fully  at all  stages of  a case including that when
the investigation  has just started. There is nothing in the
context in  which the  word `Court'  is used  in  these	 two
sections and  <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_280">section 195</a>  which would provide an indication
that it	 has been  used in two different senses therein, and
in such	 a situation  the legislature must be deemed to have
used it	 in one and the same sense wherever it occurs in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_281"> the
Code</a>. While  deciding the  question of	bail,  therefore,  a
Magistrate must be held to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">743</span>
acting	as   a	Court	and  not   in  any  other  capacity,
irrespective of	 the stage  which the  case has	 reached  by
then, that  is, whether	 it is	still under investigation by
the police  or has  progressed to the stage of an inquiry or
trial by  the Magistrate. It at once follows that the taking
of cognizance  of any  offence by a Magistrate under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_282">section
190</a> of	the Code  is not a condition precedent for him to be
regarded as a Court.
</p><p id="p_55">     6. Nor  do	 I  feel  that	the  opinions  expressed  by
Halsbury and  Lord Sankey  lay down any different principle.
Those opinions appear to me to cover only cases of tribunals
which  perform	 quasi-judicial	 functions   but   are	 not
statutorily recognised	as `Court'.  At page 342 of Volume 9
of Halsbury's  Laws of	England (third	edition) appears the
following passage in Para 809 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  "Originally the  term "court"	 meant, among  other
     meanings, the  Sovereign's palace;	 it has acquired the
     meaning of the place where justice is administered and,
     further, has  come to  mean the  persons  who  exercise
     judicial  functions   under  authority  derived  either
     immediately  or   mediately  from	the  Sovereign.	 All
     tribunals, however,  are not  courts, in  the sense  in
     which the term is here employed, namely, to denote such
     tribunals as  exercise  jurisdiction  over	 persons  by
     reason of	the sanction  of the  law, and not merely by
     reason of	voluntary submission  to their jurisdiction.
     Thus, arbitrators,	 committees of	clubs, and the like,
     although they  may	 be  tribunals	exercising  judicial
     functions, are not "courts" in this sense of that term.
     On the  other hand,  a tribunal  may be  a court in the
     strict sense of the term although the chief part of its
     duties is	not judicial.  Parliament is  a	 court,	 its
     duties are	 mainly deliberative  and legislative  : the
     judicial duties  are only	part  of  its  functions.  A
     coroner's court  is a true court although its essential
     function is investigation."</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">     In para 810 the learned author proceeds to lay down the
criteria which	determine when	a tribunal would be regarded
as a  Court. In	 his opinion,  the elements to be considered
are :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  (1) the  requirement for a public hearing, subject
     to a power to exclude the public in a proper case, and
	  (2) a	 provision that	 a member  of  the  tribunal
     shall not	take part  in any  decision in	which he  is
     personally interested,  or unless	he has	been present
     throughout the proceedings.</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">744</span>
<p id="p_57">     The  learned   author   then   quotes   Lord   Sankey's
observations in	 Shell Co.  of	Australia  Ltd.	 v.  Federal
Commissioner of Taxation and then gives numerous examples of
tribunals which	 are not  regarded  as	Courts.	 One  common
feature of  such tribunals is that they are not described as
Courts by  statute and	are charged  with the performance of
administrative or  executive functions as distinguished from
judicial functions.
</p><p id="p_58">     Paragraph 812 on page 344 of the same Volume deals with
the subject of creation of Courts and lays down :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "Courts  are	created	 by  the  authority  of	 the
     Sovereign as the fountain of justice. This authority is
     exercised either  by statute,  charter, letters patent,
     or Order  in Council. In some cases, a court is held by
     prescription, as  having existed  from time immemorial,
     with the  implication that	 there was  at some  time  a
     grant of  the Court  by the  Sovereign, which  has been
     lost.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  "An Act  of Parliament  is necessary	to create  a
     court which  does not  proceed according  to the common
     law."</blockquote>
<p id="p_59">     Reference may usefully be made to <a href="/doc/909219/" id="a_283">Section 6</a> of the same
Chapter in which the above paragraphs occur. That Section is
headed "Magistrates' Courts". The relevant part of paragraph
1041 with  which the  Section begins  is  to  the  following
effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	  "A magistrate's  court consists  of a	 justice  or
     justices of  the peace acting under any enactment or by
     virtue of	his or	their commission or under common law
     (otherwise than  as a  court or  committee	 of  quarter
     sessions or  a purely administrative tribunal), or of a
     stipendiary magistrate."</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">     The combined  effect of  the various paragraphs forming
part of the treatise and noticed above would be that a Court
may be	created by  a statute  and that	 when such  a  Court
performs judicial  functions, it  will be deemed to act as a
Court and  further, that Magistrates' Courts are regarded as
such   unless	performing   executive	 or   administrative
functions. That	 is how	 the position  stands in England and
there is  nothing in  the case of Shell Company of Australia
Ltd. v.	 Federal Commissioner of Taxation (supra) which runs
to the	contrary. It  may be  noted that  in that  case	 the
question for  decision was as to whether the Board of Review
which had  been constituted  under the Australian Income Tax
Assessment Act	to review  the decisions of the Commissioner
of Taxation  was or  was not  a Court  and it  was  in	that
context that Lord Sankey expressed his opinion. Obviously he
was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">745</span>
not dealing  with the functions of a tribunal which had been
statutorily labelled as a Court.
</p><p id="p_61">     7. What I have said of Lord Sankey's opinion is true of
the decisions  of this	Court in <a href="/doc/1664246/" id="a_284">Virinder Kumar Satyawadi v.
The State  of Punjab</a>  and <a href="/doc/673012/" id="a_285">Smt.	Ujjam Bai  v. State of Uttar
Pradesh</a>. In  the former	 the question for decision was as to
whether a  returning officer discharging functions under the
<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_286">Representation of  the People  Act</a>, 1951  was a Court and in
answering the  same the	 Court referred to the case of Shell
Company	 of   Australia	 (supra)   and	other	English	 and
Australian authorities and then observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	  "It is  unnecessary to  traverse the	same  ground
     once again. It may be stated broadly that distinguishes
     a court  from a  quasi-judicial tribunal  is that it is
     charged with  a duty  to decide  disputes in a judicial
     manner  and   declare  the	  rights  of  parties  in  a
     definitive judgment.  To decide  in a  judicial  manner
     involves that  the parties	 are entitled as a matter of
     right to  be heard	 in support  of their  claim and  to
     adduce evidence  in proof of it. And it also imports an
     obligation on  the part  of the authority to decide the
     matter on	a consideration	 of the evidence adduced and
     in accordance  with  law.	When  a	 question  therefore
     arises as	to whether an authority created by an Act is
     a	Court	as  distinguished   from  a   quasi-judicial
     tribunal, what  has to  be decided	 is  whether  having
     regard to	the provisions	of the	Act it possesses all
     the attributes of a Court."</blockquote>
<p id="p_62">     In Ujjam  Bai's case (supra) this Court was resolving a
question  as   to  whether  an	officer	 of  the  income-tax
department was	a Court and replied in the negative, broadly
for the	 reason that even though taxing authorities follow a
pattern of action which is considered judicial, they are not
converted into	Courts of  civil judicature  and that  their
actions are executive in nature.
</p><p id="p_63">     Neither of these cases deals with an authority on which
the status  of a Court is conferred by statute, nor with one
forming part of the judiciary, such as a Magistrate in whose
case the  opinion of  this  Court  would  surely  have	been
different as  is apparent from the judgment of Hidayatullah,
J., in	Ujjam Bai's  case (supra) which quotes the following
passage from <a href="/doc/948743/" id="a_287">Gullapalli Nageswara v. State of Andhra Pradesh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">746</span>
	  "The</a> concept	of a quasi-judicial act implies that
     the act  is not  wholly judicial,	it describes  only a
     duty cast on the executive body or authority to conform
     to norms  of judicial procedure in performing some acts
     in exercise of its executive power."
</p><p id="p_64">and then proceeds :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	  "The taxing  departments are	instrumentalities of
     the State.	 They are not a part of the Legislature; nor
     are they  a part  of the judiciary. Their functions are
     the assessment  and collection  of taxes,	and  in	 the
     process of	 assessing  taxes  they	 have  to  follow  a
     pattern of	 action, which	is considered judicial. They
     are  not	thereby	 converted   into  Courts  of  civil
     judicature. They  still remain the instrumentalities of
     the State	and are	 within the definition of `State' in
     <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_288">Art. 12.</a> In this view of the matter, their actions must
     be regarded,  in the ultimate analysis, as executive in
     nature, since their determinations result in the demand
     of tax  which neither the legislature nor the judiciary
     can collect.  Thus, the actions of these quasi-judicial
     bodies may be open to challenge on the ground of breach
     of fundamental rights."</blockquote>
<p id="p_65">     It is  thus clear that the source of power exercised by
the authority,	that is, whether it is an executive power or
judicial  power	  would	 make  all  the	 difference  in	 the
determination of  the question	as to  whether the authority
acts as	 a Court  or merely as a quasi-judicial tribunal not
functioning as	a Court.  In this connection a reference may
also be	 made to <a href="/doc/1807029/" id="a_289">section 19</a> of the Indian Penal Code coupled
with  illustration  (b)	 appended  thereto  and	 <a href="/doc/1904694/" id="a_290">section  20</a>

<p id="p_69">     Although we  are not  here	 concerned  with  the  terms
"Judge" and  "Court  of	 Justice"  properly  so-called,	 the
provisions above  extracted do give a definite indication of
the attributes of a Court as used in criminal law generally.
It may	be noted that<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_293"> the Code</a> and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_294"> the Indian Penal Code</a> are
the main  statutes operating  in India	in relation  to	 the
dispensation of	 criminal justice  and may  in	a  sense  be
regarded as  supplementary to  each other,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_295">  the Code</a> forming
the procedural	link of	 the same  chain of which<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_296"> the Indian
Penal Code</a>  constitutes the  link of  substantive law.	This
relation between  the two enactments is further strengthened
by the	provisions contained in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/33535/" id="a_297">section 4</a>
(the definition clause)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_298"> of the Code</a> which runs thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">	  "4 (2)  : Words  which refer	to acts done, extend

     in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_299"> the  Indian Penal Code</a>, and not hereinabove defined,
     shall be  deemed  to  have	 the  meanings	respectively
     attributed to them by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_300"> the Code</a>."</blockquote>
<p id="p_70">     It is  no doubt  true that	 the  expression  "Court  of
Justice" does  not appear  to have  been used  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_301">  the	Code</a>
(although the  expression  "Judge"  does  find	a  place  in
<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_302">section 197</a>  thereof), but  then there is no escape from the
conclusion that	 when a "Judge" (including a Magistrate) who
is empowered  to act  judicially and does so act constitutes
not merely a Court but a Court of Justice.
</p><p id="p_71">     8. Now  I proceed	to examine  the relevant  provisions
contained in  Chapter XIV  of the  Code	 which	carries	 the
caption "INFORMATION  TO THE  POLICE  AND  THEIR  POWERS  TO
INVESTIGATE". It  may be  stated at  once that	although the
Chapter is  headed as  stated, it is not confined to matters
which are  strictly concerned  with the	 investigation stage
but  also  deals  with	situations  which  arise  after	 the
investigation has  been finalized.  Reference may be made in
this behalf  to subsection  (2) of  <a href="/doc/1330928/" id="a_303">section 172</a>	 of the Code
reads thus :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">748</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">	  "Any Criminal	 Court	may  send  for	the  police-
     diaries of a case under inquiry or trial in such Court,
     and may  use such diaries, not as evidence in the case,
     but to  aid it  in such  inquiry or  trial. Neither the
     accused nor  his agents  shall be	entitled to call for
     such diaries,  nor shall  he or they be entitled to see
     them merely  because they are referred to by the Court,
     but, if  they are	used by	 the police-officer who made
     them, to  refresh his memory, or if the Court uses them
     for the  purpose of  contradicting such police-officer,
     the  provisions  of  the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_304">Indian  Evidence	 Act</a>,  1872,
     <a href="/doc/79961425/" id="a_305">section 161</a>  or <a href="/doc/169966181/" id="a_306">section  145</a>, as the case may be, shall
     apply."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">     The sub-section  clearly deals  with the use of police-
</blockquote><p id="p_72">diaries at  an inquiry or trial which a Magistrate holds not
in his	administrative or executive capacity but undoubtedly
as a  Court. The  caption of  the Chapter  therefore is	 not
decisive  of   the  question  as  to  whether  a  particular
provision contained  therein is	 limited to  the supervisory
jurisdiction  of   the	Magistrate   in	 relation   to	 the
investigation being  conducted by  the police  or deals with
his judicial functions as a Court.

when it	 finds at  the conclusion  of the  investigation (1)
that there  is not  sufficient evidence or reasonable ground

courses open  to the Magistrate in such a situation? He may,

Mishra</a>.
</p><p id="p_76">	  (1)  agree with  the report of the police and file

	  (2)  not agree  with the  police  report  and	 (a)

	       the evidence  is sufficient  to	justify	 the
	       forwarding of  the accused  to the Magistrate
	       and take cognizance of the offence complained
	       of.
</p><p id="p_77">     The appropriate  course has  to be decided upon after a
consideration of  the report and the application of the mind
of the	Magistrate to  the contents  thereof. But  then	 the
problem to  be solved  is whether  the order  passed by	 the
Magistrate pertains  to his  executive or judicial capacity.
In my  opinion, the  only order	 which can  be	regarded  as
having been  passed by the Magistrate in his capacity as the
supervisory  authority	in  relation  to  the  investigation
carried out by the police is the one covered by the course 2
</p><p id="p_78">(a). The order passed by the Magistrate in each of the other
two courses,  that is, (1) and 2(b), follows a conclusion of
the investigation  and is  a judicial  order determining the
rights of  the parties	(the State  on the  one hand and the
accused on the other) after the application of his mind. And
if that	 be so,	 the order  passed by  the Magistrate in the
proceeding before us must be characterised as a judicial act
and therefore as one performed in his capacity as a Court.
</p><p id="p_79">     9. The  reasons which have weighed with me in coming to
the conclusion	arrived at in the last paragraph are equally
applicable to  the consideration  of the question whether an
order  of   bail  passed  by  a	 Magistrate  calls  for	 the
performance by	him of his judicial functions. Such an order
also decides  the rights of the State and the accused and is
made by the Magistrate after the application of his mind and
therefore in  the discharge  of his  judicial duties,  which
factor constitutes it an act of a Court.
</p><p id="p_80">     10. For  a tribunal  to be acting as a Court, it is not
necessary that	the parties  must have a right of hearing or
adducing evidence  at every  stage of the proceedings before
it. This  is specially true of Courts constituted as such by
the legislature. Reference may here be made to interlocutory
orders issuing temporary injunctions or staying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">752</span>
proceedings in	a subordinate  Court or	 dispossession of  a
party by  Civil Courts	at the	instance of  a plaintiff  or
appellant and  in the  absence of  the opposite	 party which
comes into  the picture	 later on  after it is served with a
notice. And  even subsequent  to the appearance of the party
adversely affected,  the existence  of a  prima	 facie	case
would till  the scales	against it so that the order earlier
passed in  favour of  the other	 party is confirmed till the
conclusion of  the case	 on merits, even though the case may
finally be  decided otherwise  and the	interlocutory  order
found to  be unjust  and then vacated. And yet it can hardly
be argued  that the  presiding officer of the Court does not
act as a Court when passing such an order. Really, the right
to adduce  evidence  and  be  heard  is	 to  be	 taken	into
consideration  as  being  available  at	 one  stage  of	 the
proceedings or	the other.  Thus in  the case  of  an  order
passed by  a Magistrate under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_321">section 173</a>
of the	Code in	 agreement with	 the police  report does not
call for  any hearing  or the  production of any evidence on
the part  of the  accused, as  it goes in his favour. If the
Magistrate, on	the other  hand, disagrees  with the  report
submitted by the police and takes cognizance of the offence,
the accused comes into the picture and thereafter shall have
the right  to be  heard and to adduce evidence in support of
his innocence.	Viewed in this context, all orders passed by
a Magistrate  acting judicially	 (such as orders of bail and
those passed under subsection (3) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_322">section 173</a> of the Code
discharging an	accused or  orders taking  cognizance of the
offence complained  of) are parts of an integral whole which
may end	 with a	 definitive judgment  after an	inquiry or a
trial,	or  earlier  according	to  the	 exigencies  of	 the
situation  obtaining   at  a  particular  stage,  and  which
involves, if  need be,	the adducing  of  evidence  and	 the
decision of  the Magistrate on an appreciation thereof. They
cannot	be   viewed  in	 isolation  and	 given	a  character
different from the entire judicial process of which they are
intended to form a part.
</p><p id="p_81">     11. In  the view  that I have taken of the matter, I do
not consider  it necessary  to go  into the  details of	 the
conflict of  opinion amongst  the High	Courts in  India  in
relation there to but I would touch briefly thereupon. <a href="/doc/230090/" id="a_323">In J.
D. Boywalla  v. Sorab  Rustomji	 Engineer  Beaumont,  C.  J</a>.
speaking for himself and Macklin, J., emphatically held that
a Magistrate  while passing  a order  releasing	 an  accused
person on  bail or  discharging him in pursuance of a report
submitted by  the police to the effect that the evidence was
insufficient to	 sustain the  charge,  acts  judicially	 and
therefore as a Court within the meaning of that term as used
in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_324">section 195</a> of the Code.
That decision was followed by a Division Bench consis-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">753</span>
<p id="p_82">ting of	 Shah, C. J., and Baxi, J., in State v. Vipra Khimji
Gangaram in so far as an order discharging an accused person
as aforesaid  is concerned. Beaumont, C. J.'s view in regard
to orders  of bail  was accepted  as correct by M. C. Desai,
C.J., and Mishra, J., in <a href="/doc/1069919/" id="a_325">Badri v. State</a>.
</p><p id="p_83">     These three  decisions, in	 my opinion,  lay  down	 the

stated above.
</p><p id="p_84">     12. In  so far  as this  Court is	concerned, the point
debated before	us has	not been  the subject  matter of any
decision and was expressly left open in <a href="/doc/340501/" id="a_328">M. L. Sethi v. R. P.
Kapur &amp;	 Anr. In</a> that case the appellant had lodged a report
with  the  police  charging  the  respondents  with  certain
cognizable offences.  While the	 police	 were  investigating
into the  report, the  respondent filed	 a complaint  in the
Magistrate's Court alleging that the appellant had committed
an offence  under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_329">section  211</a> of  the Indian  Penal Code by
falsely charging  the respondent  with having  committed  an
offence. The  Magistrate took cognizance of the respondent's
complaint under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_330">section 190</a> of the Code. At that stage there
were no	 proceedings in	 any Court  nor	 any  order  by	 any
Magistrate for	arrest, remand	or bail of the respondent in
connection with the appellant's report to the police. Later,
however, the  police arrested  the respondent  in connection
with the appellant's report and filed a charge sheet against
him,  but   the	 case	ended  in  an  order  of  discharge.
Thereafter, the	 appellant raised  an objection in the Court
of the	Magistrate to  the effect  that	 cognizance  of	 the
offence under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_331">section 211</a> of the Indian Penal Code could not
be taken  in view  of the  provisions of  clause (b) of sub-
section (1)  of <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_332">section	 195</a> of	 the  Code.  The  Magistrate
rejected the  contention and  the order was confirmed by the
Sessions Court	and the	 High Court.  While  dismissing	 the
appeal, this  Court held  that the  complaint filed  by	 the
respondent was	competent and  that clause (b) aforesaid did
not stand in the way of the Magistrate taking cognizance, in
as much	 as, there  had been  no  proceedings  of  any	kind
whatsoever before  the Magistrate  in relation to the report
lodged by  the appellant  with the police till the complaint
was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">754</span>
filed by  the respondent.  Reliance was	 placed on behalf of
the appellant in that case on <a href="/doc/1069919/" id="a_333">Badri vs. State</a> (supra) and <a href="/doc/230090/" id="a_334">J.
D. Boywalla  v. Sorab  Rustomji	 Engineer</a>  (supra)  but	 the
points decided	in those cases were held not to arise in the
case  then   before  the  Court	 which	made  the  following
observations in relation thereto :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">	  "In the  case of <a href="/doc/1069919/" id="a_335">Badri vs. State</a>, where an offence
     under <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_336">section  211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_337">I.P.C</a>.,  was alleged  to have	been
     committed by  the person  making a false report against
     the complainant  and others  to the police, it was held
     that it  was an  offence  in  relation  to	 the  remand
     proceedings  and	the  bail   proceedings	 which	were
     subsequently taken	 before a  Magistrate in  connection
     with that	report to  the police,	and, therefore,	 the
     case was  governed by  <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_338">section 195</a>	 (1) (b), Cr. P. C.,
     and no  cognizance of the offence could be taken except
     on a  complaint by	 the Magistrate	 who held the remand
     and bail  proceedings. We	do not consider it necessary
     to express	 any opinion  whether the  remand  and	bail
     proceedings before	 Magistrate  could  be	held  to  be
     proceedings in  a	Court,	nor  need  we  consider	 the
     question whether  the charge  of making  of  the  false
     report could be rightly held to be in relation to those
     proceedings. That	aspect need  not detain us, because,
     in the  case before  us, the  facts are  different. The
     complaint for the offence under <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_339">section 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_340">I.P.C</a>. was
     taken cognizance  of  by  the  Judicial  Magistrate  at
     Chandigarh	 at   a	 stage	 when  there   had  been  no
     proceedings  for	arrest,	 remand	  or  bail   of	 the
     respondent and the case was still entirely in the hands
     of the  police. There  was, in  fact, no  order by	 any
     Magistrate in the proceedings being taken by the police
     on the  report lodged  by the appellant up to the stage
     when the question of applying the provisions of <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_341">section
     195</a> (1)(b),  Cr. P.C.  arose. These two cases are also,
     therefore, of  no assistance  to the  appellant. On the
     same ground,  the decision of the Bombay High Court, in
     <a href="/doc/230090/" id="a_342">J. D.  Boywalla vs.  Sorab Rustomhi  Engineer</a>  is	also
     inapplicable, because  in that  case also	orders	were
     passed by	a Magistrate on the final report made by the
     police after  investigation of  the facts in the report
     in respect	 of which  the complaint  under <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_343">section 211</a>,
     <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_344">I.P.C</a>. was sought to be filed."

</blockquote><p id="p_85"><a href="/doc/340501/" id="a_345">Sethi v.  R. P.	 Kapur</a> (supra) this Court disagreed with the
view expressed in <a href="/doc/318497/" id="a_346">Ghulam
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">755</span>
Rasul v.  Emperor</a> wherein  Blacker, J.,	 made the  following
observation :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">	  "I am clear that the words in this sub-section "in
     relation to  any proceedings in any Court" apply to the
     case of  a false  report or  a false  statement made an
     investigation by  the police  with the  intention	that
     there shall  in consequence  of this  be a trial in the
     criminal Court, and I find support for this view in the
     case reported as 1929 Sind 132 (1)".</blockquote>
<p id="p_86">     This view	of Blacker,  J., was  repelled by this Court
thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	  "The decision	 in the	 words in  which the learned
     Judge expressed himself appears to support the argument
     of learned	 counsel for  the appellant  in the  present
     case but  we think	 that very  likely in that case, the
     learned Judge  was influenced by the circumstances that
     the case  had  been  reported  by	the  police  to	 the
     Magistrate for  cancellation. He  appears to  have held
     the view  that the Magistrate having passed an order of
     cancellation,  it	was  necessary	that  the  complaint
     should be	filed by the Magistrate, because <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_347">section 195</a>
     (1) (b)  had become  applicable. If  the learned  Judge
     intended to say that without any proceeding being taken
     by the Magistrate in the case which was investigated by
     the police,  it was  still essential  that a  complaint
     should be	filed by  the Magistrate  simply  because  a
     subsequent	   proceeding	  following    the    police
     investigation was	contemplated, we  consider that	 his
     decision cannot be accepted as correct."</blockquote>
<p id="p_87">     These observations	 cannot be  held to  mean that if an
order of  cancellation of a case has actually been passed by
a Magistrate  in agreement  with the report of the police to
the effect that no sufficient evidence was available against
the accused,  such order could not be regarded as a judicial
proceeding and	the Magistrate passing it could not be given
the status  of a  Court. This  is  apparent  from  the	last
sentence of the passage just above extracted which indicates
that all  that was  meant was  that if Blacker, J., meant to
say that  even though no proceeding at all had been taken by
the Magistrate, clause (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_348">section 195</a>
of the	Code would  be attracted  merely for the reason that
the police  had held an investigation which would at a later
point  of   time  result   in  any  proceedings	 before	 the
Magistrate this Court could not agree with him. Another fact
which may  be noted  in this  connection is that judgment in
<a href="/doc/318497/" id="a_349">Ghulam	Rasul	vs.  Emperor</a>   (supra)	does  not  state  in
unmistakable terms that any order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">756</span>
of cancellation	 of the	 case was  passed by  the  concerned
Magistrate and	all that is mentioned is that the police had
reported the  case for	"cancellation", which  may well mean
that really  no order  of cancellation had in fact been made
by the Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_88">     14. As  the order releasing Trivedi on bail and the one
ultimately discharging	him of	the  offence  complained  of
amount to proceedings before a Court, all that remains to be
seen is	 whether the offence under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_350">section 211</a> of the Indian
Penal Code  which is  the subject  matter of  the  complaint
against Trivedi	 can be	 said to  have	been  committed	 "in
relation to"  those proceedings.  Both the  orders  resulted
directly from  the information	lodged by  Trivedi with	 the
police against	Pathak and  in this  situation there  is  no
getting out  of the conclusion that the said offence must be
regarded as  one committed in relation to those proceedings.
This  requirement  of  clause  (b)  aforementioned  is	also
therefore fully satisfied.
</p><p id="p_89">     15. For  the reasons  stated, I hold that the complaint
against Trivedi	 is in respect of an offence alleged to have
been committed in relation to a proceeding in Court and that
in taking  cognizance of  it the SDJM acted in contravention
of the bar contained in the said clause (b), as there was no
complaint in  writing either  of the  SDJM or  of a superior
Court. In  the result,	therefore, I  accept the appeal and,
setting aside  the  order  of  the  High  Court,  quash	 the
proceedings taken by the SDJM against Trivedi.
</p><p id="p_90">			   ORDER
     In accordance  with the  opinion of  the majority,	 the
appeal is  allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside
and the	 proceedings taken  by the  Sub-Divisional  Judicial
Magistrate against  the appellant,  Kamlapati  Trivedi,	 are
quashed.
