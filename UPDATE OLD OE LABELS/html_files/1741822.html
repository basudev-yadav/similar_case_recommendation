<p id="p_2">The Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter 
referred to as 'the SEBI') is the appellant in the present appeal

and order dated 21.08.2003 passed by the Securities Appellate 
Tribunal, Mumbai (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal') in 
appeal No. 50 of 2002 and 51 of 2002 raising an important 
question of law as to whether once it is conclusively established 
that the Mutual Fund has violated the terms of the Certificate of 
Registration and the statutory Regulations i.e. SEBI (Mutual 
Funds) Regulations, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 
Regulations") the imposition of penalty becomes a sine qua non of 
the violation.  
</p><p id="p_3">The respondents have not chosen to enter appearance 
though they were served with the notice.  Since the service is 
complete and the appeals are ready for hearing, the above 
appeals were listed for final hearing.

had floated 5 schemes.  It conducted business through brokers 
associated with its sponsor in excess of the permissible limits 
prescribed under Regulation 25(7)(a) of the Regulations, 1996 on 
12 occasions.  The respondent failed to comply with the terms 
and conditions attached to the Certificate of Registration which 
are statutory in nature, as prescribed by Regulation 15 (D)(b) of 
the Securities and <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_4">Exchange Board of India Act</a>, 1992.

The Chairman, SEBI in exercise of the powers conferred on 
it under <a href="/doc/1910177/" id="a_5">Section 15(I)</a> of the said Act and Rule 3 of the SEBI 
(Procedure for Holding Enquiry and Imposing Penalty by 
Adjudicating Officer) appointed an Adjudicating Officer to enquire 
into the violations of exceeding by the respondents of the 
permissible limit of 5% of aggregate purchases and sales of 
securities made by the Mutual Fund in all its Schemes, as 
prohibited under Regulations 25(7)(a) of the said Regulations. 
The Appellant-Board issued notice dated 01.04.2002 under 
Rule 4 of Rules, 1995 calling upon the respondents to show 
cause as to why an inquiry should not be held and penalty 
imposed under the Rules, 1995.  The respondents filed a 
common reply before the Enquiry and Adjudicating Officer, SEBI. 
The Adjudicating Officer, after hearing the parties, imposed 
penalty of Rs. 5 lacs under <a href="/doc/536016/" id="a_6">Section 15E</a> on respondent No.2 for 
failure to comply with Regulations 25 (7)(a) of SEBI (Mutual 
Funds) Regulations, 1996 with regard to routing of transactions 
through associate brokers.  
</p><p id="p_19">The Adjudicating Officer also imposed a penalty of Rs. 2 
lacs under Section 15D(b) of SEBI Act, 1992 on respondent No.1 
for its failure to comply with the terms and conditions of 
Certificate of Registration granted to it.  
Aggrieved by the order dated 24.06.2002 passed by the 
Adjudicating Officer, the respondents filed appeals before the 
Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai on 21.08.2003, inter alia, 
contending that the transactions with the associate brokers were 
related to thinly traded Securities, for which there were no ready 
markets available through the normal Stock Exchange, or were 
relating to securities which did not have any large volume or 
trade in the market.  It was further contended that these 
securities were either thinly traded, or did not have any volumes.  
It was submitted that the percentage of excess business 
carried out with associate brokers were as high as 91.68% and 
52.42%, while the total volume of business done with the 
associate brokers was Rs.4.55 lacs.  
</p><p id="p_20">The Tribunal set aside the order of the Adjudicating Officer 
on the purported ground that the penalty to be imposed for 
failure to perform a statutory obligation is a matter of discretion.  
The Tribunal has held that the penalty is warranted by the 
quantum which has to be decided by taking into consideration 
the factors stated in <a href="/doc/398319/" id="a_7">Section 15-J</a>.  Aggrieved by the order dated 
21.08.2003, the Chairman, SEBI filed the above statutory appeal 
under <a href="/doc/9382/" id="a_8">Section 15-Z</a> of the Act of 1992 as amended by the 
Securities and <a href="/doc/188267/" id="a_9">Exchange Board of India (Amendment) Act</a>, 2002.

<p id="p_40">Statutory Scheme
Chapter VI-A of the SEBI Act provides for Penalties and 
Adjudication, which provisions were introduced in SEBI Act by 
the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_19">Amendment Act</a> 9 of 1995.  <a href="/doc/1404045/" id="a_20">Section 15-A</a> to Section 15 HB 
are in the form of mandatory provisions imposing penalty in 
default of the provisions of the SEBI Act and Regulations.  The 
provisions of penalty for non-compliance of the mandate of the 
Act is with an object to have an effective deterrent to ensure 
better compliance of the provisions of the SEBI Act and 
Regulations, which is crucial for the appellant Board in order to 
protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the 
development of the securities market.
</p><p id="p_41">Chapter VI-A of the SEBI Act deals with the penalties and 
the adjudication.  Section 15-l of the SEBI ACT envisages 
appointment of Adjudicating Officer for holding an inquiry in the 
prescribed manner, after giving reasonable opportunity of being 
heard for the purpose of imposing any penalty.
<a href="/doc/398319/" id="a_21">Section 15-J</a> provides various factors which are to be taken 
into consideration while adjudging the question of penalty under 
<a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_22">Section 15-l</a> namely, the amount of disproportionate gain or 
unfair advantage whenever quantifiable, loss caused to an 
investor or group of investors and the repetitive nature of default.  
The legislature in its wisdom had not included mens rea or 
deliberate or wilful nature of default as a factor to be considered 
by the Adjudicating Officer in determining the quantum of 
liability to be imposed on the defaulter.
<a href="/doc/1404045/" id="a_23">Sections 15A</a> to <a href="/doc/1908801/" id="a_24">15H</a> and <a href="/doc/157347540/" id="a_25">15HA</a> employ the words "shall be 
liable" and, therefore, mandatorily provides for imposition of 
monetary penalties for respective breaches or non-compliance of 
provisions of the SEBI Act and the Regulations.  Default or 
failure, as contemplated under the Act includes :
15A  Failure to furnish information, return 
15B  Failure to enter into agreement with clients
15C  Failure to redress investors' grievances
15D  Default in case of mutual funds
15E  Failure to observe rules and regulations by an 
	  asset management company
15F  Default in case of stock brokers
15G  For insider trading
15H  Non-disclosure of acquisition of shares and takeovers
15HA  Fradulent and unfair trade practices
15HB  Penalty, if not separately provided

	The Scheme of the SEBI Act of imposing penalty is very 
clear.  Chapter VI nowhere deals with criminal offences.  These 
defaults for failures are nothing, but failure or default of 
statutory civil obligations provided under the Act and the 
Regulations made thereunder.  It is pertinent to note that Section 
24 of the SEBI Act deals with the criminal offences under the Act 
and its punishment.  Therefore, the proceedings under Chapter 
VI A are neither criminal nor quasi-criminal.  The penalty leviable 
under this Chapter or under these Sections, is penalty in cases of 
default or failure of statutory obligation or in other words breach 
of civil obligation.  In the provisions and scheme of penalty under 
Chapter VI A of the SEBI Act, there is no element of any criminal 
offence or punishment as contemplated under criminal 
proceedings.  Therefore, there is no question of proof of intention 
or any mens rea by the appellants and it is not essential element 
for imposing penalty under SEBI Act and the Regulations.     
As already noticed, the Tribunal allowed the appeals of the 
respondent on the ground that there was no mala fide intention 
to act in violation of Regulation 25 (7((a) and Section 15(D)(b) of 
the SEBI Act but due to circumstances respondents were forced 
to act in excess of the limits prescribed under Regulation 25(D)(b) 
of the said Regulation. 
</p><p id="p_42">Question of law
The important question of law which arises for 
consideration in the present appeal is whether the Tribunal was 
justified in allowing the appeals of the respondent herein and 
that whether once it is conclusively established that the Mutual 
Fund has violated the terms of the Certificate of Registration and 
the statutory Regulations i.e. the SEBI (Mutual Funds) 
Regulation, 1996, the imposition of penalty becomes a sine qua 
non of the violation. 
</p><p id="p_43">In other words, the breach of a civil obligation which 
attracts penalty in the nature of fine under the provisions of the 
Act and the Regulations would immediately attract the levy of 
penalty irrespective of the fact whether the contravention was 
made by the defaulter with any guilty intention or not. 
 Mr. Rao took us through the orders passed by the 
Adjudicating Authority.  It is seen that the respondents 
themselves have admitted the violation of the Regulations during 
a continuous period of 2= years in 12 instances, covering 6 
quarters.  Regulation 25 (7)(a) of the Regulation provides that an 
Asset Management Company shall not through any broker 
associated with sponsor, purchase or sell securities, which is 
average of 5% or more of the aggregate purchases and sale of 
securities made by the Mutual Fund in all its schemes.  The 
second proviso to the said Regulation clearly provides that the 
aforesaid limit shall apply for a block of 3 months.  Hence, there 
has been a repetitive violation of the said Regulation, and the 
terms of the Certificate of Registration.  In these circumstances, 
the learned senior counsel submitted that the Tribunal has 
erroneously allowed the appeals filed by the respondents against 
the order passed by the Adjudicating Officer on 24.06.2002.  The 
Tribunal has given a clear finding that the respondent No.1 Fund 
has admittedly exceeded the prescribed limit of more than 5% 
when it had transacted business through brokers, associated 
with its sponsors which is in contravention of provisions of 
Regulation 25(7)(a) of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulation, 1996. 
We have already noticed the instances of excess 
transactions conduced by the respondents and reproduced the 
same in paragraphs (supra).  It is an admitted fact that the 
respondent had on 12 occasions routed transactions through its 
associated brokerage houses in excess of the permissible limits 
prescribed under Regulation 25 (7)(a) of the Regulations. 
In the present case, the contesting respondent is a Mutual 
Fund and the Asset Management Company.  During the period 
from June, 1998 to September, 1999, the respondent had 
conducted business through associated brokers, in excess of the 
limits prescribed under Regulation 25 (7)(a) of the Regulations on 
12 occasions covering 6 quarters.  The respondent had failed to 
comply with the terms and conditions attached to the Certificate 
of Registration granted to it, inasmuch as it did not exercise 
diligence to ensure that the transactions by its own Asset 
Management Company were confined to the permissible limits. 
In this case, the SEBI appointed an Adjudicating Officer in 
terms of <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_26">Section 15-I</a> to inquire into and adjudge the alleged 
contravention of <a href="/doc/536016/" id="a_27">Section 15-E</a> of the Act of 1992.  The 
Adjudicating Officer, after inquiry, confirmed the charges and 
imposed a sum of Rs. 5 lacs as penalty on respondent No.2 
under <a href="/doc/536016/" id="a_28">Section 15-E</a> of the said Act for failure to comply with 
Regulation 25 (7)(a) and Rs. 2 lacs on the other respondent for 
failure to comply with the terms and conditions attached to the 
Certificate of Registration. 
</p><p id="p_44">Mr. Rao submitted that under Regulation 25 (7)(a) an Asset 
Management Company shall not through any broker associated 
with the sponsor, purchase or sell securities, which is average of 
5% or more of the aggregate purchases and sale of securities 
made by Mutual Funds in all its schemes and that the aforesaid 
limit of 5% shall apply for a block of any three months.  
In the present case, the respondents on their own 
admission have violated the aforesaid statutory Regulations 
during 6 quarters.  Hence Mr. Rao submitted that the violation is 
ex facie wilful and hence the penalty imposed by the Adjudicating 
Officer ought not to have been set aside by the single member 
Tribunal.  Mr. Rao further argued that unless the language of the 
statute indicates the need to establish the element of mens rea it 
is generally sufficient to prove that a default in complying with 
the statute has occurred.  Under <a href="/doc/1241807/" id="a_29">Sections 15-D(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/536016/" id="a_30">15-E</a> of 
the Act, there is nothing which requires that mens rea must be 
proved before penalty can be imposed under these provisions.  
Hence, it was contended that once the contravention is 
established, the penalty has to follow. 
</p><p id="p_45">The Tribunal set aside the order passed by the Adjudicating 
Officer on the ground that the penalty to be imposed for failure to 
perform a statutory obligation is a matter of discretion which has 
to be exercised judicially and on a consideration of all the 
relevant facts and circumstances.  The Tribunal also held that 
the Adjudicating Officer has to be satisfied with the material 
placed before him that the violation deserves punishment.  It was 
held that the penalty is warranted by the quantum which has to 
be decided by taking into consideration the factors stated in 
Section 15J of SEBI Act.  In our opinion, the Tribunal has 
miserably failed to appreciate that by setting aside the order of 
the Adjudicating Officer the Tribunal was setting a serious wrong 
precedent whereby every offender would take shelter of alleged 
hardships to violate the provisions of the Act.  In our opinion, 
mens rea is not an essential ingredient for contravention of the 
provisions of a civil act.  In our view, the penalty is attracted as 
soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as 
contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the 
intention of the parties committing such violation becomes 
immaterial.  In other words, the breach of a civil obligation which 
attracts penalty under the provisions of an Act would 
immediately attract the levy of penalty irrespective of the fact 
whether the contravention was made by the defaulter with any 
guilty intention or not.  This apart that unless the language of 
the statute indicates the need to establish the element of mens 
rea, it is generally sufficient to prove that a default in complying 
with the statute has occurred.  Under a close scrutiny of Section 
15 D(b) and 15-E of the Act, there is nothing which requires that 
mens rea must be proved before penalty can be imposed under 
these provisions.  Hence, we are of the view that once the 
contravention is established, then the penalty has to follow and 
only the quantum of penalty is discretionary.  Discretion has 
been exercised by the Adjudicating Officer as is evident from 
imposition of lesser penalty than what could have been imposed 
under the provisions.  The intention of the parties is wholly 
irrelevant since there has been a clear violation of the statutory 
Regulations and provisions repetitively, covering a period of 6 
quarters.  Hence we hold that the respondents have wilfully 
violated statutory provisions with impunity and hence the 
imposition of penalty was fully justified.  The Tribunal, in this 
context, failed to appreciate that every Mutual Fund has to 
redeem the units as per terms and conditions of the scheme on 
the request of the unit holders and this cannot, in any manner, 
be considered as an extraordinary circumstance or something 
which was not known to the respondents.  The facts and 
circumstances of the present case in no way indicate the 
existence of special circumstances so as to waive the penalty 
imposed by the Adjudicating Officer.  A perusal of the order 
passed by the Adjudicating Officer would clearly go to show that 
factors such as small size of the funds, low volume of 
transactions, thinly traded securities, administrative and 
operational exigencies were duly considered and appreciated by 
the Adjudicating Officer while passing the order and that is why 
the Adjudicating Officer did not impose the maximum 
permissible penalty.  The Tribunal failed to appreciate that the 
objective behind imposing certain limit on the business that can 
be conducted by mutual fund through the associate broker is to 
eliminate any undue advantage to the class of brokers by virtue 
of their close association with the Asset Management Company, 
sponsors etc.  In other words, the object of imposing such limits 
is to ensure that there is no concentration of business only in 
such entities, so that there is an indirect pecuniary advantage to 
the person associated with the Asset Management Company, 
sponsors etc.  Any undue concentration on the business of the 
mutual fund with its affiliated brokers by paying huge 
commissions to such brokers is neither desirable nor in the 
interest of the unit holders.  It is a matter of record that in the 12 
admitted instances of violation by the respondents, the 
percentage of the business through the associated brokers was 
as high as 91.68% and 52.2% in certain factors.  This apart, the 
respondent's excessive exposure to the associate brokers is not 
only established from the record, but has also been admitted by 
respondents. 
</p><p id="p_46">It is settled law that when a penalty is imposed by an 
Adjudicating Officer, it is done so in adjudicatory proceedings 
and not by way of fine as a result of prosecution of an accused 
for commission of an offence in a criminal proceeding.  In the 
instant case, the Tribunal has failed to appreciate that the 
respondents had given undue and unfair advantage to the 
associated brokers, which is detrimental to the interest of the 
unit holders.  
</p><p id="p_47">In the present case, it has been established by the 
Adjudicating Officer as well as admitted by the respondents that 
there has been a conscious disregard of the obligation inasmuch 
as the respondents were aware that they were acting in violation 
of the provisions of Regulations.  The Adjudicating Officer had, 
after taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the 
case, imposed only a token of Rs. 5 lacs against the respondents 
for its failure on 12 occasions though the charging section 
permits imposition of a maximum penalty of Rs. 5 lacs for each 
such violation.  
</p><p id="p_48">The Appellant Board has been established by the 
Parliament under the Securities and <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_31">Exchange Board of India 
Act</a>, 1992 to protect the interest of investors in securities and to 
promote the development of, and to regulate the securities 
market and for matter connected therewith or incidental thereto.  
The Board was set up to promote orderly and healthy growth of 
the securities market and for investors protection SEBI has been 
monitoring and regulating the activities of Stock Exchanges, 
Mutual Funds and Merchant Bankers, etc. to achieve these 
goals.  The Capital market has witnessed tremendous growth in 
recent times, characterized particularly by the increasing 
participation of the Public.  Investors' confidence in the capital 
market can be sustained largely by ensuring investors protection.  
That it became imperative to impose monetary penalties also in 
addition to other penalties in cases of default. 
Mens rea  : Whether an essential element for imposing 
penalty for breach of civil obligations?
	This Court in a catena of decisions have held that mens rea 
is not an essential element for imposing penalty for breach of 
civil obligations.
</p><p id="p_49">(a)	<a href="/doc/212683/" id="a_32">Director of Enforcement vs. MCTM Corporation Pvt. 
Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>. , (1996) 2 SCC 471
"It is thus the breach of a "civil obligation" which 
attracts "penalty" under Section 23(1)(a) FERA, 
1947 and a finding that the delinquent has 
contravened the provisions of Section 10  FERA 
1947 that would immediately attract the levy of 
"penalty" under <a href="/doc/3118/" id="a_33">Section 23</a>, irrespective of the fact 
whether the contravention was made by the 
defaulter with any "guilty intention" or not.  
Therefore, unlike in a criminal case, where it is 
essential for the 'prosecution' to establish that the 
'accused' had the necessary guilty intention or in 
other words the requisite 'mens rea' to commit the 
alleged offence with which he is charged before 
recording his conviction, the obligation on the part 
of the Directorate of Enforcement, in cases of 
contravention of the provisions of Section 10 of 
FERA, would be discharged where it is shown that 
the "blameworthy conduct" of the delinquent had 
been established by wilful contravention by him of 
the provisions of <a href="/doc/1557315/" id="a_34">Section 10</a>, FERA 1947.  It is the 
delinquency of the defaulter itself which establishes 
his 'blameworthy' conduct, attracting the provisions 
of Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947, without any 
further proof of the existence of "mens rea".  Even 
after an adjudication by the authorities and levy of 
penalty under Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947, the 
defaulter can still be tried and punished for the 
commission of an offence under the penal 
law."

<p id="p_50">"In Corpus Juris Secundrum. Vol.85 at page 580, 
para 1023, it is stated thus:
</p>
<p id="p_51">"A penalty imposed for a tax delinquency is a civil 
obligation, remedial and coercive in its nature, and 
is far different from the penalty for a crime or a fine 
or forfeiture provided as punishment for the 
violation of criminal or penal laws."
</p>
<p id="p_52">"We are in agreement with the aforesaid view and in 
our opinion what applies to "tax delinquency" 
equally holds good for the 'blameworthy' conduct for 
contravention of the provisions of FERA, 1947.  We, 
therefore, hold that mens area (as is understood in 
criminal law) is not an essential ingredient for 
holding a delinquent liable to pay penalty under 
Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947 for contravention of 
the provisions of Section 10 of FERA, 1947 and that 
penalty is attracted under <a href="/doc/3118/" id="a_35">Section 23(1)(a)</a> as soon 
as contravention of the statutory obligation 
contemplated by <a href="/doc/168459/" id="a_36">Section 10(1)(a)</a> is established.  
The High Court apparently fell in error in treating 
the "blameworthy conduct" under the Act as 
equivalent to the commission of a "criminal offence", 
overlooking the position that the "blameworthy 
conduct" in the adjudicatory proceedings is 
established by proof only of the breach of a civil 
obligation under the Act, for which the defaulter is 
obliged to make amends by payment of the penalty 
imposed under <a href="/doc/3118/" id="a_37">Section 23(1)(a)</a> of the Act 
irrespective of the fact whether he committed the 
breach, with or without any guilty intention."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">665</span>

"The offences under the Act are not a part of 
general penal law but arise from the breach of a 
duty provided in a special beneficial social 
defence legislation, which creates absolute or 
strict liability without proof of any mens rea.  The 
offences are strict statutory offences for which 
establishment of mens rea is not an essential 
ingredient.  The omission or commission of the 
statutory breach is itself the offence.  Similar type 
of offences based on the principle of strict 
liability, which means liability without fault or 
mens rea, exist in many statutes relating to 
economic crimes as well as in laws concerning 
the industry, food adulteration, prevention of 
pollution etc. in India and abroad.  "Absolute 
offences" are not criminal offences in any real 
sense but acts which are prohibited in the 
interest of welfare of the public and the 
prohibition is backed by sanction of 
penalty"

"Even here we may reject the notion 
that a penalty or a punishment  cannot be cast in 
the form of an absolute or no-fault liability but 
must be preceded by mens rea.  The classical 
view that 'no mens rea, no crime' has long ago 
been eroded and several laws in India and 
abroad, especially regarding economic crimes and 
departmental penalties, have created severe 
punishments even where the offences have been 
defined to exclude mens rea.  Therefore, the 
contention that <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_38">Section 37(1)</a> fastens a heavy 
liability regardless of fault has no force in 
depriving the forfeiture of the character of 
penalty."

</p>
<p id="p_56">"It is sufficient for us to refer to <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_40">Section 
271(1)(a)</a>, which provides that a penalty may be 
imposed if the Income Tax Officer is satisfied that 
any person has without reasonable cause failed 
to furnish the return of total income, and to 
<a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_41">Section 276-C</a> which provides that if a person 
wilfully fails to furnish in due time the return of 
income required under <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_42">Section 139(1)</a>, he shall 
be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to one year or with fine.  
It is clear that in the former case what is 
intended is a civil obligation while in the latter 
what is imposed is a criminal sentence.  There 
can be no dispute that having regard to the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_43">Section 276-C</a>, which speaks of 
wilful failure on the part of the defaulter and 
taking into consideration the nature of the 
penalty, which is punitive, no sentence can be 
imposed under that provision unless the element 
of mens rea is established.  In most cases of 
criminal liability, the intention of the legislature 
is that the penalty should serve as a deterrent.  
The creation of an offence by statute proceeds on 
the assumption that society suffers injury by the 
act or omission of the defaulter and that a 
deterrent must be imposed to discourage the 
repetition of the offence.  In the case of a 
proceeding under <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_44">Section 271(1)(a)</a>, however, it 
seems that the intention of the legislature is to 
emphasise the fact of loss of revenue and to 
provide a remedy for such loss, although no 
doubt an element of coercion is present in the 
penalty.  In this connection, the terms in which 
the penalty falls to be measured is significant.  
Unless there is something in the language of the 
statute indicating the need to establish the 
element of mens rea it is generally sufficient to 
prove that a default in complying with the statute 
has occurred.  In our opinion, there is nothing in 
<a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_45">Section 271(1)(a)</a> which requires that mens rea 
must be proved before penalty can be levied 
under that provision."

<p id="p_60">"Thus, the following extracted principles are 
summarised:
</p>
<p id="p_61">(A)	Mens rea is an essential or sine qua non for 
criminal offence.
</p>
<p id="p_62">(B)	Strait jacket formula of mens rea cannot be 
blindly followed in each and every case.  
</p><p id="p_63">Scheme of particular statute may be diluted 
in a given case. 	 	
</p>
<p id="p_64">(C)	If, from the scheme, object and words used in 
the statute, it appears that the proceedings 
for imposition of the penalty are adjudicatory 
in nature, in contra-distinction to criminal or 
quasi criminal proceedings, the determination 
is of the breach of the civil obligation by the 
offender.  The word "penalty" by itself will not 
be determinative to conclude the nature of 
proceedings being criminal or quasi-criminal.  
The relevant considerations being the nature 
of the functions being discharged by the 
authority and the determination of the 
liability of the contravenor and the 
delinquency.
</p>
<p id="p_65">(D)	Mens rea is not essential element for imposing 
penalty for breach of civil obligations or 
liabilities..

<p id="p_66">(E)	There can be two distinct liabilities, civil and 
criminal under the same Act.

<p id="p_67">(Para 52)  The SEBI Act and the Regulations 
are intended to regulate the Security Market 
and related aspects, the imposition of penalty, 
in the given facts and circumstances of the 
case, cannot be tested on the ground of "no 
mens rea no penalty".  For breaches of 
provisions of SEBI Act and Regulations, 
according to us, which are civil in nature, 
mens rea is not essential.  On particular facts 
and circumstances of the case, proper 
exercise or judicial discretion is a must, but 
not on a foundation that mens rea is an 
essential to impose penalty in each and every 
breach of provisions of the SEBI Act.
</p><p id="p_68">(para 54) However, we are not in agreement 
with the appellate authority in respect of the 
reasoning given in regard to the necessity of 
mens rea being essential for imposing the 
penalty.   According to us, mens rea is not 
essential for imposing civil penalties under 
the SEBI Act and Regulations."

<p id="p_69">	The Trbunal has erroneously relied on the judgment in 
the case of Hindustan Steel Ltd. Vs. State of Orissa, AIR 
1970 SC 253 which pertained to criminal/quasi-criminal 
proceeding.  That Section 25 of the Orissa Sales Tax Act which 
was in question in the said case imposed a punishment of 
imprisonment up to six months and fine for the offences under 
the Act.  The said case has no application in the present case 
which relates to imposition of civil liabilities under the SEBI 
Act and Regulations and is not a criminal/quasi-criminal 
proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_70">In our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as 
the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated 
by the Act and the Regulation is established and hence the 
intention of the parties committing such violation becomes 
wholly irrelevant.  A breach of civil obligation which attracts 
penalty in the nature of fine under the provisions of the Act 
and the Regulations would immediately attract the levy of 
penalty irrespective of the fact whether contravention must 
made by the defaulter with guilty intention or not.  We also 
further held that unless the language of the statute indicates 
the need to establish the presence of mens rea, it is wholly 
unnecessary to ascertain whether such a violation was 
intentional or not.  On a careful perusal of <a href="/doc/1910177/" id="a_48">Section 15(D)(b)</a> 
and <a href="/doc/536016/" id="a_49">Section 15-E</a> of the Act, there is nothing which requires 
that mens rea must be proved before penalty can be imposed 
under these provisions.  Hence once the contravention is 
established then the penalty is to follow.
	In our view, the impugned judgment of the Securities 
appellate Tribunal has set a serious wrong precedent and the 
powers  of the SEBI to impose penalty under Chapter VIA are 
severely curtailed against the plain language of the statute 
which mandatorily imposes penalties on the contravention of 
the Act/Regulations without any requirement of the 
contravention having been deliberated or contumacious.  The 
impugned order sets the stage for various market players to 
violate statutory regulations with impunity and subsequently 
plead ignorance of law or lack of mens rea to escape the 
imposition of penalty.  The imputing mens rea into the 
provisions of Chapter VI A is against the plain language of the 
statute and frustrates entire purpose and object of introducing 
Chapter VIA to give teeth to the SEBI to secure strict 
compliance of the Act and the Regulations.
In the result, the Civil Appeal Nos. 9523 and 9524 of 2003 
are allowed and the order passed by the Securities Appellate 
Tribunal, Mumbai dated 21.08.2003 in Appeal Nos. 50 and 51 of 
2002 are set aside.  No costs.
