<p id="p_2">  1.    These   appeals   arise   out   of   Judgment   and   Order 


        passed   by   the  Customs,   Excise   and   Gold   (Control) 



        Appellate   Tribunal,   New   Delhi  Bench   [for   short 



        "CEGAT"]   on   02.08.2002   whereby   the   Tribunal   had 



        allowed  the   appeals  filed by  the   respondents  holding 



        that   the   respondents   were   not   guilty   of   clandestine 



        removal of excisable goods and also that the goods of

        the respondent no. 1 were not excisable inasmuch as 



        they   were   not   packed   in   containers   under   a   brand 



        name.
</p>



<p id="p_3">      2. Before entering into rival contentions of the parties, it 



        would be necessary although in a nutshell to look into 



        the   facts   of   the   case   leading   to   filing   of   the   present  



        appeals.
</p>



<p id="p_4">3.      The   respondent   No.   1,   M/s.  Kalvert   Foods   India   Pvt. 
</p>


<p id="p_5">Ltd.   is   a   company   (in   short   hereinafter   referred  to   as   'the 



Company')   engaged   in   the   manufacture   of   P   &amp;   P   Food 



Products,   such   as,   assorted   jams,   pickles,   squashes, 



cooking   sauces,   chutneys,   syrups,   synthetic   vinegars   etc. 



The company is also  trading in  sugar, salt  and  pepper by 



packing   into   small   packs.   The   respondent   No.   2,   Shri 



Yunus A. Kalvert is the Managing Director of the Company. 
</p>



<p id="p_6">4.      On   22.11.2000,   on   receiving   information   that 



respondents   were   indulging   in   clandestine   removals   of   its 



finished   P   &amp;   P   food   products   without   payment   of   Central 



Excise   Duty,   the   revenue   authorities   searched   the   factory 



premises   of   the   respondent   no.   1.         Searches   were   also 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  Page 2 of 22</span>


carried   out   at   the   premises   of   its   distributors/wholesale 



dealers/traders of respondent no. 1 situated in and around 



Mumbai and other connected premises.  
</p>



<p id="p_7">5.    During   the   search   conducted   at   the   premises   of   the 



respondent no. 1 several incriminating documents, articles 



and records were found.  A huge quantity of finished goods 



were also  found lying in  the  factory premises.   Further, it 



was   also   noticed   that   there   was   one   tempo   parked   inside 



the   factory   premises   loaded   with   cartons   containing   the 



excisable   goods   manufactured   by   the   said   company   and 



was about to leave the factory premises.   On inquiry from 



the   driver   of   the   said   tempo   it   was   found   that   the   driver 



was   not   in   possession   of   any   documents   relating   to   the 



goods loaded in the said tempo.   On inspection of invoices  



at the premises of the respondent no. 1, it was also found  



that there were two invoices with the same serial number, 



in respect of different products.   The officers took stock of  



the goods in the factory and it was found that the finished 



goods lying in the factory were in excess of the stock shown 



and accounted for in the RGI Register.  
</p>




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                Page 3 of 22</span>


<p id="p_8">6.    Specific allegation  against  the  respondent is that  the 



goods   found   lying   excess   in   the   stock   than   what   were 



entered into RGI register, valued at Rs. 7,33,668/- and the  



same was seized.  
</p>


<p id="p_9">7.    Thereafter,   search   was   also   carried   out   at   the 



premises   of   the   dealers/traders,   to   whom   the   company 



allegedly   supplied   the   finished   goods.     The   goods   found  



lying in those premises to the value of Rs. 6,22,946/- were 



also seized on the ground that they were not duty paid. 
</p>



<p id="p_10">8.    Similarly,   the   search   was   carried   out   by   the   officers 



on   28-11-2000,   at   the   premises   of   M/s.   Relish   Trading  



Company   (in   short   'RTC')/the   selling   agent   of   the 



respondent-company,   M/s.   Sai   Krupa,   a   partnership   firm 



of   the   Managing   Director   of   the   respondent   No.   1;   and   at 



the   premises   of   sole   proprietor   of   RTC   and   records 



pertaining   to   the   sale   and   purchase   of   the   goods   lying   in 



the offices of these companies, were seized.   It revealed to 



the   searching   officers   that,   in   fact,   the   respondent-
</p>


<p id="p_11">company   had   cleared   jams,   syrup,   sauces,   pickles,   etc., 



from the  factory premises to the  above said selling agents 



without payment of duty, but had shown those clearances 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               Page 4 of 22</span>


as  that  of the  sugar, in  the  invoices and  had  also cleared 



the branded goods to the dealers/traders. 
</p>



<p id="p_12">9.    After   completion   of   the   entire   process   a   show   cause 



notice was issued to the Company and its Director.   Such 



notices were also issued to the proprietor of M/s. RTC, its 



partner and M/s. Sai Krupa Corporation.  Through notices 



issued,   duty   demand   was   raised   from   the   company   and 



penalty was also proposed to be imposed on the company. 
</p>


<p id="p_13">Reply   was   filed   by   the   respondents   to   the   aforesaid   show 



cause notices. 
</p>



<p id="p_14">10.  The adjudicating authority, namely, the Commissioner 



of   Central   Excise,   Mumbai,   passed   an   order   dated 



27.02.2002,   holding   that   the   respondent   no.   1   with   the 



connivance   of   the   respondents   2   and   3   have   deliberately 



attempted   to   pass   off   excisable   goods   as   non-excisable 



goods   with   an   intent   to   evade   payment   of   excise   duty. 
</p>


<p id="p_15">Consequently,   the   Commissioner   confirmed   the   duty 



demand   and   ordered  confiscation   of   the   seized  goods   and 



also imposed penalty equivalent to the amount of duty on 



the company and also directed to pay interest on the excise 



duty etc.

</p><p id="p_16">11.    Being   aggrieved   by   the   aforesaid   order,   respondents 



filed   appeals   before   the   CEGAT.   The   said   appeals   were 



heard   and   Tribunal   passed   the   judgment   and   order   on 



02.08.2002, which is impugned herein.  The Tribunal by its 



order set aside the findings of the Commissioner of Central 



Excise,   Mumbai   holding   that   the   respondents   were   not 



guilty   of   clandestine   removal   of   excisable   goods   and   also 



that   the   goods   of   respondent   no.   1   were   not   excisable 



inasmuch as they were allegedly not packed in containers 



under a brand name and therefore not required to pay any 



excise duty.  
</p>



<p id="p_17">12.    The   present   appeals   are   directed   and   preferred 



against   the   said   judgment   and   order   on   which   we   heard 



learned counsel appearing for the parties.  
</p>



<p id="p_18">13.    The   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   parties   have 



painstakingly   and   extensively   taken   us   through   the 



relevant   documents   on   record   to   which   reference   shall   be 



made   during   the   course   of   our   discussion   hereinafter. 
</p>


<p id="p_19">However,   before   we   record   our   findings   and   the 



conclusions   on   the   issues   raised,   we   must   also   deal   with

the   tariff   headings   and   some   of   the   documents   which   are 



relevant for our purpose and material available on record. 
</p>



<p id="p_20">14.    Admittedly, the years with which we are concerned in 



these appeals are 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99.   So far 



the year of 1996-97 is concerned the relevant entry for our 



purpose is 20.01 and sub-heading 2001.00 under Chapter 



20   of   the   Central   Excise   Tariff   of   India   1996-97 



(incorporating   rates   of   Central   Excise   &amp;   Service   Tax).

<p id="p_21">Chapter   20   relates   to   preparations   of   vegetables,   fruits, 



nuts or other parts of plants and it prescribes "Nil" rate of

<p id="p_36">17.    During   the   search   operation   carried   out   by   the 



appellants   several   incriminating   articles   were   found   with 



brand name "Kalvert Anchor" or "Kalvert" in assorted forms 



which were manufactured by M/s. Kalvert Foods (I) P. Ltd. 
</p>


<p id="p_37">During the course of investigation statement of Shri Yunus 



A. Kalvert, Managing Director of respondent company was 



recorded under <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_1">Section 14</a> of the Central Excise Act, 1944, 



who  inter   alia  deposed   that   the   respondent   company   was 



engaged   in   the   manufacture   of   P   &amp;   P   food   products   like 



jams;   pickles;   syrups;   vinegars   etc.   bearing   their   brand 



name "KALVERT ANCHOR" and the  other Directors of the 



company   viz.   Shri   Akbar   Ali   Kalvert,   his   father   and   Shri 



Irshad Y. Kalvert.

<p id="p_38">18.    During   the   course   of   arguments   learned   counsel 



appearing   for   the   respondent   submitted   before   us   that 



although the aforesaid statements of Managing Director of 



the Company and other persons were recorded during the 



course of judicial proceedings but the same were retracted 



statements,   and   therefore,   they   cannot   be   relied   upon. 
</p>


<p id="p_39">However,   the   statements   were   recorded   by   the   Central 



Excise Officers and they were not police officers. Therefore, 



such   statements   made   by   the   Managing   Director   of   the 



Company   and   other   persons   containing   all   the   details 



about the functioning of the company which could be made 



only   with   personal   knowledge   of   the   respondents   and 



therefore could not have been obtained through coercion or 



duress   or   through   dictation.   We   see   no   reason   why   the 



aforesaid   statements   made   in   the   circumstances   of   the 



case should not be considered, looked into and relied upon. 
</p>



<p id="p_40">19.    We are of the considered opinion that it is established 



from the record that the aforesaid statements were given by 



the concerned persons out of their own volition and there is 



no allegation of threat, force, coercion, duress or pressure 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                            Page 10 of 22</span>


being   utilized   by   the   officers   to   extract   the   statements 



which   corroborated   each   other.     Besides,   the   Managing 



Director of the Company on his own volition deposited the 



amount   of           Rs.   11   lakhs   towards   excise   duty   and 



therefore in the facts and circumstance of the present case, 



the aforesaid statement of the counsel for the respondents 



cannot be accepted.  This fact clearly proves the conclusion 



that the statements of the concerned persons were of their 



volition and not outcome of any duress.
</p>



<p id="p_41">20.    During   the   course   of   arguments   our   attention   was 



also   drawn   to   the   statement   of   Managing   Director   of   the 



Company   where   he   had   admitted   the   fact   of   clandestine 



clearance  of  excisable  goods  and  therefore  has  voluntarily 



come forward to sort out the issue and to pay the Central 



Excise   duty   liability   and   that   he   has   paid   Central   Excise  



duty   voluntarily   under   TR6   Challans   totaling   to   Rs. 
</p>


<p id="p_42">11,00,000/- on various dates.  Similarly statement of Miss 



Vinita M. Khanolkar - proprietor of RTC was also recorded 



under   <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_2">Section   14</a>   of   the   Central   Excise   Act,   1944   along 



with   Shri   Shekhar   Mogaviera   -   Production   Supervisor   of 



M/s.  Kalvert   Foods   India   Pvt.   Ltd.     Statements   of   various

other   persons   were   also  recorded  under   <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_3">Section   14</a>  of  the 



Central Excise Act.  
</p>



<p id="p_43">21.    Our   attention   was   also   drawn   by   the   counsel 



appearing for the appellant to the findings recorded by the 



adjudicating   authority   to   the   fact   that   there   have   been 



recovery   of   unaccounted   finished   excisable   goods   from   8 



different   dealers   in   and   around   Mumbai   and   that   there 



have   been   creation   of   firms   dealing   in   similar   products 



from   the   same   premises   by   the   same   persons   having   no 



capital   or   machinery   and   also   that   there   have   been   only 



one   tempo   invariably   used   for   delivery   of   excisable   goods 



from   factory   to   the   buyers   though   some   invoices   were 



issued   by   the   firms   other   than   M/s.   Kalvert   Foods   India 



Pvt.   Ltd.   and   that   there   have   been   use   of   parallel   sets   of 



invoices of the same serial numbers supported by recovery 



of   a   serially   numbering   machine   and   blank   invoices 



without any printed serial numbers.  
</p>



<p id="p_44">22.    On   the   basis   of   the   aforesaid   material   discussed 



hereinbefore   the   adjudicating   authority   came   to   the 



conclusion  that the respondent no. 1 with the connivance 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                Page 12 of 22</span>


of   respondent   nos.   2   and   3   have   been   deliberately 



clandestinely   removing  excisable   goods   as   non-excisable 



goods   with   intent   to   evade   payment   of   excise   duty. 
</p>


<p id="p_45">However, the  aforesaid judgment and order passed by the 



adjudicating   authority,   namely,   the   Commissioner   of 



Central   Excise,   Mumbai,   was   set   aside   by   the   Tribunal 



holding   that   neither   the   tempo   nor   the   goods   loaded 



therein   could   be   legally   seized   and   confiscated   when   the 



relevant documents were shown to the officers at the spot. 
</p>


<p id="p_46">It   was   also   observed   by   the   Tribunal   that   it   could   not   be 



said that an attempt was being made to clear those goods 



in   tempo   in   a   clandestine   manner,   when   the   company 



representative   produced   the   invoices   and   other   relevant 



documents in respect thereof.   These findings were arrived 



at by the Tribunal apparently ignoring the materials which 



are considered hereinbefore and referred to.  
</p>



<p id="p_47">23.    There   is   no   reference   about   the   statement   of  Miss 



Vinita  M.  Khanolkar  -  sole  proprietor  of  M/s.  RTC,  in  the 



judgment   of   order   passed   by   the   Tribunal,   when   she   was 



examined under <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_4">Section 14</a>  of the Central Excise Act,  she 



had   clearly   stated   that   her   company   bought   large

quantities of excisable goods from the respondent company 



and   in   turn   sold   them   to   its   distributors.   She   also 



confirmed the documents seized from her residence which 



included   correspondence   with   their   customers   regarding 



promotion of the "Kalvert brand" products.

<p id="p_48">24.    The   Tribunal   also   failed   to   consider   and   discuss   the 



specific   allegation   of   the   appellant   that   respondent   no.   1 



maintained two  sets of computerized commercial  invoices, 



one for excisable products like jams, sauce, syrup etc and  



the  other  for  non-excisable goods such as salt, sugar  and 



pepper which were marked as L series.     It has also come 



on   evidence   that   L   series   sales   for   the   period   1996-1999  



was  only  made to RTC  in huge quantities and that  in the 



guise of selling salt, sugar and pepper, the respondent No. 



1   was   in   fact   selling   excisable   goods   to   RTC.   These   facts 



have   been   found   and   taken   note   of   by   the  adjudicating 



authority  but   the   same   were   totally   ignored   by   the 



Tribunal.  
</p>



<p id="p_49">25.    Due to the aforesaid reasons and on the basis of the 



materials available on record it is clear that the Company 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               Page 14 of 22</span>


was   guilty   of   clandestine   removal   of   excisable   goods   as 



non-excisable   goods   in   order   to   evade   excise   duty.     It   is 



proved from the fact that the Managing Director voluntarily 



came   forward   to   sort   out   the   issue   and  to   pay   the  Excise 



duty and paid Excise duty to the extent of Rs. 11,00,000/- 
</p>


<p id="p_50">on different dates.  The aforesaid act of the respondent no.  
</p>


<p id="p_51">1   was   very   material   and   relevant   but   the   same   was   also 



ignored   by   the   Tribunal   while   arriving   at   a   wrong 



conclusion.  
</p>



<p id="p_52">26.    Therefore, according to us the issue with regard to the 



clandestine   removal   of   excisable   goods   as   non-excisable 



goods by the respondent from their premises and selling to 



its   dealers   and   distributors   is   clearly   proved   from   the 



materials on record.
</p>



<p id="p_53">27.    In view of the aforesaid position and since there was 



clandestine   removal   of   excisable   goods,   the   period   of 



limitation  in the  present case would  have  to be  computed 



from the date of their knowledge, arrived at upon raids on  



the   premises.     In   the   present   case   therefore   the   extended 



period   of   limitation   would   be   available   as   there   was 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                              Page 15 of 22</span>


suppression of facts by the respondents with the intention 



to evade the central excise duty inasmuch as they did not  



account   for   the   manufactured   goods   in   the   prescribed 



record.  
</p>



<p id="p_54">28.     The   Tribunal   has   also   recorded   a   finding   that   the 



respondents never cleared the goods in question under any 



brand name and being unbranded they were chargeable to 



NIL rate of duty.
</p>



<p id="p_55">29.     The   aforesaid   finding   is   also   unacceptable.     The 



Managing Director of the respondent company has himself 



stated that they have been selling their products under the 



brand   name   "Kalvert"   and   on   the   basis   of   the   said 



statement   and   other   record   found   on   the   articles   sold   by 



the   respondent   company   the   aforesaid   finding   of   the 



Tribunal is wrong and perverse.  
</p>



<p id="p_56">30.     The   Tribunal   has   also   held   that   because   the   brand 



name "Kalvert" was not registered in their name therefore it 



cannot be held that respondents were using `brand name'. 
</p>


<p id="p_57">The   Tribunal   further   held   that   the   name   on   the   goods 



manufactured and cleared by the respondent in the market 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                              Page 16 of 22</span>


could   at   best   be   termed   as   "House   mark"   and   not   brand 



name/trade name.  
</p>



<p id="p_58">31.    In  our   considered  opinion,   the   aforesaid  findings  are 



also   totally   wrong   and   recorded   in   violation   of   the   law   of 



Trade   Marks.     During   the   course   of   arguments,   our 



attention   was   drawn   to   a   Judgment   of   this   Court   in   the 



case   of  TARAI   FOOD   LTD.   V.  COMMISSIONER   OF  


CENTRAL EXCISE, MEERUT-II, reported in 2007(8) S.T.R. 
</p>

<p id="p_59">442   (S.C.).     While   placing   reliance   on   the   said   Judgment,  



the  counsel appearing  for   the  respondents  submitted that 



what is a `Brand name' is as stated in paragraph 4 of the 



said Judgment.   He relied on the said definition  of `Brand 



name' and then submitted that the phrase "New Improved 



Quick   Frozen   French   Fries"   was   not   held   to   be   a   brand 



name, and therefore, according to him  the  brand name of 



the   respondent   company   "Kalvert"   being   a   "House   Name" 
</p>


<p id="p_60">could not be termed as "Brand Name".   
</p>



<p id="p_61">32.    In our considered opinion, the aforesaid brand name 



"New Improved Quick Frozen French Fries" is a descriptive 



word and the same could not have been termed and coined 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                               Page 17 of 22</span>


either   as   a   "house   name"   or   a   "brand   name"   under   any 



circumstances.   There   can   be   no   dispute   therefore   with 



regard to the proposition of law laid down by this Court in 



the   aforesaid   decision.     We   may   also   refer   to   another 



decision of this Court in  Astra Pharmaceutical Pvt. Ltd. 
</p>


<p id="p_62">V.  Collector   of   Central   Excise,   Chandigarh,   reported   in 



[1995   (75)   E.L.T.   214   (S.C.)].     That   was   a   case   of 



Pharmaceutical   product.   In   the   said   decision   also   the 



manner   and   scope   of   "Brand   name"   and   distinction 



between   `House   mark'   and   "Product   mark/Brand   name" 
</p>


<p id="p_63">has been brought out. It was stated therein by this Court 



that "House mark" which is usually a device in the form of 



an   emblem,   word   or   both   is   an   identification   of   the 



manufacturer which is compulsory under the Drug Rules. 
</p>


<p id="p_64">On   the   other   hand,   product   mark   or   brand   name   is 



invariably a word or a combination of a word and letter or 



numeral by which the product is identified and asked for.  
</p>


<p id="p_65">In paragraph 6 of the said Judgment,  Narayanan's Book  


on Trade Marks and Passing-Off was also referred to and 


since   the   same   may   have   a   bearing   to   the   facts   of   the  



present case, it is extracted herein below:

<p id="p_66">"677A. House mark and Product mark (or Brand name).
</p>

<p id="p_67">              In   the   pharmaceutical   business   a   distinction   is  

made   between   a   House   mark   and   a   Product   mark.     The  

former is used on all the products of the manufacturer. It is  

usually   a   device   in   the   form   of   an   emblem,   word   or   both.  
</p>
<p id="p_68">For each product a separate mark known as a product mark  

or   a   brand   name   is   used   which   is   invariably   a   word   or   a  

combination   of   a   word   and   letter   or   numeral   by   which   the  

product is identified and asked for. In respect of all products  

both the Product mark and House mark will appear side by  

side  on all  the  labels, cartons  etc.    Goods are  ordered only  

by   the   product   mark   or   Brand   name.   The   House   mark  

serves   as   an   emblem   of   the   manufacturer   projecting   the  

image of the manufacturer generally."
</p>



<p id="p_69">33.    In   the   book   of   "Trade   Marks"   by  Sarkar,   the 



distinction   between   the   expressions   "House   mark"   and 



"Product mark" or "Brand name" has been clearly brought 



out   by   way   of   reference   to   the   decision   in  Astra  


Pharmaceutical   Pvt.   Ltd.   (supra).     It   is   stated   therein 


that   "House   mark"   is   used   on   all   the   products   of   the 



manufacturer   and   that   it   is   usually   a   device   or   a   form   of  



emblem of words or both.   It was also pointed out that for 



each product a separate mark known as a "Product mark" 
</p>


<p id="p_70">or   "Brand   name"   is   used   which   is   invariably   a   word   or 



combination   of   word   and   letter   or   numeral   by   which   the 



product is identified and asked for.  It was also stated that  



in   respect   of   all   products   both   the   "Product   mark"     and 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                Page 19 of 22</span>


"Brand name" would appear side by side on all the labels, 



cartons etc.   and that the "House mark"   is used generally 



as an emblem of the manufacturer projecting the image of 



the   manufacturer,     whereas   "Brand   name"   is   a   name   or 



trade mark either unregistered or registered under the Act. 
</p>



<p id="p_71">34.    Therefore,   it   is   not   necessary   that   "Brand   name" 
</p>


<p id="p_72">should be compulsorily registered.   A person can carry on 



his   trade   by   using   a   "Brand   name"   which   is   not   even 



registered.     But   in   violation/infringement   of   trade   mark, 



remedy   available   would   be   distinctly   different   to   an 



unregistered brand name from that of remedy available to a 



registered brand name.  
</p>



<p id="p_73">35.    Unfortunately,   the   Tribunal   did   not   consider   and 



properly   appreciate   the   apparent   distinction   between   the 



two   distinct   expressions   i.e.   "House   mark"     and   "Brand 



name" and thereby proceeded to set aside the well-written 



Judgment  passed  by  the  Commissioner  of  Central  Excise, 



Mumbai who has recorded his reasons giving cogent basis 



for his reasoning.

<p id="p_74">36.    In   the   book   of   "Law   of   Trade   Marks"   by  K.C.  
</p>

<p id="p_75">Kailasam and Ramu Vedaraman the distinction between 


`Product   mark'   and   `House   mark'   has   been   beautifully 



delineated, which is as under:
</p>


<p id="p_76">"It   is   possible   that   the   proprietor   may   use   several   trade  

marks   in   respect   of   his   goods   (known   as   Product   mark),  

besides using a common mark in all his products to indicate  

the origin of the goods from the enterprise (known as House  

mark).        This   practice   is   more   predominant   in   the  

pharmaceutical   trade.     Though   both   are   trade   marks   and  

are  registrable  as  such, each  has  its  own  distinct  function.  
</p>
<p id="p_77">While the House mark represents the image of the enterprise  

from   which   the   goods   emanate,   the   Product   mark   is   the  

means  by which  goods are  identified and  purchased in the  

market   place   and   it   the   focal   point   of   presentation   and  

advertisement."
</p>


<p id="p_78">37.    In view of above discussion, it is clear that what was 



being   used   by   the   respondent   under   the   expression 



"Kalvert" was a "Brand name" and not a "House mark" as 



sought   to   be   alleged   by   the   respondent   and   has   been 



wrongly accepted by the Tribunal.  Therefore, the articles of 



assorted   jams,   pickles,   squashes,   cooking   sauces, 



chutneys,   syrups,   synthetic   vinegars   etc.   manufactured 



and sold by the respondent company under a brand name 



"Kalvert"   were   liable   to   be   charged   for   excise   duty   at   the 



rate prescribed in the Excise Law.

its   conclusion   and   therefore   the   order   passed   by   the 



Tribunal   is   set   aside   and   the   order   dated   27.02.2002 



passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai is 



restored.
