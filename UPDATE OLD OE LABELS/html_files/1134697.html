HEADNOTE:
     <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_10">Article  311</a>   of	the   Constitution  confers  certain
safeguards upon	 persons employed  in civil capacities under
the Union of India or a State. The first safeguard (which is
given by  clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_11">Article  311</a>) is  that such  person
cannot be  dismissed or	 removed by an authority subordinate
to that	 by which  he was  appointed. The  second  safeguard
(which is given by clause (2) of
133
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_12">Article 311</a>  is that  he  cannot  be  dismissed	 removed  or
reduced in rank except after an inquiry in which he has been
informed of  the charges  against him and given a reasonable
opportunity of	being heard  in respect	 of  those  charges.
The second  safeguard is,  however,  not  available  when  a
person is  dismissed, removed  or reduced  in rank in any of
the three  cases set  out in clauses (a) to (c) mentioned in
the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_13">Article 311(2).</a> Under clause (a), such
person can  be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank without
any inquiry  on the  ground of	conduct which has led to his
conviction on  a criminal  charge. Under  clause (b), any of
the three  penalties can  be  imposed  where  the  authority
empowered to  impose any  of the penalties is satisfied that
for some  reason,  to  be  recorded  by	 that  authority  in
writing, it  is not  reasonably	 practicable  to  hold	such
inquiry. Under	clause (c),  any of  the aforesaid penalties
can be	imposed where  the President,  or the  Governor of a
State, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest
of the	security of  the State	it is  not expedient to hold
such inquiry.
     All the  Government servants  in the  above Appeals and
Writ Petitions	had been  either dismissed  or removed	from
service without	 holding any  inquiry.	They  had  not	been
informed  of   the  charges   against  them  nor  given	 any
opportunity of	being heard in respect of those charges. The
penalty of  dismissal or  removal, as  the case	 may be, had
been imposed  upon them	 under one or the other of the three
clauses of  the second	proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_14">Article 311(2)</a>  or under
similar provisions  in	rules  made  under  the	 proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_15">Article 309</a>  or in  rules made	under an  Act  referable  to
<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_16">Article 309</a>,  for instance,  Rule 19  of the  Central  Civil
Services (Classification,  Control and	Appeal) Rules, 1965.
Rule 14	 of the	 Railway Servants  (Discipline	and  Appeal)
Rules 1968,  and Rule  37 of the Central Industrial Security
Force Rules, 1969, or under such a rule read with one of the
clauses of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_17">Article 311(2).</a>
     The affected government servants assailed the aforesaid
order in  writ petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> in different High
Courts, and some of these writ petitions were allowed on the
basis  of  this	 Court's  decision  in	Divisional  Personal
Officer, Southern Railway &amp; Anr. v. T.R. Challappan [1976] 1
S.C.R. 783, and a few were dismissed.
     Appeals by	 Special Leave	against those judgments were
filed, and  in three  such appeals it was noticed by a three
Judge Bench of this Court that there was a conflict between
134
Challappan's Case and another three Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/701389/" id="a_19">M. Gopala
Krishna Naidu v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> [1968] 1 S.C.R. 355
and directed  that the papers in the three appeals be placed
before the  Hon'ble Chief  Justice for reference to a larger
Bench. These  appeals were thus referred to the Constitution
Bench and  all other similar Appeals and Writ Petitions were
also placed before the Constitution Bench for disposal.
     The arguments  advanced on	 behalf	 of  the  government
servants on  the pleasure doctrine and the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_20">Article 311 (2)</a> were :
     1. The  pleasure doctrine	in England  is a part of the
special prerogative  of the  Crown and had been inherited by
India from  England  and  should,  therefore,  be  construed
strictly against  the Government  and liberally in favour of
government servants.
     2. The  second proviso  which withdraws from government
servants the  safeguards provided  by clause  (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_21">Article
311</a>  must  be  also  similarly	construed,  otherwise  great
hardship would	result to  government servants as they could
be arbitrarily	thrown out of employment, and they and their
dependents would be left without any means of subsistence.
     3. There are several stages before a government servant
can be	dismissed or  removed or  reduced  in  rank  namely,
serving upon  him of  a show-cause notice or a charge-sheet,
giving	him   inspection  of   documents,   examination	  of
witnesses, arguments  and imposition  of penalty. An inquiry
starts only  after a show cause notice is issued and served.
A show cause notice is thus preparatory to the holding of an
inquiry and  even if  the entire  inquiry is dispensed with,
the giving  of	a  show	 cause	notice	and  taking  of	 the
explanation of	the government	servant with respect thereto
are not excluded.
     4. It is not obligatory upon the disciplinary authority
to dispense  with the  whole of	 the inquiry. Depending upon
the circumstances  of the  case, the  disciplinary authority
can dispense with only a part of the inquiry.
     5. Imposition  of penalty	is not a part of the inquiry
and once  an inquiry  is dispensed with, whether in whole or
in part, it is obligatory upon the disciplinary authority to
give an	 opportunity to	 the government	 servant to  make  a
representation with  respect to	 the penalty  proposed to be
imposed upon him.
135
     6. <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_22">Article	 311</a> is subject to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Article 14.</a> Principles of
natural justice and the audi alteram partem rule are part of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_24">Article 14</a>,  and therefore,  a show  cause notice asking for
the explanation	 of the	 government servant  with respect to
the charges  against him as also a notice to show cause with
respect to  the proposed penalty are required to be given by
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_25">Article 14</a>  and not  giving such  notices or  either of them
renders the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank
invalid.
     On behalf of the Union of India it was submitted that:
     1. The  second  proviso  is  unambiguous  and  must  be
construed according to its terms.
     2. Where  the second  proviso of  clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_26">Article
311</a> is	made inapplicable, there is no scope for holding any
partial inquiry.
     3. The very contents of the three clauses of the second
proviso show  that it is not necessary or not practicable or
not expedient that any partial inquiry could be or should be
held, depending upon which clause applies.
     4. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Article	 14</a> does  not govern or control <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_28">Article 311.</a>
The Constitution  must be  read as  a whole.  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_29">Article 311(2)</a>
embodies the principle of natural justice including the audi
alteram partem	rule. Once  the application of clause (2) is
expressly excluded  by the Constitution itself, there can be
no question  of making	applicable what has been so excluded
by seeking recourse to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_30">Article 14.</a>
     5.	 Considerations	  of  sympathy	for  the  government
servants who  may be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank
are irrelevant	to the	construction of	 the second proviso.
The doctrine  of tenure	 at pleasure  in <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_31">Article 310</a> and the
safeguards given  to a	government servant under clauses (1)
and (2)	 of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_32">Article  311</a>  as  also  the	 withdrawal  of	 the
safeguard under	 clause (2)  by the  second proviso  are all
enacted	 in   public  interest	and  where  public  interest
conflicts with	private interest,  the latter  must yield to
the former.
     Allowing  the   Appeals  of  the  Union  of  India	 and
dismissing the	Writ Petitions	and Transferred Cases of the
employees.
^
     HELD: (Per	 Chandrachud,  CJ.  V.D.  Tulzapurkar,	R.S.
Pathak &amp; D.P. Madon JJ. - M.P. Thakkar,J. dissenting)
136
     I. The Pleasure Doctrine in the United Kingdom
     1. The  pleasure doctrine	relates to  the tenure	of a
government servant,  that is,  his right to continue to hold
office. All public officers and servants of the Crown in the
United Kingdom	hold their  appointments at  the pleasure of
the Crown  and their  services can  be	terminated  at	will
without assigning any cause. [166 F]
     2. The  pleasure doctrine is not based upon any special
prerogative of	the Crown  but is based on public policy and
is in  public interest and for public good. The basis of the
pleasure doctrine  is that  the public is vitally interested
in the	efficiency and	integrity  of  civil  services	and,
therefore, public policy requires, public interest needs and
public good demands that civil servants who are inefficient,
dishonest or  corrupt or  have become a security risk should
not continue in service. [166 G]
     3. In  the United	Kingdom, Parliament is sovereign and
can make  any law  whatever and	 the courts have no power to
declare it  void. The pleasure doctrine is therefore subject
to what	 may be expressly provided otherwise by legislation.

A.C. 1111,1118 (P.C.) referred to.
     II. The Pleasure Doctrine in India
     1.	 In   India  the   pleasure  doctrine  has  received
Constitutional sanction	 by being  enacted in <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_33">Article 310(1)</a>
of the Constitution of India. Under <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_34">Article 310(1)</a> except as
expressly provided  in the Constitution, every person who is
a member  of a	defence service or of a civil service of the
Union of India or of any all-India service or holds any post
connected with	defence or any civil post under the Union of
India holds office during the pleasure of the President, and
every person  who is  a member of a civil service of a State
or holds  any civil  post under	 a state holds office during
the pleasure of the Governor of the State. [186 H, 187 E]
137
     2. In India, unlike in the United Kingdom, the pleasure
doctrine is  not subject  to any law made by Parliament or a
State Legislature  but is  subject to only what is expressly
provided in  the  Constitution.	 In  India,  therefore,	 the
exceptions to  the pleasure doctrine can only be those which
are expressly provided in the Constitution. [187 E]
     3. Several	 exceptions to	the  pleasure  doctrine	 are
expressly provided in the Constitution.
     4. <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_35">Article	 311</a>, being  an	 express  provision  of	 the
Constitution, is  an  exception	 to  the  pleasure  doctrine
contained in <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_36">Article 310(1)</a> of the Constitution. Clauses (1)
and (2)	 of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_37">Article  311</a>  restrict  the  operation  of	 the
pleasure doctrine  so far as civil servants are concerned by
conferring upon	 civil servants	 the safeguards	 provided in
those clauses. [179 D]
     5. Under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_38">Article 311</a> no civil servant can
be  dismissed  or  removed  from  service  by  an  authority
subordinate to that by which he was appointed. [179 E]
     6. Under clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_39">Article 311</a> no civil servant can
be dismissed  or   removed from	 service or  reduced in rank
except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the
charges against	 him and  given a  resonable opportunity  of
being heard  in respect	 of such charges. As a result of the
amendment made	by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment)
Act, 1976,  in clause  (2) of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_40">Article 311</a>  it	is  now	 not
necessary to  give to  a civil	servant	 an  opportunity  of
making a representation with respect to the penalty proposed
to be imposed upon him. [179 F,181 E]
     7. An  order  of  compulsory  retirement  from  service
imposed upon  a civil  servant by  way of penalty amounts to
"removal"  from	 service  and  attracts	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_41">Article 311.</a>[180 E, 197 B]
     8.	 Restrictions  on  the	operation  of  the  pleasure
doctrine contained  in legislation made by Parliament in the
United Kingdom	and in clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_42">Article 311</a> in
India are  based on public policy and are in public interest
and for	 public good  in as  much  as  they  give  to  civil
servants a feeling of security of tenure. [182 E-F]
     9. The  safeguard provided	 to civil servants by clause
(2) of	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_43">Article 311</a>  is taken  away when  any of  the  three
clauses of  the second	proviso (originally the only proviso
to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_44">Article 311(2))</a> becomes applicable. [182 D]
138
     10. It  is incorrect  to say that the pleasure doctrine
is a  prerogative  of  the  British  crown  which  has	been
inherited by  India and	 transposed into  its  Constitution,
adapted to suit the Constitutional set up of the Republic of
India. Authoritative  judicial dicta  both in England and in
India, have  laid down	that the  pleasure doctrine  and the
protection afforded  to civil servants by legislation in the
United Kingdom	and by clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_45">Article 311</a> in
India are based on public good. Similarly, the withdrawal of
the safeguard  contained in clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_46">Article 311</a> by the
second proviso to that clause is also based on public policy
and is in public interest and for public good. [191 C-E]
     11. Neither <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_47">Article 309</a> nor <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_48">Article 310</a> nor <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_49">Article 311</a>
sets out  the grounds for dismissal, removal or reduction in
rank or	 for imposition	 of any	 other penalty	upon a civil
servant. These	Articles also  do not specify what the other
penalties are  These matters  are left	to be  dealt with by
rules made  under the  proviso to  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_50">Article 309</a>	or  by	Acts
referable to  that Article  or rules  made under  such Acts.
[191 G]
     12. The  pleasure of  the President  or the Governor is
not to be exercised by him personally. It is to be exercised
by the	appropriate authority  specified in rules made under
the proviso  to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_51">Article	 309</a> or	 by Acts  referable to	that
Article or  rules made	under such Acts. Where, however, the
President or  the Governor, as the case may be, exercise his
pleasure under	<a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_52">Article 310(1</a>), it is not required that such
act of exercise of the pleasure under <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_53">Article 310(1)</a> must be
an act	of the President or the Governor himself but it must
be  an	 act  of  the  President  or  the  Governor  in	 the
Constitutional sense,  that is,	 with the  aid	and  on	 the
advice of the Council of Ministers. [193 E]

mandate to  the principles  of natural	justice and the audi

     rule by  providing that  a civil  servant shall  not be
dismissed or  removed from  service or reduced in rank until
after an  inquiry in  which he	has been  given a reasonable
opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges. [234
E]
     2. The  nature of this inquiry has been elaborately set
out by	this Court  in <a href="/doc/546415/" id="a_60">Khem  Chand v. The Union of India and
Others</a> [1958]  S.C.R.  1980,  1095-97  and  even  after	 the
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, the inquiry
required by  clause (2)	 of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_61">Article  311</a> would	be the	same
except that  it would  not be  necessary to  give to a civil
servant an opportunity to make a representation with respect
to the penalty proposed to be imposed upon him. [235 B]
     3. Apart from <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_62">Article 311</a> prior to its amendment by the
Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment) Act,  1976, it is not
necessary either under the ordinary law of the land or under
industrial law	to give	 a second  opportunity to show cause
against the penalty proposed to be imposed upon an employee.
[243 H]
     4. If  an inquiry	held against  a civil  servant under
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_63">Article 311(2)</a>	is unfair or biased or had been conducted in
such a	manner as  not to  give him  a	fair  or  reasonable
opportunity to	defend himself,	 the principles	 of  natural
justice would  be violated;  but in such a case the order of
dismissal, removal  or reduction  in rank  would be  bad  as
contravening the  express provision  of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_64">Article	 311(2)</a>	 and
there is  no scope for having recourse to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_65">Article 14</a> for the
purpose of invalidating it. [235 C]
     IV. The Second Proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_66">Article 311(2)
     1.</a> The language of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_67">Article 311(2)</a>
is plain  and  unambiguous.  The  key-words  in	 the  second
proviso are  "this clause  shall not  apply".  There  is  no
ambiguity in these words. Where a situation envisaged in any
of the	three clauses  of the  second  proviso	arises,	 the
safeguard provided  to a  civil servant	 by  clause  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_68">Article 311</a> is taken away. [204 C]
     2.	 The   second  proviso	to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_69">Article  311(2)</a>  becomes
applicable an  the three  cases mentioned  in clauses (a) to
(c) of that proviso, namely, (a) Where a person is dismissed
or removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which
has led	 to his	 conviction on	a criminal charge; (b) Where
the authority  empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to
reduce him  in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be
recorded by that
140
authority in  writing, it  is not  reasonably practicable to
hold such  inquiry; and	 (c)  Where  the  President  or	 the
Governor, as  the case	may be,	 is satisfied  that  in	 the
interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to
hold such inquiry. [203 A-C]
     3. The  governing words of the second proviso to clause
(2) of	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_70">Article 311</a>,  namely, "this clause shall not apply",
are mandatory  and not	directory and are in the nature of a
Constitutional	prohibitory   injunction   restraining	 the
disciplinary authority from holding an inquiry under <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_71">Article
311(2)</a> or  from	 giving	 any  kind  of	opportunity  to	 the
concerned civil	 servant in  a case  where one	of the three
clauses of  the second	proviso becomes applicable. There is
thus no	 scope for  introducing into the second proviso some
kind of inquiry or opportunity to show cause by a process of
inference or implication. The maxim "expressum facit cessare
tacitum' ("when	 there is express mention of certain things,
then anything  not mentioned  is excluded")  applies to	 the
case. This  well known	maxim is  a principle  of logic	 and
commonsense and not merely a technical rule of construction.
[213 H-214 A]
     4. The second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_72">Article 311(2)</a> has been in the
Constitution of	 India since  the time	the Constitution was
originally enacted.  It was  not blindly or slavishly copied
from section  240(3) of	 the Government	 of India Act, 1935.
There was  a considerable  debate on  this  proviso  in	 the
Constituent Assembly.  The majority  of the  members of	 the
Constituent Assembly had fought for freedom and had suffered
imprisonment in the cause of liberty and were therefore, not
likely to introduce into our Constitution any provision from
the earlier  Government of India Acts which had been enacted
purely for  the benefit	 of a  foreign imperialistic  power.
They retained  the second  proviso as  a  matter  of  public
policy and  as being  in the  public interest and for public
good. They further inserted clause (c) in the second proviso
dispensing with	 the inquiry under <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_73">Article 311 (2)</a> in a case
where the  President or the Governor, as the case may be, is
satisfied that	in the interest of the security of the State
it is not expedient to hold such inquiry as also added a new
clause, namely,	 clause (3),  in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_74">Article 311</a> giving finality
to the decision of the disciplinary authority that it is not
reasonably practicable	to hold	 the inquiry  under  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_75">Article
311(2).</a> Section	 240 of	 the Government	 of India Act, 1935,
did not	 contain any  provision similar to clause (c) of the
second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_76">Article  311(2)</a> or  clause (3) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_77">Article
311.</a> [215 F-H]

     V. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_83">Article 14</a> and the Second Proviso
     1. The  principles	 of  natural  justice  are  not	 the
creation of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_84">Article 14</a>	 of the	 Constitution. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_85">Article 14</a> is
not the begetter of the principles of natural justice but is
their Constitution guardian.[230 D]
     2. The  principles of natural justice consist primarily
of two	main rules,  namely, "nemo  judex in cause sua" ("no
man shall  be a	 judge in  his own cause") and "audi alteram
partem" ("hear	the other side"). The corollary deduced from
the above two rules and particularly the audi alteram partem
rule was  "qui	aliquid	 statuerit  parte  inaudita  altera,
adguum licet  dixerit, haud  aequum fecerit"  ("he who shall
decide anything	 without the  other side  having been heard,
although he  may have  said what is right will not have done
what is	 right" or  as is  now expressed "justice should not
only be	 done but  should manifestly  be seen  to be done").
These two rules and their corollary are neither new nor were
they the  discovery of English judges but were recognised in
many civilizations and over many centuries. [235 D, 237 G]

     3. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_88">Article	 14</a> applies not only to discriminatory class
legislation but	 also to  arbitrary or	discriminatory State
action. Violation  of a	 rule of  natural justice results in
arbitrariness which is the same as discrimination, and where
discrimination is  the result  of a  State action,  it is  a
violation  of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_89">Article	14.</a>  Therefore,	 a  violation  of  a
principle  of  natural	justice	 by  a	State  action  is  a
violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_90">Article 14.</a> [229 F-G]
     4. The  principles of  natural justice  apply  both  to
quasi judicial as well as administrative inquiries entailing
civil consequences. [233 H-234 A]
     5. It  is well established both in England and in India
that the  principles of	 natural justice yield to and change
with the  exigencies of	 different situations  which are not
alike. They  are neither  cast in a rigid mould nor can they
be put	in a legal strait-jacket. They are not immutable but
flexible and can be adapted, modified or excluded by statute
and statutory  rules as	 also by  the  Constitution  of	 the
tribunal which	has to	decide a  particular matter  and the
rules by which such tribunal is governed. [235 D-F]
     6. If  legislation and  the necessities  of a situation
can exclude  the principles of natural justice including the
audi alteram partem rule, a fortiorari so can a provision of
the Constitution  such as  the	second	proviso	 to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_91">Article
311(2).</a> [238 B]
     7. The audi alteram partem rule having been excluded by
a Constitutional  provision, namely,  the second  proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_92">Article 311(2</a>),	 there is no scope for reintroducing it by a
side-door to  provide once  again the same inquiry which the
Constitutional provision has expressly prohibited. [238 D]
     8. A  right of  making a representation after an action
is taken  against a person has been held by this Court to be
a sufficient  compliance with  the requirements	 of  natural
justice. In  the  case	of  a  civil  servant  to  whom	 the
provisions of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_93">Article 311(2)</a> have been
applied, he has the
143
right of a departmental appeal in which he can show that the
charges made  against him  are not  true, and an appeal is a
wider and  more effective  remedy than	a right	 of making a
representation. [234 C]
     9. The  majority view  in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_94">A. K. Gopalan v. The State of
Madras</a>, [1950]	S. C. R. 88 namely, that particular Articles
governing certain  Fundamental	Rights	operate	 exclusively
without having	any inter-relation with any other Article in
the Chapter  on Fundamental  Rights was disapproved and held
to be not correct in <a href="/doc/1320382/" id="a_95">Rustom Cawasji Cooper v. Union of India</a>
[1970] 3  S.C.R. 530,  its burial service was read in <a href="/doc/608557/" id="a_96">Sambhu
Nath Sarkar  v. The State of West Bengal and Others</a> [1974] 2
S.C.R. 1,  <a href="/doc/1486034/" id="a_97">Haradhan Saha  and another  v. The  State of West
Bengal and  Others</a> [1975]  1  S.C.R.  832  and	its  funeral
oration was  delivered in  Maneka Gandhi's  case,  [1978]  2
S.C.R. 64  and it  is to  be hoped  that the  ghost of	that
majority view  does not	 at some  future time  rise from its
grave and  stand, clanking  its chains, seeking to block the
onward march  of our country to progress, prosperity and the
establishment of a Welfare State. [240 H-241 A]
     10. R.C.  Cooper's	 case  and  the	 other	cases  which
followed it do not, however apply where a Fundamental Right,
including the  audi alteram  partem rule comprehended within
the  guarantee	 of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_98">Article   14</a>,  is	 excluded   by	 the
Constitution. Express  exclusionary provisions	contained in
the Constitution  are <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_99">Article  31A (1</a>), <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_100">Article 31B</a>, <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_101">Article
31C</a>, <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_102">Article 22 (5)</a> and the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_103">Article 311(2)</a>
as regards  the audi  alteram partem rule, namely, affording
an opportunity	of a  hearing  to  a  civil  servant  before
imposing the  penalty of  dismissal, removal or reduction in
rank upon him. [241 B]
     11. The  principles of natural justice must be confined
within their  proper limits and not allowed to run wild. The
concept of natural justice is a magnificant thorough bred on
which this  nation gallops  forwards towards  its proclaimed
and  destined	goal  of   "JUSTICE,  social,  economic	 and
political". This  thoroughbred must  not be  allowed to turn
into a	wild and  unruly house, carrering off were it lists,
unsaddling its	rider, and  bursting into  fields where	 the
sign "no passaran" is put up. [242 D]

     VI. Service Rules and Acts
     1.	 <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_115">Article  309</a>  is  expressly  made  subject  to	 the
provisions of the Constitution. Rules made under the proviso
to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_116">Article  309</a>, Acts  referable to  that Article, and rules
made under such Acts are, therefore, subject both to <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_117">Article
310(1)</a> as  also to  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_118">Article 311.</a>  If any  such rule  or	 Act
impinges upon  or restricts  the operation  of the  pleasure
doctrine embodies  in <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_119">Article  310(1)</a>  except  as  expressly
provided in  the Constitution or restricts or takes away the
safeguards provided to civil servants by clauses (1) and (2)
of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_120">Article  311</a>, It  would be  void and	 unconstitutional as
contravening the  provisions of <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_121">Article 310(1)</a> or clause (1)
or clause  (2) of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_122">Article 311</a>, as the case may be. Any such
Act  or	 rule  which  provides	for  dismissal,	 removal  or
reduction in  rank of  a civil	servant without	 holding  an
inquiry as  contemplated by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_123">Article 311</a> except
in the	three cases  specified in the second proviso to that
clause would  therefore, be  unconstitutional  and  void  as
contravening <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_124">Article 311(2).</a> [243 A-C]
     2. In  the same  way, for	an Act	or a rule to provide
that in	 a case	 where the  second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_125">Article 311(2)</a>
applies, any of the safeguards excluded by that proviso will
be  available	to  a	civil  servant	would  be  void	 and
unconstitutional as  impinging	upon  the  pleasure  of	 the
President or the Governor, as the case may be. [243 E]
     3. A  well-settled rule  of construction of statutes is
that where  two interpretations	 are possible,	one of which
would  preserve	  and  save  the  constitutionality  of	 the
particular statutory  provision while the other would render
it unconstitutional
145
and  void,   the  one	which  saves   and   preserves	 its
constitutionality should  be adopted and the other rejected.
[243 F]
     4. Where  an Act  or a  rule provides that in a case in
which the  second proviso  to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_126">Article  311(2)</a> applies any of
the safeguards excluded by that proviso will be available to
a civil	 servant, the  constitutionality of  such  provision
would be preserved by interpreting it as being directory and
not mandatory.	The breach of such directory provision would
not, however,  furnish any  cause of  action  or  ground  of
challenge to  a civil  servant because at the threshold such
cause of  action or  ground of	challenge would be barred by
the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_127">Article 311(2).</a> [243 G]
     5. Service	 rules may  reproduce the  provisions of the
second	proviso	  to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_128">Article	311(2)</a>	and   authorise	 the
disciplinary authority	to  dispense  with  the	 inquiry  as
contemplated by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_129">Article 311</a> in the three cases
mentioned in the second proviso to that clause or any one or
more of	 them. Such  a provision,  however, is not valid and
constitutional without	reference to  the second  proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_130">Article 311(2)</a> and cannot be read apart from it. Thus, while
the source  of authority of a particular officer to act as a
disciplinary authority	and dispense  with  the	 inquiry  is
derived from  the service  rules, the source of his power to
dispense with the inquiry is derived from the second proviso
to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_131">Article 311(2)</a> and not from any service rule. [243 F-G]
     6. The  omission to  mention in  an order of dismissal,
removal or  reduction in  rank the  relevant clause  of	 the
second proviso	or the	relevant service  rule will not have
the effect  of invalidating the order imposing such penalty,
and the	 order must  be read  as having	 been made under the
applicable clause  of the  second proviso  to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_132">Article 311(2)</a>
read with the relevant service rule. [266 H-267 A]
     7. Rule  37 of  the Central  Industrial Security  Force
Rules, 1969,  is clumsily  worded and makes little sense. To
provide that  a member	of the	Central Industrial  Security
Force who  has been  convicted to rigorous imprisonment on a
criminal charge "shall be dismissed from service" and at the
same time  to provide  that" only a notice shall be given to
the party charged proposing the penalty of dismissal for his
having been  convicted to  rigorous imprisonment  and asking
him to	explain as  to why the proposed penalty of dismissal
should not  be imposed" is a contradiction in terms. To read
these provisions as mandatory would be to render
146
them  unconstitutional	and  void.  These  provisions  must,
therefore, be  read as	directory in order to preserve their
constitutionality. [263 C-G]
     8.	  Rule	  19   of   the	  Central   Civil   Services
(Classification,  Control   and	 Appeal)   Rules,  1965,  is
identical with	Rule 14	 of the Railway Servants (Discipline
and Appeal)  Rules, 1968, and the interpretation of the said
Rule 19	 would be the same as that of the said Rule 14. [256
F-H]
     VII. Challappan's Case
     1. The  three-Judge Bench	of this	 Court in Divisional
Personnel Officer,  Southern Railways  and another  v.	T.R.
Challappan was	in error  in interpreting  Rule	 14  of	 the
Railway Servants  (Discipline and  Appeal) Rules,  1968,  by
itself and  not in  conjunction with  the second  proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_133">Article 311(2).</a> [256 D]
     2. The Court in Challappan's case also erred in holding
that the  addition of  the words "the disciplinary authority
may consider  the circumstances	 of the	 case and  make such
order thereon as it deems fit" in the said Rule 14 warranted
an interpretation of the said Rule different from that to be
placed upon the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_134">Article 311(2).</a> [254 G]
     3. The Court in Challappan's case also erred in holding
that the  addition of  the words "the disciplinary authority
may consider  the circumstances	 of the	 case and  make such
order thereon as it deems fit" in the said Rule 14 warranted
an interpretation of the said Rule different from that to be
placed upon  the second	 proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_135">Article 311(2).</a> It also
erred in  the interpretation  placed by	 it  upon  the	word
"consider" occurring in the above phrase in the said Rule 14
and  in	  taking  the  view  that  a  consideration  of	 the
circumstances of  the case  cannot be unilateral but must be
after hearing the delinquent civil servant would render this
part of the said Rule 14 unconstitutional as restricting the
full exclusionary operation of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_136">Article
311(2).</a> [255 A-C]
     4. The  word "consider"  in its  ordinary	and  natural
sense is  not capable  of the  meaning	assigned  to  it  in
Challappan's case. [255 G]
     5. The  consideration of  the circumstances  under	 the
said Rule  14 must,  therefore,	 be  ex	 parte	and  without
affording to  the concerned  civil servant an opportunity of
being heard. [255 H]
147
     6. The  decision in  Challappan's case  never held	 the
field for  the	judgment  in  that  case  was  delivered  on
September 15, 1975 and hardly was that case reported when in
the next  group of  appeals in	which the  same question was
raised the matter was referred to a larger Bench by an order
made on	 November 18, 1976. The reference was in view of the
earlier decision  of another  three-Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/701389/" id="a_137">M. Gopala
Krishna Naidu v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>. The correctness of
Challappan  Case  was,	therefore,  doubted  from  the	very
beginning. [256 E]
     VIII. Executive Instructions
     Executive Instructions  stand on a lower footing than a
statutory rule. Executive instructions which provide that in
a case	where the  second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_138">Article 311(2)</a> applies,
any safeguard excluded by that proviso would be available to
a civil	 servant would	only be directory and not mandatory.
[265 H]
     IX. The Scope of the Second Proviso
     1. The  three clauses  of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_139">Article
311</a> are	 not intended  to be  applied in normal and ordinary
situations. The second proviso is an exception to the normal
rule and  before any of the three clauses of that proviso is
applied to  the case of a civil servant, the conditions laid
down in that clause must be satisfied. [204 F-205 C]
     2. Where a situation envisaged in one of the clauses of
the second  proviso to	<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_140">Article 311(2)</a>	exists,	 it  is	 not
mandatory that	the  punishment	 of  dismissal,	 removal  of
reduction in  rank should  be imposed  upon a civil servant.
The disciplinary  authority will  first have to decided what
punishment is  warranted by  the facts	and circumstances of
the case. Such consideration would, however, be ex parte and
without	 hearing   the	concerned   civil  servant.  If	 the
disciplinary authority	comes to  the  conclusion  that	 the
punishment which is called for is that of dismissal, removal
or reduction  in rank, it must dispense with the inquiry and
then  decide   for  itself  which  of  the  aforesaid  three
penalties should be imposed. [205 A-B]
     X. Clause (a) of the Second Proviso
     1. In  a case where clause (a) of the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_141">Article 311(2)</a> applies the disciplinary authority is to take
the conviction	of the concerned civil servant as sufficient
proof of
148
misconduct on  his part. It has thereafter to decide whether
the conduct  which had led to the civil servant's conviction
on a  criminal charge  was such as to warrant the imposition
of a  penalty and,  if so,  what that penalty should be. For
this purpose  it must  peruse the  judgment of	the criminal
court  and   take  into	 consideration	all  the  facts	 and
circumstances of the case and the various factors set out in
Chalappan's Case  such as,  the entire	conduct of the civil
servant of  the gravity of the offence committed by him, the
impact which  his  misconduct  is  likely  to  have  on	 the
administration,	 whether   the	offence	 for  which  he	 was
convicted was  of a  technical or  trivial nature,  and	 the
extenuating circumstances,  if any,  present  in  the  case.
This, however,	has to be done by the disciplinary authority
ex parte  and without  hearing the  concerned civil servant.
[267 C-E]
     2. The  penalty imposed  upon the	civil servant should
not  be	 arbitrary  or	grossly	 excessive  or	out  of	 all
proportion to  the offence committed or one not warranted by
the facts and circumstances of the case. [267 H]
     3. Where  a civil	servant goes  to the  office of	 his
superior officer  whom he  believes to	be  responsible	 for
stopping his increment and hits him on the head with an iron
rod, so that the superior officer falls down with a bleeding
head,  and   the  delinquent  civil  servant  is  tried	 and
convicted under <a href="/doc/1440821/" id="a_142">section 332</a> of the Indian Penal Code but the
Magistrate,  instead  of  sentencing  him  to  imprisonment,
applies to  him the provisions of <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_143">section 4</a> of the Probation
of Offenders  Act,  1958,  and	after  such  conviction	 the
disciplinary  authority,   taking  the	 above	facts	into
consideration, by way of punishment compulsorily retires the
delinquent civil  servant under	 clause (i) of section 19 of
the Central  Civil  Services  (Classification,	Control	 and
Appeal) Rules,	1965, it  cannot be said that the punishment
inflicted  upon	    the	  civil	 servant  was  excessive  or
arbitrary. [267 F-G]
     XI. Clause (b) of the Second Proviso.
     1. There  are two	conditions precedent  which must  be
satisfied before clause (b) of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_144">Article
311(2)</a> can  be applied.	 These conditions are (i) there must
exist a	 situation which  makes the  holding of	 an  inquiry
contemplated by	 <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_145">Article 311(2)</a>	 not reasonably practicable,
and (ii) the disciplinary authority should record in writing
its reason  for its  satisfaction that	it is not reasonably
practicable to hold such inquiry.[269 D-E]
149
     2. Whether	 it was	 practicable to	 hold the inquiry or
not must  be  judged  in  the  context	of  whether  it	 was
reasonably practicable to do so. [269 F]
     3. It is not a total or absolute impracticability which
is required  by clause	(b) of	the second  proviso. What is
requisite  is  that  the  holding  of  the  inquiry  is	 not
practicable in	the opinion  of a  reasonable man  taking  a
reasonable view of the prevailing situation. [270 B]
     4. The  reasonable practicability of holding an inquiry
is a  matter of	 assessment to	be made	 by the disciplinary
authority  and	 must  be   judged  in	 the  light  of	 the
circumstances then prevailing. The disciplinary authority is
generally on  the spot	and knows  what is  happening. It is
because the  disciplinary authority is the best judge of the
prevailing situation  that clause  (3) of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_146">Article 311</a> makes
the decision  of the disciplinary authority on this question
final. [270 C]
     5. It  is not  possible to enumerate the cases in which
it would not be reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry.
     Illustrative cases would be
     (a) Where	a civil	 servant,  particularly	 through  or
together with  his associates,	so terrorizes,	threatens or
intimidates witnesses who are going to give evidence against
him with  fear of reprisal as to prevent them from doing so,
or [270 A]
     (b) Where the civil servant by himself or together with
or through  others threatens, intimidates and terrorizes the
officer who  is the disciplinary authority or members of his
family so that he is afraid to hold the inquiry or direct it
to be held, or [270 B]
     (c) Where	an atmosphere  of  violence  or	 of  general
indiscipline  and   insubordination   prevails,	  it   being
immaterial whether  the concerned civil servant is or is not
a party	 to bringing  about such  a situation.	In all these
cases, it must be remembered that numbers coerce and terrify
while an individual may not. [270 C]
     6.	 The  disciplinary  authority  is  not	expected  to
dispense with  a disciplinary inquiry lightly or arbitrarily
or out of
150
ulterior motives  or merely in order to avoid the holding of
an inquiry  or because	the Department's  case	against	 the
civil servant is weak and must fail. [270 C]
     7. The  word "inquiry"  in clause	(b)  of	 the  second
proviso includes a part of an inquiry. It is, therefore, not
necessary that	the situation  which makes the holding of an
inquiry not  reasonably practicable  should exist before the
inquiry is  instituted against	the civil  servant.  Such  a
situation can  also come  into existence subsequently during
the course  of the  inquiry, for instance, after the service
of a  charge-sheet upon	 the civil  servant or	after he has
filed his  written statement  thereto or even after evidence
has been led in part. [271 D-E]
     8. When  at the  commencement of the inquiry or pending
it, the	 civil servant abscards and cannot be served or will
not participate	 in the	 inquiry it  will not  be reasonably
practicable to	afford to  the civil servant and opportunity
of a  hearing or  further hearing. In such cases, the matter
must proceed  ex parte	and  on	 the  materials	 before	 the
disciplinary authority. [271 E]
     9. The  recording of the reason for dispensing with the
inquiry is  a condition	 precedent  to	the  application  of
clause (b)  of the  second proviso. This is a Constitutional
obligation and	if such	 reason is  not recorded in writing,
the order  dispensing with  the inquiry	 and  the  other  of
penalty	 following   thereupon	would	both  be   void	 and
unconstitutional. It  is, however,  not necessary  that	 the
reason should  find a  place in the final order but it would
be advisable  to record	 it in	the final  order in order to
avoid an  allegation that  the reason  was not	recorded  in
writing before	passing the final order but was subsequently
fabricated. [271 G]
     10. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need not
contain details particulars but it cannot be vague or just a
repetition of  the language  of clause	(b)  of	 the  second
proviso. [272 C]
     11. It  is also not necessary to communicate the reason
for dispensing	with the  inquiry  to  the  concerned  civil
servant but  it would  be  better  to  do  so  in  order  to
eliminate the  possibility of  an allegation being made that
the reason was subsequently fabricated. [272 B]
     12. The  obligation to  record the reason in writing is
provided in clause (b) of the second proviso so that the
151
superiors of the disciplinary authority may be able to judge
whether such  authority had exercised its power under clause
(b) properly or not.[272 F]
     13.  It   is,  however,  better  for  the	disciplinary
authority to  communicate to the concerned civil servant its
reason	for   dispensing  with	 the  inquiry  because	such
communication  would   eliminate  the	possibility  of	  an
allegation being  made that the reason had been subsequently
fabricated. It	would  also  enable  the  civil	 servant  to
approach the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_147">Article 226</a> or, in a fit case,
the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_148">Article 32.</a> [272 H]
     14. It  would be  illogical to hold that administrative
work carried  out by  senior officers should be paralysed by
sending them  to other	stations to  hold the  inquiry	just
because a  delinquent civil  servant either  by	 himself  or
along with or through others makes the holding of an inquiry
by the	designated disciplinary authority or inquiry officer
not reasonably practicable. [273 C]
     15. In  a case  falling under  clause (b) of the second
proviso it is not necessary that the civil servant should be
placed under  suspension until	such time  as the  situation
improves and it becomes possible to hold the inquiry because
in such	 cases	neither	 public	 interest  nor	public	good
requires that  salary or  subsistence  allowance  should  be
continued to  be paid  out of  the public  exchequer to	 the
concerned civil servant. In certain cases, the exigencies of
a situation would require that prompt action should be taken
and suspending	a civil servant would not serve the purpose,
and sometimes  not taking  prompt action might result in the
trouble spreading  and the  situation worsening and at times
becoming uncontrolable. Not taking prompt action may also be
construed by the trouble-makers as a sign of weakness on the
part of	 the authorities  and thus encourage them to step up
their activities  or agitation.	 Where such prompt action is
taken there  is an  element of	deterrence in it but this is
unavoidable and	 a necessary concomitance of such an action.
[273 D]
     16. If  an inquiry	 into the  charges against  a  civil
servant is  not reasonably  practicable, it stands to reason
that an	 inquiry into  the question whether the disciplinary
inquiry should	be dispensed  with or  not  is	equally	 not
reasonably practicable. [273 D]
     17. In situations where a large group of members of the
Central Industrial  Security collectively indulge in several
of acts	 of insubordination  indiscipline  and	intimidation
with the
152
common	object	 of  coercing	those  in   charge  of	 the
administration of  the Force  and the  Government to  compel
them to	 grant	recognition  to	 their	Association  and  to
concede their  demands, it  is not possible to particularise
in the	orders of  dismissal the  acts	of  each  individual
member who participated in the commission of these acts. The
participation of  each individual  might be  of a greater or
lesser degree but the acts of each individual contributed to
the creation  of a  situation in  which the  security  force
itself had become a security risk. [291 C-E]
     18. The quantum and extent of the penalty to be imposed
in each	 case would depend upon the gravity of the situation
and the extent to which the acts said to be committed by the
praticular  civil  servants,  even  though  not	 serious  in
themselves, in	conjunction with  acts committed  by others,
contributed to	bringing about the situation. The fact, that
at a particular centre certain civil servants were dismissed
from service  while at	some other  centres they  were	only
removed from  service does  not mean that the penalties were
arbitrarily imposed. [292 A-B]
     XII. Clause (c) of the Second Proviso.
     The expression "security of the State" in clause (c) of
the second  proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_149">Article 311(2)</a> does not mean security
of the entire country or a whole State but includes security
of a part of a State. [275 E]
     2. Security of the State cannot be confined to an armed
rebellion or  revolt for there are various ways in which the
security of  the State	can be	affected such  as  by  State
secrets or  information relating  to defence  production  or
similar matters	 being passed on to other countries, whether
inimical  or   not  to	 India,	 or  by	 secret	 links	with
terrorists. [275 E]
     3. The  way in  which the	security  of  the  State  is
affected may be either open or clandestine. [275 F]
     4. Disaffection  in the  armed forces  or	paramilitary
forces or  the police force would affect the security of the
State. The  importance of the proper discharge of the duties
by members of these Forces and the maintenance of discipline
among them  is emphasised in <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_150">Article 33</a> of the Constitution.
[275 G]
     5. Disaffection  in any  armed force  or  para-military
force  or   police  force   is	likely	 to  spread  because
dissatisfaction and
153
disaffected members  of such  a Force spread dissatisfaction
and disaffection  among other  members of the Force and thus
induce them  not to  discharge their  duties properly and to
commit acts of indiscipline, insubordination or disobedience
to the orders of their superiors. Such a situation cannot be
a matter affecting only law and order or public order but is
a matter  vitally affecting  the security of the State. [276
A-B]
     6. The  interest of  the security	of the	State can be
affected by  actual acts  or even  by the likelihood of such
acts taking place. [277 D]
     7. In  an inquiry	into acts  affecting the interest of
the security of the State, several matters not fit or proper
to be  made public,  including	the  source  of	 information
involving a  civil servant  in such acts, would be disclosed
and thus  in such  cases an inquiry into acts prejudicial to
the interest  of the  security of  the State  would as	much
prejudice the interest of the security of the State as those
acts themselves would. [279 D]
     8. The  condition for  the application of clause (c) of
the second  proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_151">Article 311(2)</a> is the satisfaction of
the President  or the  Governor, as the case may be, that it
is not	expedient in  the interest  of the  security of	 the
State to hold a disciplinary inquiry. [277 D]
     9. Such  satisfaction is not required to be that of the
President or the Governor personally but of the President or
the  Governor,	 as  the   case	 may   be,  acting   in	 the
Constitutional sense. [278 A]
     State of  Rajasthan and  Others etc.  etc. v.  Union of
India etc. etc. [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1, 82., referred to.
     10.  "Expedient"	means  "Advantageous,	fit,  proper
suitable. Where,  therefore, the  President of the Governor,
as the	case may  be, is  satisfied  that  it  will  not  be
advantageous or	 fit or proper or suitable or politic in the
interest of the security of the State to hold an inquiry, he
would be  entitled to  dispense with  it under clause (c) of
the second proviso. [277 F]
     11.  Under	  clause  (c)  of  the	second	proviso	 the
satisfaction reached  by the  President or  the Governor, as
the  case   may	 be,   must  necessarily   be  a  subjective
satisfaction because  expediency involves matters of policy.
[278 G]
154
     12. Satisfaction of the President or the Governor under
clause (c)  of the  second proviso  may be  arrived at	as a
result of  secret information received by the Governor about
the brewing  danger to	the security  of the  State and like
matters. There	are other factors which are also required to
be considered,	weighed and  balanced in  order to reach the
requisite satisfaction	whether holding	 an inquiry would be
expedient or  not. If  the requisite  satisfaction has	been
reached as  a result  of secret	 information received by the
Government, making  known such	information may	 very  often
result in  disclosure of  the source of such information and
once known, the particular source would no more be available
to the	Government. The	 reason for the satisfaction reached
by the	President or  the Governor  under clause  (c) of the
second proviso cannot, therefore, be required to be recorded
in the	order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank nor
can it be made public. [279 E, 280 B]
     13. When  a number	 of members  of the  Madhya  Pradesh
District Police	 Force and  the Madhya Pradesh Special Armed
Force, in  order to  obtain the	 release on  bail of  two of
their colleagues who had been refused bail and remained into
judicial custody  because of an incident which took place at
the annual  Mela attacked  the police  station at  the	Mela
ground, ransacked  it and  forced the  wireless operator  to
close down  the wireless  set and  the situation  became  so
dangerous that	senior district	 and police  officers had to
approach the  judicial Magistrate  at night  to get  the two
arrested constables  released on  bail and, after discussion
at a Cabinet meeting, a decision was taken and the advice of
the Council  of Ministers  was tendered	 to the	 Governor of
Madhya	Pradesh	  who  accepted	 it  and  issued  orders  of
dismissal of  these persons  by applying  clause (c)  of the
second proviso to them it cannot be said that the provisions
of the said clause (c) were not properly applied. [295 E-296
C]
     14. Similarly,  when after	 these members of the Madhya
Pradesh District Police Force and the Madhya Pradesh Special
Armed force  were dismissed,  some other  members  of  these
Forces began  carrying on  an active  propaganda against the
Government, visiting  various places  in the State of Madhya
Pradesh, holding  secret meetings, distributing leaflets and
inciting the  constabulary in  these places  to rise against
the administration  as a  body in protest against the action
taken by  the Government  and,	on  such  information  being
received, there	 were also  dismissed by applying clause (c)
of the	second proviso	to them,  it cannot be said that the
said clause (c) was not properly applied. [296 F-297 B]
155
     A civil  servant who  has been  dismissed,	 removed  or
reduced in  rank by  applying to his case one of the clauses
of the	second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_152">Article  311(2)</a> or  an  analogour
service rule  has  two	remedies  available  to	 him.  These
remedies are;
     (i)  The appropriate  departmental remedy	provided for
	  in the relevant service rules, and
     (ii) if still  dissatisfied, invoking the court's power
	  of judicial review. [216 A-B]
     XIV. Departmental Remedies.
     Service  rules   generally	 provide   for	departmental
remedies by  way of  an appeal,	 revision and  review in the
case of disciplinary action taken against a civil servant.
     2. Sub-clause  (ii) of  clause (c) of the first proviso
to Rule	 25(1)	of  the	 Railway  Servants  (Discipline	 and
Appeal) Rules,	1968, provides that where an inquiry has not
been held,  the revising  authority shall  itself hold	such
inquiry or  indirect such  inquiry to  be  held.  A  railway
servant has  therefore a  right to  demand  in	revision  an
inquiry into  the charges against him subject to a situation
envisaged in  Rule 14  of the  said Rules  not prevailing at
that time. [248 G-H]
     3. Although  a provision  similar to sub-clause (ii) of
clause (c) of the first proviso of the first proviso to Rule
25(1) of  the  Railways	 Servants  (Discipline	and  Appeal)
Rules, 1968,  does  not	 exist	in  the	 rules	relating  to
appeals, having regard to the factors set out in Rule 22 (2)
which are  to be  considered by	 the appellate	authority in
deciding an  appeal, a	provision similar  to the  said sub-
clause (ii)  of clause	(c) of	the first  proviso to  Rules
25(1) should  be  read	and  imported  into  the  provisions
relating to appeals in the said Rules. [249 D-F]
     4. Even  in a  case where at the time of the hearing of
the appeal  or revision,  as the  case may  be, a  situation
envisaged by the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_153">Article 311(2)</a> exists, as
the  civil   servants,	if  dismissed  or  removed,  is	 not
continuing in service and, if reduced in rank, is continuing
in service  with the reduced rank, the hearing of the appeal
or revision,  as the  case may be, should be postponed for a
reasonable length  of time to enable the situation to return
to normal. [273 G]
156
     5. An order imposing penalty passed by the President or
the Governor,  as the case may be, cannot be challenged in a
departmental appeal or revision. [265 D]
     6. A  civil servant  who has  been dismissed or removed
from service  or reduced in rank by applying to his case one
of the clauses of the second proviso of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_154">Article 311(2)</a> or of
an analogous  service rule  has, therefore,  the right	in a
departmental appeal  or revision  to  a	 full  and  complete
inquiry into  the allegations  made against him subject to a
situation envisaged  in the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_155">Article 311(2)</a>
not existing  at the  time of  the hearing  of the appeal or
revision application.  Even in a case where such a situation
exists, he  has the  right to have the hearing of the appeal
or revision application postponed for a reasonable length of
time for the situation to become normal. [273 F]
     7. In  an appeal, revision or review by a civil servant
who has been dismissed or removed from service or reduced in
rank by	 applying to  his case	clause	(a)  of	 the  second
proviso or  an analogous service rule, it is not open to the
civil servant  to contend  that he  was wrongly convicted by
the criminal  court.  He  can,	however,  contend  that	 the
penalty imposed	 upon him  is to  severe or excessive or was
one not	 warranted by  the facts  and circumstances  of	 the
case. If  he is	 in fact  not  the  civil  servant  who	 was
actually convicted  on a  criminal charge, he can contend in
appeal, revision  or review  against such  order of  penalty
that it was a case of mistaken identity. [264 E]
     8. A  civil servant  who has  been dismissed or removed
from service  or reduced  in rank  by applying	to his	case
clause (b)  of the  second proviso  to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_156">Article	311(2)</a> or an
analogous service  rule can claim in appeal or revision that
in inquiry  should be  held with  respect to  the charges on
which such  penalty has	 been  imposed	upon  him  unless  a
situation envisaged  by the  second proviso is prevailing at
the hearing  of the  appeal or revision application. Even in
such  a	  case	the   hearing  of  the	appeal	or  revision
application should  be postponed  for a reasonable length of
time for the situation to return to normal. [264 B]
     9. In  a case  where a civil servant has been dismissed
or removed  from service  or reduced  in  rank	by  applying
clause (b)  of the  second proviso  or an  analogous service
rule to	 him, by  reason of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_157">Article 311</a>, it is
not open  to him  contend in appeal, revision or review that
the inquiry was wrongly dispensed with. [264 G]
157
     10. In  a case where a civil servant has been dismissed
or removed  from service  or reduced  in  rank	by  applying
clause (c)  of the  second proviso  or an  analogous service
rule to	 him, no appeal or revision will lie if the order of
penalty was  passed by	the President  or the  Governor.  If
however,  the	inquiry	 has  been  dispensed  with  by	 the
President or  the Governor and the order of penalty has been
passed by  the disciplinary  authority (a position envisaged
by  clause   (iii)  of	Rule  14  of  the  Railway  Servants
(Discipline and	 Appeal) Rules,	 1968, and  clause (iii)  of
Rule 19	 of  the  Central  Civil  Services  (Classification,
Control and  Appeal) Rules,  1965) a  departmental appeal or
revision will  lie. In such an appeal or revision, the civil
servant can  ask for  an inquiry to be held into his alleged
conduct unless	at the	time of the hearing of the appeal or
revision a  situation to  envisaged by the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_158">Article 311(2)</a>	is prevailing.	Even in such a situation the
hearing of  the appeal	or revision  application  should  be
postponed for  a reasonable length of time for the situation
to become normal. The civil servant, however, cannot contend
in such	 appeal or  revision that  the inquiry	was  wrongly
dispensed with by the President or the Governor. [265 B-E]
     XV. Judicial Review.
     1. Where  a clause	 of the	 second proviso	 to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_159">Article
311(2)</a> or  an  analogous  service  rule	 is  applied  on  an
extraneous ground  or a	 ground having	no relation  to	 the
situation envisaged  in such  clause or	 rule, the action of
the disciplinary  authority in	applying that clause or rule
would be  mala fide and, therefore, bad in law and the court
in exercise  of its  power of  judicial review	would strike
down both  the order  dispensing with  the inquiry  and	 the
order of penalty following thereupon. [273 C-D]
     2. Where  a civil servant has been dismissed or removed
from service  or reduced  in rank  by applying clause (a) of
the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_160">Article 311(2)</a> or an analogous service
rule and he invokes the court's power of judicial review, if
the court  finds that  the penalty  imposed by	the impugned
order is  arbitrary or	grossly	 excessive  or	out  of	 all
proportion to  the offence committed or was not warranted by
the facts  and circumstances of the case or the requirements
of the	particular government service to which the concerned
civil servant  belonged, the  court  will  strike  down	 the
impugned  order.  In  such  a  case,  it  is,  however,	 not
necessary that	the court should always order reinstatement.
The court  can instead	substitute a  penalty which  in	 its
opinion would be just and proper in the circumstances of the
case. If
158
however, the  court finds  that he was not in fact the civil
servant who  was convicted, it will strike down the impugned
order of  penalty and order his reinstatement. [267 G-268 A,
273 F]
     3. In  the	 case  of  a  civil  servant  who  has	been
dismissed or  removed from  service or	reduced in  rank  by
applying clause	 (b) of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_161">Article 311(2)</a>
or an  analogous service  rule, the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_162">Article
226</a> of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_163">Article 32</a> will interfere on grounds
well-established in  law for  the exercise  of its  power of
judicial review	 in matters  where administrative discretion
is exercised. [274 A]
     4. The  finality given  by clause (3) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_164">Article 311</a> to
the  disciplinary  authority's	decision  that	it  was	 not
reasonably practicable	to hold	 the inquiry  is not binding
upon the  court and  the court would consider whether clause
(b) of	the second  proviso or an analogous service rule had
been properly applied or not. [274 B]
     5. In  examining the relevancy of the reasons given for
dispensing with	 the inquiry,  the court  will consider	 the
circumstances	which,	 according   to	  the	disciplinary
authority, made	 it come  to the  conclusion that it was not
reasonably practicable	to hold	 the inquiry.  If the  court
finds that  the reason	are irrelevant, the order dispensing
with the  inquiry and the order of penalty following upon it
would be  void and  the court  will  strike  them  down.  In
considering the	 relevancy  of	the  reasons  given  by	 the
disciplinary authority,	 the court will not, however, sit in
judgment over  the reasons  like a  court of first appeal in
order to  decide whether  or not  the reasons are germane to
clause (b)  of the  second proviso  or an  analogous service
rule. The  court  must	put  itself  in	 the  place  of	 the
disciplinary  authority	  and  consider	 what  in  the	then
prevailing situation a reasonable man acting in a reasonable
manner would  have done.  It will  judge the  matter in	 the
light of  the then  prevailing situation. Where two view are
possible, the court will decline to interfere. [274 C-D]
     6. Where  it is  alleged that  clause (b) of the second
proviso or  an analogous service rule was applied mala fide,
the court will examine the charge of mala fides. A mere bare
allegations of	mala fides  without any	 particulars of mala
fides will  not, however, amount to a plea of mala fides and
requires to be ignored. [280 H]
     7. If  the reasons	 for dispensing with the inquiry are
not
159
communicated to	 the concerned	civil servant and the matter
comes to  court, the  court can	 direct the  reasons  to  be
produced and  furnished to the civil servant and if still no
produced, a presumption should be drawn the reasons were not
recorded in  writing and the impugned order would then stand
invalidated. Such presumption can, however, be rebutted by a
satisfactory  explanation  for	the  non-production  of	 the
written reasons. [272 H-273 A]
     8. Where  a civil	servant is dismissed or removed from
service or  reduced in	rank by	 applying clause  (c) of the
second proviso or an analogous service rule to his case, the
satisfaction of the President or the Governor that it is not
expedient in  the interest  of the  security of the State to
hold an inquiry being a subjective satisfaction would not be
a fit matter for judicial review. [278 F]
     9. It  is not  necessary for  the court  to decide	 the
question whether  the satisfaction  of the  President or the
Governor can  be challenged  on the  ground that it has been
reached mala  fide or  is  based  on  wholly  extraneous  or
irrelevant  grounds  in	 a  case  where	 all  the  materials
including the  advice of  the Council of Ministers have been
produced and  such materials  show that	 the satisfaction of
the President  or the Governor was neither reached mala fide
nor was	 it based  on any  extraneous or  irrelevant ground.
[279 E]
     10. By reason of the express provision of <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_165">Article 74(2)</a>
and <a href="/doc/60543/" id="a_166">Article  163(3)</a> of the Constitution the question whether
any, any if so what, advice was tendered by the Ministers to
the President or the Governor, as the case may be, cannot be
inquired into by any court. [279 F]
     11. Whether  the court  should order  production of the
materials upon	which the advice of the Council of Ministers
to the	President or  the Governor,  as the case may be, was
based in  order to determine whether the satisfaction of the
President or  the Governor  was arrived	 at mala fide or was
based on  wholly  extraneous  or  irrelevant  grounds  would
depend upon  whether the  documents fall within the class of
privileged  documents	and  whether   in  respect  of	them
privilege has been properly claimed or not. [277 G-278 B]
     In re Tulsiram Patel
160
     The Respondent-Tulsiram  Patel was	 a permanent auditor
in  the	 Regional  Audit  Office.  Orders  were	 issued	 for
stopping his  increment for  one year, where-upon he went to
the Regional  Audit Officer demanded an explanation from him
as to  why he  had stopped  his increment, and not satisfied
with the  reply of  the auditor	 officer struck	 him with an
iron  rod,   whereupon	the  officer  fell  down,  his	head
bleeding. The  Respondent was tried and convicted under Sec.
332<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_167"> of	the Indian  Penal Code</a> but the Magistrate instead of
sentencing  the	 respondent  to	 imprisonment,	invoked	 the
provisions Sec.	 4 of  the <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_168">Probation  of Offenders Act</a>, 1958
and released  him for  a period	 of one	 year on executing a
bond of	 good behaviour. The Respondent's appeal against his
conviction was dismissed. [281 F-H]
     The  Controller   General	of   Defence  Accounts,	 the
disciplinary authority,	 imposed  upon	the  Respondent	 the
penalty of compulsory retirement under clause (1) of Rule 19
of the	Civil Service  Rules. The  respondent's departmental
appeal was dismissed. [282 A, D]
     The Respondent  thereafter filed  a Writ  Petition, and
the High  Court relying	 upon Challappan's Case held that no
opportunity had	 been  afforded	 to  the  Respondent  before
imposing the  penalty of  compulsory retirement	 on him	 and
that the impugned order was defective inasmuch as it did not
indicate the  circumstances which  were	 considered  by	 the
disciplinary authority	except the fact of conviction of the
Respondent. [282 E-F]
     The appeal	 of the	 Union of  India  was  allowed,	 the
judgment and  order appealed  against were  reversed and set
aside and  the writ  petition filed by the Respondent in the
High Court is dismissed. [284 A]
     CISF MATTERS
     The respondents  who were members of the CIS Force Unit
at Bokaro  Steel Plant	and were dismissed from service. The
members of this CIS'F Unit at Bokaro had formed an All-India
association and	 one of	 the dismissed person was elected it
General Secretary.  Thereafter a  country-wide agitation was
carried on  for recognition of the association. In June 1979
some of the members went to Delhi to meet the Home Minister.
A demonstration	 was staged  and some  of the  demonstrators
were arrested. At Bokaro Steel Plant the agitation which was
going became aggravated and out of 1900 persons belonging to
CISF Unit Bokaro, about 1000
161
persons	  participated	  in   processions    and    violent
demonstrations. They  indulged in  several acts	 of violence
and created  serious in-discipline.  The agitation  and	 the
violent activity reached serious proportion in the last week
of June 1979 with the result that the Army that to be called
by the	State Authorities  on 23.6.1979,  took up  positions
round the  CISF Lines  and called upon the agitators to give
up charge  of the  Aroury. The agitators refused and started
firing at  the Army, who returned the fire, and the exchange
of fire resulted in the instant death of one Army Major. The
offending CISF members were over powered, and arrested. [284
F-285 D]
     The authorities were of the opinion, that having regard
to the	violent and  disturbed situation  which prevailed in
the Bokaro  Steel Plant,  the collective action of violence,
mass terror  and intimidation and threats to the supervisory
and loyal staff, any inquiry in accordance with Rules 34, 35
and 36	of  CISF  Rules	 1969  or  in  accordance  with	 the
requirements of	 <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_169">Article 311(2)</a>	 would be dangerous counter-
productive  and	  would	 aggravate  the	 existing  dangerous
situation,  the	  delinquent  personnel	 were  dismissed  in
exercise of  the powers conferred by sub-rule (b) of rule 37
of the	CISF Rules  1969 read  with clause (b) of the second
proviso of  clause (2)	of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_170">Article  311</a> of the Constitution.
[288 C-289 A]
     The CIS  Force has	 been constituted under the CISF Act
for  the   better  protection  and  security  of  industrial
undertakings owned  by the  government. The  CIS Force is an
armed Force  and the  security duties to be performed by the
CIS  Force   are  of  vital  importance	 to  the  industrial
production of the country. [289 B, G]
     All the  acts indulged  in by  the members of the Force
virtually amounted  to a  mutiny and how grave the situation
was can	 be judged  from the  fact that	 the army  had to be
called out  and a pitched battle took place between the army
and the members of the Force. [291 A]
     No person	with any  reason or  sense of responsibility
can say	 that in  such a situation the holding of an inquiry
was reasonable and practicable. [291 B]
     The appellate  authority under  the Central  Industrial
Security Force	Rules 1969  was directed  to dispose  of  an
expeditiously as possible such appeals of the members of the
Force as  might still  be pending. Such of those members who
had
162
not  filled  any  appeal,  in  view  of	 their	reliance  on
Challappan's case,  time was  granted  to  them	 to  file  a
departmental  appeal,	and  the   concerned  authority	 was
directed to  condone the  delay in  the filing of the appeal
and to dispose it of on merits.[291 H-292 C]
     RAILWAY SERVICE MATTERS
     Railway Servants  were either dismissed or removed from
service by  applying to	 their cases  either clause  (ii) of
Rule 14	 of the	 Railways Servants  Rules or  clause (ii) of
Rule 14	 read with  clause (b)	of  the	 second	 proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_171">Article 311(2</a>),	 as they were alleged to have been concerned
in incidents  which took  place in  the all-India strikes of
railway employees.  Many of  these employees belonged to the
all-India loco-running	staff. The  railway servants went on
these strikes  with the	 object of forcing the Government to
meet their demands. [292 E-F]
     Railway service  is a public utility service within the
meaning of  clause  (a)	 of  <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_172">section  2</a>	 of  the  Industrial
Disputes Act,  1947 and	 the proper  running of	 the railway
service is  a vital  to the  country. Where,  therefore, the
railway	 employees   went  on	an  illegal  strike  without
complying  with	  the  provisions   of	<a href="/doc/1950513/" id="a_173">section	 22</a>  of	 the
Industrial Disputes  Act  1947,	 and  thereby  committed  an
offence punishable  with imprisonment and fine under <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_174">section
26(1)</a> of  the  said  Act,  and	the  railway  services	were
paralysed, loyal workers and superior officers assaulted and
intimidated, the  country held to ransom, the economy of the
country and  public interest  and public  good prejudicially
affected, prompt  and immediate	 action was  called  for  in
order  to   bring  the	 situation  to	 normal.  In   these
circumstances,	it  cannot  be	said  that  an	inquiry	 was
reasonably practicable	or that	 clause (b)  of	 the  second
proviso to  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_175">Article 311</a>	 was not properly applied. [294 C-F,
295 C]
MADHYA PRADESH POLICE FORCES MATTERS
     Members of	 the M.P.  District  Police  Force  or	M.P.
Special Armed Force were dismissed by orders of the Governor
of Madhya  Pradesh by  applying clause	(c)  of	 the  second
proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_176">Article 311(2).</a> [295 E]
     An incident  took place  on January  18,  1981  at	 the
annual Mela  held at  Gwalior in  which one  man  was  burnt
alive. Some persons including a constable from each of these
two forces,  were arrested and remanded to judicial custody.
On January 20, 1981
163
several members	 of these  two Forces  indulged	 in  violent
demonstration and  rioted at  the Mela	ground demanding the
release	 of  their  colleagues.	 They  attacked	 the  police
station at  the Mela  Grounds, ransacked  it and  forced the
operator to close down the wireless set. [296 D]
     The police	 are the  guardians of Law and order, and if
these guards  turn law-breakers	 and create  violent  public
disorder and incite others to do the same, prompt and urgent
action becomes	necessary and the holding of an inquiry into
the conduct  of each  individual member	 of the police force
would not  be expedient	 in the	 interest of the security of
the State.[297 A-B]
(Per M.P. Thakkar J-dissenting)
     'Challappan's has been rightly decided. And there is no
compulsion to  overrule it - Even if the other point of view
were to	 appear to be more 'attractive' it is neither a good
nor  a	sufficient  ground  to	overrule  'Challappan'.	 The
decision, does	no more	 than enjoin  in the context of Rule
14(1) (a) and therefore, as a logical corollary, also in the
context	 of  Rule  14  (a)  (b)	 of  the  Railways  servants
(Discipline and	 Appeal) Rules,	 1968, that an employee must
atleast be  heard on  one question  of quantum of punishment
before he  is dismissed	 or  removed  from  service  without
holding any  inquiry.  The  ratio  of  the  decision  is  so
innocuous that there is hardly any need to overturn it. [299
F-G]
     Concurrence with  the consequential orders being passed
in these cases and association with the exposition of law in
regard to  the true  meaning and  content of  the  'pleasure
doctrine' and  its implications	 and impact is not possible.

<p id="p_5">     MADON, J. The above Appeals by Special Leave granted by
this Court and the above Writ Petitions filed either in this
Court under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_177">article 32</a>	 of the	 Constitution of India or in
different High	Courts under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_178">Article 226</a> and transferred to

(Forty-second Amendment)  Act, 1976,  the second  proviso to
that clause.
</p><p id="p_6">     The Genesis of the Appeals and Writ Petitions
     To understand  what questions fall for determination by
this Court  in these Appeals and Writ Petitions, it is first
necessary to  sketch briefly  how they have come to be heard
by this Constitution Bench.
</p><p id="p_7">     <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_180">Article  311</a>   of	the   Constitution  confers  certain
safeguards upon	 persons employed  in civil capacities under
the Union of India or a State. The first safeguard (which is
given by  clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_181">Article  311</a>) is  that such  person
cannot be  dismissed or	 removed by an authority subordinate
to that	 by which  he was  appointed. The  second  safeguard
(which is  given by  clause (2)	 of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_182">Article  311</a>) is that he
cannot be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank except after
an inquiry  in which  he has  been informed  of the  charges
against him  and given	a reasonable  opportunity  of  being
heard in  respect of those charges. The second safeguard is,
however, not  available to him when he is dismissed, removed
or reduced  in rank  in any  of the three cases mentioned in
the second  proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_183">Article 311(2).</a> These three cases are
set out	 in clauses  (a) to (c) of the second proviso. Under
clause (a), such person can be dismissed, removed or reduced
in rank	 without any  inquiry on the ground of conduct which
has led to his conviction on a criminal charge. Under Clause
</p><p id="p_8">(b), any  of these  three penalties  can be imposed upon him
where  the  authority  empowered  to  impose  any  of  these
penalties is  satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded
by  that   authority  in   writing,  it	 is  not  reasonably
practicable to	hold such  inquiry. Under clause (c), any of
the above  penalties can  be  imposed  upon  him  where	 the
President or the Governor of a state, as the case may be, is
satisfied that	in the interest of the security of the State
it is not expedient to hold such inquiry.
</p><p id="p_9">     All the  government servants  in the  above Appeal	 and
Writ Petitions	have been  either dismissed  or removed from
service without	 holding any  inquiry. They  have  not	been
informed of  the charges  against them	nor been  given	 any
opportunity of being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">165</span>
heard in  respect of those charges. The penalty of dismissal
or removal,  as the  case may be, has been imposed upon them
under one  or the  other of  the three clauses of the second
proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_184">Article 311(2)</a>  or under  similar  provision  in
rules made under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_185">Article 309</a> or in rules made
under an Act referable to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_186">Article 309</a>, for instance, Rule 19
of the	Central Civil  Services Classification,	 Control and

(Discipline and	 Appeal) Rule  1968,  and  Rule	 37  of	 the
Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 1969, or under such
a rule read with one of the clauses of the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_187">Article 311(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_10">     Aggrieved by  these orders	 of dismissal  and  removal,
several	 government  servants  filed  writ  petitions  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_188">Article 226</a>  of the  Constitution in  different High Courts.
Some of	 these writ  petitions were  allowed, mainly  on the
basis of  a decision of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in
Divisional Personnel  Officer, Southern	 Railway &amp;  Anr.  v.
T.R. Challappan, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 783, given on September 15,
1975, while  a few  were dismissed. Appeals by Special Leave
against those  judgments were  filed in this Court. In three
other similar appeals, namely, Civil Appeals Nos. 1088, 1089
and 1120  of 1975,  another three-Judge	 Bench of this Court
felt that there was a conflict between Challappan's case and
an earlier  decision of	 another three-Judge  Bench of	this
Court, namely,	<a href="/doc/701389/" id="a_189">M. Gopala  Krishan Naidu  v. State of Madhya
Pradesh</a>, [1968]	 1 S.C.R.  355, and directed on November 18,
1976, that  the papers	in those  three	 appeals  be  placed
before the  learned Chief  Justice to  enable him  to  refer
those appeals  to a larger Bench. The said appeals were thus
referred to  the Constitution  Bench. Because  of  the	said
order all  the above  Appeals and  Writ Petitions  were also
placed before  this Constitution Bench. During the course of
the hearing of all these matters by this Constitution Bench,
the said  Civil Appeals	 Nos. 1088,  1089 and  1120 of	1975
were, however,	got dismissed  on March	 29, 1984,  but	 the
above Appeals  and Writ	 Petitions were	 fully heard and are
being disposed of by this Judgment.

     Justice Oliver  Wendell Holmes  in his book "The Common
Law", consisting of lectures delivered by him while teaching

     through many  centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as

     become."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">It will	 not, therefore,  be out  of  place  to	 begin	this
Judgment with a brief historical sketch of the civil service
in India as also of the law applicable to civil servants and
the changes which have taken place in it from time to time.
</p><p id="p_13">     Civil servants,  that is,	persons who are members of a
civil service  of the Union of India or an all-India service
or a civil service of a State or who hold a civil post under
the Union  or a State, occupy in law a special position. The
ordinary law  of master	 and servant does not apply to them.
Under that  law, whether  the contract	of service  is for a
fixed period  or not.  If it  contains a  provision for	 its
termination by	notice, it can be so terminated. If there is
no provision for giving a notice and the contract is not for
a fixed	 period, the  law implies  an obligation  to give  a
reasonable notice.  Where no  notice in the first case or no
reasonable notice  in the second case is given, the contract
is wrongfully  terminated and such wrongful termination will
given rise  to a  claim for damages. This is subject to what
may otherwise  be provided  in industrial  and	labour	laws
where such  laws  are  applicable.  The	 position  of  civil
servants both  in England  and in  India is, however, vastly
different.
</p><p id="p_14">     The Civil Service in England
     Our  civil	 services  are	modelled  upon	the  British
pattern	 though	  in  some   respects  there  are  important
differences  between  the  two.	 In  England,  except  where
otherwise provided  by	statute,  all  public  officers	 and
servants  of  the  Crown  hold	their  appointments  at	 the
pleasure of  the Crown or durante bene placito ("during good
pleasure" or  "during the  pleasure of	the appoint  or") as
opposed to an office held dum bene se gesserit ("during good
conduct"), also	 called quadiu se bene gesserit ("as long as
he shall  behave himself  well"). When a person holds office
during the  pleasure of	 the Crown,  his appointment  can be
terminated at any time without assigning cause. The exercise
of pleasure  by the  Crown can,	 however, be  restricted  by
legislation enacted  by Parliament  because  in	 the  United
Kingdom Parliament is sovereign and has the right to make or
unmake any law whatever
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">167</span>
and all	 that a	 court of  law can  do with an Act passed by
Parliament is  to interpret  its meaning  but not  to set it
aside or  declare it void Blackstone in his Commentaries has
thus  described	  the  unlimited  legislative  authority  of
Parliament(1 Bl., Comm. pp. 160,161):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  "It hath sovereign and uncontrollable authority in
	  the  making	confirming,  enlarging,	 restraining
	  abrogating, repealing,  reviving,  and  expounding
	  laws,	  concerning   matters	 of   all   possible
	  denominations, ecclesiastical	 or temporal, civil,
	  military, maritime,  or criminal"  this being	 the
	  place where  that absolute  despotic power,  which
	  must	in  all	 governments  reside  somewhere,  is
	  entrusted by	the constitution  of these kingdoms.
	  All mischiefs	 and grievances,  operations and the
	  laws, are  within the	 reach of this extraordinary
	  tribunal.  It	  can  regulate	  or  new-model	 the
	  succession to	 the Crown; as was done in the reign
	  of Henry  VIII, and  William III. It can alter the
	  established religion of the land; as was done in a
	  variety of  instances, in the reigns of king Henry
	  VIII and  his three  children. It  can change	 and
	  create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom
	  and of  parliaments themselves; as was done by the
	  act  of   union,  and	 the  several  statutes	 for
	  triennial and	 septennial elections.	It  can,  in
	  short,  do   everything  that	  is  not  naturally
	  impossible; and therefore some have no scrupled to
	  call its  power, by  a figure rather too bold, the
	  omnipotence of  Parliament. True  it is, that what
	  the Parliament  doth, no  authority upon earth can
	  undo."
</blockquote><p id="p_15">Jean  Louis   De   Lolme,   the	  eighteenth-century   Swiss
constitutionalist in  his "Constitution	 de  1	'Angleterre"
("Constitution	of   England"),	 which	 gave  many  on	 the
continent their ideas of one British Constitution, summed up
the position of Parliament in the English constitutional law
in the	following apophthegm  quoted in Dicey's Introduction
to the	Study of  the Law  of  the  Constitution  (see	10th
Edition, p.43):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "It  is   a  fundamental  principle  with  English

	  make a woman a man, and a man a woman."</blockquote>

<p id="p_16">     So	 far   as  the	 pleasure  doctrine  in	 England  is
concerned, Lord Diplock in Chelliah Kodeeswaran v. Attorney-
General of  Ceylon, L.R.  [1970] A.C.  1111, 1118, P.C., has
succinctly stated its position in English law as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  "It	is   now   well	  established	in   British
	  Constitutional theory,  at  any  rate	 as  it	 has
	  developed since  the eighteenth  century, that any
	  appointment	as    a	  Crown	  servant,   however
	  subordinate, is  terminable at  will unless  it is
	  expressly otherwise provided by legislation."
</blockquote><p id="p_17">In practice,  however, a  dismissal would take place only as
the result of well-established disciplinary processes.
</p><p id="p_18">     In recent	years, though  the Crown  still retains	 the
right to  dismiss at  pleasure, the  legal position of civil
servants has  radically changed	 as a result of legislation,
and legally  binding collective	 agreements can	 be  entered
into between  the Crown	 and representative of its staff and
those representatives  can sue	for breach of any conditions
of service  covered by	these agreement.  Further,  a  civil
servant can  bring an  action for unfair dismissal or sue on
his conditions	of service. But just as an ordinary employee
cannot insist  on continuing  in employment, so also a civil
servant cannot	insist	on  continuing	in  employment.	 The
remedy in  both cases  is to  recover damages  for  wrongful
dismissal. (See	 Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition,
Volume 8, Paras 1106 and 1303).
</p><p id="p_19">     The Pre-Constitution Civil Services in India
     It is unnecessary to go back more than two centuries to
trace the  origin and  development of  the Civil  Service in
India. The  East India	Company sent  out to  India its	 own
servants and  so did the Crown, and from the earliest times,
under the  various Charters given to the East India Company,
the Crown  could at  its pleasure  remove any person holding
office, whether	 civil or  military, under  the	 East  India
Company. The  Court of	Directors of  the East India Company
had also  the power to remove or dismiss any of its officers
or servants  not appointed  by the  Crown. <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_190">Section 35</a> of the
Act of	1793 (33 Geo. III. c.52) made it lawful to and for a
King's Majesty,	 his heirs and successors, by any writing or
instrument under  his or their sign manual, countersigned by
the President  of the Board of Commissioners for the affairs
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">169</span>
India, to  remove or  recall any  person holding any office,
employment or  commission, civil or military, under the East
India Company;	while <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_191">section  36</a> of  that Act provided that
nothing contained in that Act should extend, or be construed
to extend,  to preclude	 or take away the power of the Court
of Directors  of the  East India  Company from	removing  or
recalling any of its officers or servants and that the Court
of Directors shall and may at all times have full liberty to
remove, recall	or dismiss  any of such officers or servants
at their will and pleasure in the like manner as if that Act
had not been passed. Similar provisions were made in the Act
of 1833	 (3 &amp; 4 will IV, c.85) by <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_192">sections 74</a> and <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_193">75</a> of that
Act. <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_194">Section  74</a> made  it lawful  "for His  Majesty  by	 any
Writing	 under	 His  Sign   Manual,  countersigned  by	 the
President of  the said	Board of Commissioners, to remove or
dismiss	 any   person  holding	any  office,  employment  or

India, and  to vacate  any Appointment	or Commission of any

remove or  dismiss any of such officers or servants at their

</p><p id="p_20">     By the  end of  the nineteenth century a well-organized
civil service  had developed  in India,	 the control over it
being vested in the executive, and the members of the "civil
service of  the Crown  in India" were governed in the matter
of their  appointments as also the regular of the conditions
of  their   service,  such  as,	 classification	 methods  of
recruitment, pay and allowances, and discipline and conduct,
by rules made by the executive.
</p><p id="p_21">     The Government  of India  Act, 1858  (21  &amp;  22  Vict.,
c.106), which  vested in  the British  Crown the territories
under  the  government	of  East  India"  Company,  repeated
certain sections  of the Government of India Act, 1853 (16 &amp;
17 Vict.,  c.95), in  so far  as they applied to or provided
for the	 admission or  appointment of  persons to  the Civil
Service of  the East  India Company  and conferred  upon the
Secretary of  State in Council the power to make regulations
for the	 admission of  candidates to  the Civil	 Service  of
India as  also	with  respect  to  other  matters  connected
therewith. Three  years later  the Indian  Civil Service  so
envisaged received statutory recognition by the enactment of
the Indian Civil Service Act, 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict., c.54).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">170</span>
<p id="p_22">     The above Acts were repealed by the Government of India
Act of	1915 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. V, c.61). Part VIII of the 1915 Act

aid and advice of the Civil Service Commissioners, the power
to make rules for the Indian Civil Service examination.

India. This was for the first time done by the Government of
India Act,  1919 (9  &amp; 10  Geo. v,  c.101), which introduced
several amendments  in the  1915 Act including the insertion

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">172</span>
<p id="p_32">The Fundamental	 Rules, the  Civil Service  (Classification,
Control and  Appeal) Rules  of 1930  and the  Civil  Service
(Governors Provinces  Classification) Rules are instances of
rules made under authority conferred by <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_198">section 96B</a>. <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_199">Section
96C</a> provided  for the  establishment  of  a  Public  Service

Auditor-General to be appointed by the Secretary of State in
Council	 who  was  to  hold  office  during  "His  Majesty's
pleasure", and	conferred upon	the Secretary  of  State  in
Council the  power to  make rules providing for the Auditor-
General's pay,	powers, duties and conditions of employment.

could be  added to  or withdrawn from the public service and

consultation  with   such  finance  authority  as  might  be
designated in  the rules  being an authority of the Province
or of  the Government of India, according as the post was or
was not	 under the  control of	a  local  Government.  Under

with the  concurrence of  the majority of votes at a meeting
of the Council of India.
</p><p id="p_33">     Thus, after  the 1919  Act, the civil services of India
continued to  be under the control of the Secretary of State
in Council  who was  to regulate by rules the classification
of the	civil services,	 the  methods  of  recruitment,	 the
conditions of  services, pay  and allowances, and discipline
and conduct. Such rules could also provide for delegation of
the rule-making	 power to the Governor-General in Council or
the local Governments or authorize the Indian Legislature or
Local  Legislatures  to	 make  laws  regulating	 the  public
services but only to the extent and in respect of matters as
were prescribed by the rules. Thus, even the power of making
rules as  also the  authority to  the Indian Legislature and
the Local  Legislatures to  enact Acts regulating the public
services was  derived by  delegation of	 power made  by	 the
Secretary of State in Council.
</p><p id="p_34">     What is really material for the purposes of the present
Appeals and  Writ Petitions  is	 that  section	96B  of	 the
Government of  India Act, 1919, for the first time expressly
stated that  every person  in the civil service of the Crown
in India  held office  "during His Majesty's pleasure." This
was, however, made subject to three safeguards, namely-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	  (1)  a civil servant could not be dismissed by any

	  complaint and	 require such  action  to  be  taken
	  thereon as  might appear  to him  to be  just	 and
	  equitable.</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">     The position  which prevailed with respect to the civil
services in  India during the intervening period between the
Government of  India Act,  1919, and the Government of India
Act, 1935  (25 &amp;  26 Geo. V, c.42) was that the top echelons
of the	important services,  especially those  working under
the provincial	Governments, consisted of what were known as
the "all  India services,"  which governed a wide variety of
departments. There  were, in  the first	 place,	 the  Indian
Civil Service  and the Indian Police Service, which provided
the framework  of the administrative machinery. In addition,
there were the Indian Forest Service, the Indian Educational
Service, the Indian Agricultural Service, the Indian Service
of Engineers (consisting of an Irrigation Branch and a Roads
and Buildings  Branch), the  Indian Veterinary	Service, the
Indian Forest  Engineering Service  and the  Indian  Medical
Service (Civil).  The initial appointments and conditions of
service for all these services were made by the Secretary of
State  and   each  officer  executed  a	 covenant  with	 the
Secretary of  State containing	the terms under which he was
to serve.  In addition	to the all-India services there were
the central  services under  the Government of India and the
Provincial  services   in  the	Provinces;  and	 lastly	 the
subordinate  services.	 (See	Indian	 Statutory   (Simon)
Commission Report(1930),  Vol.I, para  290 ff.).  During the
years following	 the 1919  Act it  was decided	that,  as  a
consequence of	the decision  to effect progressive transfer
of power  to Governments  in India,  the number of all-India
services under	the direct control of the Secretary of State
should be  progressively reduced  especially in those fields
of  administration  that  were	transferred  to	 ministerial
control. It was now to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">174</span>
be left	 to the	 Provincial  Governments  to  reorganize  in
gradual stages	the higher  cadres of  their services in the
transferred subjects,  and recruitment	and control  of	 the
Secretary of State in Council were accordingly discontinued.
This policy  resulted by  the early  thirties in  the Indian
Civil Service, the Indian Police Service, the Ecclesiastical
Service and  the civil	branch of the Indian Medical Service
being retained	by the Secretary of State and the rest being
converted  into	  Provincial  services,	  safeguards   being
provided to  secure the	 rights and privileges guaranteed to
officers recruited  earlier to	the all-India services. (See
Report	 of   the   Joint   Select   Committee	 on   Indian
Constitutional Reform, (1934), para 277.)
     The above position received legislative recognition and
sanction under	the Government	of India  Act, 1935 (25 &amp; 26
Geo. v,	 c.42), often cited with the year and chapter of the
Act in	pursuance of  which it	was reprinted,	namely,	 the
Government of  India (Reprinting)  Act, 1935  (26 Geo. V &amp; 1
Edw, VIII,  c.1). Part	X of  the 1935	Act dealt  with	 the
services of  the Crown	in India.  Chapter II of Part X made
provisions with	 respect of  the civil services. <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_203">Section 240</a>
provided for  the tenure  of office  of persons	 employed in
civil capacities  in India  and conferred  upon them certain
statutory safeguards  as regards  dismissal or	reduction in
rank.  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_204">Section	 241</a>  dealt   with  their   recruitment	 and
conditions of  service. Under  that section  power  to	make
appointments was  vested in  respect of	 central services in
the  Governor-General  and  in	respect	 of  the  Provincial
services in the respective Governors. In the same manner the
power to  regulate conditions  of service  of the members of
these services	was conferred  upon the Governor- General or
the Governor,  as the  case may	 be. The Governor-General as
also the  Governor could  authorize such  person as he might
direct to  make appointments  and rules	 with respect to the
conditions of service. Provision was also made for enactment
of  Acts   by  appropriate   Legislatures  to  regulate	 the
conditions of  service of  persons in the civil services. It
is unnecessary	to look into the details of these provisions
as the	federal structure  envisaged by	 the 1935  Act never
came into existence as it was optional for the Indian States
to join	 the proposed Federation and they did not give their
consent thereto.  Chapter III  of Part	X provided  for	 the
setting up  of a  Federal Public  Service Commission  and  a
Public Service Commission for each province. A provision was
also made for two or more Provinces to agree to have a joint
Public	Service	  Commission  or   for	the  Public  Service
Commission of  one of  these Provinces to serve the needs of
the other provinces.

<p id="p_39">     The Civil Services under the Constitution
     Provisions with respect to services under the Union and
the states  are made  in Part  XIV of  the  Constitution  of
India. This Part consists of two Chapters, Chapter I delaing
with services  and Chapter  II dealing	with Public  Service
Commission for	the Union  and the  State. <a href="/doc/5988/" id="a_211">Article  308</a>,  as
originally enacted, defined

the expression	"State" occurring  in Part  XIV as  meaning,
unless the context otherwise required, "a State specified in
Part A or B of the First Schedule." This Article was amended
by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, which was
passed in  order to  implement the scheme for reorganization
of States.  The amended <a href="/doc/5988/" id="a_212">Article 308</a> provides, "In this Part,
unless	the   context  otherwise  requires,  the  expression
'State' does  not include  the State  of Jammu and Kashmir."
<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_213">Article 309</a>  provides  for  recruitment	 and  conditions  of
service of persons serving the Union or a State, <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_214">Article 310</a>
for the	 tenure of  office of  such persons, and <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_215">Article 311</a>
for the	 mode of  dismissal removal  or reduction in rank of
persons employed  in civil  capacities under  the Union or a

alia provides  that where  the Council of State has declared
by resolution  supported by  not less than two-thirds of the
members present and voting that it is necessary or expedient

provide for  the creation  of one or more all-India services
common to  the Union and the States and subject to the other
provisions  of	 Chapter  I  regulate  the  recruitment	 and
conditions of  service of  persons  appointed  to  any	such
service;  and	it  further   provides	 that	the   Indian
Administrative Service	and the	 Indian Police Service shall

the Constitution  as an	 all-India service  or as service or

</blockquote><p id="p_47">From the  original and	amended <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_224">Article 311</a> set out above it
will be noticed that of the original <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_225">Article 311</a> only clause
(1) remains  unaltered, while  both the	 other clauses	have
become	the   subject  of   Constitutional  amendments.	  No
submission was	founded by  either party on the substitution
of  the	  present  clause   (3)	 for  the  original  by	 the
Constitution  (Fifteenth   Amendment)  Act,  1963,  for	 the
obvious reason that such substitution was made only in order
to bring  clause  (3)  in  conformity  with  clause  (2)  as
substituted by the said <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_226">Amendment Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_48">     A comparison  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_227">Article  311</a> of  the Constitution with
section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935, shows that
the safeguards provided to civil servants by <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_228">Article 311</a> are
very much  the same  as those  under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_229">section  240</a> with	this
difference that	 while <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_230">Article	311</a> also  affords safeguards
against removal	 from service  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_231">section 240</a> did not. Further,
though the  proviso to	<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_232">section 240(3)</a> is reproduced in what
originally was	the only  proviso  and	is  now	 the  second
proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_233">Article 311	 (2</a>), an  additional clause, namely,
clause (c)  has been  added thereto.  A provision similar to
clause	(3)   of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_234">Article  311</a>	was  also  absent  from	 the
Government of  India Act,  1935. Thus, while on the one hand
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_235">Article	 311</a>  enlarges	the  protection	 afforded  to  civil
servants, on  the other	 hand it increases by one the number
of cases in which that protection can be withdrawn.

<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_237">Article 311 (2)</a> may be sketched in broad outlined as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">	  (1) The  pleasure doctrine in England is a part of
	  the special  prerogative of the Crown and has been
	  inherited  by	  India	 from  England	and  should,
	  therefore,  be   construed  strictly,	  that	 is,
	  strictly against  the Government  and liberally in
	  favour of government servants.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">	  (2)  The   second  proviso  which  withdraws	from
	  government servants  the  safeguards	provided  by
	  clause (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_238">Article  311</a> must be also similarly
	  construed for,  unless a liberal construction were
	  placed upon  it, great  hardship would  result  to
	  government servants  as they	could be arbitrarily
	  thrown  out  of  employment  and  they  and  their
	  dependents would  be left  without  any  means  of
	  subsistence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">	  (3) There  are several  stages before a government
	  servant can  be dismissed or removed or reduced in
	  rank, namely,	 serving upon  him of  a show  cause
	  notice or a charge-sheet, giving him inspection of
	  documents, examination of witnesses, arguments and
	  imposition of	 penalty.  An  inquiry	starts	only
	  after a  show cause  notice is  issued and  served
	  upon a  government servant. A show cause notice is
	  thus preparatory  to the holding of an inquiry and
	  even if  the entire inquiry is dispensed with, the
	  giving of  a show  cause notice and asking for the
	  explanation of the government servant with respect
	  there to are not excluded.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	  (4) It  is not  obligatory upon  the	disciplinary
	  authority  to	 dispense  with	 the  whole  of	 the
	  inquiry. Depending  upon the	circumstances of the
	  case, the disciplinary authority can dispense with
	  only a part of the inquiry.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">184</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">	  (5) Imposition  of penalty  is not  a part  of the
	  inquiry and  once an	inquiry is  dispensed  with,
	  whether in whole or in part, it is obligatory upon
	  the disciplinary  authority to give an opportunity
	  to the government servant to make a representation
	  with respect to the penalty proposed to be imposed
	  upon him.

	  given by  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_242">Article 14</a>	and the	 not giving  of such

<p id="p_51">     The submissions  on behalf of the Union of India can be
thus summarized :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">	  (1) The second proviso must be construed according
	  to its terms. It is unambiguous and does not admit
	  of any  such interpretation  as canvassed  for  on
	  behalf of the government servants.

	  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_243">Article 311</a>  is made	inapplicable,  there  is  no
	  scope for holding any partial inquiry.
	  (3) In  any event,  the very contents of the three
	  clauses of  the second proviso show that it is not
	  necessary or not practicable or not expedient that
	  any partial  inquiry could  be or  should be held,
	  depending upon which clause applies.
	  (4) <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_244">Article  14</a> does not govern or control Article
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">	  311. The  Constitution must  be read	as a  whole.
	  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_245">Article 311(2)</a>  embodies the principles of natural
	  justice including the audi alteram partem rule. It
	  thus	expressly  states  what	 is  required  under
	  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_246">Article 14</a>  as  a  result  of	 the  interpretation
	  placed upon  it by recent decisions of this Court.
	  Once the  application of  clause(2)  is  expressly

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">185</span>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_52">	  (5) Consideration  of sympathy  for the government
	  servants  who	 may  be  dismissed  or	 removed  or

	  of the  second proviso.  The doctrine of tenure at
	  pleasure in  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_248">Article 310</a>  and the safeguards given
	  to a	government servant under clauses (1) and (2)

	  the latter must yield to the former.</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">     The Pleasure Doctrine
     The concept  of civil  service is	not now or of recent
origin. Governments  - whether	monarchial,  dictatorial  or
republican -  have to  function; and  for  carrying  on	 the
administration and  the varied functions of the government a
large number  of persons  are required	and have always been
required, whether  they are  constituted in  the form  of  a
civil service or not. Every kingdom and country of the world
throughout history  had a  group of  persons who  helped the
ruler to  administer the  land, whether	 according to modern
notions we  may call  that group  a civil  service  or	not,
because it  is not  possible for  one man by himself to rule
and govern  the land  and look	after and  supervise all the
details of  administration. As it was throughout history, so
it has been in England and in India.
</p><p id="p_53">     In England,  all public  officers and  servants of	 the
Crown hold  their appointments	at the pleasure of the Crown
and  their  services  can  be  terminated  at  will  without
assigning  any	 cause.	 By  the  expression  "the  pleasure
doctrine" is  conveyed this  right of  the Crown. This right
is, however,  subject to  what may  be provided otherwise by
legislation passed  by	Parliament  because  in	 the  United
Kingdom, Parliament has legislative sovereignty.
</p><p id="p_54">     The Foundations  of modern European civil services were
laid in	 Prussia in  the  late	seventeenth  and  eighteenth
centuries and  by Napoleon's development of highly organized
hierarchy  (a	model  copied	by  many  countries  in	 the
nineteenth century);  and  they	 are  the  basis  of  modern
European civil	services. In  England  civil  servants	were
originally the monarch's personal servants and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">186</span>
members of  the King's household. Clive's creation from 1765
of a  civil service  to govern	such parts  of India as were
under the  dominion of the East India Company and Macaulay's
report on  recruitment to  the Indian Civil Service provided
the inspiration	 for the  report of 1854 on the organization
of the	permanent civil service in Britain which recommended
recruitment by	open competitive  examination, the selection
of  higher   civil  servants   on  the	 basis	of   general
intellectual attainment,  and the  establishment of  a Civil
Service Commission to ensure proper recruitment.
</p><p id="p_55">     In the  United  Kingdom,  until  about  the  middle  of
November 1981,	the Civil  Service Department, which was set
up in  1968 with  the Prime  Minister, as  Minister for	 the
Civil Service,	as its Head, looked after the management and
personnel functions  in connection  with the  Civil  Service
which were  until then	being looked  after by the Treasury.
These functions included the organization and conduct of the
Civil Service  and the	remuneration, conditions of service,
expenses and  allowances of  persons serving  in it; mode of
recruitment of	persons to  the Civil  Service; the  pay and
allowances of,	and the	 charges payable  by, members of the
armed forces;  with certain  exceptions, superannuation	 and
injury payments, compensation for loss of employment or loss
or diminution  of emoluments or pension rights applicable to
civil servants	and others  in	the  public  sector  and  to
members of  the armed  forces; the exercise by other persons
and bodies of powers to determine, subject to the minister's
sanction, the  pay or  conditions of  service of  members of
public bodies  (excluding judicial  bodies), or the numbers,
pay or	conditions of  service of  staff  employed  by	such
bodies or  by the  holders of  certain non-judicial offices;
and the	 appointment or	 employment  and  the  remuneration,
conditions of  service, personal  expenses or  allowances of
judges and  judicial staff  (See Halsbury's Laws of England,
Fourth Edition, Volume 8, para 1162).
</p><p id="p_56">     The Permanent Secretary to the Civil Service Department
was the	 Head of  the Home  Civil Service and gave advice to
the  Prime   Minister  as  to  civil  service  appointments,
decorations,  etc.   The  Civil	  Service  Departments	 was
abolished on  November 12,  1981, and its functions, instead
of reverting  to the  Treasury,	 were  divided	between	 the
Treasury and  the newly	 created  Management  and  Personnel
Office.
</p><p id="p_57">     In	 India,	  the	pleasure   doctrine   has   received
constitutional sanction	 by being enacted in <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_250">Article 310(1).</a>
Unlike in  the United  Kingdom in India it is not subject to
any law made by Parliament
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">187</span>
but is	subject only  to what  is expressly  provided by the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_58">     The pleasure  doctrine  relates  to  the  tenure  of  a
government servant.  "Tenure" means  "manner, conditions  or
term of	 holding something" according to Webster's Third New
International Dictionary,  and	"terms	of  holding;  title;
authority" according  to the  Oxford English Dictionary. It,
therefore, means the period for which an incumbent of office
holds it.  It is  for this  reason that the statement of law
relating to  the pleasure  doctrine in	England is  given in
Halsbury's Laws	 of England,  Fourth Edition, Volume 8, Para
1106, under the heading "Tenure of office".
</p><p id="p_59">     The  first	  time	that   a  statute  relating  to	 the
government of India provided that civil servants hold office
during His  Majesty's pleasure	was the	 Government of India
Act of 1919 in <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_251">section 96B</a> of that Act. The marginal note to
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_252">section 96B</a>  did not,  however, refer to the tenure of civil
servants but  stated "The Civil Services of India". This was
because <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_253">section	 96B</a> in	 addition to dealing with the tenure
of civil  servants also dealt with matters relating to their
recruitment,  conditions   of  service,	  pay,	 allowances,
pensions, etc.	The marginal  note to  section	240  of	 the
Government of  India Act,  1935,  however,  was	 "Tenure  of
office of  persons employed  in civil  capacities in India".
The marginal  note to  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_254">Article 310</a>  of the Constitution also
refers to  "tenure" and	 states "Tenure of office or persons
serving the  Union or  a State".  Thus, it  is the tenure of
government servants  which <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_255">Article  310(1)</a> makes  subject to
the pleasure  of the  President or  the Governor of a State,
except as expressly provided by the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_60">     While it  was vehemently  contended on  behalf  of	 the
government servants that the pleasure doctrine is a relic of
the feudal  age -  a part  of the special prerogative of the
Crown -	 which was  imposed upon  India by an Imperial power
and thus is an anachronism in this democratic, socialist age
and  must,  therefore,	be  confined  within  the  narrowest
limits, it  was submitted  on behalf  of the  Union of India
that this doctrine was a matter of public policy, and it was
in public  interest and	 for public  good that	the right to
dismiss at  pleasure  a	 government  servant  who  has	made
himself unfit  to continue  in	office,	 albeit	 subject  to
certain safeguards,  should exist  and be exercisable in the
Constitutional sense  by the  Crown in	England and  by	 the
President or  the Governor  of a  State in  India. It is not
possible to  accept the	 arguments advanced on behalf of the
government servants for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">188</span>
all the authoritative judicial dicta are to the contrary. As
pointed out by Lord Hobhouse in Shenton v. Smith, L.R.[1895]
A.C. 229  J.C., the  pleasure doctrine	is founded  upon the
principle that	the  difficulty	 which	would  otherwise  be
experienced in	dismissing those whose continuance in office
is detrimental	to the	State would  be such as seriously to
impede the  working of	the public  service. In	 Dunn v. The
Queen, L.R.  [1896] Q.B.D. 116; s.c. [1895-96] 73 L.T.R. 695
and sub nomine Dunn v. Regem in [1895-99] All E.R. Rep. 907,
the Court  of Appeal  in England held that it was an implied
term of	 every contract	 of service  that  servants  of	 the
Crown, civil  as well  as military,  except in	special case
where it  is otherwise	provided by  law, hold their offices
only during  the pleasure  of the  Crown. In  that case Lord
Herschell observed (pages 119-120) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">	  It seems  to me  that it  is the  public  interest
	  which has  led to  the term which I have mentioned
	  being imported  into contracts  for employment  in
	  the service  of the  Crown. The  cases cited	shew
	  that, such  employment being	for the	 good of the
	  public, it  is essential  for the public good that
	  it should  be capable	 of being  determined at the
	  pleasure  of	 the  Crown,   except	in   certain
	  exceptional cases  where it  has been deemed to be
	  more for  the public	good that  some restrictions
	  should be  imposed on	 the power  of the  Crown to
	  dismiss its servants."
</blockquote><p id="p_61">(Emphasis supplied)
	  In the same case Kay, L.J., said (page 120)
	  "It seems to me that the continued employment of a
	  civil	 servant   might  in   many  cases   be	 `as
	  detrimental to  the interests	 of the State as the
	  continued employment of a military officer."
     In this  case as  reported in  the	 Law  Times  Reports
series the judgments of the three learned judges who decided
the case  (Lord Esher,	M.R., being the third judge), though
in substance  the same, are given in very different language
and the	 passages extracted  above do  not  appear  in	that
report. The  report of	the case  in  the  All	England	 Law
Reports Reprint	 series is  with very  minor variations	 the
same as	 the report  in the  Times Law	Reports	 series	 but
somewhat abridged.  This is  because  the  All	England	 Law
Reports Reprint series is a revised and annotated reprint of
a selection from the Law Times Reports for the years 1843 to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">189</span>
1935. The  report from which the above extracts are given is
the  one   in  the  Law	 Reports  series  published  by	 the
Incorporated Council  of Law Reporting which was established
in 1865 and which report is, therefore, more authoritative.
In Gould  v. Stuart,  L.R. [1896]  A.C. 575,578-9  J.C., the
Judicial Committee  of the  Privy Council  further held that
where  by   regulations	 a   civil  service  is	 established
prescribing qualifications for its members and imposing some
restriction on	the power  to dismiss them, such regulations
should be  deemed to  be  made	for  the  public  good.	 The
position that  the pleasure  doctrine is  not based upon any
special prerogative  of the Crown but upon public policy has
been accepted by this Court in <a href="/doc/1540511/" id="a_256">The States of Uttar Pradesh &amp;
Ors. v.	 Babu Ram Upadhya</a>, [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679, 696 and Moti
Ram Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon,
Pandu etc.,  [1964] 5 S.C.R. 683, 734-5. This Court has also
accepted the  principle that  society has an interest in the
due discharge  of their	 duties by  government servants.  <a href="/doc/1888316/" id="a_257">In
Roshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of	 India</a>, [1968] 1 S.C.R. 185,
Ramaswami, J., speaking for the Court said (at page 195) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">	  "It is  true that the origin of Government service
	  is contractual.  There is  an offer and acceptance
	  in every  case. But  once appointed to his post or
	  office the  Government servant  acquires a  status
	  and his  rights  and	obligations  are  no  longer
	  determined by	 consent of  both  parties,  but  by
	  statute or statutory rules which may be framed and
	  altered unilaterally	by the	Government. In other
	  words, the  legal position of a Government servant
	  is more  one of status that of contract. The Hall-
	  mark of  status  is  the  attachment	to  a  legal
	  relationship of  rights and  duties imposed by the
	  public law  and  not	by  mere  agreement  of	 the
	  parties. The	emolument of  the Government servant
	  and his  terms of  service are governed by statute
	  or  statutory	 rules	which  may  be	unilaterally
	  altered by  the Government  without the consent of
	  the employee.	 It is true that <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_258">Article 311</a> imposes
	  constitutional  restrictions	upon  the  power  of
	  removal granted  to the President and the Governor
	  under <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_259">Article	 310.</a> But  it is  obvious  that	 the
	  relationship	between	  the  Government   and	 its
	  servant  is  not  like  an  ordinary	contract  of
	  service between  a master  and servant.  The legal
	  relationship	is   something	entirely  different,
	  something in the nature of status. It is much more
	  than a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">190</span>
	  purely   contractual	  relationship	 voluntarily
	  entered into	between the  parties. The  duties of
	  status are fixed by the law and in the enforcement
	  of these  duties society  has an  interest. In the
	  language of jurisprudence status is a condition of
	  membership of	 a group  of which powers and duties
	  are exclusively  determined  by  law	and  not  by
	  agreement between the parties concerned."
</blockquote><p id="p_62">(Emphasis supplied)
     Ministers frame  policies and  legislatures enact	laws
and lay	 down the  mode in  which such	policies are  to  be
carried out  and the  object of the legislation achieved. In
many cases,  in a  Welfare State such as ours, such policies
and statutes  are  intended  to	 bring	about  socioeconomic
reforms	 and  the  uplift  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged
classes. From  the nature  of things the task of efficiently
and effectively	 implementing these policies and enactments,
however, rests	with the  civil	 services.  The	 public	 is,
therefore  ;   vitally	interested  in	the  efficiency	 and
integrity of  such services.  Government servants  are after
all  paid  from	 the  public  exchequer	 to  which  everyone
contributes either by way of direct or indirect taxes. Those
who are	 paid by  the public and are charged with public and
administration for  public good	 must, therefore,  in  their
turn bring  to the  discharge of  their duties	a  sense  of
responsibility. The efficiency of public administration does
not depend  only upon the top echelons of these services. It
depends as much upon all the other members of such services,
even on	 those in  the most subordinate posts. For instance,
railways do  not run  because of  the members of the Railway
Board or  the General  Managers of different railways or the
heads	of    different	  departments	 of   the    railway
administration. They  run also	because	 of  engine-drivers,
fireman, signalmen, booking clerks and those holding hundred
other similar posts. Similarly, it is not the administrative
heads who  alone can  set to  the proper  functioning of the
post  and   telegraphs	service.   For	a   service  to	 run
efficiently there  must, therefore, be a collective sense of
responsibility. But  for a  government servant	to discharge
his duties  faithfully and  conscientiously, he	 must have a
feeling of  security of	 tenure. Under our Constitution this
is provided for by the Acts and rules made under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_260">Article 309</a>
as also	 by the	 safeguards in respect of the punishments of
dismissal, removal  or reduction in rank provided in clauses
(1) and	 (2) of	 <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_261">Article 311.</a>  It is,  however, as  much  in
public interest and for public good that government servants
who are	 inefficient, dishonest	 or corrupt or have become a
security risk
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">191</span>
should not  continue in	 service  and  that  the  protection
afforded to  them by  the Acts	and rules made under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_262">Article
309</a> and	 by <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_263">Article  311</a>  be  not  abused  by  them  to	 the
detriment  of  public  interest	 and  public  good.  When  a
situation as  envisaged in  one of  the three clauses of the
second proviso	to clause  (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_264">Article 311</a> arises and the
relevant clause	 is properly  applied and  the	disciplinary
inquiry dispensed  with, the  concerned	 government  servant
cannot be  heard to  complain that  he is  deprived  of	 his
livelihood. The	 livelihood of	an individual is a matter of
great concern  to him and his family but his livelihood is a
matter of  his private interest and where such livelihood is
provided by the public exchequer and the taking away of such
livelihood is  in the  public interest	and for public good,
the former  must yield	to the	latter.	 These	consequences
follow not  because  the  pleasure  doctrine  is  a  special
prerogative of the British Crown which has been inherited by
India and  transposed into  our Constitution adapted to suit
the Constitutional set up of our Republic but because public
policy requires,  public  interest  needs  and	public	good
demands that there should be such a doctrine.
</p><p id="p_63">     It is thus clear that the pleasure doctrine embodied in
<a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_265">Article 310  (1</a>), the  protection afforded to civil servants
by clauses  (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_266">Article 311</a> and the withdrawal of
the protection under clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_267">Article 311</a> by the second
proviso thereto	 are all provided in the Constitution on the
ground of  public policy  and in the public interest and are
for public good.
</p><p id="p_64">     The Scope of the Pleasure Doctrine.
</p><p id="p_65">     While under  section 96B(1)  of the Government of India
Act of	1919 the  holding of  office in the civil service of
the  Crown  in	India  during  His  Majesty's  pleasure	 was
"Subject to  the provisions  of this  Act and the rules made
thereunder", under section 240(1) of the Government of India
Act, 1935,  the holding	 of such office during His Majesty's
pleasure was  "Except as  expressly provided  by this  Act".
Similarly, the	pleasure  doctrine  as	enacted	 in  <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_268">Article
310(1)</a> is not an absolute one and is not untrammeled or free
of all	fetters, but  operates "Except as expressly provided
by this	 Constitution." The  constitutional restrictions  on
the exercise  of pleasure  under <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_269">Article  310(1)</a> other	than
those contained	 in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_270">Article 311</a> will be considered later but
what is	 immediately  relevant	is  the	 group	of  Articles
consisting  of	Articles  309,	310  and  311.	These  three
Articles are interlinked and form an integrated whole. There
is an organic and thematic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">192</span>
unity running  through them  and it  is now necessary to see
the interplay of these three Articles.
</p><p id="p_66">     These Articles  occur in  Chapter I  of Part XIV of the
Constitution. Part XIV is entitled "Services under the Union
and  the   States"  and	  Chapter  I   thereof	is  entitled
"Services". While <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_271">Article 309</a> deals with the recruitment and
conditions of  service of  persons appointed  to the  public
services and  posts in	connection with	 the affairs  of the
Union or  a State,  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_272">Article 310</a>	 deals with  the  tenure  of
office or  members of  the defence  services  and  of  civil
services of  the  Union	 and  the  States  and	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_273">Article	 311</a>
provides certain  safeguards to	 persons employed  in  civil
capacities under  the Union or a State but not to members of
the defence  services. The  first thing which is required to
be noticed  about <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_274">Article  309</a> is  that it  itself makes  no
provision  for	recruitment  or	 conditions  of	 service  of
government servants  but confers  power upon the appropriate
Legislature to	make laws  and upon  the President  and	 the
Governor of  a State  to make  rules  in  respect  of  these
matters. The  passing of these Acts and the framing of these
rules are,  however, made "Subject to the provisions of this
Constitution." This  phrase which preceeds and qualifies the
power conferred	 by <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_275">Article  309</a> is  significantly different
from the  qualifying  phrase  in  <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_276">Article  310(1)</a>  which  is
"Except as expressly provided by this Constitution".
</p><p id="p_67">     With reference  to the  words "conditions	of  service"
occurring in  section 243  of the  Government of  India Act,
1935,  under   which  the   conditions	of  service  of	 the
subordinate ranks of the various police forces in India were
to be  determined by or under Acts relating to those forces,
the Judicial  Committee of  the Privy Council held in <a href="/doc/131825/" id="a_277">North-
West Frontier Province v. Suraj Narain Anand, L.R</a>. [1947-48]
75  I.A.,   342,  352-3,   that	 this	expression  included
provisions which  prescribed the  circumstances under  which
the employer  would be	entitled to terminate the service of
an employee,  whether such provisions were constitutional or
statutory.
</p><p id="p_68">     <a href="/doc/303704/" id="a_278">In State  of Madhya  Pradesh &amp;  Ors. v.  Shardul Singh</a>,
[1970] 3  S.C.R.  302,	305-6,	this  Court  held  that	 the
expression  "conditions	  of  service"	 means	 all   those
conditions which  regulate the holding of a post by a person
right from  the time of his appointment until his retirement
and even  beyond it  in matters	 like pension etc. and would
include the  right to  dismiss such  persons  from  service.
Thus, as  pointed out  in <a href="/doc/1876971/" id="a_279">Sardari  Lal v.  Union of  India &amp;
Ors</a>., [1971] 3 S.C.R. 461, 465, a law can be

appropriate executive  under  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_280">Article  309</a>  prescribing	 the
procedure and  the authority by whom disciplinary action can
be taken  against a  government servant.  Thus the functions
with respect  to the  civil service  which in  England until
1968 were  being performed by the Treasury and thereafter by
the Civil  Service Department and from mid-November 1981 are
being performed	 partly by  the Treasury  and partly  by the
Management &amp; personnel Office are in India under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_281">Article 309</a>

Deka's case (supra), if any such Act or rule trespasses upon
the rights guaranteed to government servants by <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_283">Article 311</a>,
it would  be void.  Similarly, such  Acts and  rules  cannot
abridge or  restrict the  pleasure of  the President  or the
Governor of a State exercisable under <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_284">Article 310(1)</a> further
than what  the Constitution  has expressly done. In the same
way, such  Act or  rule would  be void	if it  violates	 any

</p><p id="p_70">     Which would  be the  appropriate Legislature  to  enact
laws or	 the appropriate  authority  to	 frame	rules  would
depend upon  the provisions of the Constitution with respect
to legislative	competence and	the division  of legislative
powers. Thus,  for instance, under Entry 70 in List I of the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, Union Public Services,
all-India Services  and Union  Public Service Commission are
subjects which	fall within  the exclusive legislative field
of Parliament,	while under  Entry 41  in  List	 II  of	 the
Seventh Schedule  to the Constitution, State Public Services
and  State   Public  Service   Commission  fall	 within	 the
exclusive legislative  field of	 the State Legislatures. The
rules framed  by the  President or  the Governor  of a State
must also,  therefore, conform	to these legislative powers.
It is, however, not necessary that the Act of an appropriate
Legislature  should  specifically  deal	 with  a  particular
service. It is sufficient if it is an Act as contemplated by
<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_296">Article 309</a>  by	 which	provision  is  made  regulating	 the
recruitment  and  conditions  in  a  service  (see  <a href="/doc/689237/" id="a_297">Ram	 Pal
Chaturvedi v.  State of	 Rajasthan and	others</a>.),  [1970]  2
S.C.R. 559,564.
</p><p id="p_71">     It was  at	 one  time  thought  that  the	right  of  a
government servant  to recover arrears of salary fell within
the ambit  of the  pleasure doctrine  and a  servant of	 the
Crown, therefore,  cannot sue  for his	salary, it  being  a
bounty of  the Crown and not a contractual debt. This was so
stated in  the judgment	 of Lord  Blackburn in	the Court of
Session (the supreme civil court of Scotland) in the case of
Mulvenna v.  The  Admiralty.,  [1926]  S.C.  (i.e.  Sessions
Cases) 842. Relying heavily upon this decision, the Judicial
Committee of  the Privy	 Council in  High  Commissioner	 for
India and High Commissioner for <a href="/doc/1135972/" id="a_298">Pakistan v. I.M. Lall,, L.R</a>.
[1947-48] 75  I.A. 225,	 243-4, though	it held	 that Lall's
dismissal was  contrary to  section 240(3) of the Government
of India  Act, 1935, negatived his claim for arrears of pay.
<a href="/doc/480602/" id="a_299">In The	State of  Bihar v. Abdul Majid</a>, [1954] S.C.R. 786, a
Constitution Bench  of	this  Court  pointed  out  that	 the
attention of the Judicial Committee was not drawn to <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_300">section
60</a> and	the other  relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_301">	of the Code</a> of Civil
Procedure, 1908,  and that  the rule  of English  law that a
Crown servant  cannot maintain	a suit against the Crown for
recovery of arrears of salary did not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">195</span>
prevail in  India as it had been negatived by the provisions
of statutory  law in  India. It may be mentioned that in its
subsequent decision  in Chellaih  Kodeeswaran  v.  Attorney-
General of  Ceylon in  appeal from  the	 Supreme  Court	 for
Ceylon, the  Judicial Committee	 held that  Lord Blackburn's
reasoning in  Mulvenna's case  had not	been concurred in by
the other  two members	of the	Scottish Court	of  Session,
namely, Lord  Sands and	 Lord  Ashmore,	 and  had  not	been
subsequently treated  in Scotland  as correctly	 laying down
the law and that it was defective and the conclusion reached
by Lord	 Blackburn was	contrary to authority and was wrong.
It further pointed out that there was a current of authority
for a  hundred years  before 1926  (that being	the year  in
which Mulvenna's  case was  decided) to	 the effect that the
arrears of  salary of  a civil	servant	 of  the  Crown,  as
distinguished  from   a	 member	  of  the   armed  services,
constituted a  debt recoverable	 by  a	petition  of  right.
According  to	the  Privy  Council,  as  the  relevant	 and
prestigious authorities	 to the	 contrary, did not appear to
have been  cited before	 the Judicial  Committee  in  Lall's
case, this  part of  the  judgment  is	that  case  must  be
regarded as given per incuriam.
</p><p id="p_72">     As seen  earlier, in  India for the first time a fetter
was imposed  upon the pleasure of the Crown to terminate the
service of  any	 of  its  servant  by  section	96B  of	 the
Government of  India Act,  1919,  but  that  was  only	with
respect to  the authority  which could	dismiss him. In that
section	 the   holding	of   office  "during  His  Majesty's
pleasure" was  made subject  to both  the provisions of that
Act and	 the rules  made thereunder. Under the Government of
India Act  1935, the reference to the rules to be made under
the Act	 was omitted  and the  tenure of  office of  a civil
servant was  to be  "during His Majesty's pleasure except as
expressly provided"  by that  Act. <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_302">Article 310(1)</a> adopts the
same phraseology as in <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_303">section 240</a> of the 1935 Act. Under it
also the  holding of an office is during the pleasure of the
President or  the Governor  "Except as expressly provided by
this Constitution".  Therefore	the  only  fetter  which  is
placed on  the exercise	 of such  pleasure  is	when  it  is
expressly so  provided in  the Constitution itself, that is,
when there  is an  express proviso  in that  behalf  in	 the
Constitution. Express  provisions in  that behalf  are to be
found in the case of certain Constitutional functionaries in
respect of  whose tenure  special provision  is made  in the
Constitution as,  for instance,	 in clauses  (4) and  (5) of
<a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_304">Article 124</a>  with respect  to Judges  of the  Supreme Court,
<a href="/doc/1923298/" id="a_305">Article 218</a>  with respect  to  Judges  of  the	High  Court,

</p><p id="p_73">     Clauses (1)  and (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_309">Article 311</a> impose restrictions
upon the  exercise by  the President  or the  Governor of  a

express provisions with respect to termination of service by
dismissal or  removal as  also with  respect to reduction in
rank of	 a civil  servant and  thus come within the ambit of
the  expression	  "Except  as  expressly  provided  by	this
Constitution" qualifying <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_311">Article 310(1).</a> <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_312">Article 311</a> is thus
an exception  to <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_313">Article 310</a> and was described in <a href="/doc/1270113/" id="a_314">Parshottam
Lal Dhingra  v. Union  of India</a>,  [1958] S.C.R.	 820,829, as
operating as a proviso to <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_315">Article 310(1)</a> though set out in a
separate Article.  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_316">Article 309</a>	is,  however,  not  such  an
exception. It  does not lay down any express provision which
would  derogate	 from  the  amplitude  of  the	exercise  of
pleasure under	<a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_317">Article 310(1).</a>	 It merely  confers upon the
appropriate Legislature	 or executive the power to make laws
and frame  rules but  this power  is  made  subject  to	 the
provisions of the Constitution. Thus, <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_318">Article 309</a> is subject
to <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_319">Article 310(1)</a> and any provision restricting the exercise

rule made  or frame  under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_320">Article  309</a> not being an express

conflict  with	<a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_322">Article	 310(1)</a>	 and  must  be	held  to  be
unconstitutional.  Clauses   (1)  and  (2)  of	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_323">Article	 311</a>
expressly restrict  the manner in which a Government servant
can be	dismissed, removed  or reduced in rank and unless an
Act made  or rule  framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_324">Article 309</a> also conforms to
these restrictions, it would be void. The restriction placed
by clauses  (1) and  (2) of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_325">Article 311</a>  are two : (1) with
respect to  the authority  empowered to	 dismiss or remove a
government servant  provided for  in clause  (1) of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_326">Article
311;</a> and  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_327">(2)</a>  with  respect  to  the  procedure  dismissal,
removal	 or  reduction	in  rank  of  a	 government  servant
provided for  in clause(2).  The second	 priviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_328">Article
311(2</a>), which  is the  central point of controversy in these
Appeals and Writ Petitions, lifts the restriction imposed by
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_329">Article 311(2)</a>	in the	cases specified in the three clauses
of that proviso.
</p><p id="p_74">     None of  these three Articles (namely, Articles 309,310
and 311)  sets out  the grounds	 for dismissal,	 removal  or
reduction in  rank of a government servant or for imposition
of any	other penalty  upon him	 or states  what those other
penalties are.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">197</span>
<p id="p_75">These are  matters which  are left  to be dealt with by Acts
and rules  made under  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_330">Article 309.</a> There are two classes of
penalties in  service jurisprudence, namely, minor penalties
and major  penalties. Amongst  minor penalties	are censure,
with holding  of promotion and with holding of increments of
pay. Amongst  major penalties  are dismissal or removal from
service, compulsory  retirement and reduction in rank. Minor
penalties do  not affect  the tenure of a government servant
but the	 penalty of  dismissal or removal does because these
two penalties  bring to	 an end	 the service of a government
servant. It  is also  now well	established that  compulsory
retirement  by	way  of	 penalty  amounts  to  removal	from
service. So  this penalty  also	 affects  the  tenure  of  a
government servant. Reduction in rank does not terminate the
employment of a government servant, and it would, therefore,
be difficult  to  say  that  it	 affects  the  tenure  of  a
government servant.  It may  however, be argued that it does
bring to  an end  the holding of office in a particular rank
and from  that point  of  view	it  affects  the  government
servant's tenure in the rank from which he is reduced. It is
unnecessary to	decide this  point  because  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_331">Article  311(2)</a>
expressly  gives   protection  as  against  the	 penalty  of
reduction in rank also.
</p><p id="p_76">     Exercise of Pleasure
     A question	 which arises  in this connection is whether
the pleasure  of the President or the Governor under <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_332">Article
310(1)</a> is  to be  exercised by the President or the Governor
personally or  it can  be exercised  by a  delegate or	some
other authority	 empowered under  the Constitution  or by an
Act or	Rules made  under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_333">Article 309.</a> This question came up
for consideration  before a Constitution Bench of this Court
in Babu	 Ram Upadhya's	case.  The  majority  of  the  Court
(speaking through  Subba Rao, J., as he then was) stated (at
page 701)  the conclusions  it had  reached in	the form  of
seven propositions. These propositions are :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">	  (1) In  India every  person who  is a	 member of a
	  public service  described in	<a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_334">Article 310</a>  of	 the
	  Constitution holds  office during  the pleasure of
	  the President or the Governor, as the case may be,
	  subject to the express provisions therein.
	  (2) The  power to  dismiss  a	 public	 servant  at
	  pleasure is  outside the scope of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_335">Article 154</a> and,
	  therefore, cannot  be delegated by the Governor to
	  a subordinate officer, and can be exercised by him
	  only in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">198</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">	  (3) This  tenure is  subject to the limitations or
	  qualifications mentioned  in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_336">Article	311</a>  of	 the
	  Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57">	  (4) The  Parliament or  the Legislatures of States
	  cannot make  a law  abrogating or  modifying	this
	  tenure so  as to impinge upon the overriding power
	  conferred upon the President or the Governor under
	  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_337">Article 310</a>, as qualified by <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_338">Article 311.</a>
	  (5) The  Parliament or  the Legislatures of States
	  can  make  a	law  regulating	 the  conditions  of
	  service  of	such   a   member   which   includes
	  proceedings by way of disciplinary action, without
	  affecting the	 powers	 of  the  President  or	 the
	  Governor under  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_339">Article 310</a>  of  the	Constitution
	  read with  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_340">Article 310</a>  of the  Constitution	read
	  with <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_341">Article 311</a> thereof.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">	  (6) The  Parliament and  the Legislatures also can
	  make a  law laying  down and	regulating the scope
	  and  content	 of  the   doctrine  of	 `reasonable
	  opportunity'	embodies   in  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_342">Article	311</a>  of	 the
	  Constitution; but the said law would be subject to
	  judicial review.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">	  (7) If  a statute  could be  made by	Legislatures
	  within the  foregoing permissible limits the rules
	  made by  an authority	 in exercise  of  the  power
	  conferred   there-under    would    likewise	  be
	  efficacious within the said limits.
</blockquote><p id="p_77">The question  came to  be reconsidered	by a larger Bench of
Seven Judges in Moti Ram Deka's case. While referring to the
judgment of  the majority  in Babu  Ram Upadhya's  case	 the
Court observed as follows (at pp.731-2) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">	  What the  said Judgment  has held  is	 that  while
	  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_343">Article 310</a>  provides for  a tenure at pleasure of
	  the President or the Governor, <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_344">Article 309</a> enables
	  the legislature  or the executive, as the case may
	  be, to  make any law or rule in regard inter alia,
	  to conditions	 of service  without impinging	upon
	  the overriding power recognised under <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_345">Article 310.</a>
	  In other  words, in exercising the power conferred
	  by  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_346">Article	309</a>,  the  extent  of  the  pleasure
	  recognised by	 <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_347">Article 310</a>  cannot be affected, or
	  impaired. In fact, while stating the conclusions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">199</span>
	  in the form of propositions, the said judgment has
	  observed that	 the Parliament	 or the	 Legislature
	  can  make  a	law  regulating	 the  conditions  of
	  service  without   affecting	the  powers  of	 the
	  President or	the Governor  under <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_348">Article 310</a> read
	  with <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_349">Article	311.</a> It	 has also been stated at the
	  same place  that the	power to  dismiss  a  public
	  servant  at  pleasure	 is  outside  the  scope  of
	  <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_350">Article 154</a> and, therefore, cannot be delegated by
	  the Governor	to a  subordinate officer and can be
	  exercised by	him only in the manner prescribed by
	  the Constitution.  In the  context,  it  would  be
	  clear that this latter observation is not intended
	  to lay  down that  a	law  cannot  be	 made  under
	  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_351">Article 309</a>  or a  Rule cannot be framed under the
	  proviso  to	the  said  Article  prescribing	 the
	  procedure by which, and the authority by whom, the
	  said pleasure	 can be	 exercised. This observation
	  which is  mentioned as  proposition number(2) must
	  be read  along with  the  subsequent	propositions
	  specified as	(3),(4),(5) &amp;  (6). The	 only  point
	  made is  that whatever  is done  under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_352">Article 309</a>
	  must be  subject to  the  pleasure  prescribed  by
	  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_353">Article 310."</a></blockquote>
<p id="p_78">     While we are on this point we may as well advert to the
decision of  this Court	 in <a href="/doc/1876971/" id="a_354">Sardari  Lal v. Union of India &amp;
Ors. In</a>	 that case  it was  held that where the President or
the Governor,  as the  case may	 be, if	 satisfied, makes an
order under  clause (c) of what is now the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_355">Article 311(2)</a>	that in	 the interest of the security of the
State it  is not  expedient to hold an inquiry for dismissal
or  removal   or  reduction   in  rank	of  an	officer	 the
satisfaction of	 the President	or the	Governor must be his
personal satisfaction.	The correctness	 of  this  view	 was
considered by  a seven Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_356">Shamsher
Singh &amp; Anr. v. State of Punjab</a>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 814, It was
categorically stated  in that  case(at page  835)  that	 the
majority view in Babu Ram Upadhya's case was no longer goods
law after the decision in Moti Ram Doka's case. Referring to
these two cases the Court observed (at pages 834-5)) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">	  This Court  in <a href="/doc/1540511/" id="a_357">State	of Uttar  Pradesh &amp;  Ors. v.
	  Babu Ram Upadhya</a> [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679 held that the
	  power of  the Governor  to  dismiss  at  pleasure,
	  subject to the provision of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_358">Article 311</a>, is not an
	  executive  power   under   <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_359">Article   154</a>   but   a
	  Constitutional power	and is	not capable of being
	  delegated to officers subordinate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">200</span>
	  to him.  The effect  of the  judgment in  Babu Ram
	  Upadhya's case(supra)	 was that the Governor could
	  not delegate his pleasure to any officer nor could
	  any law  provide for the exercise of that pleasure
	  by an	 office with the result that pleasure by any
	  officer  with	 the  result  that  statutory  rules
	  governing dismissal  are binding  on every officer
	  though  they	 were  subject	 to  the  overriding
	  pleasure of the Governor. This would mean that the
	  officer was  bound by	 the Rules  but the Governor
	  was not.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_62">	  In Babu  Ram Upadhya's  case(supra)  the  majority
	  view stated  seven propositions at page 701 of the
	  report. Proposition  No. 2  is that  the power  to
	  dismiss a  public servant  at pleasure  is outside
	  the scope  of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_360">Article	 154</a> and therefore cannot be
	  delegated by the Governor to a subordinate officer
	  and can  be exercised	 by him	 only in  the manner
	  prescribed by the Constitution. Propositions No. 3
	  and 4 are these. The tenure of a public servant is
	  subject  to	the  limitations  or  qualifications
	  mentioned in	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_361">Article 311</a> of the Constitution. The
	  Parliament or	 the Legislatures  of States  cannot
	  make a  law abrogating or modifying this tenure so
	  as to	 impinge upon the overriding power conferred
	  upon the  President or  the Governor under <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_362">Article
	  310</a> as qualified by <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_363">Article 311.</a> Proposition No. 5
	  is that  the Parliament  or  the  Legislatures  of
	  States can make a law regulating the conditions of
	  service  of	such   a   member   which   includes
	  proceedings by way of disciplinary action, without
	  affecting the	 powers	 of  the  President  or	 the
	  Governor under  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_364">Article 310</a>  of  the	Constitution
	  read with  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_365">Article 311.</a>  Proposition No. 6 is that
	  the Parliament  and the Legislatures also can make
	  a law	 laying down  and regulating  the scope	 and
	  content   of	  the	doctrine    of	 `reasonable
	  opportunity' embodied in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_366">Article 311</a>, but the said
	  law would be subject to judicial review.
	  All  these   propositions  were  reviewed  by	 the
	  majority opinion  of this Court in Moti Ram Deka's
	  case	(supra)	  and  this   Court  restated	that
	  proposition No.  2 must  be read  along  with	 the
	  subsequent propositions  specified as propositions
	  No. 3,4,5  and 6.  The ruling	 in Moti  Ram Deka's
	  case	(supra)	  is  that   a	law  can  be  framed
	  prescribing the procedure by which and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">201</span>
	  authority  by'  whom	the  said  pleasure  can  be
	  exercised. The  pleasure of  the President  or the
	  Governor to  dismiss can  therefore  not  only  be
	  delegated but	 is also subject to <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_367">Article 311.</a> The
	  true position as laid down in Moti Ram Deka's case

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_63">	  The majority	view  in  Babu	Ram  Upadhya's	case
	  (supra) is  no longer	 good law after the decision
	  in Moti  Ram Deka's  case (supra). The theory that
	  only the  President or  the Governor is personally
	  to exercise  pleasure of  dismissing or removing a
	  public servant  is repelled  by express  words  on
	  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_373">Article 311</a>  that no person who is a member of the
	  civil service	 or holds  a civil  post  under	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_79">(Emphasis supplied)
	  The Court  then stated  its conclusion  as follows
	  (at page 836) :
</p><p id="p_80">	  "For	the  foregoing	reasons	 we  hold  that	 the
	  President or	the Governor  acts on  the  aid	 and
	  advice of  the Council of Ministers with the Prime
	  Minister as  the head in the case of the Union and
	  the Chief  Minister at  the head  in the  case  of
	  State in  all matters which vest. in the executive
	  whether   those   functions	are   executive	  or
	  legislative in  character. Neither  the  President
	  nor the  Governor is	to  exercise  the  executive
	  functions personally."
</p><p id="p_81">     The position,  therefore, is  that the  pleasure of the
President or the Governor is not required to be exercised by
either of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">202</span>
them  personally,  and	that  is  indeed  obvious  from	 the
language of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_374">Article 311.</a> Under clause (1) of that Article a
government servant  cannot be  dismissed or  removed  by  an
authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. The
question of  an authority  equal or  superior in rank to the
appointing authority cannot arise if the power to dismiss or
remove is  to be  exercised by the President or the Governor
personally. Clause  (b) of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_375">Article 311</a>
equally makes  this clear when the power to dispense with an
inquiry is  conferred by  it upon the authority empowered to
dismiss, remove	 or reduce in rank a government servant in a
case where such authority is satisfied that for some reason,
to be  recorded by  that authority  in writing,	 it  is	 not
reasonably practicable	to hold	 such inquiry, because if it
was the	 personal  satisfaction	 of  the  President  or	 the
Governor, the  question of the satisfaction of any authority
empowered  to	dismiss	 or  remove  or	 reduce	 in  rank  a
government servant  would  not	arise.	Thus,  though  under
<a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_376">Article 310(1)</a>	the tenure of a government servant is at the
pleasure of  the President  or the Governor, the exercise of
such pleasure can be either by the President or the Governor
acting with  the aid  and on  the advice  of the  Council of
Ministers or  by the  authority specified in Acts made under
<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_377">Article 309</a>  or in  rules made under such Acts or made under
the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_378">Article 309;</a> and in the case of clause (c) of
the second  proviso to	<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_379">Article 311(2</a>),	 the inquiry  to  be
dispensed with	not on	the  personal  satisfaction  of	 the
President or the Governor but on his satisfaction arrived at
with the aid and on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
</p><p id="p_82">     The Second Proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_380">Article 311(2)</a>
     Clause  (2)  of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_381">Article  311</a>  gives  a  constitutional
mandate to  the	 principles  of	 natural  justice  and	audi
alteram partem rule by providing that a person employed in a
civil capacity	under the  Union or  a State  shall  not  be
dismissed or  removed from  service or reduced in rank until
after an  inquiry in  which he	has  been  informed  of	 the
charges	 against   him	and  has  been	given  a  reasonable
opportunity of	being heard  in respect of those charges. To
this extent, the pleasure doctrine enacted in <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_382">Article 310(1)</a>
is abridged because <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_383">Article 311(2)</a> is a express provision of
the Constitution.  This safeguard  provided for a government
servant by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_384">Article 311</a> is, however, taken away
when the  second proviso  to that clause becomes applicable.
The safeguard provided by clause(1) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_385">Article 311</a>, however,
remains	 intact	  and  continues  to  be  available  to	 the
government servant. The second
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">203</span>
proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_386">Article 311(2)</a>  becomes applicable	in the three
cases mentioned in clauses (a) to (c) of that proviso. These
cases are
</p><p id="p_83">	  (a) where  a person  is dismissed  or	 removed  or
	  reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has
	  led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or

	  remove a  person or  to  reduce  him	in  rank  is
	  satisfied that  for some reason, to be recorded by
	  that authority  in writing,  it is  not reasonably
	  practicable to hold such inquiry; and
</p><p id="p_85">	  (c) where  the President  or the  Governor, as the
	  case may  be, is satisfied that in the interest of
	  the security	of the	State it is not expedient to
	  hold such inquiry.
</p><p id="p_86">     The Construction  to be  placed upon the second proviso
and the	 scope and  effect of that proviso were much debated
at the	Bar. In	 Hira Lal Rattan Lal etc. v. State of U.P. &amp;
Anr., [1973]  2 S.C.R. 502 this Court observed (at page 512)
;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">	  "In construing  a statutory  provision, the  first

	  If the  provision is	unambiguous and if from that
	  provision, the  legislative intent  is  clear,  we
	  need	not   call  into  aid  the  other  rules  of

	  Ordinarily a	proviso to  a section is intended to

<blockquote id="blockquote_65">	  "A proviso  cannot be	 construed as  enlarging the

	  does not  contain the provisions which are said to
	  occur in it, one cannot derive those provisions by
	  implication from a proviso."</blockquote>
<p id="p_88">     The  language   of	 the  second  proviso  is  plan	 and
unambiguous. The  key-words in	the second proviso are "this
clause	shall	not  apply".   By  "this  clause"  is  meant
clause(2). As  clause(2) requires  an  inquiry	to  be	held
against a  government servant, the only meaning attributable
to these words is that this inquiry shall not be held. There
is no scope for any ambiguity in these words and there is no
reason to  given them  any meaning  different from the plain
and ordinary  meaning which  they bear. The resultant effect
of these  words is that when a situation envisaged in any of
the three  clauses of  the proviso  arises and	that  clause
becomes applicable,  the safeguard  provided to a government
servant by clause (2) is taken away. As pointed out earlier,
this provision	is as much in public interest and for public
good and  a matter of public policy as the pleasure doctrine
and the	 safeguards  with  respect  to	security  of  tenure
contained in clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_388">Article 311.</a>
</p><p id="p_89">     Before, however,  any clause  of the second proviso can
come into  play the  condition	laid  down  in	it  must  be
satisfied. The	condition for  the application	of  each  of
these clauses  is different.  In the  case of  clause (a)  a
government servant  must be  guilty of conduct deserving the
penalty of  dismissal, removal	or reduction  in rank  which
conduct has led to him being convicted on a criminal charge.
In the case of clause (b) the disciplinary authority must be
satisfied that	it is  not reasonably practicable to hold an
inquiry. In  the case  of clause  (c) the  President or	 the
Governor of  a State,  as the case may be, must be satisfied
that in the interest of the security of the State, it is not
expedient to  hold an  inquiry. When these conditions can be
said to	 be fulfilled  will be discussed later while dealing
separately with	 each of  the three  clauses. The  paramount
thing, however,	 to bear  in mind is that the second proviso
will apply only where the conduct of a government servant is
such as	 he deserves the punishment of dismissal, removal or
reduction in  rank. If	the conduct  is such as to deserve a
punishment different  from those mentioned above, the second
proviso cannot come into play at all,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">205</span>
because <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_389">Article	 311 (2)</a>  is itself  confined only  to these
three penalties.  Therefore,  before  denying  a  government
servant his  constitutional right  to an  inquiry, the first
consideration would  be whether the conduct of the concerned
government servant  is such  as	 justifies  the	 penalty  of
dismissal,  removal   or  reduction   in  rank.	  Once	that
conclusion is  reached and  the condition  specified in	 the
relevant clause	 of the	 second proviso	 is satisfied,	that
proviso becomes applicable and the government servant is not
entitled to  an inquiry.  The extent  to which	a government
servant can  be denied	his right  to an  inquiry formed the
subject-matter of  considerable debate	at the	Bar and	 we,
therefore, now turn to the question whether under the second
proviso	 to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_390">Article  311(2)</a>  even  though  the	 inquiry  is
dispensed with,	 some opportunity  at least  should  not  be
afforded to  the government  servant to	 that he is not left
wholly without	protection. As most of the arguments on this
Part of the case were common to all the three clauses of the
second proviso,	 it will be convenient at this stage to deal
at one	place with  all the  arguments on  this part  of the
case, leaving  aside to	 be separately	dealt with the other
arguments pertaining  only to  a particular  clause  of	 the
second proviso.
</p><p id="p_90">     The Extent	 of Denial  of Opportunity  under the Second
Proviso
     It was  submitted on  behalf of the government servants
that an	 inquiry consists  of several stages and, therefore,
even where by the application of the second proviso the full
inquiry is  dispensed with,  there is nothing to prevent the
disciplinary authority	from  holding  at  least  a  minimal
inquiry because no prejudice can because by doing so. It was
further submitted  that even though the three clauses of the
second proviso	are  different	in  their  content,  it	 was
feasible in the case of each of the three clauses to give to
the government	servant	 an  opportunity  of  showing  cause
against the  penalty proposed  to be imposed so as to enable
him to	convince the  disciplinary authority that the nature
of the	misconduct attributed  to him  did not	call for his
dismissal, removal  or reduction in rank. For instance, in a
case falling  under clause  (a) the  government servant	 can
point out  that the  offence of which he was convicted was a
trivial or  a technical one in respect of which the criminal
court had  taken a lenient view and had sentenced him to pay
a nominal  fine or  had given  him the benefit of probation.
Support for  this submission  was derived  from Challappan's
case.  It   was	 further   submitted  that  apart  from	 the
opportunity to	show cause  against the	 proposed penalty it
was also  feasible to give a further opportunity in the case
of each of the three clauses though such opportunity in each
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">206</span>
case may  not be  identical. Thus,  it was  argued that	 the
charge-sheet or	 at least  a notice informing the government
servant of  the charges	 against him  and  calling  for	 his
explanation thereto  was always	 feasible.  It	was  further
argued that though under clause (a) of the second proviso an
inquiry into  the conduct which led to the conviction of the
government  servant  on	 a  criminal  charge  would  not  be
necessary, such	 a notice would enable him to point out that
it was a case of mistaken identity and he was not the person
who had	 been convicted	 but  was  an  altogether  different
individual. It	was urged  that there  could be no practical
difficulty in  serving such  charge-sheet to  the  concerned
government servant  because even  if he	 were  sentenced  to
imprisonment, the charge-sheet or notice with respect to the
proposed penalty  can always be sent to the jail in which he
is serving  his sentence. So far as clause (b) is concerned,
it was	argued that  even though  it may  not be  reasonably
practicable to	hold an	 inquiry,  the	explanation  of	 the
government servant can at least be asked for with respect to
the charges  made against  him so  that	 he  would  have  an
opportunity of	showing in his written reply that he was not
guilty of  any of  those charges.  It was  also argued	that
assuming such  government servant was absconding, the notice
could be  sent by  registered post to his last known address
or pasted  there. Similar arguments as in case of clause (b)
were advanced  with respect  to clause (c). It was submitted
that the disciplinary authority could never make up its mind
whether to  dismiss or remove or reduce in rank a government
servant	 unless	  such	minimal	 opportunity  at  least	 was
afforded  to  the  government  servant.	 Support  for  these
contentions was	 sought to  be derived from (1) the language
of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_391">Article  311(2)</a> and	the implications  flowing therefrom,
(2) the	 principle of  natural justice	including  the	audi
alteram partem	rule comprehended in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_392">Article 14</a>, and <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_393">(3)</a> the
language certain  rules made  either under Acts referable to
the <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_394">Article  309</a> or  made under the proviso to that Article.
We will	 consider the  contentions with	 respect to  each of
these basis separately.
</p><p id="p_91">     So far  as <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_395">Article	 311(2)</a> was  concerned, it  was said
that the  language of  the second  proviso did	not negative
every single  opportunity  which  could	 be  afforded  to  a
government servant  under different  situations	 though	 the
nature of  such opportunity  may be different depending upon
the circumstances of the case. It was further submitted that
the object  of the  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_396">Article 311(2)</a>  was that  no  government
servant should be condemned unheard and dismissed or removed
or reduced  in rank  without affording	him  at	 least	some
chance of either showing his innocence or convincing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">207</span>
the disciplinary authority that the proposed penalty was too
drastic and  was uncalled  for in  his	case  and  a  lesser
penalty	 should,  therefore,  be  imposed  upon	 him.  These
arguments, though attractive at the first blush, do not bear
scrutiny.
</p><p id="p_92">     The language  of the  second proviso  to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_397">Article 311(2)</a>
read in	 the light  of the interpretation placed upon clause
(2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_398">Article 311</a> as originally enacted and the legislative
history of  that clause	 wholly rule  out the  giving of any
opportunity. While  construing Rule 55 of the Civil Services
(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules and the phrase "a
reasonable opportunity	of showing  cause against the action
proposed to  be taken  in regard  to him"  occurring in sub-
section (3)  of section	 240 of the Government of India Act,
1935, the  Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Lall's
case stated as follows (at page 242-3) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">	  "... sub-s.  3 of <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_399"> s. 240</a>  was not intended to be,
	  and was  not, a reproduction of rule 55, which was
	  left unaffected as an administrative rule. Rule 55
	  is concerned	that  the  civil  servant  shall  be
	  informed 'of	the grounds  on which it is proposed
	  to take  action,' and	 to afford  him an  adequate
	  opportunity of  defending himself  against charges
	  which have  to be  reduced to	 writing; this is in
	  marked contrast  to the  statutory provision of 'a
	  reasonable opportunity  of showing  cause  against
	  the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.'
	  In the  opinion of  their Lordships,	no action is
	  proposed within  the meaning	of  the	 sub-section
	  until a  definite conclusion	has been  come to on
	  the charges,	and the	 actual punishment to follow
	  is provisionally determined on. Before that stage,
	  the  charges	 are  unproved	 and  the  suggested
	  punishments are merely hypothetical. It is on that
	  stage being  reached that  the statute  gives	 the
	  civil servants  the opportunity  for which sub-s.3
	  makes provision.  Their Lord	ships would only add
	  that they  see  no  difficulty  in  the  statutory
	  opportunity being reasonably afforded at more that
	  one stage.  If the  civil servant has been through
	  an  inquiry	under  rule  55,  it  would  not  be
	  reasonable that  he should ask for a repetition of
	  that stage,  if duly	carried out,  but that would
	  not exhaust  his statutory  right,  and  he  would
	  still	 be   entitled	to   represent	against	 the
	  punishment proposed  as the result of the findings
	  of  the  inquiry.  On	 this  view  of	 the  proper
	  construction of sub-s.3 of s.240, it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">208</span>
	  not disputed	that the  respondent  has  not	been
	  given the  opportunity to  which  he	is  entitled
	  thereunder,  and  the	 purported  removal  of	 the
	  respondent on	 August 10,1940,  did not conform to
	  the mandatory	 requirements of  sub-s.3 of  s.240,
	  and was void and inoperative."</blockquote>
<p id="p_93">     The very  phrase "a  reasonable opportunity  of showing
cause against  the action  proposed to be taken in regard to
him" in	 sub-section(3) of  section 240 of the Government of
India Act,  1935, was  repeated in clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_400">Article 311</a>
as originally enacted, that is in the said clauses prior too
its amendment by the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act,
1963. Approving	 the construction  placed  by  the  Judicial
Committee upon	this phrase, this Court in <a href="/doc/546415/" id="a_401">Khem Chand v. The
Union of  India &amp;  Ors</a>. [1958]	S.C.R. 1080, held as follows
(at page 1095-97) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_67">	  "It is true that the provision does not, in terms,
	  refer to  different stages at which opportunity is
	  to be	 given to the officer concerned. All that it
	  says is  that the government servant must be given
	  a reasonable	opportunity of showing cause against
	  the action  proposed to be taken in regard to him.
	  He must  not only be given an opportunity but such
	  opportunity must  be a  reasonable one.  In  order
	  that the  opportunity to  show cause	against	 the
	  proposed action  may be  regarded as	a reasonable
	  one, it  is quite  obviously	necessary  that	 the
	  government servant should have the opportunity, to
	  say, if  that be  his case,  that he	has not been
	  guilty of  any misconduct  to merit any punishment
	  at all  and also  that the  particular  punishment
	  proposed to  be given	 is much  more	drastic	 and
	  server than  he deserves.  Both these pleas have a
	  direct bearing  on the  question of punishment and
	  may well  be put  forward in showing cause against
	  the proposed	punishment. If	this is	 the correct
	  meaning of  the clause,  as we  think it  is, what
	  consequences	follow?	  If  it   is  open  to	 the
	  government  servant	under  this   provision	  to
	  contend, if  that be	the fact,  that	 he  is	 not
	  guilty of any misconduct then how can he take that
	  plea unless  he is told what misconduct is alleged
	  against him?	If the	opportunity to show cause is
	  to be	 a reasonable one it is clear that he should
	  be informed  about the  charge or charges levelled
	  against him and the evidence by which it is sought
	  to be	 established, for  it is  only then  that he
	  will be able
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">209</span>
	  to put forward his defence. If the purpose of this
	  provision is	to give	 the government	 servant  an
	  opportunity to  exonerate himself  from the charge
	  and if  this opportunity is to be a reasonable one
	  he should  be allowed	 to show  that the  evidence
	  against  him	 is  not   worthy  of	credence  or
	  consideration and  that he  can only	do if  he is
	  given a  chance  to  cross-examine  the  witnesses
	  called against  him and  to examine himself or any
	  other witness	 in support of his defence. All this
	  appears to  us to be implicit in the language used
	  in the  clause, but  this  does  not	exhaust	 his
	  rights. In  addition to  showing that	 he has	 not
	  been guilty  of any  misconduct so as to merit any
	  punishment, it  is reasonable	 that he should also
	  have an  opportunity to  contend that	 the charges
	  proved against  him do not necessarily require the
	  particular punishment	 proposed to be meted out to
	  him. He may say for instance, that although he has
	  been guilty of some misconduct it is not of such a
	  character as	to merit  the extreme punishments of
	  dismissal or	even of removal or reduction in rank
	  and that any of the lesser punishments ought to be
	  sufficient in his case.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_68">	  To  summarise	  :   the   reasonable	 opportunity
	  envisages by	the  provision	under  consideration
	  includes -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_69">	  (a) An opportunity to deny his guilt and establish
	  his innocence,  which he can only do if he is told
	  what the  charges levelled against him are and the

	  of India  Act, 1935  so as  to  give	a  statutory
	  protection to	 the government servants and has now
	  been incorporated  in	 <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_402">Article  311(2)</a>  so  as  to
	  convert  the	 protection  into  a  constitutional
	  safeguard."</blockquote>
<p id="p_94">     While the	Judicial Committee  in Lall's case held that
two opportunities  were required  - one under rule 55 of the
Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules to
show cause  against the charges of misconduct made against a
government servant,  and the  other under sub-section (3) of
section 240  of the  Government of  India Act, 1935, to show
cause against  the proposed  penalty,  this  Court  in	Khem
Chand's case held that <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_403">Article 311(2)</a> bodily lifted the said
rule 55	 and the  additional  opportunity  provided  for  in
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_404">section 240(3)</a>	of  the	 1935  Act  and	 incorporated  these
provisions in <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_405">Article 311(2)</a> so as to convert the protection
afforded  to   government  servants  into  a  constitutional
safeguard. This	 conclusion was	 reached by  this Court even
though <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_406">Article	311(2)</a> used  the same  language	 as  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_407">section
240(3)</a>. The  Constitution (Fifteenth  Amendment) Act,  1963,
substituted the	 whole of clause (2). The substituted clause
specifically provided for two opportunities to be given to a
government servant  :(1)  to  be  informed  of	the  charges
against him  and to  be given  a reasonable  opportunity  of
defending  himself   against  those   charges,	and   (2)  a
reasonable  opportunity	 of  making  representation  on	 the
penalty proposed where after such inquiry it was proposed to
impose on him the penalty of dismissal, removal or reduction
in rank.  No additional rights were, however, conferred upon
government servants by the above amendment because it merely
declared the  rights  which  a	government  servant  already
possessed under	 the original  clause (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_408">Article 311</a> as
interpreted  by	 this  Court  in  Khem	Chand's	 case.	This
amendment, therefore,  was merely  declaratory, but in a way
it was also clarificatory because it restricted the right of
representation on  the proposed	 penalty to a representation
only on	 the  basis  of	 the  evidence	adduced	 during	 the
inquiry.  This	 clarification	perhaps	  became   necessary
because, as pointed out by this Court in <a href="/doc/1629479/" id="a_409">Suresh Koshy George
v. The	University of  Kerala &amp;	 Ors</a>. [1969]  1 S.C.R.	317,
</p><p id="p_95">326., there  prevailed an  erroneous impression	 in  certain
quarters, evidently  influenced by  the	 provisions  of	 the
unamended <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_410">Article  311(2)</a> that every disciplinary proceeding
must consist  of two  inquiries, one  before issuing  a show
cause notice  to be  followed by another inquiry thereafter.
This amendment,	 therefore, made it expressly clear that the
inquiry to be held against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">211</span>
a government  servant was  to be one in which a charge-sheet
or a show-cause notice was to be issued to him informing him
of the	charges against	 him and  giving  him  a  reasonable
opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges and a
further opportunity  of making representation on the penalty
proposed to  be imposed	 on him but only on the basis of the
evidence  adduced   during  such  inquiry.  The	 substituted
clause, therefore,  showed that	 the issue of a charge-sheet
or a  show-cause notice	 in respect  of the  charges  framed
against a  government servant  and a  notice to	 show  cause
against the  proposed  penalty	were  part  of	the  inquiry
contemplated by	 <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_411">Article 311 (2).</a> Even assuming for the sake
of argument  that because  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_412">Article 311(2</a>), as substituted by
the Constitution  (Fifteenth Amendment)	 Act,  spoke  of  "a
reasonable  opportunity	 of  making  representation  on	 the
penalty proposed"  in a	 case "where  it is  proposed, after
such inquiry,  to impose  on him any such penalty", the show
cause notice  with respect  to penalty was not a part of the
inquiry, the opening words of the proviso to clause (2) (now
the second proviso to that clause) namely, "Provided further
that this  clause shall	 not apply", would, where any of the
three clauses  of the  said proviso  applies, take away both
the right  to have  an inquiry	held in which the government
servant would  be entitled  to a  charge-sheet as  also	 the
right to  make a  representation on the proposed penalty. As
mentioned above, the words "this clause shall not apply" are
the key-words  in the  second proviso  and govern  each	 and
every clause  thereof and  by reason of these words not only
the holding  of an  inquiry but all the provisions of clause
(2) have been dispensed with.
</p><p id="p_96">     The  question   which  then  arises  is,  "Whether	 the
Constitution  (Forty-second   Amendment)  Act,	1976,  which
further amended	 the substituted  clause (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_413">Article 311</a>
with effect  from 1st  January 1977,  has made any change in
the law?" The amendments made by this Act are that in clause
(2) that  portion which required a reasonable opportunity of
making representation on the proposed penalty to be given to
a government  servant was deleted and in its place the first
proviso was  inserted, which  expressly provides  that it is
not necessary to give to a delinquent government servant any
opportunity  of	  making  representation   on  the  proposed
penalty. Does  this affect  the operation  of  the  original
proviso which,	by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment)
Act, became  the second	 proviso? Such obviously was not and
could not have been the intention of Parliament. The opening
words of  the second proviso remain the same except that the
word 'further'	was  inserted  after  the  word	 'Provided',
because the  original proviso  by reason of the insertion of
another proviso before it became
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">212</span>
the second proviso. It should be borne in mind that the show
cause notice at the punishment stage was originally there as
a result  of  the  interpretation  placed  by  the  Judicial
Committee in  Lal's case  and by  this Court in Khem Chand's
case upon  the phrase  "a reasonable  opportunity of showing
cause against  the action  proposed to be taken in regard to
him".  Clause	(2)  as	  substituted  by  the	Constitution
(Fifteenth Amendment) Act merely reproduced the substance of
what  was  held	 in  Khem  Chand's  case.  The	words  which
originally found  a  place  in	clause	(2),  "a  reasonable
opportunity of	showing cause against the action proposed to
be taken  in regard  to him",  do not  any more	 feature  in
clause (2).  All that  clause (2) now provides is an inquiry
in which  the government  servant is informed of the charges
against him  and given	a reasonable  opportunity  of  being
heard in  respect of  those charges.  Clause  (2)  taken  by
itself even  without the  first proviso	 does  not  provide,
expressly  impliedly,	for  any   opportunity	to   make  a
representation	against	 the  proposed	penalty.  After	 the
Constitution   (Fifteenth   Amendment)	 Act   this   second
opportunity formed a separate part of clause (2), which part
was deleted  by the  Constitution  (Forty-second  Amendment)
Act. Thus,  when the  second proviso  states in	 its opening
words that  "Provided further  that this  clause  shall	 not
apply" it means that whatever safe-guards are to be found in
clause (2)  are wholly taken away in a case where any of the
three clauses  of the  second proviso  is attracted. In this
connection, the	 following observations of this Court in the
<a href="/doc/1629479/" id="a_414">Case of	 Suresh Koshy  George v.  The University of Kerala &amp;
Ors</a>.(at page 326-7) are pertinent :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">	  "There seems	to be  an  erroneous  impression  in
	  certain  quarters   evidently	 influenced  by	 the
	  provisions in	 <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_415">Article  311</a>  of  the	Constitution
	  particularly as they stood before the amendment of
	  that article	that every  disciplinary  proceeding
	  must consist	of two inquiries, one before issuing
	  the show  cause notice  to be	 followed by another
	  inquiry thereafter. Such is not the requirement of
	  the principles  of natural justice. Law may or may
	  not prescribe such a course."
</blockquote><p id="p_97"><a href="/doc/1431558/" id="a_416">In Associated  Cement Companies	 Ltd. v.  T.C.Shrivastava  &amp;
Ors</a>., [1984] 3 S.C.R. 361,369, this Court held that "neither
under the  ordinary law of the land nor under industrial law
a second  opportunity to  show cause  against  the  proposed
punishment is  necessary". Since a right to such opportunity
does not  exist in law, it follows that the only right which
the government	servant had  to make a representation on the
proposed penalty was to be found
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">213</span>
in clause  (2) of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_417">Article 311</a> prior to its amendment by the
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act. This right having
been taken away by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment)
Act, there  is no  provision of law under which a government
servant can claim this right.
</p><p id="p_98">     As for  the argument that in a case under clause (a) of
the second  proviso a  government servant  could be  wrongly
dismissed, removed  or reduced	in rank	 mistaking  him	 for
another with the same name unless he is given an opportunity
of bringing to the notice of the disciplinary authority that
he is not the individual who has been convicted, it can only
be described  as being	too  fanciful  and  far-fetched	 for
though	such   a  case	 of   mistaken	 identity   may	  be
hypothetically possible,  it is highly improbable. As in all
other  organization,  there  is	 in  government	 service  an
extremely active  grapevine, both  departmental	 and  inter-
departmental,  which   is  constantly  active,	humming	 and
buzzing with  service news  and office	gossip, and it would
indeed be  strange if the news that a member of a department
was facing  prosecution or had been convicted were to remain
a  secret  for	long.  Assuming	 such  a  case	occurs,	 the
government servant  is not  without any remedy. He can prove
in a  departmental appeal  which service  rules provide for,
save in exceptional cases, that he has been wrongly mistaken
for another.  Similarly, it  is not  possible to  accept the
argument that  unless a	 written explanation with respect to
the charges  is asked  for from a government servant and his
side of	 the case  known, the penalty which would be imposed
upon him,  could be  grossly out of proportion to his actual
misconduct. The disciplinary authorities are expected to act
justly and  fairly after  taking into  account all the facts
and circumstances  of the  case and  if they act arbitrarily
and impose  a penalty  which is unduly excessive, capricious
or vindictive, it can be set aside in a departmental appeal.
In any event, the remedy by way of judicial review is always
open to a government servant.
</p><p id="p_99">     The position which emerges from the above discussion is
that the  key-words of	the second  proviso govern  each and
every clause of that proviso and leave no scope for any kind
of opportunity	to be  given to	 a government  servant.	 The
phrase "this  clause shall  not apply"	is mandatory and not
directory.  It	 is  in	  the  nature  of  a  Constitutional
prohibitory   injunction    restraining	  the	disciplinary
authority from	holding an  inquiry under  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_418">Article 311(2)</a> or
from  giving  any  kind	 of  opportunity  to  the  concerned
government servant.  There is  thus no scope for introducing
into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">214</span>
the second  proviso some kind of inquiry or opportunity by a
process of  inference or  implication. The  maxim "expressum
facit cessare  tacitum" ("when	there is  express mention of
certain things,	 then anything	not mentioned  is excluded")
applies to  the case.  As pointed  out by  this Court  in <a href="/doc/44591/" id="a_419">B.
Shankara Rao  Badam &amp; Ors. v. State of Mysore &amp; Anr</a>., [1969]
3 S.C.R.  1, 12,  this well-known  maxim is  a principle  of
logic and  common sense	 and not  merely a technical rule of
construction. The  second proviso  expressly  mentions	that
clause (2)  shall not apply where one of the clauses of that
proviso becomes	 applicable. This  express mention  excludes
everything that	 clause (2)  contains and  there can  be  no
scope for  once again introducing the opportunities provided
by clause (2) or any one of them into the second proviso. In
Atkinson v. United States of America Government, L.R. [1971]
A.C. 197, Lord Reid said (at page 232) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">	  "It is  now well  recognised that  the  court	 has
	  power to  expand procedure laid down by statute if
	  that	is  necessary  to  prevent  infringement  of
	  natural justice and is not plainly contrary to the
	  intention of Parliament."
</blockquote><p id="p_100">Here, however,	the attempt  is not  merely to	do something
contrary to  the intention  of "Parliament", that is, in our
case, the Constituent Assembly, but to do something contrary
to an express prohibition contained in the Constitution. The
conclusion which  flows from  the express  language  of	 the
second proviso is inevitable and there is no escape from it.
It may	appear harsh  but, as  mentioned earlier, the second
proviso has been inserted in the Constitution as a matter of
public policy  and in  public interest	and for	 public good
just as	 the pleasure  doctrine and  the  safeguards  for  a
government servant provided in clause (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_420">Article
311</a> have  been. It is in public interest and for public good
that government	 servant who  has been	convicted of a grave
and serious  offence or	 one rendering him unfit to continue
in office  should be  summarily dismissed  or  removed	from
service instead of being allowed to continue in it at public
expense and  to public	detriment. It  is equally  in public
interest and  for public good that where his offence is such
that he should not be permitted to continue to hold the same
rank, that  he should  be reduced  in rank. Equally, where a
public servant	by himself  or in  concert with	 others	 has
brought about  a situation  in which  it is  not  reasonably
practicable to hold an inquiry and his conduct is such as to
justify his  dismissal, removal	 or reduction  in rank, both
public interest and public good demand that such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">215</span>
penalty should	forthwith and summarily be imposed upon him;
and similarly,	where in the interest of the security of the
State it  is not  expedient to hold an inquiry, it is in the
public interest	 and for  public good  that where one of the
three punishments of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank
is called  for, it  should be  summarily  imposed  upon	 the
concerned government  servant. It  was argued that in a case
falling under  clause (b) or (c), a government servant ought
to be place under suspension until the situation improves or
the danger  to the  security of the State has passed, as the
case may  be, and  it becomes  possible to  hold an inquiry.
This argument  overlooks the  fact that	 suspension involves
the payment  at least  of  subsistence	allowance  and	such
allowance is paid at public expense, and that neither public
interest would	be  benefited  nor  public  good  served  by
placing such  government servant under suspension because it
may take a considerable time for the situation to improve or
the danger  to be  over. Much  as this	may seem  harsh	 and
oppressive to  a government  servant, this  Court  must	 not
forget that  the object	 underlying the	 second	 proviso  is
public policy, public interest and public good and the Court
must, therefore,  repel the temptation to be carried away by
feelings of  commiseration and sympathy for those government
servants who have been dismissed, removed or reduced in rank
by applying  the second	 proviso. Sympathy and commiseration
cannot be  allowed to  out weigh  considerations  of  public
policy, concern	 for public interest, regard for public good
and the	 peremptory dictate of a Constitutional prohibition.
The Court must bear in mind that the second proviso has been
in the	Constitution since it was originally enacted. It was
not blindly  or slavishly  copied from section 240(3) of the
Government of India Act, 1935. <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_421">Article 311</a> was <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_422">article 282-B</a>
of the	draft Constitution  of India  and the  draft <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_423">Article
282-B</a> was  discussed and a considerable debate took place on
it in  the Constituent	Assembly (see the Official Report of
the Constituent	 Assembly  Debates,  vol.IX,  page  1099  to
1116). The  greater part  of this  debate centred  upon	 the
proviso to  clause (2)	of the draft <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_424">article 282-B</a>, which is
now the	 second proviso	 to <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_425">Article  311.</a> Further, the Court
should also  bear in  mind that	 clause (c)  of	 the  second
proviso and  clause (3)	 of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_426">Article  311</a> did  not feature in
section 240  of the  Government of India Act, 1935, but were
new provisions	consciously introduced	by  the	 Constituent
Assembly in  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_427">Article 311.</a>  Those who  formed the Constituent
Assembly were not the advocates of a despotic or dictatorial
form of	 government. They  were the persons who enacted into
our Constitution  the Chapter  on  Fundamental	Rights.	 The
majority of  them had  fought for  freedom and	had suffered
imprisonment in the cause of liberty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">216</span>
and they,  therefore, were  not likely to introduce into our
Constitution any  provision from  the earlier  Government of
India Acts which had been intended purely for the benefit of
a foreign  imperialistic power. After all, it is not as if a
government applied  to him.  There are	two remedies open to
him, servant  is without  any remedy when the second proviso
has been applied to him. There are two remedies open to him,
namely, departmental  appeal and  judicial review. The scope
and extent of these remedies will be considered later in the
course of this judgment.
</p><p id="p_101">     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_428">Article 14</a> and the Second Proviso
     The next  question which  false to	 be  considered	 is,
"Does <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_429">Article  14</a> make	any difference	to the	consequences
which flow  from the  second proviso  to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_430">Article 311(2)?"</a> It
was submitted  on behalf  of the  government  servants	that
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_431">Article 14</a>  in which  the principle  of natural	 justice are
comprehended  permeates	  the	entire	 Constitution	and,
therefore, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_432">Article  14</a> must  be read into the second proviso
to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_433">Article  311(2)</a> and	according if  not under that proviso
read by	 itself, under	it read with <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_434">Article 14</a> a government

elaborate inquiry  as would  be the case where clause (2) of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_435">Article 311</a>  applies. According	 to learned  Counsel this is
what is	 required by  the audi	alteram partem rule which is
one of	the two	 main principles  of natural Justice. In the

the ground  that the principles of natural justice have been
wholly	disregarded.  These  arguments	are  based  upon  an
imperfect understanding of the principles of natural justice
in their application in courts of law to the adjudication of
causes before  them and the function of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_438">Article 14</a> vis-a-vis
the other  provisions of  the Constitution  and particularly
the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_439">Article 311(2).</a>

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">217</span>
<p id="p_103">In Jowitt's  Dictionary of English Law (Second Edition, page
1221) it  is defined  as "rules	 derived from God, reason or
nature,	 as   distinct	from   man-made	 law."	Black's	 Law
Dictionary (Fifth Edition, page 925) states :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_74">	  "This expression,  'natural law',  or jus natural,
	  was largely used in the philosophical speculations
	  of the  Roman jurists of the Antonine age, and was
	  intended  to	 denote	 a   system  of	  rules	 and
	  principles  for  the	guidance  of  human  conduct
	  which, independently	of enacted  law	 or  of	 the
	  systems peculiar  to	any  one  people,  might  be
	  discovered by	 the rational  intelligence of	man,
	  and would  be found  to grow	out of an conform to
	  his nature, meaning by that word his whole mental,
	  moral, and  physical constitution.  The  point  of
	  departure  for   this	 conception  was  the  stoic
	  doctrine of  a life ordered 'according to nature',
	  which	 in   its  turn	  rested  upon	 the  purely
	  supposititious existence, in primitive times, of a
	  'state of nature;' that is, a condition of society
	  in which men universally were governed solely by a
	  rational and	consistent obedience  to the  needs,
	  impulses, and	 promptings of	their  true  nature,
	  such nature being as yet underacted by dishonesty,
	  falsehood, or indulgence of the baser passions. In
	  ethics  it   consists	  in   practical   universal
	  judgments which man himself elicits. These express
	  necessary and	 obligatory rules  of human  conduct

	  universe and	have been  promulgated by God solely
	  through human reason".</blockquote>
<p id="p_104">     There are	certain basic values which man has cherished
throughout the	ages. But man looked about him and found the
ways of	 men to	 be cruel  and unjust and so also their laws
and customs.  He saw  men flogged, tortured, mutilated, made
slaves, and  sentenced to  row the  galleys or	toil in	 the
darkness of  the mines	or to fight in an arena with wild an
hungry beasts of the Jungle or to die in other ways a cruel,
horrible and  lingering death.	He found  judges to be venal
and servile to those in power and the laws they administered
to be  capricious, changing  with the  whims of the ruler to
suit his  purpose. When, therefore, he found a system of law
which did  not so  change, he  praised	it.  Thus,  the	 old
Testament in the Book of Esther (I,19) speaks
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">218</span>
admiringly of  legal system  of the  Achaemenid dynasty (the
First Persian  Empire) in  which "a  royal commandment"	 was
"written among	the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that
it be  not altered."  Man saw  cities and  towns sacked	 and
pillaged,  their   populace  dragged   into  captivity	 and
condemned to  slavery - the men to labour, the women and the
girls to  concubinage, and  the young  boys to	be castrated
into eunuches  - their only crime being that their ruler had
the misfortune	to be  defeated in battle and to lose one of
his cities  or towns  to the  enemy. Thus, there was neither
hope nor  help in  man-made laws  or man-established customs
for they  were one-sided and oppressive, intended to benefit
armed might  and monied	 power and  to subjugate  the  down-
trodden poor  and the  helpless needy. If there was any help
to be  found or	 any hope to be discovered, it was only in a
law based  on justice  and reason which transcended the laws
and customs  of men,  a law  made by  some one	greater	 and
mightier than  those men who made these laws and established
these customs.	Such a	person could  only be a divine being
and such  a law	 could only  be "natural law" or "the law of
nature" meaning	 thereby "certain  rules of conduct supposed
to be  so just	that they  are binding upon all mankind." It
was not	 "the law of nature "in the sense of "the law of the
jungle" where  the lion devours the lamb and the tiger feeds
upon the  antelope because  the lion is hungry and the tiger
famished but  a higher	law of	nature or  "the natural law"
where the  lion and the lamb lie down together and the tiger
frisks with the antelope.
</p><p id="p_105">     Most, if  not all, jurists are agreed that "reason" and
"the nature  of man" constitute the fountain-head of natural
law but	 there	is  a  considerable  divergence	 of  opinion
amongst them  as also  amongst philosophers about the nature
and meaning  of that  law and  its relation to positive law.
Among the  ancients Greeks  the Sophists,  Artistotle in his
treatises on  "Logic" and  Ethics", and the Stoics developed
different theories.  The theory	 propounded by	Aristotle in
his "Logic"  adhered substantially  to the  point of view of
the Sophists,  namely, that man is a natural creature but is
also endowed  with reason. Later, in his "Ethics", Aristotle
came  to   distinguish	between	  natural   and	  legal	  or
conventional justice  and postulated  that natural  law	 had
authority everywhere  and was  discoverable by	the  use  of
reason. The  ancient Romans  were not given to philosophical
speculations or	 creative orignality  in Art. They preferred
to borrow  these from  the Greeks.  The Romans	were a hard-
headed, practical  race of  conquerors,	 administrators	 and
legislators. Roman  jurists, therefore,	 used the concept of
natural law,  that is  jus naturale  (or ius naturale as the
Romans wrote it because Roman alphabet had no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">219</span>
letter "J"  or "J"  in it) to introduce into the body of law
those parts of laws and customs of foreigners, that is, non-
Roman people  with whom	 they came in commercial contract or
whom they  subjugated. The  Rules which	 the Romans borrowed
from these laws and customs were those which were capable of
general application  and they  developed then  into  general
legal principles,  which came to form jus gentium or the law
of nations.  In doing  so they acted upon the principle that
any rule  of law  which was  common to	the nations (gentes)
they knew  of must  be basically  in consonance	 with reason
and, therefore, fundamentally just. They applied jus gentium
to those  to whom ius civile (civil law) did not apply, that
is, in	cases between  foreigners or between a Roman citizen
and a  foreigner. On  this basic  formulation that  what was
common to  all known  nations must  be	in  consonance	with
reason	and  justice,  the  Roman  jurists  and	 magistrates
proceeded to  the theory  that any  rule which instinctively
commanded itself to the sense of justice and reason would be
part of	 the jus  gentium. The jus gentium of the Romans was
different from what we call international law and should not
be confused  with it,  for the	scope of the jus gentium was
much wider than our international law. Because of the theory
of its	identity with  justice and  reason,  the  term	"jus
gentium" came  at times	 to be	used for  aequitas, that is,
equity as  understood by  the Romans, which was the basis of
praetorian law	or  the	 power	of  the	 praetors  to  grant
remedies where non existed under the jus civile. In the Dark
Ages the  expression "natural  law" acquired  a	 theological
base  and  the	Fathers	 of  the  Church,  particularly	 St.
Ambrose, St. Augustine and St. Gregory, held the belief that
it was	the function  of the  Church to bring about the best
possible  approximation	  of   human   laws   to   Christian
principles. As	Europe emerged	from the  Dark Ages in about
the  ninth  century,  Christianity  became  substituted	 for
reason as the supreme force in the universe, and this led to
the development of a theory of law in which Christianity had
the supreme  spiritual and  legal force	 and was superior to
all other  laws, with  the Church as the authentic expositor
of the	law of	nature. Gratian	 (Francisco Graziano) in the
twelfth	  century   in	 his   "Decretum"   or	 "Concordies
discordantium canonum" consider the law of nature as part of
the law	 of God.  According to St. Thomas Aquinas (1226-74),
natural law  was derived  from the  law	 of  God  which	 was
supreme and  such of  it as  was  intelligible	to  men	 was
revealed through  Church law  as the incorporation of divine
wisdom. Thus, according to this Theory, natural law was that
part of	 divine law which revealed itself in natural reason,
and man	 as a  reasonable being	 applied this part of divine
law to human affairs. This theory, though it upheld
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">220</span>
the supreme authority of the Church, made some concession to
the authority  of the  Emperor,	 that  is,  the	 Holy  Roman
Emperor.  Dante	  in  his   "De	 Monarchia"  championed	 the
supremacy of  the Holy Roman Empire as against the Church on
the ground  that the Emperor was the legitimate successor of
the Roman  people and  was chosen  by God to rule the world.
The authority  of the  law of  nature  or  natural  law	 was
repeatedly sought  support from	 during the  centuries which
saw the	 struggle for  supremacy between  the Popes  and the
General Councils of the Church and between the Popes and the
Emperors and later in the struggle between the Catholics and
the Protestants.  Both sides  in these	conflicts  found  in
natural law  the interpretation	 of scriptural	texts  which
supported  their   respective  views  and  were,  therefore,
according to them, the true interpretation. Braction, in the
thirteenth century,  however, considered natural law as that
which nature,  that is,	 God, teaches  to all  animals,	 and
though he  tried to reconcile natural law with human law, he
acknowledged the  difficulty of	 doing so  because he  found
rules of positive law which could hardly be so reconciled.
</p><p id="p_106">     Natural  law   was	 also	seized	upon  as  furnishing
arguments in  the struggle between the judges and Parliament
for supremacy  which took  place in the seventeenth century.
Coke in	 Dr, Bonham's case [1610] 8 Co. Rep. 113b, 118, said
by way	of obiter,  "when an  Act of  Parliament is  against
common right  or reason,  or repugnant,	 or impossible to be
performed, the	common law will control it, and adjudge such
Act to	be void."  There were  later assertions	 to the same
effect until the supremacy of Parliament and the legislation
enacted by it became firmly established in 1688. However, in
British Railways  Board	 v.  Pickin  sub  nomine  Pickin  v.
British Railways  Board, L.R.  [1974] A.C. 765, the argument
was once  again advanced  before the  House of	Lords that a
court was  entitled to	disregard a  provision in  an Act of
Parliament and	a distinction  was sought  be drawn for this
purpose between a public Act and a private Act. Referring to
the arguments  to this	point, Lord  Reid observed  (at page
</p><p id="p_107">782) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">	  "In earlier  times many  learned lawyers  seem  to
	  have believed	 that an  Act of Parliament could be
	  disregarded in  so far  as it	 was contrary to the
	  law of  God  or  the	law  of	 nature	 of  natural
	  justice, but since the supremacy of Parliament was
	  finally demonstrated by the Revolution of 1688 any
	  such idea has become obsolete."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">221</span>
<p id="p_108">Rejecting the above argument, the House of Lords unanimously
held that  the function	 of the	 court was  to consider	 and
apply the  enactments of Parliament, and accordingly, in the
course of  litigation, it  was	not  lawful  to	 impugn	 the
validity  of   a  statute   by	seeking	 to  establish	that
Parliament, in passing it, was misled by fraud or otherwise,
nor might  a litigant seek to establish a claim in equity by
showing that  the other	 party, by  fraudulently  misleading
Parliament,  had   inflicted  damage   on   him;   for	 any
investigation  into  the  manner  in  which  Parliament	 had
exercised  its	 function  would   or  might  result  in  an
adjudication by	 the courts,  bringing about a conflict with
Parliament.
</p><p id="p_109">     As a  result of  the infusion  of new  ideas during the
Renaissance and	 the Reformation, the intellectual authority
of reason  again came  to be  substituted for  the spiritual
authority of  divine law  as the  basis of natural law. This
new or	rather resuscitated basis of natural law was laid by
Grotius (Huigh	de Groot)  in his "De jure belli ac Pacis" -
the precursor or of modern public international law.
</p><p id="p_110">     Reason  as	 the  theoretical  basis  for  natural	law,
however, once again suffered a reversal at the hand of David
Hume.  According   to  Hume,   only  knowledge	obtained  by
mathematical reasoning	was certain; knowledge obtained from
other sciences	being only  probable. His  theory of justice
was that  it served  both  an  ethical	and  a	sociological
function. He  contended that  public utility  was  the	sole
origin of  legal justice  and the  sole	 foundation  of	 its
merit, and  that for  a legal  system to  be useful, it must
adhere to  its rules  even though  it may cause injustice in
particular cases.  He did  not make a formal analysis of law
but distinguished equity or the general system of  morality,
the legal  order, and  law, as a body of precepts. According
to him,	 the authority	of civil  law modified	the rules of
natural justice	 according to  the particular convenience of
each community.
</p><p id="p_111">     Blackstone, however,  in his  "Commentaries on the Laws
of England" had this to say about natural law :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_76">	  "This law  of nature,	 being coeval  with mankind,
	  and dictated by God himself, is of course superior
	  in obligation to any other. It is binding over all
	  the glove  in all  countries, and at all times; no
	  human laws  are of  any validity,  if contrary  to
	  this; and  such of  them as  are valid  derive all
	  their force  and all their authority, mediately or
	  immediately, from this original."</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">222</span>
<p id="p_112">     In the  nineteenth and  twentieth centuries there was a
reaction against natural law as the basis of law. The French
Revolution had	enthroned reason  as a goddess. The excesses
of the French Revolution, however, led to a reaction against
the theory that reason was the basis of law. The utilitarian
view was that the basis for law was the practical inquiry as
to what	 would most  conduce to	 the  general  benefit.	 The
spirit	of   scientific	 inquiry   which  pre-dominated	 the
nineteenth  and	  twentieth  centuries	 could	not   favour
hypotheses which were vague and unprovable. In the twentieth
century, disillusionment  with the  theory that	 good  could
come out  of the  power of  the State  and positive law has,
however, once  again brought  about a revival of interest in
natural law.
</p><p id="p_113">     Apart   from    providing	 the	subject-matter	 for
philosophical dissertations  and speculative theories on the
origin and attributes of natural law, the concept of natural
law has	 made invaluable  contribution to the development of
positive law. It helped to transform the rigidity of the jus
civile of  the Romans  into a more equitable system based on
the theory of the jus gentium. It provided arguments to both
sides in  the struggle	during the  Middle Ages	 between the
Popes and  the	Emperors.  It  inspired	 in  the  eighteenth
century the  movement for  codification of  law in  order to
formulate ideas derives from the concept of natural law into
detailed rules. England, the idea of natural law and natural
justices has  influenced its  law in  several respects.	 The
origin and  development of  equity in  England owed  much to
natural law. It also served as the basis for the recognition
or rejection  of a  custom. It	was looked to for support in
the struggle  for supremacy  which took	 place	between	 the
judges	and  Parliament	 in  the  seventeenth  century.	 The
concept of  natural law	 and natural  rights influenced	 the
drafting of the Constitution of the United States of America
and  many  of  the  amendments	made  thereto  as  also	 the
Constitutions of  its various States. It has provide a basis
for much  of  modern  international  law  and  International
Conventions, Covenants	and Declarations.  Above all, it has
enriched positive  law by introducing into it the principles
of natural  justice, divested  of all  their  philosophical,
metaphysical and  theological  trappings  and  disassociated
from their identification with, or supposed derivation from,
natural law.
</p><p id="p_114">     Natural justice has been variously defined by different
judges. A  few instances  will suffice.	 In Drew v. Drew and
Leburn [1855]  2 Macq.	1,8, Lord  Craworth  defined  it  as
"universal justice".  In James	Dunbar Smith  v. Her Majesty
The Queen
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">223</span>
[1877-78] 3  App. Cas.	614,623 J.C.,  Sir Robert P.Collier,
speaking for  the Judicial  Committee of  the Privy Council,
used the  phrase "the  requirements of substantial Justice",
while in  Arthur John  Spacmkman v.  The Plumstead  District
Board of Works L.R. [1884-85] 10 App. Case. 229,240, Earl of
Selborne,  L.C.,   preferred  the  phrase  "the	 substantial
requirements of	 justice". In  Vionet and another v. Barrett
and another  [1885] 55	L.J. Q.B.  39,41, Lord	Esher, M.R.,
defined natural	 justice as  "the natural  sense of  what is
right and  wrong".  While,  however,  deciding	Hopkins	 and
another v.  Smethwick Local  Board of  Health L.R.[1890]  24
Q.B.D. 712,716,	 Lord Esher,  M.R.,  instead  of  using	 the
definition given  earlier by  him in  <a href="/doc/703393/" id="a_442">Vionet and  another v.
Barret and  another</a>  chose  to	define	natural	 justice  as
"fundamental justice".	In Ridge  v. Baldwin and others L.R.
[1963] 1. Q.B. 539,578, Harman, L.J., in the Court of Appeal
equated natural justice with "fair play of action", a phrase
favoured by Bhagwati, J., in <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_443">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</a>
[1978] 2  S.C.R. 621,676. In re.H.K. (An Infant) L.R. [1967]
2 Q.B.	617,630, lord  Parker, C.J.,  preferred to  describe
natural justice	 as a  duty to	act fairly".  In  Fair-mount
Investment Ltd.	 v. Secretary  of State	 for the Environment
[1976] 1  W.L.R.  1255,1265-66,	 Lord  Russell	of  Killowen
somewhat picturesquely	described natural justice as "a fair
crack of  the whip".  While Geoffrey Lane L.J., in Regina v.
Secretary of  State for	 Home Affairs,	Ex  parte  Hosenball
[1977] 1 W.L.R. 766,784, preferred the homely phrase "common
fairness".
</p><p id="p_115">     As some judges, for instance, Ormond, L.J., in <a href="/doc/748834/" id="a_444">Lewis v.
Heffer and  others</a> [1978] 1 W.L.R. 1061,1076, have found the
phrase "natural	 justice" to  be  a  highly  attractive	 and
potent phrase".	 it may not be out of place, in order to set
the balance  right, to	reproduce a  passage, full of robust
common sense and biting Irony, from the judgment of Maugham,
J.., in	 Maclean v.  The Workers  Union L.R.  [1929]  1	 Ch.
602,624. That passage is as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_77">	  "Eminent judges have at times used the phrase 'the
	  principles of	 natural justice'. The phrase is, of
	  course, used	only in a popular sense and must not
	  be taken to mean that there is any justice natural
	  among men.  Among most  savages there	 is no	such
	  thing as  justice in	the modern sense. In ancient
	  days, a  person wronged  executed his own justice.
	  Amongst our  own ancestors, down to the thirteenth
	  century,  manifest  felony,  such  as	 that  of  a
	  manslayer taken  with his  weapon, or a thief with
	  the stolen goods, might be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">224</span>
	  punished by  summary execution without any form of
	  trial.  Again	  every	  student   has	  heard	  or
	  computation and  of or  deal;	 and  it  is  hardly
	  necessary to	observe that  (for example) a system
	  of or	 deal by water in which sinking was the sign
	  of innocence	and floating  the sign	of guilt,  a
	  system which	lasted in  this country for hundreds
	  of years,  has little	 to do	with modern ideas of
	  justice.  It	 is  unnecessary   to  give  further
	  illustrations. The truth is that justice is a very
	  elaborate conception, the growth of many centuries
	  of  civilization;  and  even	now  the  conception
	  differs widely  in countries	usually described as
	  civilized."</blockquote>
<p id="p_116">     In the  Supreme Court of Ireland, Black. J., in William
Green v.  Isidore J. Blake and others [1948] I.R. 242, after
referring to the above passage from the judgment of Maugham,
J., proceeded to state (at page 268) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">	  "I agree,  but what  then does it mean? We may, if
	  we   choose,	  describe   as	   'natural'   every
	  evolutionary advance in our conception of justice.
	  But for  me, natural	justice means  no more	that
	  justice without any epithet. I take the essentials
	  of justice  to mean those desiderata which, in the
	  existing   stage   of	  our	mental	 and   moral
	  development, we  regard as  essential, in  contra-
	  distinction  from   the  many	 extra	precautions,
	  helpful to  justice, but  not indispensable to it,
	  which, by  their rules  of evidence and procedure,
	  our Courts  have made	 obligatory in actual trials
	  before  themselves.  Many  advanced  peoples	have

	  does not  exist. The idea of negligence is equally
	  insusceptible of  exact  definition,	but  what  a

	  as  negligence  in  particular  circumstances	 are
	  equally capable  of serving  as tests	 in law, and
	  natural justice  as it has been interpreted in the

</blockquote><p id="p_119">(Emphasis supplied)
     How then  have the	 principles of	natural justice been
interpreted in the courts and within what limits are they to
be confined?  Over  the	 years	by  a  process	of  judicial
interpretation two  rules have	been evolved as representing
the principles	of  natural  justice  in  judicial  process,
including   therein    quasi-judicial	and   administrative
processes. They	 constitute the	 basic elements	 of  a	fair
hearing, having	 their roots  in the innate sense of man for
fair play  and justice	which is  not the  preserve  of	 any
particular race	 or country  but is  shared in common by all
men. The  first rule  is "nemo	judex in causa sua" or "nemo
debet esse  judex in propria causa" as stated in 12 Co. Rep.
114, that  is, no  man shall  be a  judge in his own cause".
Coke used  the form  "aliouis non debt esse judex in propria
causa quia  non potest esse judex et pars" (Co. Litt. 141a),
that is,  "no man  ought to  be a  judge in  his own  cause,
because he  cannot act	as a judge and at the same time be a
party". The  form "nemo	 potest esse  simul actor et judex",
that is, "no one can be at once suitor and judge" is also at
times used. The second rule - and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">226</span>
that is	 the rule  with which are concerned in these Appeals
and Writ  Petitions -  is "audi	 alteram partem".  that	 is,
"hear  the   other  side".  At	times  and  particularly  in
continental countries  the form "audietur et altera pars" is
used, meaning very much the same thing. A corollary has been
deduced from  the above	 two rules and particularly the audi
alteram partem	rule, namely,  "qui alliquid statuerit parte
inaudita altera, aequum licet dixerit, haud aequum fecerit".
that is,  "he who  shall decide	 anything without  the other
side having  been heard,  although he  may have said what is
right, will  not have  done what  is right"  (see  Boswell's
case) [1606]  6 Co.  Rep. 48b,52a, or, in other words, as it
is now	expressed, "justice  should not	 only  be  done	 but
should manifestly be seen to be done."
</p><p id="p_120">     The above two rules and their corollary are neither new
nor were  they the  discovery of  English judges.  They were
recognized in  may civilizations  and over  many  centuries.
Roman law  recognized the  need for  a judge to be impartial
and not	 to have  a personal interest in the case before him
(Digest V.1.17)	 and Tacitus  in his  "Dialogus" referred to
this principle. Under Roman law a judge who heard a cause in
which he  had an interest was liable as on a quasi-delict to
the party  prejudiced thereby  (Justinian's Institutes IV, 5
pr.;as also  Justinian's Codex	III, 5, 1). Even the Kiganda
tribesmen of  Buganda have  an old  proverb which  literally
translated means  "a monkey does not decide an affair of the
forest (see  "law and  Justice in  Buganda" by	E.S.  Haydo,
p.333).	 The   requirement  of	hearing	 both  sides  before
arriving at  a decision	 was part  of the  judicial oath  in
Athens. It also formed the subject-matter of a proverb which
was often referred to or quoted by Greek playwrights, as for
instance, by  Aritophanes in  his  comedy  "The	 Wasps"	 and
Euripides in  his tragedies  "Heracleidae" and "Andromache",
and by	Greek orators,	for  instance,	Demosthenes  in	 his
speech "De  Corona". Among the Romans, Seneca in his tragedy
"Medea" referred  to the  injustice of	coming to a decision
without a  full hearing.  In fact,  the corollary  drawn  in
Boswell's case	is taken from a line in Seneca's "Medea". In
the Gospel  according to  St. John(vii,51),  Nicodemus asked
the chief priests and the Pharisees, "Doth our law judge any
man, before  it hear  him, and know what he doeth?" Even the
proverb and songs of African tribesmen, for instance, of the
Lozi tribe  in Barotseland  refer to  this  rule  (see	"The
Judicia Process	 Among the Barotse Northern Rhodesia" by Max
Gluckman, p.102.)
     The two  rules "nemo  judex in  causa  sua"  and  "audi
alteram
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">227</span>
partem" and  their corollary that justice should not only be
done but  should manifestly  be seen  to be  done have	been
recognized from	 early days in English courts. References to
them are  to be	 found in the Year Books - a title preferred
to the	alternative one of "Books of Years and Terms"- which
were a	regular series,	 with a	 few gaps, of law reports in
Anglo-norman or	 Norman-French	or  a  mixture	of  English,
Norman-French and  French, which  had then  become the court
language, from	the 1270s  to 1535  or, as printed after the
invention of the printing press, from 1290 to 1535, that is,
from the  time	of  Edward  II	to  Henry  VIII.  The  above
principles of  natural justice came to be firmly established
over the  course of  centuries and have become a part of the
law of	the land. Both in England and in India they apply to
civil as  well as  to criminal	cases and to the exercise of
judicial,  quasi-judicial  and	administrative	powers.	 The
expression "natural  justice" is  now so  well understood in
England that  it has  been used	 without any  definition  in
statutes of Parliament, for example, in section 3(10) of the
Foreign Compensation  Act, 1969,  and <a href="/doc/23075613/" id="a_445">section  6(13)</a> of	 the
Trade Union  and Labour	 Reforms Act,  1974, which was later
repealed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment)
Act,  1976.   These  rules  of	natural	 justice  have	been
recognized  and	 given	effect	to  in	many  countries	 and
different  systems   of	 law.	They   have   now   received
international recognition  by being  enshrined in <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_446">Article 10</a>
of the	Universal Declaration  of Human	 Rights adopted	 and
proclaimed by  the General Assembly of the United Nations by

question which	then arises is "Whether the rules of natural
justice form part of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_450">Article 14</a> and, if so, how?"
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_82">	  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_451">Article  14</a>	of  the	  Constitution	provides  as
	  follows:

	  deny to  any person equality before the law or the
	  equal protection  of the laws within the territory
	  of India."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">228</span>
<p id="p_122"><a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_452">Article 14</a> thus contains an express Constitutional
injunction against  the	 State	as  defined  in	 <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_453">Article  12</a>
prohibiting the State from denying to any person(1) equality
before the  law, or  (2) the  equal protection	of the laws.
Neither of  these two  concepts are new. They are based upon
similar provisions  in other  Constitutions. One instance is
section 40(1)  of the  Constitution of	Eire of	 1937, which
occurs in  the Chapter	entitled Fundamental  Rights in that
Constitution. The  Constitution of  Eire begins	 on a strong
religious note. It starts by stating :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">	  "In the  name of  the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom
	  is all  authority and	 to Whom,  as our final end,
	  all  actions	both  of  men  and  States  must  be
	  referred.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_85">	  We, the people of Eire,
	  Humbly acknowledging	all our	 obligations to	 our
	  Divine  Lord,	 Jesus	Christ,	 Who  sustained	 our
	  fathers through centuries of tiral, ...... ".</blockquote>
<p id="p_123">     <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_454">Section 40(1)</a>  of that Constitution provides as follows
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_86">	  "All Citizens	 shall, as  human persons,  be	held
	  equal before the law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_87">	  This shall  not be  held to  mean that  the  State
	  shall not  in its  enactments have  due regard  to
	  differences of  capacity, physical  and moral, and
	  of social functions."
</blockquote><p id="p_124">Another instance  is <a href="/doc/452639/" id="a_455">Article 3(1)</a> of the Constitution of the
Federal Republic of Germany of 1948 which states:
</p><p id="p_125">     "All persons  shall  be  equal  before  the  law."	 Yet
another instance is section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution  of the  United  States  of  America  which
reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_88">	  "All persons	born or	 naturalized in	 the  United
	  States, and  subject to  the jurisdiction thereof,
	  are citizens of the United States and of the State
	  wherein  they	 reside.  No  State  shall  make  or
	  enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges
	  or immunities	 of citizens  of the  United States,
	  nor shall  any State	deprive any  person of life,
	  liberty, or  property, without due process of law,
	  nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
	  equal protection of the laws."

<p id="p_126">Constitution of	 some  other  countries	 also  have  similar
provisions  but	  as  these   Constitutions  have   suffered
political vicissitudes,	 it is unnecessary to refer to them.
Provisions  similar  to	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_456">Article  14</a>  are  to  be  found  in
International Charters	and Conventions.  Thus, <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_457">Article 7</a> of
the Universal  Declaration Human Rights of 1948, provides as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_89">	  "All are  equal before  the law  and are  entitled
	  without any  discrimination to equal protection of
	  the law ....."</blockquote>
<p id="p_127">     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_458">Article 14</a>	 is divided  into two  parts.  In    Re	 The
Special Courts	Bill, 1978 [1979] 2 S.C.R. 476, Chandrachud,
C.J., describe	the two	 parts of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_459">Article 14</a> as follows (at
page 534):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_90">	  "The first  part of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_460">article 14</a>, which was adopted
	  from the  Irish Constitution,	 is a declaration of
	  equality of the civil rights of all persons within
	  the territories  of India.  It enshrines  a  basic
	  principle of republicanism. The second part, which
	  is a	corollary of  the first	 and is based on the
	  last clause of the first section of the Fourteenth
	  Amendment of	the  American  Constitution  enjoins
	  that equal protection shall be secured to all such
	  persons in  the  enjoyment  of  their	 rights	 and
	  liberties without discrimination of favoritism. It
	  is a	pledge of the protection of equal laws, that
	  is, laws  that operate  alike on all persons under
	  like circumstances."</blockquote>
<p id="p_128">     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_461">Article 14</a>	 contains a guarantee of equality before the
law  to	 all  persons  and  a  protection  to  them  against
discrimination by  any law.  Sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of
<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_462">Article 13</a> defines law as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_91">	  "'law' includes  any	Ordinance,  order,  bye-law,
	  rule, regulation,  notification, custom  or  usage
	  having in  the territory  of India  the  force  of
	  law".
</blockquote><p id="p_129">What <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_463">Article  14</a> forbids  is discrimination by law, that is,
treating  persons  similarly  circumstanced  differently  or
treating those	not similarly  circumstanced in the same way
or, as has been pithily put, treating equals as unequals and
unequals   as	equals.	  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_464">Article   14</a>	 prohibits   hostile
classification by law and is directed against discriminatory
class legislation. The propositions deducible from decisions
of this court on this point have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">230</span>
been set  out in  the form  of thirteen	 propositions in the
judgment of  Chandrachud, C.J.,	 in In Re The Special Courts
Bill, 1978.  The first of these propositions which describes
the nature of the two parts of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_465">Article 14</a> has been extracted
earlier. We  are not  concerned in  these Appeals  and	Writ
Petitions with	the  other  propositions  set  out  in	that
judgment. In  early days,  this	 Court	was  concerned	with
discriminatory and  hostile class  legislation and it was to
this aspect  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_466">Article	 14</a> that its attention was directed.
As fresh thinking began to take place on the scope an anoint
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_467">Article  14</a>, new dimensions to this guarantee of equality
before the  law and  of the  equal protection  of  the	laws
emerged and  were recognized  by this Court. It was realized
that to treat one person differently from another when there
was no	rational basis	for doing  so would be arbitrary act
thus discriminatory.  Arbitrariness can	 take many forms and
shapes but  whatever form  or shape it takes, it is none the
less discrimination. It also became apparent that to treat a
persons or a class of persons unfairly would be an arbitrary
act amounting  to discrimination  forbidden by	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_468">Article	 14.</a>
Similarly, this	 Court, recognized that to treat a person in
violation of  the principles of natural justice would amount
to arbitrary  and discriminatory treatment and would violate
the guarantee given by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_469">Article 14.</a>

	  the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate and
	  relevant but is extraneous and outside the area of
	  permissible considerations,  it  would  amount  of
	  mala fide  exercise of  power and  that is  hit by

     Bhagwati, J.,  reaffirmed in  Maneka Gandhi's case what
he had	said in	 Royappa's case in these words (at page 673-
</p><p id="p_133">74):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_94">	  "Now, the  question immediately  arises as to what

In the course of his judgment in the same case Bhagwati, J.,
further said (at pages 676-7):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_95">	  "Now, if  this be the test of applicability of the
	  doctrine of  natural	justice,  there	 can  be  no
	  distinction between  a quasi-judicial function and
	  an administrative  function for  this purpose. The
	  aim of  both administrative  inquiry	as  well  as
	  quasi-judicial inquiry  is to	 arrive	 at  a	just
	  decision and	if a  rule  of	natural	 justice  is
	  calculated  to   secure  justice,  or	 to  put  it
	  negatively, to  prevent miscarriage of justice, it
	  is difficult to see why it should be applicable to
	  quasi-judicial inquiry  and not  to administrative
	  inquiry. It  must logically apply to both. On what
	  principle can	 distinction be made between one and
	  the other?  Can it be said that the requirement of

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_96">	  "The true  scope and	ambit of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_485">Article 14</a> has been
	  the subject matter of numerous decisions and it is
	  not necessary	 to make  any detailed	reference to
	  them. It  is sufficient  to state that the content
	  and reach  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_486">Article 14</a> must not be confused with
	  the doctrine	of classification. Unfortunately, in
	  the  early   stages  of   the	 evolution   of	 our

<blockquote id="blockquote_97">     The principles  of natural justice have thus come to be
recognized as  being a	part of	 the guarantee	contained in
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_488">Article 14</a>  because of	the new	 and dynamic  interpretation
given by  this Court to the concept of equality which is the
subject-matter of  that Article.  Shortly put, the syllogism
runs thus  violation of a rule of natural justice results in
arbitrariness which  is the  same as  discrimination;  where
discrimination is  the result  of  state  action,  it  is  a
violation  of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_489">Article	14:</a>  therefore,	 a  violation  of  a

natural justice,  however, apply not only to legislation and

of "State"  in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_492">Article	12</a>, is	charged	 with  the  duty  of
deciding a matter. In such a case, the principles of natural
justice require	 that it  must decide such matter fairly and
impartially.</blockquote>
<p id="p_135">     The rule of natural justice with which we are concerned
in these  Appeals  and	Writ  Petitions,  namely,  the	audi
alteram partem	rule, in  its fullest amplitude means that a
person against	whom an order to his prejudice may be passed
should be  informed of	the allegations	 and charges against
him, be	 given an  opportunity of submitting his explanation
thereto, have  the right  to know the evidence, both oral or
documentary, by	 which the  matter is proposed to be decided
against him,  and to  inspect the documents which are relied
upon for  the purpose of being used against him, to have the
witnesses who  are to  give evidence against him examined in
his presence  and have	the right to cross-examine them, and
to lead	 his own evidence, both oral and documentary, in his
defence. The  process of  a fair  hearing need not, however,
conform to  the judicial  process in a court of law, because
judicial  adjudication	 of  causes  involves  a  number  of
technical  rules   of  procedure   and	evidence  which	 are
unnecessary and	 not required  for the	purpose	 of  a	fair
hearing within	the meaning of audi alteram partem rule in a
quasi-judicial or  administrative inquiry.  If	we  look  at
clause (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_493">Article	311</a> in	the light  of what is stated
above, it will be apparent that	 clause is merely an express
statement  of	the  audi   alteram  partem  rule  which  is
implicitly made	 part of  the guarantee contained in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_494">Article
14</a> as  a result	 of  the  interpretation  placed  upon	that
Article by  recent decisions  of this  Court. Clauses (2) of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_495">Article 311</a>  requires that  before a  government servant  is
dismissed, removed  or reduced	in rank,  an inquiry must be
held in	 which he is informed of the charges against him and
given a	 reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of
those charges.	The nature  of the  hearing to be given to a
government servant under clauses (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_496">Article 311</a> has been
elaborately set	 out by	 this Court  in Khem chand's case in
the passages  from the judgment extracted above. Though that
case related  to the original clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_497">Article 311</a>, the
same applies to the present clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_498">Article 311</a> except
for the	 fact that  now a government servant has no right to
make any  representation against  the penalty proposed to be
imposed upon him but, as pointed out earlier, in the case of
<a href="/doc/1629479/" id="a_499">Suresh Koshy  George v. The University of Kerala and others</a>,
such an opportunity is not the requirement of the principles
of  natural   justice  and  as	held  in  <a href="/doc/1431558/" id="a_500">Associated  Cement
Companies Ltd.	v. T.  C. Shrivastava and others</a> neither the
ordinary law of the land nor industrial law requires such an
opportunity to be given. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">235</span>
Opportunity of	showing cause  against the  proposed penalty
was only  the result  of the  interpretation placed  by	 the
Judicial Committee  of the Privy Council in Lall's Case upon
section 240(3)	of the	Government of India, 1935, which was
accepted by  this Court in Khem Chand's Case. If, therefore,
an inquiry  held against  a government	servant under clause
(2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_501">Article 311</a> is unfair or biased or has been conducted
in such	 a manner  as not  to give  him a fair or reasonable
opportunity to	defend himself,	 undoubtedly, the principles
of natural justice would be violated, but in such a case the
order of  dismissal, removal  or reduction  in rank would be
held to	 be bad	 as contravening  the express  provisions of
clause (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_502">Article	311</a> and	 there will  be no scope for
having	recourse   to  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_503">Article	 14</a>  for   the	purpose	  of
invalidating it.
</p><p id="p_136">     Though  the  two  rules  of  natural  justice,  namely,

definite meaning  and connotation  in law  and their content
and implications  are well understood and firmly established
the are	 none the  less not  statutory rules.  Each of these
rules yields to and changes with the exigencies of different

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">	  "As observed	by this Court in <a href="/doc/639803/" id="a_508">Kraipak and Ors. v.
	  Union of India</a> the aim of rules of natural justice
	  is to	 secure justice	 or to	put it negatively to
	  prevent miscarriage  of justice.  These rules	 can

	  validly made.	 In other words they do not supplant
	  the law  but supplement  it. It  is true that if a

	  the principles  of  natural  justice,	 the  courts
	  should do  so because it must be presumed that the
	  legislatures and  the statutory authorities intend

<p id="p_140">     <a href="/doc/859161/" id="a_509">In Swadeshi  Cotton Mills	v. Union  of India</a>  [1981] 2
S.C.R. 533,  Chinnappa Reddy, J., in his dissenting judgment
summarized the	position in law on this point as follows (at
page 591):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_102">	  "The principles of natural justice have taken deep
	  root in  the judicial	 conscience of	our  people,
	  nurtured  by	Binapani,  Kraipak,  Mohinder  Singh
	  Gill,	 Maneka	  Gandhi  etc.	etc.  They  are	 now
	  considered so	 fundamental as	 to be	'implicit in
	  the concept  of ordered  liberty' and,  therefore,
	  implicit in  every decision  making function, call
	  it judicial,	quasi  judicial	 or  administrative.
	  Where authority  functions under a statute and the
	  statute  provides   for  the	 observance  of	 the
	  principles of	 natural  justice  in  a  particular
	  manner, natural  justice will	 have to be observed
	  in that  manner and  in no  other. No	 wider right
	  than that  provided by  statute can be claimed nor
	  can the  right be  narrowed. Where  the statute is
	  silent about	the observance	of the principles of
	  natural justice such statutory silence is taken to
	  imply compliance  with the  principles of  natural
	  justice. The	implication of natural justice being
	  presumptive it may be excluded by express words of
	  statute or  by  necessary  intendment.  Where	 the
	  conflict is  between the  public interest  and the
	  private interest, the presumption rust necessarily
	  be weak and may, therefore, be readily displaced."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_103">					(Emphasis supplied.)
     Not only,	therefore, can	the  principles	 of  natural
justice be  modified but  in exceptional cases they can even
be excluded.  There are	 well-defined exceptions to the nemo
judex in  causa sua  rule as also to the audi alteram partem
rule. The  nemo judex  in causa	 sua rule  is subject to the
doctrine of  necessity and  yields to  it as  pointed out by
this Court  in <a href="/doc/1619801/" id="a_510">J.Mohapatra  &amp; Co.  and another	v. State  of
Orissa and  another</a> [1985] 1 S.C.R. 322,334-5. So far as the
audi alteram  partem rule  is concerned, both in England and
in India,  it is  well established  that where	a right to a
prior notice  and an opportunity to be heard before an order
is passed would obstruct the taking of prompt action, such a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">238</span>
right can be excluded. This right can also be excluded where
the nature of the action to be taken, its object and purpose
and the	 scheme of the relevant statutory provisions warrant
its exclusion;	nor can	 the audi  alteram  partem  rule  be
invoked if  importing it would have the effect of paralysing
the administrative process or where the need for promptitude
or the	urgency of  taking action so demands, as pointed out
in Maneka Gandhi's  case at page 681. If legislation and the
necessities of	a situation  can exclude  the principles  of
natural justice	 including the	audi alteram  partem rule, a
fortiorari so  can a  provision or  the Constitution,  for a
Constitutional provision has a far greater and all-pervading
sanctity than  a statutory  provision. In  the present case,
clause (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_511">Article	311</a> is	expressly  excluded  by	 the
opening words  of the  second proviso  and particularly	 its
key-words this clause shall not apply. As pointed out above,
clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_512">Article 311</a> embodies in express words the audi
alteram partem	rule.  This  principle	of  natural  justice
having	been   expressly  excluded   by	  a   Constitutional
provision, namely,  the second	proviso	 to  clause  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_513">Article 311</a>,  there is	no scope  for reintroducing  it by a
side-door to  provide once  again the same inquiry which the
Constitutional provision  has expressly	 prohibited. Where a
clause of  the second  proviso is  applied on  an extraneous
ground or  a ground  having no	relation  to  the  situation
envisaged in that clause, the action in so applying it would
be mala	 fide, and,  therefore, void.  In such	a  case	 the
invalidating factor may be referable to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_514">Article 14.</a> This is,
however, the  only  scope  which  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_515">Article  14</a>  can  have  in
relation to  the second	 proviso. but  to hold that once the
second proviso is properly applied and clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_516">Article
311</a> excluded,  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_517">Article 14</a>  will step in to take the place of
clause (2)  would be  to nullify  the effect  of the opening
words of the second proviso and thus frustrate the intention
of the	makers of  the Constitution.  The second  proviso is
based on  public policy	 and is	 in public  interest and for
public good and the Constitution - makers who inserted it in
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_518">Article 311(2)</a>	were the best persons to decide whether such
an exclusionary provision should be there and the situations
in which this provision should apply.</blockquote>
<p id="p_141">     In this  connection,  it  must  be	 remembered  that  a
government servant  is not  wholly without  any opportunity.
Rules made  under the  proviso to  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_519">Article 309</a> or under Acts
referable to  that Article  generally provide for a right of
appeal except  in those	 cases where the order of dismissal,
removal or  reduction in  rank is passed by the President or
the Governor  of a  State because  they	 being	the  highest
Constitutional functionaries, there can be no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">239</span>
higher authority  to which  an appeal  can lie from an order
passed by  one of  them.  Thus,	 where	the  second  proviso
applies,  though   there  is   no  prior  opportunity  to  a
government servant  to defend  himself against	the  charges
made against  him   he has  the opportunity  to show  in  an
appeal filed  by him  that the	charges made against him are
not true.  This would  be a  sufficient compliance  with the
requirements of natural justice. In Maneka Gandhi's case and
in <a href="/doc/549062/" id="a_520">Liberty Oil Mills and others v. Union of India and others</a>
[1984] 3  S.C.C. 465   the  right to  make a  representation
after an  action was  taken was	 held  to  be  a  sufficient
remedy, and  an appeal	is a  much wider  and more effective
remedy than a right of making a representation.
</p><p id="p_142">     In support	 of the	 contention  that  even	 though	 the
second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_521">Article  311(2)</a>  excludes  any  right  of
hearing, such  a right	is none	 the  less  available  under
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_522">Article 14</a>,  reliance was placed on behalf of the government
servants upon the case of <a href="/doc/513801/" id="a_523">Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of
India</a> [1970]  3 S.C.R. 530. In our opinion, this reliance is

the correctness	 of the	 majority view in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_524">A.K.Gopalan v. The
State of  Madras</a> [1950]	 S.C.R. 88. In Gopalan's case it was

</p><p id="p_143">21. According  to the  majority view, it was the form of the

substantive rights  by requiring  a procedure and <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_526">Article 22</a>
laid  down   the  minimum  rules  of  procedure	 which	even
Parliament could not abrogate or overlook. Fazal Ali, J., in
his  dissenting	  judgment,  however,  took  the  view	that
preventive detention  was a direct violation of a sub-clause
</p><p id="p_144">(d)  of	  clause  (1)  of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_527">Article  19</a>,	 even  if  a  narrow

</blockquote><p id="p_148">The question in Gopalan's case and Cooper's case was whether
particular Articles guaranting certain Fundamental Rights
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">241</span>
operated exclusively  without having any inter-relation with

is not	the question  before us.  Neither <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_538">Article  19</a> or  21
excludes the  operation of the other Articles in Part III of
the  Constitution.   Where  however,   an  Article   in	 the
Constitution expressly	excludes the  application of certain
Fundamental Rights,  the view taken in Cooper's case and the
other cases  which followed it, namely, that the Articles in

fair hearing  guaranteed by  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_552">Article 14</a> would require and by
the opening  words of the second proviso to that clause that
right is  expressly taken away, and R.C.Cooper's case cannot
be invoked  to reintroduce  that right on the ground that it
flows by  implication from  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_553">Article 14.</a> If the contention of
the petitioner	that in	 all cases  there must be a right of
hearing before an order is made to a person's prejudice were
correct, the  result would  be startling  and anomalous. For

in his	separate but  concurring judgment in Moti Ram Deka's
case at	 page 734,  namely, that rules under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_572">Article 309</a> are
subject to  the pleasure  doctrine and the pleasure doctrine
is itself  subject to the two limitations imposed thereon by
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_573">Article 311.</a>  Thus, as	pointed out  in that  case, any rule
which contravenes  clause (1)  or clause  (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_574">Article 311</a>
would be invalid. Where, however the second proviso applies,
the only  restriction upon  the exercise  of the pleasure of
the President  or  the	Governor  of  a	 State	is  the	 one
contained in  clause(1) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_575">Article 311.</a> For an Act or a rule
to provide  that in  a case where the second proviso applies
any of	the safeguards	excluded by  that  proviso  will  be
available to  a Government  servant would amount to such Act
or rule	 impinging upon	 the pleasure  of the  President  or
Governor, as  the case	may be,	 and would  be void as being
unconstitutional. It  is, however,  a well-settled  rule  of
construction of	 statutes that where two interpretations are
possible,  one	 of  which   would  preserve  and  save	 the
constitutionality  of  the  particular	statutory  provision
while the  other would	render it unconstitutional and void,
the one	 which saves  and  preserves  its  constitutionality
should	 be   adopted	and   the   other   rejected.	Such
constitutionality can  be  preserved  by  interpreting	that
statutory provision  as directory  and not  mandatory. It is
equally well-settled  that where  a statutory  provision  is
directory,  the	  courts  cannot  interfere  to	 compel	 the
performance or	punish breach  of the  duty created  by such
provision and  disobedience  of	 such  provision  would	 not
entail any  invalidity -  see Craies on Statute Law, Seventh
Edition, at  page  229.	 In  such  a  case  breach  of	such
statutory provisions  would not	 furnish any cause of action
or ground  of challenge	 to a  government servant for at the
very threshold,	 such cause of action or ground of challenge
would be barred by the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_576">Article 311(2).</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">244</span>
<p id="p_153">     On behalf	of the	government servants  support for the
above contention  raised by  them was  sought to  be derived
from Challappan's case. Bearing in mind what has been stated
above, we  will, therefore,  now examine  Challapan's  case.
Before, however, we come to that case it would be convenient
to refer  to the  observations in  M. Gopala Krishna Naidu's
case, because it was by reason of the conflict between those
observations and  what was  held in  Challappan's case	that
these  matters	 have  all   some  to  be  decided  by	this
Constitution Bench.  M.Gopala Krishna  Naidu's case  was not
directly a  case under the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_577">Article 311(2).</a>
In that	 case the  appellant, who  was an  overseer  in	 the
Public Works  Department of  the Central Provinces and Berar
Government,  was   suspended  from   service  in   1947	 and
prosecuted under  <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_578">section 161</a>  of  the	Indian	Penal  Code.
Ultimately, on	orders from  the High Court, the prosecution
was  dropped.	The  appellant	was  also  exonerated  in  a
departmental  inquiry	held  against  him.  Thereafter	 the
Government by  an order	 held that  the charges	 against the
Appellant had  not been	 proved beyond	reasonable doubt and
the suspension of the appellant and the departmental inquiry
"were not  wholly unjustified". It accordingly directed that
the appellant  should be  reinstated in	 service with effect
from the  date of the said order and retired from that date,
he having  already attained  the age  of superannuation, and
that the  entire period	 of  absence  from  duty  should  be
treated as  period spent  on duty  under rule  54(5) of	 the
Fundamental Rules  for purposes of pension only, but that he
should not  be allowed	any pay	 beyond what he had actually
received or  what was  allowed to  him by way of subsistence
allowance during  the period  of suspension. The appellant's
writ petition  was dismissed  by the High Court. In appeal a
three Judge  Bench of  this Court  allowed the	appeal.	 The
court  held   that  rule   54  of   the	 Fundamental   Rules
contemplated a	duty to	 act in	 accordance with  the  basic
concept	 of  justice  and  fair	 play,	and  the  authority,
therefore had  to afford  a reasonable	opportunity  to	 the
appellant to  show cause  why clauses (3) and (5) of rule 54
should not  be applied and at this not having been done, the
order was  invalid. While discussing the scope of rule 54 of
the Fundamental	 Rules the  Court observed  as	follows	 (at
page, 358-59) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_106">	  "It is  true that  the order	under F.R.54 is in a
	  sense a  consequential order	in that	 it would be
	  passed after	an order  of reinstatement  is made.
	  But the fact that it is a consequential order does
	  not determine	 the question whether the government
	  servant has to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">245</span>
	  given an  opportunity to  show cause or not. It is
	  also true  that in  a case  where reinstatement is
	  ordered   after   a	departmental   inquiry	 the
	  government servant  would ordinarily	have had  an
	  opportunity to  show cause.  In such	a case,	 the
	  authority no	doubt  would  have  before  him	 the
	  entire record	 including the	explanation given by
	  the government  servant from	which all  the facts
	  and circumstances  of the case would be before the
	  authority and	 from which  he can form the opinion
	  as to	 whether he has been fully exonerated or not
	  and in  case of suspension whether such suspension
	  was wholly  unjustified or not. In such a case the
	  order passed	under a	 rule such  as	the  present
	  Fundamental  Rule   might  be	  said	 to   be   a
	  consequential	 order	 following  a	departmental
	  inquiry. But	there are  three classes of cases as
	  laid down  by the  proviso in	 <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_579">Article 311</a> where a
	  departmental inquiry	would not be held, viz., (a)
	  where a person is dismissed, removed or reduced in
	  rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his
	  conviction on	 a criminal  charge; (b)  where	 the
	  authority empowered  to dismiss or remove a person
	  or to	 reduce him in rank is satisfied for reasons
	  to  be   recorded  in	  writing  that	 it  is	 not
	  reasonably practicable to hold such an inquiry and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_107">	  (c) where  the President  or the  Governor as	 the
	  case may  be is  satisfied that in the interest of
	  security of  the State it is not expedient to hold
	  such inquiry.	 Since there  would be no inquiry in
	  these classes	 of cases  the authority  would	 not
	  have before  him any explanation by the government
	  servant. The authority in such cases would have to
	  consider and	pass the  order merely on such facts
	  which might be placed before him by the department
	  concerned. The  order in  such a  case would be ex
	  parte without	 the authority having the other side
	  of the  picture. In such cases the order that such
	  authority would  pass would not be a consequential
	  order as  where a  departmental inquiry  has	been
	  held. Therefore, an order passed under Fundamental
	  Rule 45 is not always a consequential order nor is
	  such order  a	 continuation  of  the	departmental
	  proceeding taken against the employee."</blockquote>
<p id="p_154">     Challapan's case decided three appeals against a common
judgment of  the High  Court of	 Rajasthan allowing the writ
petitions filed	 by three  railway servants. Challappan, the
respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">246</span>
in one	of these  appeals, was	a railway-pointsman.  He was
arrested  at   Olavakkot  Railway   Station   platform	 for
disorderly,  drunken   and  indecent   behaviour   and	 was
prosecuted and	convicted under	 section 51(a) of the Kerala
Police Act.  Instead of	 sentencing him, the sub-magistrate,
Palghat, released  him on  probation under  section  of	 the
<a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_580">Probation of  Offenders Act</a>, 1958. Thereafter he was removed
from  service	by  the	  disciplinary	authority   of	 the
Department, without holding any inquiry, on the basis of his
conviction in  the said	 criminal case. The order of removal
from service  was made	under clause  (i) of  rule 14 of the
Railway Servants  Rules. The  Kerala High Court held that as
no penalty  was imposed	 upon him, clause (i) of rule 14 did
not in terms apply, and allowed his writ petition. So far as
the other  two railway	employees were	concerned,  one	 was
convicted under	 <a href="/doc/197281033/" id="a_581">section 3</a> of the Railway Property (Unlawful
Possession) Act,  1966, and  the other	under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_582">section 420</a> of
the Indian  Penal  Code.  Both	of  them  were	released  on
probation and were similarly removed from railway service.
</p><p id="p_155">     The Railway  Servants  Rules  have	 been  made  by	 the
President in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso
to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_583">Article  309.</a> Rule 6 specifies the penalties which can be
imposed upon  a railway servant. These penalties are divided
into minor  penalties and  major penalties.  Major penalties
include	 removal   from	 service   which  is  not  to  be  a
disqualification for  future employment under the Government
or railway  administration and	dismissal from service which
is ordinarily to be a disqualification for future employment
under the  Government or  railway administration. Under sub-
rule (1)  of Rule  7, the  President may  impose any  of the
penalties specified  in Rule  6 on  any railway servant. Sub
rule (2)  of Rule  7 states  that without  prejudice to	 the
provisions of  sub-rule (1),  any of the penalties specified
in Rule	 6 may	be imposed  on	a  railway  servant  by	 the
authorities specified  in Schedules,  I, II  and III  to the
Railway Servants  Rules. Rules 9 and 10 prescribe a detailed
procedure  for	 imposing  major  penalties  while  Rule  11
prescribes  the	 procedure  for	 imposing  minor  penalties.
Originally, sub-rule  (5) of  Rule 10 required that a notice
be given  to a	railway servant informing him of the penalty
proposed  to   be  imposed   upon  him	and  giving  him  an
opportunity of	making	a  representation  on  the  proposed
penalty on  the basis  of the  evidence adduced	 during	 the
inquiry held  under Rule  9. The  whole of that sub-rule was
substituted by	the Railway Servants (Discipline and Appeal)
(Third Amendment)  Rules, 1978,	 to bring  sub-rule  (5)  in
conformity with	 clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_584">Article 311</a> as amended by the
Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment) Act,  1976. It may be
mentioned that on the respective dates of the orders
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">247</span>

Rule 10 formed part of the Railway Servants Rules and clause

</p><p id="p_167">     In Challappan's  case the Kerala High Court allowed the
writ petitions filed before it solely on the ground that the
orders of  the Magistrate  releasing the  concerned  railway
servants on  probation	did  not  amount  to  imposition  of
penalty as  contemplated by  Rule 14 of the Railway Servants
Rules. Reversing  that view  this Court	 held that  the word
"penalty" in  clause (i)  of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants
Rules does  not refer  to a sentence awarded by the Court to
the accused  on his  conviction but  it merely indicates the
nature	of   the  penalty  impossible  by  the	disciplinary
authority if  the delinquent  employee has been found guilty
of conduct  which has  led to  his conviction  on a criminal
charge. The Court observed (at pages 789-790) :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">250</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_120">	  "The view  of the  Kerala High  Court,  therefore,
	  that as  the Magistrate  released  the  delinquent
	  employee on  probation no  penalty was  imposed as
	  contemplated by  rule 15  (i) of the Rules of 1968
	  does not  appear to  us to  be legally correct and
	  must be  overruled. Nevertheless  we would  uphold
	  the order of the Kerala High Court, on the ground,
	  that the last part of rule 14 of the rules of 1968
	  which	  requires    the   consideration   of	 the
	  circumstances not having been complied with by the
	  disciplinary authority,  the order of removal from
	  service of  the delinquent  employee	was  rightly
	  quashed."
</blockquote><p id="p_168">The Court  pointed out	that clause  (i) of  Rule 14  merely
sought to  incorporate the  principle embodied in clause (a)
of the	second proviso.	 The Court  in	the  course  of	 its
judgment reproduced  the provisions of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_586">Article
311</a> alongwith  clause (a)  to the  proviso thereto,  at that
time clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_587">Article 311</a> in force being that clause as
amended by the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963,
that  is,   clause  (2)	  prior	 to  its  amendment  by	 the
Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment) Act,  1976,  and	 the
proviso thereto	 being the  same as  the second	 proviso  to
clause (2)  as amended	by  the	 Constitution  (Forty-second
Amendment) Act.	 The Court  then pointed out that there were
three stages  in a departmental inquiry under <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_588">Article 311(2)</a>
the third  being the  stage  before  actually  imposing	 the
penalty in  which final	 notice to  the delinquent  employee
should be  given to  show cause	 why  the  penalty  proposed
against him  be not  imposed on	 him. It  then	stated	that
clause (a)  of the  proviso (now the second proviso) <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_589">Article
311(2</a>), however,  completely dispensed	with all  the  three
stages of  a  departmental  inquiry  when  an  employee	 was
convicted on  a criminal charge because the employee already
had in the criminal trial a full and complete opportunity to
contest the  allegations against  him and  to make  out	 his
defence. The  Court pointed  out  that	clause	(a)  of	 the
proviso (now  the second  proviso)  is	merely	an  enabling
provision and  does not enjoin or confer a mandatory duty on
the disciplinary  authority to	pass an	 order of dismissal,
removal or  reduction in  rank the  moment and	employee  is
convicted. The Court then considered the extent and ambit of
the  last   part  of   Rule  14,  namely,  the	phrase	"the
disciplinary authority may consider the circumstances of the
case and  make such  orders there  on as  it deems  fit" and
stated its conclusions as follows (at pages 795-97) :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">251</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_121">	  "The	 word	 `consider'   has   been   used	  in
	  contradiction to  the word  `determine'. The rule-
	  making  authority   deliberately  used   the	word
	  `consider' and  not `determine'  because the	word
	  `determine' has  a  much  wider  scope.  The	word
	  `consider' merely  connotes that  there should  be
	  active application of the mind by the disciplinary
	  authority    after	considering    the    entire
	  circumstances of  the case  in order to decide the
	  nature and  extent of the penalty to be imposed on
	  the delinquent  employee on  his conviction  on  a
	  criminal charge.  This matter	 can be	 objectively
	  determined only  if  the  delinquent	employee  is
	  heard	 and  is  given	 a  chance  to	satisfy	 the
	  authority regarding  the final  orders that may be
	  passed by  the said authority. In other words, the
	  term `consider'  postulates consideration  of	 all
	  the aspects, the pros and cons of the matter after
	  hearing the  aggrieved  person.  Such	 an  inquiry
	  would be  a summary  inquiry to  be  held  by	 the
	  disciplinary	 authority    after   hearing	 the
	  delinquent employee.	It is  not at  all necessary
	  for the  disciplinary authority  to order  a fresh
	  departmental inquiry which is dispensed with under
	  rule 14  of the  Rules of  1968 which incorporates
	  the principle	 contained in <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_590">Article 311(2)</a> proviso
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_122">	  (a).	This   provision  confers   power   on	 the
	  disciplinary authority  to decide  whether in	 the
	  facts and  circumstances of a particular case what
	  penalty, if  at  all	should	be  imposed  on	 the
	  delinquent  employee.	  It  is   obvious  that  in
	  considering this matter the disciplinary authority
	  will have  to take into account the entire conduct
	  of the  delinquent employee,	the gravity  of	 the
	  misconduct committed	by him, the impact which his
	  misconduct is	 to have  on the  administration and
	  other extenuating  circumstances or  redeeming the
	  features if  any present in the case and so on and
	  so forth.  It may  be that  the conviction  of  an
	  accused may  be for  a trivial  offence as  in the
	  case of  the respondent  T.R. Challappan  in Civil
	  Appeal No. 1664 of 1974 where a stern warning or a
	  fine	would  have  been  sufficient  to  meet	 the
	  exigencies of	 service. It  is possible  that	 the
	  delinquent employee  may be  found guilty  of some
	  technical offence,  for instance, violation of the
	  transport rules  or  the  rules  under  the  <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_591">Motor
	  Vehicles Act</a> and so on, where no major penalty may
	  be attracted. It is difficult to lay down any hard
	  and fast rules as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">252</span>
	  the factors which the disciplinary authority would
	  have to  consider, but  I have  mentioned some  of
	  these factors by way of instances which are merely
	  illustrative and  not exhaustive.  In other words,
	  the  position	  is  that  the	 conviction  of	 the
	  delinquent employee  would be	 taken as sufficient
	  proof of  misconduct and  then the  authority will
	  have to  embark upon	a summary  inquiry as to the
	  nature and  extent of the penalty to be imposed on
	  the delinquent  employee and	in the course of the
	  inquiry if  the authority  is of  the opinion that
	  the offence  is too  trivial	or  of	a  technical
	  nature it may refuse to impose any penalty inspite
	  of  the   conviction.	 This  is  a  very  salutary
	  provision which  has been enshrined in these Rules
	  and one  of the purposes for conferring this power
	  is that  in cases where the disciplinary authority
	  is satisfied	that the  delinquent employee  is  a
	  youthful offender  who is  not  convicted  of	 any
	  serious offence  and shows  poignant penitence  or
	  real repentance he may be dealt with as lightly as
	  possible. This  appears to  us to be the scope and
	  ambit of  this provision. We must, however, hasten
	  to add  that we should not be understood as laying
	  down that the last part of rule 14 of the Rules of
	  1968 contains	 a licence to employees convicted of
	  serious offences  to insist  on reinstatement. The
	  statutory  provision	 referred  to  above  merely
	  imports a  rule of  natural justice  in  enjoining
	  that before  taking final action in the matter the
	  delinquent  employee	 should	 be  heard  and	 the
	  circumstances	 of  the  case	may  be	 objectively
	  considered. This  is in  keeping with the sense of
	  justice and  fair-play. The disciplinary authority
	  has  the   undoubted	power	after  hearing	 the
	  delinquent   employee	   and	  considering	 the
	  circumstances of  the case  to inflict  any  major
	  penalty on  the  deinquent  employee	without	 any
	  further departmental	inquiry if  the authority is
	  of the  opinion that	the employee has been guilty
	  of a	serious offence	 involving  moral  turpitude
	  and, therefore,  it is  not desirable or conducive
	  in the  interests of administration to retain such
	  a person in service.

	  submitted that  it may  not be  necessary for	 the
	  disciplinary authority  to hear  the	accused	 and
	  consider the	matter where  no provision like rule
	  14 exists, because in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">253</span>
	  such cases  the Government can, in the exercise of
	  its executive powers, dismiss, remove or reduce in
	  rank any  employee who  has been  convicted  of  a
	  criminal charge by force of proviso (a) to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_592">Article
	  311(2)</a> of  the Constitution.	In other  words, the
	  argument was	that to	 cases where  proviso (a) to
	  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_593">Article 311(2)</a>  applies a  departmental inquiry is
	  completely dispensed	with  and  the	disciplinary

	  terminate	the  services	of  the	  delinquent
	  employee. We	however, refrain from expression any
	  opinion on  this aspect  of the matter because the
	  cases of  all the  three respondents before us are
	  cases which  clearly fall  within rule  14 of	 the
	  rules of  1968 where	they have  been removed from
	  service without  complying with  the last  part of
	  rule 14  of the  Rules of 1968 as indicated above.</blockquote>
<p id="p_169">	  In  none   of	 the   cases  has  the	disciplinary
	  authority either  considered the  circumstances or
	  heard the  delinquent	 employees  on	the  limited
	  point as  to the  nature and extent of the penalty
	  to be	 imposed if at all. On the other hand in all
	  these	 cases	 the  disciplinary   authority	 has
	  proceeded  to	 pass  the  order  of  removal	from
	  service  straightaway	  on  the   basis   of	 the
	  conviction of	 the  delinquent  employees  by	 the
	  criminal courts." (Emphasis supplied)
     So far  as Challappan's  Case is  concerned, it  is not
possible to find any fault either with the view that neither
clause (a)  of the  second proviso  to	<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_594">Article	 311(2)</a>	 nor
clause (i)  of Rule  14 of  the Railway	 Servants  Rules  is
mandatory or with the considerations which have been set out
in the judgment as being the considerations to be taken into
account by  the disciplinary  authority	 before	 imposing  a
penalty	 upon  a  delinquent  government  servant.  Where  a
situation envisaged  in one  of the  three  clauses  of	 the
second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_595">Article 311(2)</a> or of an analogous service
rule arises,  it is  not mandatory that the major penalty of
dismissal, removal  or reduction  in rank  should be imposed
upon the concerned government servant. The penalty which can
be imposed  may be  some other major penalty or even a minor
penalty depending  upon the  facts and	circumstances of the
case. In  order to  arrive at a decision as to which penalty
should be  imposed, the	 disciplinary authority will have to
take into  consideration the  various  factors	set  out  in
Challappan's case.  It is,  however, not  possible to  agree
with approach  adopted in  Challappan's case  in considering
Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules in isolation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">254</span>
and apart  from the  second proviso  to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_596">Article	 311(2</a>), nor
with  the   interpretation  placed   by	 it  upon  the	word
"consider" in  the last	 part of Rule 14. Neither Rule 14 of
the Railways  Servants Rules  nor a  similar rule  in  other
service rules can be looked at apart from the second proviso
to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_597">Article  311(2).</a> The authority of a particular officer to
act as	a disciplinary	authority and  to impose  an penalty
upon a	government servant  is derived from rules made under
the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_598">Article 309</a> or under an Act referable to that
Article. As  pointed out earlier, these rules cannot impinge
upon the  pleasure of  the President  or the  Governor of  a
State, as  the case  may be,  because they  are	 subject  to
<a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_599">Article 310(1).</a> Equally, they cannot restrict the safeguards
provided by  clauses (1)  and (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_600">Article  311</a> as such a
restriction would be in violation of the provisions of those
clauses.  In   the  same   way,	 they  cannot  restrict	 the
exclusionary impact of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_601">Article 311 (2)</a>
because that  would be	to impose  a  restriction  upon	 the
exercise of  pleasure under  <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_602">Article 310(1)</a> which has become
free of	 the restrictions  placed upon	it by  clause (2) of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_603">Article 311</a> by reason of the operation of the second proviso
to that clause. The only cases in which a government servant
can be	dismissed, removed  or reduced	in rank	 by  way  of
punishment  without   holding  an  inquiry  contemplated  by
clause(2) of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_604">Article 311</a>  are the  three cases mentioned in
the second proviso to that clause. A rule which provides for
any other  case in which any of these three penalties can be
imposed	 would	 be  unconstitutional.	 Service  rules	 may
reproduce the  provisions of  the second proviso authorizing
the disciplinary  authority to	dispense  with	the  inquiry
contemplated by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_605">Article 311</a> in the three cases
mentioned in the second proviso to that clause or any one or
more of	 them. Such  a rule,  however, cannot  be valid	 and
constitutional without	reference to  the second  proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_606">Article 311(2)</a> and cannot be read apart from it. Thus, while
the source  of authority of a particular officer to act as a
disciplinary authority	and to	dispense with the inquiry is
derived from  the service  rules, the source of his power to
dispense with the inquiry is derived from the second proviso
to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_607">Article  311 (2)</a> and not from any service rules. There is
a  well-established   distinction  between   the  source  of
authority to  exercise a power and the source of such power.
The Court  in Challappan's  case was, therefore, in error in
interpreting Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules by itself
and not in conjunction with the second proviso (at that time
the only  proviso) to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_608">Article 311(2).</a>	It appears  that  in
Challappan's case  the Court  felt that	 the addition of the
words  "the   disciplinary  authority	may   consider	 the
circumstances of the case and make such orders
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">255</span>
thereon as it deems fit" warranted an interpretation of Rule
14 different from that to be placed upon the second proviso.
This is also not correct. It is true that the second proviso
does not  contain these	 words but  from this  it  does	 not
follow that  when  acting  under  the  second  proviso,	 the
disciplinary authority	should not  consider the  facts	 and
circumstances of  the case or make an order not warranted by
them. It  is also  not possible to accept the interpretation
placed	upon  the  word	 "consider"  in	 Challappan's  case.
According to the view taken in that case, a consideration of
the circumstances  of the case cannot be unilateral but must
be after  hearing the delinquent government servant. If such
were the  correct meaning  of the  word "consider", it would
render this  part of Rule 14 unconstitutional as restricting
the full  exclusionary operation  of the second proviso. The
word "consider",  however, does	 not bear the meaning placed
upon it in Challappan's case. The word "consider" is used in
Rule 14	 as a  transitive verb.	 The  meaning  of  the	word
"consider" as  so  used	 is  given  in	the  Oxford  English
Dictionary as  "To contemplate	mentally, fix the mind upon;
to think  over, meditate  or reflect  on,  bestow  attentive
thought upon,  given heed  to, take  note of."	The relevant
definition of  the word	 "consider" given in Webster's Third
New International  Dictionary is "to reflect on: think about
with a degree of care of caution". Below this definition are
given the  synonyms of	the word  "consider", these synonyms
being  "contemplate,  study,  weigh,  revolve,	excogitate".
While explaining  the exact  different shades  of meaning in
this group  of words, Webster's Dictionary proceeds to state
as under with respect to the word "consider".
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_124">	  "CONSIDER often  indicates little  more than think
	  about. It  may occasionally  suggest somewhat more
	  conscious direction  of thought,  somewhat greater
	  depth	  and	 scope,	  and	 somewhat    greater
	  purposefulness."
</blockquote><p id="p_170">It is  thus obvious that the word "consider" in its ordinary
and natural  sense is not capable of the meaning assigned to
it in  Challappan's case. The consideration under Rule 14 of
what penalty  should be	 imposed upon  a delinquent  railway
servant	 must,	 therefore,  be	  ex  parte  and  where	 the
disciplinary authority	comes to  the  conclusion  that	 the
penalty which  the  facts  and	circumstances  of  the	case
warrant is  either of  dismissal or  removal or reduction in
rank, no  opportunity of  showing cause against such penalty
proposed to  be imposed	 upon him  can be  afforded  to	 the
delinquent government servant. Undoubtedly, the disciplinary
authority  must	  have	regard	 to  all   the	 facts	 and
circumstances of the case as set out in Challapan's case. As
pointed out
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">256</span>
earlier, considerations of fair play and justice requiring a
hearing to  be given to a government servant with respect to
the penalty  to be  imposed upon  him do  not enter into the
picture when the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_609">Article 311(2)</a> comes into
play and  the same  would be  the position  in the case of a
service rule  reproducing the  second proviso in whole or in
part and  whether the  language used  is identical with that
used in	 the second  proviso or	 not. There  are a number of
orders which  are of  necessity passed	without hearing	 the
party who  may be  affected by them. For instance, courts of
law can	 and often do pass ex parte ad interim orders on the
application of	a plaintiff, petitioner or appellant without
issuing any notice to the other side or hearing him. Can it,
therefore, be  contended that  the judge  or judges,  as the
case may  be, did  not apply his or their mind while passing
such an order?
</p><p id="p_171">     The Decision  in Challappan's  case is,  therefore	 not
correct with respect to the interpretation placed by it upon
Rule 14	 of the Railway Servants Rules and particularly upon
the word  "consider" occurring in the last part of that rule
and interpreting  Rule 14  by itself  and not in conjunction
with the  second proviso  to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_610">Article  311(2).</a> Before parting
with Challappan's  case, we  may, also	point out that	case
never  held  the  field.  The  judgment	 in  that  case	 was
delivered on  September 15,  1975, and	it was	reported  in
[1976] 1  S.C.R.  at  pages  783ff.  Hardly  was  that	case
reported then in the next group of appeals in which the same
question  was	raised,	 namely,  the  three  Civil  Appeals
mentioned earlier,  an order  of reference to a larger Bench
was  made   on	November   18,	1976.	The  correctness  of
Challappan's case  was, therefore,  doubted  from  the	very
beginning.
</p><p id="p_172">     The next  service rule which falls for consideration in
these matters  is Rule	19 of  the Civil Services Rules. The
Civil Services	Rules are  also made  under the	 proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_611">Article	 309.</a>	The  scheme   of  these	  rules	 so  far  as
disciplinary proceedings  are concerned	 is very  similar to
that of	 the Railway  Servants Rules.  Rule 11 specifies the
penalties which	 can be	 imposed on  a	government  servant.
These penalties	 are divided  into minor penalties and major
penalties. Clauses (i) to (iv) of that rule specify what the
minor penalties are while clauses (v) to (viii) specify what
the  major   penalties	are.  The  major  penalties  include
compulsory retirement,	removal from service which is not to
be  a  disqualification	 for  future  employment  under	 the
Government and dismissal from service which is ordinarily to
be  a  disqualification	 for  future  employment  under	 the
Government. Rules 14 and 15
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">257</span>
prescribe the procedure to be followed where a major penalty
is to  be imposed while Rule 16 prescribes the procedure for
imposing a  minor penalty. Previously, under sub-rule (4) of
Rule 15 the government servant was also to be given a notice
of the	penalty proposed  to be	 imposed  upon	him  and  an
opportunity of	making representation  with respect  to such
proposed penalty.  However, by Government of India, Ministry
of Home	 Affairs  (Deptt.  of  Personnel  &amp;  Admn.  Reforms)
Notification No.  11012/2/77 -	Ests. dated August 18, 1978,
sub-rule (4)  was substituted  by a new sub-rule to bring it
in conformity  with the	 amendment made	 in  clause  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_612">Article 311</a>  by the  Constitution  (Forty-second  Amendment)
Act, and  the opportunity to show cause against the proposed
penalty was done away with. Rule 19 Provides as follows
	  "19. Special procedure in certain cases.
</p><p id="p_173">	  Notwithstanding anything  contained in  rule 14 to
	  rule 18-
</p><p id="p_174">	  (i) where  any penalty  is imposed  on  Government
	  servant on  the ground of conduct which has led to
	  his conviction on a criminal charge, or
</p><p id="p_175">	  (ii) where the disciplinary authority is satisfied
	  for reasons  to be  recorded by it in writing that
	  it  is  not  reasonably  practicable	to  hold  an
	  inquiry in the manner provided in these rules, or,
</p><p id="p_176">	  (iii) where the President is satisfied that in the
	  interest of  the security  of the State, it is not
	  expedient  to	 hold  any  inquiry  in	 the  manner

	  circumstances of  the case  and make	such  orders
	  thereon as it deems fit;
</p><p id="p_177">	  Provided that	 the Commission	 shall be consulted,
	  where such  consultation is  necessary, before any
	  orders are made in any case under this rule."
The word  "Commission" is defined by clause (d) of Rule 2 as
meaning "The  Union Public  Service Commission".  Under Rule
22, no	appeal	is  lies  against  any	order  made  by	 the
President or orders
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">258</span>
of certain  nature specified  in that  rule. Subject  to the
provisions of  Rule 22,	 Rule 23  provided for	a  right  of
appeal. Rule  25 provides  for a  period of  limitation	 for
filing an  appeal but  the appellate  authority is conferred
the power to condone the delay in filing the appeal if it is
satisfied that	the appellant  had sufficient  cause for not
preferring the	appeal	in  time.  Rule	 27(2)	provides  as
follows:

<p id="p_182">     It will  be noticed  that	Rule  37,  except  the	last
paragraph thereof,  is in  pari materia	 with Rule 14 of the
Railway Servants  Rules and  Rule 19  of the  Civil Services
Rules with  this difference  that a provision akin to clause
</p><p id="p_183">(iii) of  Rule 14  of the  Railway Servants Rules and clause
</p><p id="p_184">(iii) of  Rule 19  of the  Civil Services Rules is not to be
found in  Rule 37 of the CISF Rules. The same interpretation
as placed  by us on the word "consider" occurring in Rule 14
of the	Railway Servants  Rules and  Rule 19  of  the  Civil
Services Rules	must, therefore,  be placed  upon  the	word
"consider" in  Rule 37 of the CISF Rules. The last paragraph
of Rule	 37 of the CISF Rules is peculiar to itself and does
not find a place either in the said Rule 14 or the said Rule
</p><p id="p_185">19. It is clumsily worded and makes little sense. To provide
that a	member of  the CIS  Force who  has been convicted to
rigorous  imprisonment	 on  a	criminal  charge  "shall  be
dismissed from service" and at the same time to provide that
"only a notice shall be given to the party charged proposing
the punishment of dismissal for his having been convicted to
rigorous imprisonment  and asking  him to  explain as to why
the proposed punishment of dismissal should not be imposed",
is a  contradiction in	terms, If either of these provisions
were taken  as mandatory,  it would be void as violating the
second	proviso	  to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_622">Article  311(2)</a>  because	the  penalty
contemplated by	 the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_623">Article 311(2)</a> is not
the penalty  of	 dismissal  only  but  also  of	 removal  or
reduction in  rank, and	 to make  it mandatory	to  issue  a
notice	to  show  cause	 against  the  proposed	 penalty  of
dismissal would	 equally violate  the second proviso because
it would  whittle down the exclusionary effect of the second
proviso.  Therefore,  both  these  provisions  in  the	last
paragraph of  Rule 37  must be	read as	 directory  and	 not
mandatory, not	only to	 make sense  out of them but also to
preserve their constitutionality. So read, a breach of these
provisions would  not afford any cause of action to a member
of the CIS Force.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">264</span>
<p id="p_186">     A conspectus  of the  above service  rules and the CISF
Act shows  that a government servant who has been dismissed,
removed or  reduced  in	 rank  without	holding	 an  inquiry
because his case falls under one of the three clauses of the
second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_624">Article  311(2)</a> or  a  provision  of	 the
service rules  analogous thereto  is not  wholly  without  a
remedy. He  has a remedy by way of an appeal, revision or in
some cases  also by way of review. Sub-clause (ii) of clause
</p><p id="p_187">(c) of	the first  proviso of  Rule  25(1)  of	the  Railway
Servants Rules	expressly provides  that in  the case  of  a
major penalty  where an	 inquiry  has  not  been  held,	 the
revising authority  shall itself hold such inquiry or direct
such inquiry  to be  held. This is, however, made subject to
the provisions of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules. The
other service  rules referred  to above not appear to have a
similar provision  nor does  the Railway Servants Rules make
the same  provision in the case of an appeal. Having regard,
however, to  the factors  to be	 taken into consideration by
the appellate  authority which	are set	 out in	 the service
rules  referred	  to  above  a	provision  similar  to	that
contained in  sub-clause (ii)  of  clause(c)  of  the  first
proviso to  Rule 25(1)	of the Railway Servants Rules should
be read	 and imported into provisions relating to appeals in
the Railway  Servants Rules  and in  the other service rules
and also in the provisions relating to revision in the other
service rules.	This would,  of course,	 be subject  to	 the
second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_625">Article  311(2</a>), Rule  14 of	 the Railway
Servants Rules	Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules and Rule
37 of  the CISF	 Rules. Thus,  such a  right to	 an  inquiry
cannot be  availed of where clause (a) to the second proviso
of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_626">Article 311(2)</a> or a similar provision in any service rule
applies in  order to  enable a government servant to contend
that he was wrongly convicted by the criminal court. He can,
however, contend  that in the facts and circumstances of the
case, the  penalty imposed  upon him  is too  severe  or  is
excessive. He  can also	 show that  he is  not in  fact	 the
government servant  who was  convicted on  a criminal charge
and that  it is	 a case	 of mistaken identity. Where it is a
case falling  under clause(b)  of the  second proviso  or  a
provision  in  the  service  rules  analogous  thereto,	 the
dispensing with	 the inquiry  by the  disciplinary authority
was the	 result of the situation prevailing at that time. If
the situation  has changed  when the  appeal or	 revision is
heard, the  government servant	can claim to have an inquiry
held in	 which he can establish that he is not guilty of the
charges on  which he  has been dismissed, removed or reduced
in rank.  He, however, cannot by reason of the provisions of
clause(3) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_627">Article 311</a> contend that the inquiry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">265</span>
was wrongly dispensed with and it was reasonably practicable
to hold	 an inquiry  because by	 the  said  clause  (3)	 the
decision on  this point	 of the	 disciplinary authority	 has
been  made  final.  So	far  as	 clause	 (c)  is  concerned,
dispensing with the inquiry depends upon the satisfaction of
the President  or the  Governor, as the case may be, that in
the interest  of  the  security	 of  the  State	 it  is	 not
expedient to  hold an  inquiry. In  such a  case,  an  order
imposing penalty  can, however	be passed  by a disciplinary
authority because  in such  a  case  the  President  or	 the
Governor, as  the case	may be,	 can direct the disciplinary
authority to  consider the  facts of the case and impose the
appropriate penalty  without  holding  any  inquiry.  Clause
</p><p id="p_188">(iii) of  Rule 14  of the  Railway Servants Rules and clause
</p><p id="p_189">(iii) of  Rule 19  of the Civil Services Rules envisage this
being done. In such a case the satisfaction that the inquiry
should be  dispensed with  as not  being  expedient  in	 the
interest of  the security  of the State would be that of the
President or the Governor, the selection of one of the three
penalties mentioned  in <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_628">Article	 311(2)</a> as  being the proper
penalty	 to   be  imposed   would  be  of  the	disciplinary
authority. The satisfaction of the President or the Governor
cannot	be   challenged	 in   appeal  or  revision  but	 the
government servant  can in  appeal or  revision ask  for  an
inquiry to  be held  into his alleged conduct unless even at
the time  of the  appeal or  revision, the  interest of	 the
security of  the State	makes it inexpedient to hold such an
inquiry. Of  course, no	 such right  would be available to a
government servant where the order imposing penalty has been
made by	 the President	or the	Governor of  a State, as the
case may be.
</p><p id="p_190">     Executive Instructions and the Second Proviso
     In	 the  course  of  the  arguments  certain  executive
instructions issued by the Government of India were referred
to and	relied upon on behalf of the government servants. It
is unnecessary to deal with these instructions in detail. At
the highest  they contain  the opinion	of the Government of
India on  the scope  and effect	 of the	 second	 proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_629">Article 311(2)</a>	and cannot  be binding	upon the  Court with
respect to  the interpretation	it should  place  upon	that
proviso.  To  the  extent  that	 they  may  liberalized	 the
exclusionary effect  of the  second proviso they can only be
taken as  directory. Executive	instruction stand on a lower
footing than a statutory rule for they do not have the force
of a  statutory rule.  If an  Act or  a rule cannot alter or
liberalized the	 exclusionary effect  of the second proviso,
executive instructions can do so even much less.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">266</span>
<p id="p_191">     Omission to  Mention the  Relevant Clause of the Second
Proviso or the Relevant Service Rule in the Impugned Orders
     Some of the orders impugned before us refer only to one
or the	other of  the three clauses of the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_630">Article	 311(2)</a>	 for  dispensing  with	an  inquiry  without
referring to the relevant service rule, some refer both to a
clause of  the second proviso and the relevant service rule,
while the  others refer	 only to  the relevant	service rule
without making	any mention  of the particular clause of the
second proviso	which has  been	 applied.  The	question  is
whether the omission to mention the particular clause of the
second proviso	or  the	 relevant  service  rule  makes	 any
difference.
</p><p id="p_192">     As pointed	 out earlier,  the source  of authority of a
particular officer to act as a disciplinary authority and to
dispense with  the inquiry is derived from the service rules
while  the   source  of	 his  power  to	 dispense  with	 the
disciplinary inquiry  is derived  from the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_631">Article 311(2).</a>	 There cannot  be an  exercise	of  a  power
unless such  power exists  in law.  If such  power does	 not
exist in  law, the  purported exercise	of it  would  be  an
exercise of  a non-existent  power and	would be  void.	 The
exercise of  a power  is, therefore, always referable to the
source of  such power  and must be considered in conjunction
with it.  The Court's attention in Challappan's Case was not
drawn to  this settled	position in  law and hence the error
committed by  it in  considering  Rule	14  of	the  Railway
Servants Rules by itself and without taking into account the
second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_632">Article  311(2).</a> It	is also well settled
that where  a source  of power	exists, the exercise of such
power is  referable only  to that  source and not some other
source under  which were  that power exercised, the exercise
of such	 power would  be invalid  and without  jurisdiction.
Similarly, if  a source	 of power exists by reading together
two provisions, whether statutory or constitutional, and the
order refers  to only one of them, the validity of the order
should be  upheld by  construing it as an order passed under
both those  provisions. Further, even the mention of a wrong
provision or  the omission  to mention	the provision  which
contains the  source of	 power will  not invalidate an order
where the  source of such power exists. (<a href="/doc/1733535/" id="a_633">See Dr. Ram Manohar
Lohia v.  State of  Bihar and others</a> [1966] 1 S.C.R. 709,721
and <a href="/doc/866068/" id="a_634">The	 Municipal Corporation	of the	City of Ahmedabad v.
Ben Hiraben Manilal</a> [1983] 2 S.C.R. 676,681. The omission to
mention in  the impugned  orders the  relevant clause of the
second proviso	or  the	 relevant  service  rule  will	not,
therefore, have the effect of invalidating
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">267</span>
the orders  and the  orders must be read as having been made
under the applicable clause of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_635">Article
311(2)</a> read  with the  relevant	 service  rule.	 It  may  be
mentioned that	in none of the matters before us has it been
contended that	the disciplinary  authority which passed the
impugned order was not competent to do so.
</p><p id="p_193">     The Second Proviso - Clause (a)
     Not much  remains to  be said  about clause  (a) of the
second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_636">Article  311(2).</a> To recapitulate briefly,
where  a   disciplinary	 authority  comes  to  know  that  a
government servant  has been convicted on a criminal charge,
it must	 consider whether  his conduct	which has led to his
conviction was	such as warrants the imposition of a penalty
and, if so, what that penalty should be. For that purpose it
will have  to peruse  the judgment of the criminal court and
consider all the facts and circumstances of the case and the
various factors set out in Challappan's case. This, however,
has to	be done	 by it	ex parte  and by  itself.  Once	 the
disciplinary  authority	 reaches  the  conclusion  that	 the
government servant's  conduct was  such as  to	require	 his
dismissal or  removal from  service or	reduction in rank he
must decide which of these three penalties should be imposed
on him.	 This too it has to do by itself and without hearing
the  concerned	 government  servant   by  reason   of	 the
exclusionary effect  of the second proviso. The disciplinary
authority must, however, bear in mind that a conviction on a
criminal charge	 does not  automatically  entail  dismissal,
removal or  reduction in  rank of  the concerned  government
servant. Having	 decided which	of these  three penalties is
required to  be imposed, he has to pass the requisite order.
A government servant who is aggrieved by the penalty imposed
can agitate  in appeal,	 revision or review, as the case may
be, that  the penalty  was too	severe or  excessive and not
warranted by  the facts and circumstances of the case. If it
is his	case that  he is  not the government servant who has
been in fact convicted, he can also agitate this question in
appeal,	 revision   or	review.	 If  he	 fails	in  all	 the
departmental remedies  and still wants to pursue the matter,
he can	invoke the  court's power of judicial review subject
to the	court permitting  it. If the court finds that he was
not in	fact the  person convicted,  it will strike down the
impugned order	and order  him to  be reinstated in service.
Where the  court finds	that  the  penalty  imposed  by	 the
impugned order	is arbitrary  or grossly excessive or out of
all proportion	to the offence committed or not warranted by
the facts  and circumstances of the case or the requirements
of that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">268</span>
particular government  service the  court will	also  strike
down the  impugned order.  Thus, in <a href="/doc/1848163/" id="a_637">Shankar Dass v. Union of
India and another</a>, [1985] 2 S.C.C. 358, this Court set aside
the impugned order of penalty on the ground that the penalty
of dismissal  from service  imposed upon  the appellant	 was
whimsical and ordered his reinstatement in service with full
back wages.  It is,  however, not  necessary that  the Court
should always  order reinstatement.  The Court	can  instead
substitute a  penalty which in its opinion would be just and
proper in the circumstances of the case.
</p><p id="p_194">     The Second Proviso - Clause (b)
     The main  thrust of the arguments as regards clause (b)
of the	second proviso	to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_638">Article  311(2)</a> was that whatever
the  situation	may  be	 minimal  inquiry  or  at  least  an
opportunity to	show cause  against the	 proposed penalty is
always feasible	 and is	 required by law. The arguments with
respect to  a minimal  inquiry were  founded on the basis of
the applicability  of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_639">Article	14</a>  and	 the  principles  of
natural	 justice  and  the  arguments  with  respect  to  an
opportunity to	show cause against the proposed penalty were
in addition  founded upon the decision in Challappan's case.
These contentions have already been dealt with and negatived
by us  and we have further held that Challappan's case in so
far as	it held	 that a	 government servant  should be heard
before imposing a penalty upon him was wrongly decided.
</p><p id="p_195">     The  next	contention  was	 that  even  if	 it  is	 not
reasonably practicable	to hold	 an  inquiry,  a  government
servant can  be placed	under suspension until the situation
improves and  it becomes  possible to hold the inquiry. This
contention also	 cannot be  accepted. Very often a situation
which makes it not reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry
is of  the creation  of	 the  concerned	 government  servant
himself or  of himself	acting in  concert with others or of
his associates.	 It can	 even be  that he  himself is  not a
party to  bringing about  that situation.  In all such cases
neither public interest nor public good requires that salary
or subsistence	allowance should be continued to be paid out
of the public exchequer to the concerned government servant.
It should  also be  borne in  mind that	 in the	 case  of  a
serious situation  which renders  the holding  of an inquiry
not reasonably practicable, it would be difficult to foresee
how long  the situation	 will last  and when  normalcy would
return or  be restored. It is impossible to draw the line as
to the	period of  time	 for  which  the  suspension  should
continue and  on the  expiry of that period action should be
taken under clause (b) of the second proviso.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">269</span>
<p id="p_196">Further, the  exigencies of  a situation  may  require	that
prompt action  should be taken and suspending the government
servant cannot	serve  the  purpose.  Sometimes	 not  taking
prompt action  may result  in the  trouble spreading and the
situation worsening and at times becoming uncontrolable. Not
taking prompt  action may  also be construed by the trouble-
makers and  agitators as sign of weakness on the part of the
authorities and	 thus encourage them to step up the tempo of
their activities  or agitation.	 It is true that when prompt
action is taken in order to prevent this happening, there is
an element  of deterrence  in it  but that is an unavoidable
and necessary  concomitance of such an action resulting from
a situation which is not of the creation of the authorities.
After all,  clause  (b)	 is  not  meant	 to  be	 applied  in
ordinary, normal  situations but in such situations where is
not reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry.
</p><p id="p_197">     The condition  precedent for  the application of clause
</p><p id="p_198">(b) is	the satisfaction  of the disciplinary authority that
"it is	not reasonably	practicable  to	 hold"	the  inquiry
contemplated by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_640">Article 311.</a> What is pertinent
to  note   is  that  the  words	 used  are  "not  reasonably
practicable"  and  not	"impracticable".  According  to	 the
Oxford English	Dictionary "practicable"  means "Capable  of
being put  into practice,  carried out	in action, effected,
accomplished,  or   done;  feasible".  Webster's  Third	 New
International  Dictionary  defines  the	 word  "practicable"
inter alia  as meaning	"possible to  practice or  perform :
capable of  being put  into practice, done or accomplished :
feasible". Further, the words used are not "not practicable"
but  "not   reasonably	practicable".  Webster's  Third	 New
International Dictionary  defines the  word "reasonably"  as
"in a  reasonable manner  : to	a fairly sufficient extent".
Thus, whether  it was practicable to hold the inquiry or not
must be	 judged in  the context of whether it was reasonably
practicable to	do  so.	 It  is	 not  a	 total	or  absolute
impracticability which	is required  by clause	(b). What is
requisite  is  that  the  holding  of  the  inquiry  is	 not
practicable in	the opinion  of a  reasonable man  taking  a
reasonable view	 of the	 prevailing  situation.	 It  is	 not
possible to  enumerate the  cases in  which it	would not be
reasonably  practicable	  to  hold  the	 inquiry,  but	some
instances by  way of illustration may, however, be given. It
would not be reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry where
the government	servant, particularly  through	or  together
with his  associates, so terrorizes, threatens or intimidate
witnesses who  are going  to given evidence against him with
fear of	 reprisal as  to prevent them from doing so or where
the government servant by himself or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">270</span>
together with  or through  other threatens,  intimidates and
terrorizes the	officer who is the disciplinary authority or
member of  his family  so that	he is  afraid  to  hold	 the
inquiry or  direct it  to be  held. It	would  also  not  be
reasonably  practicable	  to  hold   the  inquiry  where  an
atmosphere  of	violence  or  of  general  indiscipline	 and
insubordination prevails,  and it  is immaterial whether the
concerned government  servant  is  or  is  not	a  party  to
bringing about	such an	 atmosphere. In	 this connection, we
must bear  in mind  that numbers coerce and terrify while an
individual may not. The reasonable practicability of holding
an inquiry  is a  matter of  assessment to  be made  by	 the
disciplinary authority.	 Such authority	 is generally on the
spot  and  knows  what	is  happening.	It  is	because	 the
disciplinary authority	is  the	 best  judge  of  this	that
clause(3)  of	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_641">Article	 311</a>   makes  the  decision  of	 the
disciplinary   authority   on	this   question	  final.   A
disciplinary authority	is not	expected to  dispense with a
disciplinary  inquiry  lightly	or  arbitrarily	 or  out  of
ulterior motives  or merely in order to avoid the holding of
an inquiry  or because	the Department's  case	against	 the
government servant is weak and must fail. The finality given
to the	decision of  the disciplinary  authority by  <a href="/doc/1541873/" id="a_642">Article
311(3)</a> is  not binding upon the court so far as its power of
judicial review	 is concerned  and in  such a case the court
will strike  down the  order dispensing	 with the inquiry as
also the  order imposing  penalty. The case of <a href="/doc/917239/" id="a_643">Arjun Chaubey
v. Union  of India  and others</a>,	 [1984] 3  S.C.R. 302, is an
instance in  point. In	that case, the appellant was working
as a  senior clerk  in the  office of  the Chief  Commercial
Superintendent,	 Northern   Railway,  Varanasi.	 The  Senior
Commercial Officer  wrote a  letter to the appellant calling
upon him  to submit  his explanation  with regard  to twelve
charges of  gross indiscipline mostly relating to the Deputy
Chief Commercial Superintendent. The appellant submitted his
explanation and	 on the	 very  next  day  the  Deputy  Chief
Commercial Superintendent  served a  second  notice  on	 the
appellant saying that his explanation was not convincing and
that another  chance was  being given  to him  to offer	 his
explanation with  respect to  those charges.  The  appellant
submitted his  further explanation  but on the very next day
the Deputy  Chief Commercial  Superintendent passed an order
dismissing him	on the	ground that  he was  not fit  to  be
retained in  service.  This  Court  struck  down  the  order
holding that  seven out	 of twelve  charges related  to	 the
conduct of  the appellant  with the  Deputy Chief Commercial
Superintendent who  was the  disciplinary authority and that
if an inquiry were to be held, the principal witness for the
Department would  have	been  the  Deputy  Chief  Commercial
Superintendent himself,	 resulting in  the same person being
the main  accuser, the	chief witness  and also the judge of
the matter.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">271</span>
<p id="p_199">     It was  submitted that  where a  delinquent  government
servant	 so   terrorizes  the  disciplinary  authority	that
neither that officer nor any other officer stationed at that
place is  willing to  hold the	inquiry, some senior officer
can  be	  sent	from  outside  to  hold	 the  inquiry.	This
submission itself  shows that  in such a case the holding of
an inquiry  is	not  reasonably	 practicable.  It  would  be
illogical to  hold that	 the administrative work carried out
by senior  officers should be paralysed because a delinquent
government servant  either  by	himself	 or  along  with  or
through	 others	  makes	 the   holding	of  an	inquiry	 not
reasonably practicable.
</p><p id="p_200">     It is  not necessary  that a  situation which makes the
holding of  an inquiry	not  reasonably	 practicable  should
exist before the disciplinary inquiry is initiated against a
government servant.  Such a  situation can  also  come	into
existence subsequently	during he  course of an inquiry, for
instance, after	 the service  of  a  charge-sheet  upon	 the
government  servant  or	 after	he  has	 filed	his  written
statement thereto  or even  after evidence  has been  led in
part. In  such a  case also the disciplinary authority would
be entitled  to apply  clause  (b)  of	the  second  proviso
because the  word "inquiry"  in that clause includes part of
an inquiry.  It would  also not be reasonably practicable to
afford to  the government  servant an opportunity of hearing
or further  hearing,  as  the  case  may  be,  when  at	 the
commencement of	 the inquiry  or pending  it the  government
servant	 absconds   and	 cannot	  be  served   or  will	 not
participate in	the inquiry.  In such cases, the matter must
proceed	 ex   parte  and   on  the   materials	before	 the
disciplinary authority.	 Therefore, even  where a part of an
inquiry has  been held	and the rest is dispensed with under
clause (b)  or a  provision in	the service  rules analogous
thereto,  the  exclusionary  words  of	the  second  proviso
operate in  their full	vigour and  the	 government  servant
cannot complain	 that he  has  been  dismissed,	 removed  or
reduced in  rank in  violation of the safeguards provided by
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_644">Article 311(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_201">     The  second   condition   necessary   for	 the   valid
application of	clause (b) of the second proviso is that the
disciplinary authority	should record  in writing its reason
for its	 satisfaction that it was not reasonably practicable
to hold	 the inquiry contemplated by <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_645">Article 311(2).</a> This is
a Constitutional  obligation  and  if  such  reason  is	 not
recorded in  writing, the  order dispensing with the inquiry
and the	 order of  penalty following thereupon would both be
void and unconstitutional.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">272</span>
<p id="p_202">     It is  obvious that  the recording	 in writing  of	 the
reason for  dispensing with  the inquiry  must	proceed	 the
order imposing	the penalty.  The reason for dispensing with
the inquiry  need not,	therefore, find a place in the final
order. It would be usual to record the reason separately and
then consider  the question of the penalty to be imposed and
pass the  order imposing  the penalty. It would, however, be
better to  record the  reason in the final order in order to
avoid the  allegation that  the reason	was not	 recorded in
writing before	passing the final order but was subsequently
fabricated. The	 reason for dispensing with the inquiry need
not contain  detailed particular, but the reason must not be
vague or  just a repetition of the language of clause (b) of
the second  proviso. For instance, it would be no compliance
with the  requirement of  clause (b)  for  the	disciplinary
authority simply  to state that he was satisfied that it was
not reasonably	practicable to hold any inquiry. Sometimes a
situation may  be such that it is not reasonably practicable
to give	 detailed reasons  for dispensing  with the inquiry.
This would  not, however,  per se invalidate the order. Each
case must  be judged  on its  own merits and in the light of
its own facts and circumstances.
</p><p id="p_203">     It was  vehemently contended  that if  reasons are	 not
recorded in  the final	order, they  must be communicated to
the concerned  government servant to enable him to challenge
the validity  of that  reasons in  a departmental  appeal or
before a  court of  law and  the failure  to communicate the
reasons would  invalidate the  order.  This  contention	 too
cannot be accepted. The constitutional requirement in clause
</p><p id="p_204">(b) is	that the  reason for  dispensing  with	the  inquiry
should be  recorded in	writing. There	is no  obligation to
communicate the	 reason to the government servant. As clause
(3) of	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_646">Article 311</a>  makes the	decision of the disciplinary
authority on  this  point  final,  the	question  cannot  be
agitated in  a departmental  appeal, revision or review. The
obligation to  record the  reason in  writing is provided in
clause	(b)  so	 that  the  superiors  of  the	disciplinary
authority may  be able	to judge  whether such authority had
exercised its  power under clause (b) properly or not with a
view to	 judge the  performance and capacity of that officer
for the	 purposes of  promotion etc.  It would,	 however, be
better for  the disciplinary authority to communicate to the
government  servant  its  reason  for  dispensing  with	 the
inquiry	 because  such	communication  would  eliminate	 the
possibility of	an allegation  being made  that the  reasons
have been  subsequently fabricated. It would also enable the
government servant  to approach the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_647">Article
226</a> or, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">273</span>
a fit  case, this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_648">Article 32.</a> If the reasons are
not communicated  to the  government servant  and the matter
comes to  the court,  the court can direct the reasons to be
produced, and  furnished to  the government  servant and  if
still not  produced, a	presumption should be drawn that the
reasons were  not recorded in writing and the impugned order
would then stand invalidated. Such presumption can, however,
be rebutted  by a  satisfactory	 explanation  for  the	non-
production of the written reasons.
</p><p id="p_205">     It was  next submitted  that though  clause (b)  of the
second proviso	excludes an  inquiry into  the charges	made
against a government servant, it does not exclude an inquiry
preceding  it,	 namely,  an   inquiry	into   whether	 the
disciplinary inquiry  should be	 dispensed with	 or not, and
that in	 such a	 preliminary inquiry  the government servant
should be  given an opportunity of hearing by issuing to him
a notice  to show  cause  why  the  inquiry  should  not  be
dispensed  with	  so  as   to  enable  him  to	satisfy	 the
disciplinary  authority	  that	it   would   be	  reasonably
practicable to	hold the inquiry. This argument is illogical
and is	a contradiction	 in terms.  If an  inquiry into	 the
charges against	 a  government	servant	 is  not  reasonably
practicable, it	 stands to  reason that	 an inquiry into the
question  whether   the	 disciplinary	inquiry	 should	  be
dispensed with or not is equally not reasonably practicable.
</p><p id="p_206">     A government servant who has been dismissed, removed or
reduced in  rank by  applying to  his case  clause (b) or an
analogous provisions of a service rule is not wholly without
a remedy.  As pointed  out earlier  while dealing  with	 the
various service rules, he can claim in a departmental appeal
or revision  that an  inquiry be  held with  respect to	 the
charges on  which  the	penalty	 of  dismissal,	 removal  or
reduction in  rank has been imposed upon him unless the same
or a  similar situation	 prevails at  the time of hearing of
the appeal or revision application. If the same situation is
continuing or  a similar situation arises, it would not then
be reasonably  practicable to hold an inquiry at the time of
the hearing of the appeal or revision. Though in such a case
as the	government servant  if	dismissed  or  removed	from
service, is  not continuing  in service	 and if	 reduced  in
rank, is  continuing in	 service with  such reduced rank, no
prejudice  could   be  caused	to  the	 Government  or	 the
Department  if	 the  hearing	of  an	appeal	or  revision
application,  as  the  case  may  be,  is  postponed  for  a
reasonable time.
</p><p id="p_207">     Where a  government servant  is dismissed,	 removed  or
reduced
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">274</span>
in rank	 by applying clause (b) or an analogous provision of
the service  rules and	the approaches either the High Court
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_649">Article  226</a> or this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_650">Article 32</a>, the court
will interfere	on grounds  well established  in law for the
exercise of  power  of	judicial  review  in  matters  where
administrative discretion  is exercised.  It  will  consider
whether clause	(b) or an analogous provision in the service
rules was  properly applied  or not.  The finality  given by
clause (3)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_651">Article	311</a> to	the disciplinary authority's
decision that  it was not reasonably practicable to hold the
inquiry is  not binding	 upon the court. The court will also
examine the  charge of	mala fides, if any, made in the writ
petition. In  examining the  relevancy of  the reasons,	 the
court will  consider the  situation which  according to	 the
disciplinary authority	made it	 come to the conclusion that
it was	not reasonably	practicable to	hold the inquiry. If
the court  finds that  the reasons  are irrelevant, then the
recording of  its satisfaction by the disciplinary authority
would be  an abuse  of power conferred upon it by clause (b)
and would  take the  case out  of the purview of that clause
and the	 impugned order	 of penalty would stand invalidated.
In considering	the relevancy  of the  reasons given  by the
disciplinary authority	the court  will not, however, sit in
judgment over them like a court of first appeal. In order to
decide whether	the reasons  are germane  to clause (b), the
court must  put itself	in the	place  of  the	disciplinary
authority and consider what in the then prevailing situation
a reasonable man acting in a reasonable way would have done.
The matter  will have  to be judged in the light of the then
prevailing  situation	and  not   as  if  the	disciplinary
authority was  deciding the  question  whether	the  inquiry
should be  dispensed with  or not  in the  cool and detached
atmosphere of  a  court	 room,	removed	 in  time  from	 the
situation in  question. Where  two views  are possible,	 the
court will decline to interfere.
</p><p id="p_208">     During the	 course of the argument a reference was made
to certain  High Court	decisions and  their citations	were
given. We  have carefully  gone through	 those decisions. It
is, however, unnecessary to refer to them. In so far as what
was held in those decisions or any of them is contrary to or
inconsistent with  what has been held by us, those decisions
are not correct and are to that extent hereby overruled.
</p><p id="p_209">     The Second Proviso - Clause (c)
     We now turn to the last clause of the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_652">Article 311(2)</a> , namely, clause (c). Though its exclusionary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">275</span>
operation on  the safeguards  provided in  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_653">Article 311(2)</a> is
the same  as those  of the  other two  clauses, it  is	very
different in  content from  them. While under clause (b) the
satisfaction is	 to  be	 of  disciplinary  authority,  under
clause (c) it is to be of the President or the Governor of a
State, as  the case  may be. Further, while under clause (b)
the satisfaction has to be with respect to whether it is not
reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry, under clause (c)
it is to be with respect to whether it will not be expedient
in the	interest of  the security  of the  State to hold the
inquiry. Thus,	in  one	 case  the  test  is  of  reasonable
practicability of  holding the inquiry, in the other case it
is of  the expediency  of holding  the inquiry. While clause
</p><p id="p_210">(b) expressly  requires that  the reason for dispensing with
the inquiry  should be	recorded in writing, clause (c) does
not so require it, either expressly or impliedly.
</p><p id="p_211">     The expressions  "law and	order", "public	 order"	 and
"security of  the State"  have been  used in different Acts.
Situations which affect "public order" are graver than those
which affect  "law and	order" and  situations which  affect
"security of  the State"  are graver than those which affect
"public order". Thus, of these situations these which affect
"security of  the State"  are the  gravest.  Danger  to	 the
security of  the State	may arise from without or within the
State. The  expression "security of the State" does not mean
security of the entire country or a whole State. It includes
security of  a part of the State. It also cannot be confined
to an  armed rebellion	or revolt. There are various ways in
which security	of the	State can  be affected.	 It  can  be
affected by State secrets or information relating to defence
production or  similar matters	being  passed  on  to  other
countries, whether  inimical or	 not to	 our country,  or by
secret links  with terrorists.	It is difficult to enumerate
the various  ways in  which security  of the  State  can  be
affected. The way in which security of the State is affected
may be	either open or clandestine. Amongst the more obvious
acts which  affect  the	 security  of  the  State  would  be
disaffection in	 the Armed  Forces or  para-military Forces.
Disaffection in any of these Forces is likely to spread, for
disaffected or	dissatisfied members  of these Forces spread
such dissatisfaction and disaffection among other members of
the Force and thus induce them not to discharge their duties
properly and to commit acts of indiscipline, insubordination
and disobedience  to the  orders of  their superiors. Such a
situation cannot be a matter affecting only law and order or
public order  but is a matter affecting vitally the security
of the State. In this respect, the Police Force
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">276</span>
stands very  much on  the same	footing as  a military	or a
paramilitary force  for it  is	charged	 with  the  duty  of
ensuring and maintaining law and order and public order, and
breaches  of   discipline  and	 acts  of  disobedience	 and
insubordination on  the part  of the  members of  the Police
Force cannot  be viewed	 with less gravity than similar acts
on the	part of the members of the military or para-military
Forces. How  important the  proper discharge of their duties
by members of these Forces and the maintenance of discipline
among them  is considered can be seen from <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_654">Article 33</a> of the
Constitution. Prior to the Constitution (Fiftieth Amendment)
Act, 1984, <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_655">Article 33</a> provided as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_160">	  "33. Power  to Parliament  to	 modify	 the  rights
	  conferred by	this Part  in their  application  to
	  Forces.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_161">	  Parliament may by law determine to what extent any
	  of the  rights conferred  by this  Part shall,  in
	  their application  to	 the  member  of  the  Armed
	  Forces or  the Forces charged with the maintenance
	  of public  order, be restricted or abrogated so as
	  to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and
	  the maintenance of discipline among them."
</blockquote><p id="p_212">By the	Constitution (Fiftieth	Amendment) Act,	 1984,	this
Article was  substituted. By  the  substituted	Article	 the
scope of  the Parliament's  power to so restrict or abrogate
the application	 of any	 of the	 Fundamental Rights  is made
wider. The substituted <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_656">Article 33</a> reads as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_162">	  "33. Power  to Parliament  to	 modify	 the  rights
	  conferred by	this Part  in their  application  to
	  Forces, etc.
	  Parliament may,  by law,  determine to what extent
	  any of the rights conferred by this Part shall, in
	  their application to,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_163">	  (a) the members of the Armed Forces ; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_164">	  (b) the  members of  the Forces  charged with	 the
	  maintenance of public order; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_165">	  (c)  persons	employed  in  any  bureau  or  other
	  organisation established by the State for purposes
	  of intelligence or counter intelligence; or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">277</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_166">	  (d) persons  employed in,  or in  connection with,
	  the  telecommunication  systems  set	up  for	 the
	  purposes of  any  Force,  bureau  or	organisation
	  referred to in clauses (a) to (c),
	  be restricted	 or abrogated  so as  to ensure	 the
	  proper  discharge   of  their	  duties   and	 the
	  maintenance of discipline among them."
</blockquote><p id="p_213">Thus, the  discharge of their duties by the members of these
Forces and  the maintenance  of discipline  amongst them  is
considered of  such vital  importance to the country that in
order to  ensure this  the Constitution	 has conferred	upon
Parliament to restrict or abrogate to them.
</p><p id="p_214">     The question  under clause (c), however, is not whether
the security  of the State has been affected or not, for the
expression used	 in clause  (c) is  "in	 the interest of the
security of  the State". The interest of the security of the
State may  be affected by actual acts or even the likelihood
of such	 acts taking  place. Further, what is required under
clause (c)  is not  the satisfaction of the President or the
Governor, as  the case	may be,	 that the  interest  of	 the
security of  the State	is  or	will  be  affected  but	 his
satisfaction that  in the  interest of	the security  of the
State,	it   is	 not   expedient  to   hold  an	 inquiry  as
contemplated by	 <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_657">Article 311(2).</a>  The  satisfaction  of	 the
President or Governor must, therefore be with respect to the
expediency or  inexpediency of	holding an  inquiry  in	 the
interest of  the security  of the  State. The Shorter Oxford
English	 Dictionary,   Third  Edition,	 defines  the	word
"inexpedient" as  meaning "not expedient; disadvantageous in
the  circumstances,   unadvisable   impolitic."	  The	same
dictionary  defines   "expedient"  as	meaning	 inter	alia
"advantageous; fit, proper, or suitable to the circumstances
of the	case." Webster's  Third New International Dictionary
also defines  the term	"expedient" as	meaning	 inter	alia
"characterized by  suitability, practicality, and efficiency
in achieving a particular end : fit, proper, or advantageous
under the  circumstances." It must be borne in mind that the
satisfaction required by clause (c) is of the Constitutional
Head of	 the whole  country or	of the	State. Under <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_658">Article
74(1)</a> of the Constitution, the satisfaction of the President
would be  arrived at  with the aid and advice of his Council
of Ministers  with the Prime Minister as the Head and in the
case of	 a State  by reason  of the  provisions	 of  <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_659">Article
163(1)</a> by the Governor acting with the aid and advice of his
Council of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">278</span>
Ministers with	the Chief  Minister as	the Head.  Whenever,
therefore,  the	  President   or   the	 Governor   in	 the
Constitutional sense  is  satisfied  that  it  will  not  be
advantageous or	 fit or proper or suitable or politic in the
interest of the security of the State to hold an inquiry, he
would be  entitled to dispense with it under clause (c). The
satisfaction so	 reached by  the President  or the  Governor
must necessarily  be a	subjective satisfaction.  Expediency
involves matters  of policy.  Satisfaction may be arrived at
as a result of secret information received by the Government
about the  brewing danger  to the  security of the State and
like matters.  There may  be  other  factors  which  may  be
required to  be considered, weighed and balanced in order to
reach the  requisite satisfaction whether holding an inquiry
would be expedient or not. If the requisite satisfaction has
been reached  as a  result of secret information received by
the Government,	 making, known	such  information  may	very
often  result	in  disclosure	 of  the   source  of	such
information. Once  known, the  particular source  from which
the information	 was received  would no more be available to
the Government.	 The reasons for the satisfaction reached by
the  President	 or  Governor	under  clause	(c)  cannot,
therefore, be  required to  be	recorded  in  the  order  of
dismissal, removal or reduction in rank nor can they be made
public.
</p><p id="p_215">     In the case of clause (b) of the second proviso, clause
(3) of	<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_660">Article 311</a>  makes the	decision of the disciplinary
authority that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the
inquiry final.	There is  no such clause in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_661">Article 311</a> with
respect to  the satisfaction reached by the President or the
Governor under	clause (c)  of the second proviso. There are
two reasons for this. There can be no departmental appeal or
other departmental  remedy against  the satisfaction reached
by the	President or the Governor; and so far as the Court's
power of  judicial review is concerned, the Court cannot sit
in judgment  over State policy or the wisdom or otherwise of
such policy.  The court	 equally  cannot  be  the  judge  of
expediency or  inexpediency. Given  a known situation, it is
not for	 the Court  to decide  whether it  was expedient  or
inexpedient in	the circumstances  of the  case to  dispense
with the  inquiry. The satisfaction reached by the President
or Governor under clause (c) is subjective satisfaction and,
therefore, would  not be  a fit	 matter for judicial review.
Relying upon  the observations	of Bhagwati, J., in State of
Rajasthan and  others etc.  etc. v. Union of India etc.etc.,
[1978] 1  S.C.R. 1,  82, it  was submitted that the power of
judicial review	 is not	 excluded where	 the satisfaction of
the President or the Governor
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">279</span>
has been  reached mala fide or is based on wholly extraneous
or irrelevant  grounds because	in such a case, in law there
would be no satisfaction of the President or the Governor at
all. It	 is unnecessary	 to decide  this question because in
the matters  under clause  (c) before  us, all the materials
including the  advice tendered	by the Council of Ministers,
have been produced and they clearly show that in those cases
the satisfaction  of the  Governor was	neither reached mala
fide nor  was it  based	 on  any  extraneous  or  irrelevant
ground.
</p><p id="p_216">     It was  further submitted	that  what  is	required  by
clause (c)  is that the holding of the inquiry should not be
expedient in  the interest  of the security of the State and
not the	 actual conduct	 of a government servant which would
be the	subject-matter of  the inquiry.	 This submission  is
correct so  far as  it goes but what it overlooks is that in
an inquiry  into acts affecting the interest of the security
of the	State, several	matters not fit or proper to be made
public, including  the source  of  information	involving  a
government servant in such acts, would be disclosed and thus
in cases  such as  these an inquiry into acts prejudicial to
the interest  of the  security of  the State would prejudice
the interest  of the  security of the State as much as those
acts would.
</p><p id="p_217">     It was  also submitted that the Government must produce
before the  court all  materials upon which the satisfaction
of the	President or  the Governor,  as the case may be, was
reached. So  far as  the advice	 given	by  the	 Council  of
Ministers to  the President  or the  Governor is  concerned,
this submission	 is negatived  by the  express provisions of
the Constitution. <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_662">Article 74(2)</a> of the Constitution provides
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_167">	  "(2) The  question whether  any, and	if so  what,
	  advice was  tendered by Ministers to the President
	  shall not be inquired into in any Court."
	  Similarly, <a href="/doc/60543/" id="a_663">Article 163(3)</a> provides :
	  "(3) The  question whether  any, and	if so  what,
	  advice was  tendered by  Ministers to the Governor
	  shall not be inquired into in any Court."</blockquote>
<p id="p_218">     It was  then submitted  that leaving  aside the  advice
given by the Ministers to the President or the Governor, the
Government is  bound to disclose at least the materials upon
which the advice of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">280</span>
the Council  of Ministers  was based  so that  the Court can
examine whether	 the satisfaction  of the  President or	 the
Governor, as  the case	may be,	 was arrived at mala fide or
based on  wholly extraneous  and irrelevant  grounds so that
such satisfaction  would in law amount to no satisfaction at
all. It	 was further  submitted that  if the Government does
not voluntarily	 disclose such materials it can be compelled
by the	Court to  do so.  Whether this should be done or not
would depend  upon whether  the documents  in question	fall
within the  class of  privileged documents  and	 whether  in
respect of  them privilege has been properly claimed or not.
It is  unnecessary to  examine	this  question	any  further
because in  the cases  under clause  (c) before us though at
first privilege	 was claimed,  at the  hearing privilege was
waived and  the materials  as also  the advice	given by the
Ministers to  the Governor  of Madhya Pradesh who had passed
the impugned orders in those cases were disclosed.
</p><p id="p_219">     The Nature of the Challenge to the Impugned orders
     In all  matters before us the challenge to the validity
of the	impugned orders	 was confined only to legal grounds,
the  main   ground  being   based  upon	 what  was  held  in
Challappan's case  and	the  application  of  principles  of
natural justice.  The  contentions  with  respect  to  these
grounds have  been considered by us in the preceding part of
this Judgment  and have	 been  negatived.  In  most  of	 the
matters	 the  Writ  Petitions  contain	no  detailed  facts.
Several of  the Petitioners have gone in departmental appeal
but that fact is not mentioned in the Writ Petitions nor the
order  of  the	appellate  authority  challenged  where	 the
appeals have  been dismissed.  Many government servants have
combine together  to file  one Writ Petition and in the case
of such of them whose departmental appeals have been allowed
and they  reinstated in service, the Petitions have not been
amended so  as to delete their names and they have continued
to remain  on the  record as  Petitioners. Several Petitions
are in identical terms, if not, almost exact copies of other
Petitions. No  attempt has  been made  in  such	 matters  to
distinguish the case of one Petitioner from the other. Apart
from contesting	 the legal  validity of the impugned orders,
hardly any  one has  even stated in his Petition that he was
not involved in the situation which has led to clause (b) or
clause (c)  of the  second  proviso  to	 <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_664">Article  311</a>  being
applied in  his case.  There is	 no allegation	of mala fide
against the  authority passing the impugned orders except at
times a	 more bare allegation that the order was passed mala
fide. No  particulars whatever	of such	 alleged mala  fides
have been given.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">281</span>
<p id="p_220">Such a	bare averment  cannot amount to a plea of mala fides
and requires  to be ignored. In this unsatisfactory state of
affairs go far as facts are concerned, the only course which
this Court  can adopt  is to  consider whether	the relevant
clause of  the second  proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_665">Article 311(2)</a>  or of  an
analogous service  rule has been properly applied or not. If
this Court  finds that	such provision has not been properly
applied, the  Appellant or  the Petitioner,  as the case may
be, is entitled to succeed. If, however, we find that it has
been properly  applied, the  Appeal  or	 Petition  would  be
liable	to   be	 dismissed,  because  there  are  no  proper
materials before  the Court  to	 investigate  and  ascertain
whether any  particular government  servant  was,  in  fact,
guilty of  the charges	made against  him or not. It is also
not the	 function of  this Court  to do	 so because it would
involve an inquiry into disputed questions of facts and this
Court will  not, except	 in a rare case, embark upon such an
inquiry. For  these reasons and in view of the directions we
propose to  give while	disposing of  these matters, we will
while dealing  with facts  refrain from	 touching any aspect
except whether	the particular	clause of the second proviso
to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_666">Article  311(2)</a> or an analogous service rule was properly
applied or not.

     Civil Appeal No. 6814 of 1983 is the only matter before

</p><p id="p_222">     The respondent, Tulsiram Patel, was a permanent auditor
in the	Regional Audit Officer, M.E.S., Jabalpur. It appears
that  orders  were  issued  by	Headquarters,  C.D.A.  C.C.,
Meerut, stopping  the increment	 of the	 Respondent for	 one
year. One  Raj Kumar  Jairath was  at the  relevant time the
Regional Audit	Officer, M.E.S.,  Jabalpur. On July 27,1976,
the Respondent	went to	 Raj Kumar's  office and demanded an
explanation from  him as to why he had stopped his increment
whereupon Raj  Kumar replied  that he was nobody to stop his
increment. The	Respondent then struck Raj Kumar on the head
with an	 iron rod.  Raj Kumar  fell down, his head bleeding.
The Respondent	was tried and convicted under <a href="/doc/1440821/" id="a_668">section 332</a> of
the  Indian   Penal  Code   by	the   First  Class  Judicial
Magistrate, Jabalpur.  The Magistrate  instead of sentencing
the Respondent to imprisonment applied to him the provisions
of <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_669">section  4</a> of  the Probation	 of Offenders Act, 1958, and
released him on his executing a bond of good behaviour for a
period of  one year.  The  Respondents	appeal	against	 his
conviction was	dismissed by  the Sessions  Judge, Jabalpur.
The Controller General of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">282</span>
Defence Accounts,  who was the disciplinary authority in the
case, imposed  upon the Respondent the penalty of compulsory
retirement under clause (i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services
Rules. The said order was in the following terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_168">	  "WHEREAS Shri	 T.R. Patel,  Pt.  Auditor  (Account
	  No.8295888)  has  been  convicted  on	 a  criminal
	  charge, to wit, under <a href="/doc/1440821/" id="a_670">Section 332</a> of I.P.C.,
	  WHEREAS it  is considered  that the conduct of the
	  said	Shri   T.R.Patel,  Pt.Auditor,(Account	 No.
	  8295888) which  has led to his conviction, is such
	  as to	 render his  further retention in the public
	  service undesirable,
	  Now,	therefore,   in	 exercise   of	the   powers
	  conferred by	Rule  19(i)  of	 the  Central  Civil
	  Services  (Classification,   Control	and  Appeal)
	  Rules, 1965,	the undersigned	 hereby direct	that
	  the said  Shri T.R.  Patel, Pt.  Auditor, (Account
	  No.8295888) shall  be	 compulsorily  retired	from
	  service with effect from 25.11.1980."
</blockquote><p id="p_223">The Respondent	thereupon filed	 a departmental appeal which
was dismissed.
</p><p id="p_224">     Thereafter the  Respondent filed  in the Madhya Pradesh
High Court a writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution. Relying  upon Challappan's Case the High Court
held that no opportunity had been afforded to the Respondent
before imposing the penalty of compulsory retirement on him.
It further  held  that	the  impugned  order  was  defective
inasmuch as it did not indicate the circumstances which were
considered by  the disciplinary authority except the fact of
conviction of the Respondent.
</p><p id="p_225">     We are  unable to	agree with either of the two reasons
given by  the High  Court for  setting aside  the  order  of
compulsory retirement. So far as the first ground upon which
the High  Court proceeded  is concerned,  as already pointed
out that  part of  the judgment	 in Challapan's	 case is not
correct and  it was, therefore, not necessary to give to the
Respondent any	opportunity of	hearing before	imposing the
penalty of compulsory retirement on him.
</p><p id="p_226">     It was,  however, argued  that the penalty imposed upon
the Respondent	was not of dismissal or removal from service
but of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">283</span>
compulsory retirement  and, therefore, clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_671">Article
311(2)</a> did  not apply.	The argument cannot be accepted. The
compulsory retirement of the Respondent was not by reason of
his reaching  the age of superannuation or under other rules
which provide for compulsorily retiring a government servant
on his	completing the	qualifying period  of  service.	 The
order of compulsory retirement in this case was under clause
</p><p id="p_227">(i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules and was by way of
imposing upon him one of the major penalties provided for in
Rule 11.  It is	 now well settled by decisions of this Court
that where  an order  of compulsory retirement is imposed by
way of	penalty, it  amounts to removal from service and the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_672">Article 311</a> are attracted. (<a href="/doc/658972/" id="a_673">See State of U.P.
v. Shyam  Lal Sharma</a>,  [1972] 1 S.C.R. 184,189 and the cases
referred to therein).
</p><p id="p_228">     The second	 ground upon which the High Court rested its
decision is  equally unsustainable.  The circumstances which
were taken  into consideration by the disciplinary authority
have been  sufficiently set  out in  the order of compulsory
retirement, they  being	 that  the  Respondent's  conviction
under <a href="/doc/1440821/" id="a_674">section 332</a> of the Indian Penal Code and the nature of
the offence  committed which  led the disciplinary authority
to  the	  conclusion  that  the	 further  retention  of	 the
Respondent  in	the  public  service  was  undesirable.	 The
mention of  <a href="/doc/1440821/" id="a_675">section 332</a> of the Indian Penal Code in the said
order itself  shows that  Respondent was  himself  a  public
servant and  had voluntarily  caused hurt  to another public
servant in  the discharge of his duty as such public servant
or in  consequence of  an act  done by	that person  in	 the
lawful discharge  of his  duty. The  facts here are eloquent
and speak  for themselves.  The Respondent  had gone  to the
office of  his superior	 officer and had hit him on the head
with an	 iron rod.  It was  fortunate that  the skull of Raj
Kumar was  not fractured  otherwise  the  offence  committed
would have  been the more serious one under <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_676">section 333</a>. The
Respondent was	lucky in  being dealt  with leniently by the
Magistrate but	these facts  clearly show that his retention
in public  service was	undesirable. In fact, the conduct of
the Respondent	was such  that he  merited  the	 penalty  of
dismissal from	government service  and it  is clear that by
imposing upon him only the penalty of compulsory retirement,
the disciplinary authority had in his mind the fact that the
Magistrate had	released him  on probation.  We	 accordingly
hold that  clause (i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules
was rightly applied to the case of the Respondent.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">284</span>
<p id="p_229">     This Appeal,  therefore, requires to be allowed and the
writ petition  filed by the Respondent in the Madhya Pradesh

</p><p id="p_231">     Before dealing  with the relevant facts, we may mention
that the  counter affidavit  filed to  the writ	 petition in
both the  said	High  Courts  were  unsatisfactory.  At	 the
hearing of  these Appeals  an application was made on behalf
of the	Appellants for leave to file a supplementary return.
This application  was granted  by  us  in  the	interest  of
justice and  the supplementary	Return annexed	to the	said
application was taken on the record. We will now briefly set
out the	 facts which  led to  the passing  of  the  impugned
orders. The Respondents in Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982 are
dismissed members  of the CISF Unit at Bokaro Steel Plant of
the Bokaro  Steel Limited  situate at Bokaro in the State of
Bihar temporary	 security guard	 in the	 CISF Unit posted at
Security Paper	Mill at	 Hoshangabad in	 the State of Madhya
Pradesh. We  will first	 deal with the facts of Civil Appeal
No. 3484 of 1982. The members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro had
formed an  all-India  association  in  March  1979  and	 one
Sadanand Jha,  Respondent No.  1, was elected as its General
Secretary. Thereafter,	a country wide agitation was carried
on for	recognition of	the said  association. In  June 1979
some of the members of the said association were called upon
to meet the Home Minister at Delhi. A delegation of the said
association  went  to  Delhi.  While  there  they  staged  a
demonstration. Some of the demonstrators, including Sadanand
Jha, were  arrested. What  happened thereafter	can best  be
related by extracting paragraphs 3 to 9 of the supplementary
Return filed  by Shri  Madan Gopal,  the  Deputy  Inspector-
General, CISF  Unit of	Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro, pursuant
to the leave granted by this Court. These paragraphs read as
follows :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">285</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_169">	  "3. The  said persons	 were arrested at Delhi, but
	  subsequently released	 on bail.  At  Bokaro  Steel
	  Plant, the  agitation which  was going  on assumed
	  aggravated from on and from 27th May, 1979. Out of
	  1900 persons	belonging to CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel
	  Plant, Bokaro	 about 1000  persons participated in
	  the processions  and violent	demonstrations.	 The
	  said employees  indulged in  agitational acts	 and
	  violent indiscipline. The said personnel unleashed
	  a reign  of terror  in the  unit lines  and openly
	  incited others  to disobey  the lawful orders. The
	  said persons	indulged in several acts of violence
	  and created a very serious law &amp; order problem and
	  an   atmosphere   of	 collective   violence	 and
	  intimidation. The  said agitation  and the violent
	  activity reached  a very serious proportion in the
	  last week  of June, 1979 with the result that Army
	  had to  be called  by	 the  State  Authorities  on
	  23.6.1979. Annexed hereto and marked Annexure AFD-
	  I is	the request  from the  Home    Commissioner,
	  Bihar	 Government  to	 the  Ministry	of  Defence,
	  Government of India dated 23.6.1979 requesting for
	  the deployment  of  the  Army	 so  as	 to  restore
	  normalcy in  the area.  The State  Government	 had
	  also deployed	 9 Magistrates	to assist  the	Army
	  authorities as  also the  CRPF for  restoring	 the
	  normal conditions  at the  Bokaro Steel  Plant.  A
	  copy of  the order is enclosed herewith and market
	  as Annexure AFD-II
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_170">	  4. On	 24.6.1979, on	seeing the  arrival  of	 the
	  Army, the  agitators started	making	preparations
	  for armed  resistance by  putting  up	 sand  bags,
	  flood lights	and barricades	in the	CISF  Lines.
	  They had  gained the control of CISF Lines and the
	  Officers were	 not allowed  to have  any access to
	  the Lines or to other ranks of CISF.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_171">	  5. On 25.6.1979, the Army along with 9 Magistrates
	  took up  positions round  the CISF  Lines  in	 the
	  early hours  and called upon the agitators to give
	  up  charge  of  the  Armoury.	 Inspite  of  giving
	  repeated warnings  by the  authorities to  give up
	  charge of  the Armoury, the agitators did not give
	  up arms,  but, instead,  resorted to violence. The
	  agitators started  firing at	0320  hours  at	 the
	  Army.	 The   Army  returned  the  fire.  The	said
	  exchange of  fire continued for 3 hours before the
	  Army could spell out the violent retaliation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">286</span>
	  the agitators.  The said  violent exchange of fire
	  resulted in  the instant  death of  one Army Major
	  and 2	 more Army  personnel were  also killed as a
	  result of firing by the CISF personnel.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_172">	  6. It	 may also be stated that there were 22 death
	  in the  course of  the said  pitched battle, which
	  went on  for three hours between the violent armed
	  agitators and the Army.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_173">	  7. In	 regard to  the aforesaid violent activities
	  and  the   commission	 of   offences,	 about	 800
	  personnel were rounded up by the Army and later on
	  arrested by  the local  police. It is pertinent to
	  mention here that at the relevant time, about 1900
	  personnel were deployed in CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel
	  Plant,   Bokaro.    More   than   1000   personnel
	  participated	 in    the   aforesaid	 agitational
	  activities. Besides  the persons  arrested by	 the
	  authorities concerned,  a  substantial  number  of
	  agitators were  at large. Most of them either fled
	  away or  went underground and large number of arms
	  and ammunitions  were also  with them.  The search
	  and seizure  of arms	and ammunition were going on
	  and as  a result  thereof  up	 till  1.7.1979,  65
	  rifles along	with large  quantity of ammunitions,
	  11 Molotov  cooktails, 20  kgs. of sulphur, 20 kgs
	  of glass  chips  and	other  explosives  and	1048
	  empties of .303 ammunition were recovered from the
	  area after  the Army	action. A  copy of  the	 FIR
	  lodged in  connection with aforesaid commission of
	  offences  is	 annexed  herewith   and  marked  as
	  Annexure (AFD-III).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_174">	  8. Notwithstanding  the arrest  of the  said about
	  800 employees,  as aforesaid,	 atmosphere  at	 the
	  Bokaro Steel Plant continued to be vitiated due to
	  terror and  collective fear and the functioning of
	  the CISF Unit and its administration at Bokaro had
	  completely broken  down. It  was only	 Army  which
	  could	 control  the  situation  by  its  continued
	  presence. The	 Army was  withdrawn from the Bokaro
	  Steel Plant  only on or about 2.7.1979, however it
	  may not  be out  of place  to	 mention  here	that
	  although the Army was withdrawn in the early July,
	  1979	but   atmosphere  of   terror  and   tension
	  continued  for   a  couple  of  months.  The	CRPF
	  continued performing security duties till Nov. 79.
	  Besides this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">287</span>
	  Bihar Military  Police took charge of armoury from
	  army and continued to perform some of armed duties
	  of CISF  as CISF  Unit was  not in  a position  to
	  function normally  for a  considerable time.	Even
	  the  State   authority  apprehended	a  dangerous
	  situation after  the Army  action including threat
	  to lives of senior officers of CISF.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_175">	  9. In	 the meanwhile, having regard to the violent
	  and disturbed	 situation which  prevailed  in	 the
	  Bokaro Steel	Plant as also the collective actions
	  of violence,	mass  terror  and  intimidation	 and
	  threats to  supervisory and  loyal staff,  it	 was
	  reasonably believed that any inquiry in accordance
	  with the  provisions of the Rules 34, 35 and 36 of
	  CISF	Rules,	 1969  or  in  accordance  with	 the
	  requirements of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_678">Article 311(2)</a> would be dangerous,

	  reasonably believed  that the	 circumstances	were
	  such as  would make  the holding  of	any  inquiry
	  self-defeating,  subversive  or  would  result  in
	  consequent detriment to public interest. It was in
	  these circumstances that the concerned authorities
	  formed  reasonable   nexus  that  any	 inquiry  in
	  accordance   with   the   rules   was	  reasonably

been conferred	very wide  powers. Under  Section 11  of the
CISF Act,  any supervisory  officer or	member of  the Force
may, without any order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">290</span>
from a	Magistrate and	without a warrant, arrest any person
who has	 been concerned	 in or	against	 whom  a  reasonable
suspicion exists  of his  having been concerned in or who is
found taking  precautions  to  conceal	his  presence  under
circumstances which  afford reason  to believe	that  he  is
taking	such   precautions  with  a  view  to  committing  a
cognizable offence relating to the property belonging to any
industrial undertaking	or other  installations.  Similarly,
under <a href="/doc/1678715/" id="a_682">section  12</a> for the same purpose a supervisory officer
or member  of the  CIS Force, not below the prescribed rank,
has the	 power to  search the  person and  belongings of any
person whom  he has  reason to believe to have committed any
such offence  as is  referred to in <a href="/doc/129524/" id="a_683">section 11</a>. From what is
stated above,  it is  obvious that in a Force entrusted with
such large responsibility, maintenance of discipline is most
essential and  this is	made clear  by section	18(1) of the
CISF Act which provides as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_178">	  "18. Penalties for neglect of duty, etc.-
	  (1) Without  prejudice to the provisions contained
	  in <a href="/doc/1502645/" id="a_684">Section  8</a>, every member of the Force who shall
	  be guilty  of any  violation	of  duty  or  wilful
	  breach or  neglect of	 any rule  or regulation  or
	  lawful order made by a supervisory officer, or who
	  shall withdraw  from	the  duties  of	 his  office
	  without permission, or who, being absent on leave,
	  fails, without reasonable cause, to report himself
	  for duty  on the  expiration of  the leave  or who
	  engages   himself   without	authority   in	 any
	  employment other  than his duty as a member of the
	  Force, or who shall be guilty of cowardice, shall,
	  on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a
	  term which may extend to six months."
</blockquote><p id="p_241">Under section  19 of the CISF Act, the Police (Incitement to
Disaffection) Act, 1922, applies to supervisory officers and
members of  the CIS  Force as  it applies  to members  of  a
Police Force. Under <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_685">section 20</a>, neither the <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_686">Payment of Wages
Act</a>, 1936,  nor the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_687">Industrial Disputes  Act</a>, 1947, nor the
<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_688">Factories Act</a>, 1948, nor any corresponding <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_689">State Act</a> applies
to the member of the CIS Force.
</p><p id="p_242">     The facts	set out	 in the Supplementary Return of Shri
Mohan Gopal and in the impugned orders show that there was a
total breakdown	 of discipline in the CIS Force. There was a
wilful	and   deliberate  disobedience	 of  orders  of	 the
supervisory officers  and 'gherao'  of such  officers. There
was a hunger strike, dharna,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">291</span>
shouting of  revellious slogans	 and threats of violence and
bodily	 harm to  supervisory officers	and acts  tending to
intimidate the supervisory officers and loyal members of the
staff. There  were acts	 of insubordination  and  deliberate
neglect and wilful violation of their duties by a very large
section of the members of the CIS Force stationed at Bokaro.
All these  acts virtually amounted to a mutiny and how grave
the situation  was can	be judge from the fact that the army
had to be called out and a pitched battle took place between
the army  and the  members of  the Force. No person with any
reason or  sence of  responsibility can	 say that  in such a
situation  the	 holding  of   an  inquiry   was  reasonably
practicable.
</p><p id="p_243">     It was  said that	the impugned  orders did not set out
the particular	acts done  by each of the members of the CIS
Force in  respect of whom the dismissal orders was made, and
these were  merely cyclostyled	orders	with  the  names  of
individual members  of the  CIS Force  filled in. Here was a
case very  much like  a case under <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_690">section 149</a> of the Indian
Penal Code.  The acts  alleged were  not of  any  particular
individual acting  by himself.	These were  acts of  a large
group acting collectively with the common object of coercing
those in  charge of  the administration of the CIS Force and
the Government	in order  to obtain  recognition  for  their
association and to concede their demands. It is not possible
in a  situation such  as this  to particularize	 the acts of
each individual	 members who  participated in the commission
of these  acts. The  participation of each individual may be
of greater  or lesser degree but the acts of each individual
contributed to	the creation  of  a  situation	in  which  a
security force itself became a security risk.
</p><p id="p_244">     It was  submitted at  the Bar  that the real reason for
passing the orders impugned in Civil Appeal No. 1484 of 1982
was the	 encounter with	 the army on June 25, 1979, and this
real reason  as not  mentioned in the impugned order because
the Respondents	 had been arrested and were being prosecuted
and, therefore,	 before passing	 the  impugned	orders,	 the
disciplinary authority	would have  had	 to  wait  till	 the
prosecutions were over. Such an allegation has not been made
in the writ petition filed in the High Court. In fact, there
is no  mention in  the writ petition of the help of the army
being sought or of the encounter with the army. The impugned
orders mentioned  the reasons  why they	 were  passed.	Then
Supplementary Returns  bears out  these	 reasons.  We  have,
therefore, no hesitation in accepting what is stated in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">292</span>
impugned orders.  In our  opinion, clause  (b) of Rule 37 of
the CISF  Rules and  clause (b)	 of the	 second	 proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_691">Article 311(2)</a>	were properly  applied to  the cases  of the
Respondents.
</p><p id="p_245">     Finally, a	 grievance was	made at	 the  Bar  that	 the
dismissed members  of the  CIS Force  had filed departmental
appeals and  the appeals of those who had been discharged by
the  Magistrate	 were  allowed	and  these  appellants	were
reinstated. We	do not	know how far this is correct nor the
reasons for  allowing such appeals, but if what is stated is
ture, it  is not  fair and  the remaining  appeals should be
disposed of as early as possible.
</p><p id="p_246">     The impugned  order in Civil Appeal No. 3512 of 1982 is
in the same terms as the impugned orders in Civil Appeal No.
3484 of 1982. The situation at Hoshangabad was very much the
same as	 at Bokaro  and in our opinion clause (b) of Rule 37
of the	CISF Rules  and clause	(b) of the second proviso to
clause (2)  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_692">Article 311</a> were properly applied to the case
of the Respondent.
</p><p id="p_247">     Both these Appeals, therefore, require to be allowed.
     Railway Service Matters
     Civil Appeals  Nos. 3231  of 1981	and 4067 of 1983 and
all the	 writ petitions	 filed in  this Court  (except	Writ
Petitions Nos. 1953 of 1981, 7393,1392 and 2022 of 1981) and
all Transferred Cases, that is, writ petitions filed in High
Courts and  transferred to  this Court,	 relate	 to  railway
servants who  were either  dismissed or removed from service
by applying  to their cases either clause (ii) of Rule 14 of
the Railway  Servants Rules  or clause	(b)  of	 the  second
proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_693">Article 311(2)</a>  or clause  (ii) of	Rule 14 read
with clause (b) of the second proviso.
</p><p id="p_248">     We have  carefully gone  through the  facts of  each of
these cases.  The majority of the railway employees who were
dismissed or  removed are  alleged to have been concerned in
incident which	took place  in all-India  strikes of railway
employees. Many of these employees belonged to the all-India
loco-running staff.
</p><p id="p_249">     The proper	 running of  the railway service is vital to
the country. Railway trains carry not only those going for a
holiday but  also those	 who commute to work or business. In
certain cities,	 for instance  - Bombay, Lakhs commute daily
by train for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">293</span>
this purpose.  The railway  trains also carry those going to
attend the  funeral or obsequiel ceremonies of near and dear
ones and  equally they	carry marriage	parties. They  carry
those who  are in  urgent need	of medical treatment or have
been seriously	injured and not having proper medical aid in
the places  where they	reside, have  to be  rushed  to	 the
nearest	 town,	city  or  district  headquarter	 where	such
medical aid  is available.  They carry essential commodities
like  foodgrains,   oil,  etc.	 They  carry  equipment	 and
machinery vital	 for the  needs of  the country. In times of
disturbances they  carry members  of the  Defence Forces and
the Central  Reserve Police Force. In this connection, it is
pertinent to  note what	 Shah,J., as he then was, had to say
in Moti	 Ram Dekh's  case (at pages 795-6) about the railway
administration and employment in railway service:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_179">	  "... employment  in the  Railways is	in a vitally
	  important establishment  of the Union in which the
	  employees are	 entrusted with	 valuable  equipment
	  and a	 large	measure	 of  confidence	 has  to  be
	  reposed in  them and	on the	due discharge of the
	  duties the  safety of the public and the efficient
	  functioning of the governmental duties depend. Not
	  only the  travelling public, but the Union and the
	  States have  in a  considerable measure  to depend
	  upon rail  transport for  the functioning  of	 the
	  governmental machinery and its welfare activities.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_180">	  It would  be	possible  even	for  one  or  a	 few
	  employees   of    the	   Railway    to    paralyse
	  communications and  movement of essential supplies
	  leading to  disorder and  confusion.	The  Railway
	  service has  therefore a special responsibility in
	  the smooth functioning of our body politic...."</blockquote>
<p id="p_250">     As pointed	 out in	 <a href="/doc/687159/" id="a_694">Kameshwar Prasad  and others v. The
State of  Bihar and  another</a>  (at  page	 385)  there  is  no
Fundamental Right  to resort  to a  strike. A strike is only
legal if  an Act  permits it  and only	if it  is called  in
compliance with	 the conditions	 prescribed by	the Act. The
definition of  "public utility	service" in  clause  (n)  of
<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_695">section 2</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, includes and
railway service.  The term "strike" is defined in clause (q)
of <a href="/doc/1701781/" id="a_696">section  2</a> of  the said  Act. The  said clause  (q) is as
follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_181">	  "strike' means  a cessation  of work	by a body of
	  persons  employed   in  any	industry  acting  in
	  combination
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">294</span>
	  or a	concerted refusal,  or	a  refusal  under  a
	  common understanding, of any number of persons who
	  are or  have been  so employed to continue to work
	  or to accept employment".
</blockquote><p id="p_251">Under sub-section  (1) of  <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_697">section 22</a>  of the  said Act,  no
person employed in a public utility service can go no strike
in breach  of contract	without giving	to  his	 employer  a
notice of  strike  as  prescribed  by  that  section.  Under
<a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_698">section 24</a>  a strike  is  illegal  if  it  is  commenced  or
declared in contravention of <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_699">section 22</a>. Under <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_700">section 26(1)</a>
any workman  who commences,  continues or  otherwise acts in
furtherance of a strike which is illegal under the said Act,
commits an  offence punishable	with imprisonment for a term
which may  extend to  one month	 or with  a fine  which	 may
extend to  fifty rupees	 or with  both. The  railway strikes
were all  commenced without complying with the provisions of
<a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_701">section 22</a>.  These strikes were, therefore, illegal and each
of the	railway servants  who participated  in these strikes
committed an  offence punishable  under <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_702">section 26(1)</a> of the
said Act.
</p><p id="p_252">     It may  be that  the railway  servants  went  on  these
strikes with  the object  of forcing  the Government to meet
their demands. Their demands were for their private gain and
in their  private interest. In seeking to have these demands
conceded they  caused untold  hardship	to  the	 public	 and
prejudicially affected	public good  and public interest and
the good and interest of the nation.
</p><p id="p_253">     It was  contended that  the conduct charged against all
employees was  not of equal gravity. This is true for in the
case of	 some of  the railway  servants the  acts alleged to
have been committed by them would not if committed in normal
times, merit  the  penalty  of	dismissal  or  removal	from
service, but  when committed  in furtherance of an all-India
strike which  has paralysed  a public  utility service	they
cannot be viewed in the same light.
</p><p id="p_254">     It	 was   also  contended	that  the  punishments	were
arbitrarily meted  out because	in some	 centres the railway
servants were  dismissed from  service while  in some  other
centres they  were removed  from service.  The	quantum	 and
extent of  penalty would  depend upon  the  gravity  of	 the
situation at a particular centre and the extent to which the
alleged	 acts,	 though	 not   serious	in   themselves,  in
conjunction with  acts committed  by others,  contributed to
the bringing about of this situation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">295</span>
<p id="p_255">     In the  context of	 an all-India  strike where  a	very
large number  of  railway  servants  had  struck  work,	 the
railway	 services  paralysed,  loyal  workers  and  superior
officers assaulted  and intimidated,  the  country  held  to
ransom, the  economy of	 the country and public interest and
public good  prejudicially affected,  prompt  and  immediate
action was  called for	to bring the situation to normal. In
these circumstances,  it cannot	 be said that an inquiry was
reasonably practicable.
</p><p id="p_256">     On a  careful examination	of the	facts of these cases
and the impugned orders, we find that in each of these cases
clause (ii)  Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules or clause
</p><p id="p_257">(b) of	the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_703">Article 311(2)</a> or both, as the
case  may  be,	were  properly	applied.  All  these  matter
therefore require to be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_258">     The Madhya Pradesh Police Forces Matters
     The matters  which now remain to be dealt with are Writ

</p><p id="p_260">     We have already held that in applying clause (c) of the
second	proviso	  the  Governor	 of  a	State  acts  on	 his
subjective satisfaction	 taking into consideration facts and
factors which  are not	proper matters	for judicial review.
However, the claim of privilege was waived by the Government
and all the materials produced at the hearing and inspection
given to  the other  side. These  materials disclose that an
incident took  place on January 18, 1981, at the annual Mela
held at	 Gwalior in  which one	man was	 burnt	alive.	Some
persons, including  a  constable  from	each  of  these	 two
Forces, were  arrested. These  persons	were  remanded	into
judicial custody.  On January  20, 1981,  several members of
these two  Forces indulged  in	violent	 demonstrations	 and
rioted at  the Mela  ground, demanding	the release of their
colleagues. They  attacked the	police station	at the	Mela
ground, ransacked  it and  forced the operator to close down
the wireless  set. The	situation became  so dangerous	that
senior district	 and police  officers had  to  approach	 the
Judicial Magistrate  at	 night	and  get  the  two  arrested
constables released on bail. The incident was discussed at a
Cabinet meeting,  a decision was taken and the advice of the
Council of  Ministers was tendered to the Governor of Madhya
Pradesh who  accepted it  and issued the impugned orders. On
further scrutiny  some names  were deleted  from the list of
dismissed personnel and some others included. As a result of
this, some  other members  of these Forces began carrying on
an  active   propaganda	 against  the  Government,  visiting
Jabalpur and  other places  in the  State of Madhya Pradesh,
holding secret meetings, distributing leaflets, and inciting
the  constabulary  in  these  places  to  rise	against	 the
administration as a body in protest against the action taken
by the	Government. On this information being received, they
too  were   similarly  dismissed.   These  facts  speak	 for
themselves. The	 police normally oppose the grant of bail to
an accused  but here  we have  the paradoxical	situation of
some of	 the highest  police and  district officers going at
midnight to the Magistrate's house to apply for bail for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">297</span>
the accused.  The police are the guardians of law and order.
They stand  guard at the border between the green valleys of
law and order and the rough and hilly terrain of lawlessness
and public  disorder. If  these guards turn law-breakers and
create violent	public disorder	 and incite others to do the
same, we  can only  exclaim with  Juvenal,  "Quis  custodiet
ipsos' Custodes?"-  who is  to guard the guards themselves?"
(Satires, VI,347).  These facts	 leave	no  doubt  that	 the
situation  was	such  that  prompt  and	 urgent	 action	 was
necessary and  the holding  of a inquiry into the conduct of
each of the Petitioners would not have been expedient in the
interest of  the security  of  the  State.  All	 these	four
Petitions, therefore deserve to be dismissed.

<p id="p_262">     THAKKAR, J.  A benevolent and justice-oriented decision
of a  three-Judge Bench	 of this  Court, rendered  ten years
back in a group of service matters, (D.P.O. Southern Railway
v. T.R.	 Challappan), [1976]  1 S.C.R.	783, is sought to be
overruled by  the judgment  proposed to	 be delivered  by my
learned Brother Madon, J, with which, the majority appear to
agree. "Challappan"  having held  the field  for such a long
time, it  would have  been appropriate	if a  meeting of the
Judges Constituting the Bench had been convened to seriously
deliberate and	evolve a  consensus as	to whether or not to
overrule it.  A 'give' and 'take' of ideas, with due respect
for the	 holders of  the opposite  point of  view (in a true
democratic spirit  of tolerance), with willingness to accord
due consideration  to the  same, would not have impaired the
search for  the true  solution or hurt the cause of justice.
The holders  of the  rival view	 points could have, perhaps,
successfully persuaded	and converted  the  holders  of	 the
opposite point	of view	 or  got  themselves  persuaded	 and
converted to the other point of view.
</p><p id="p_263">     Brother Madon,  J, to whom the judgment was assigned by

of the	dissenting view	 point	could  have  prepared  their
dissenting opinions.  That was not to be. On the other hand,
it has	so transpired  that, the full draft judgment running
into 237  pages has  come to be circulated in the morning of
July 11,  1985, less  than 3  hours before  the deadline for
pronouncing the	 judgment. There  is  a	 time-compulsion  to
pronounce the  judgment, on  11th July, 1985, as the learned
Chief Justice  who has	presided over the Constitution Bench
is due to retire on that day, and the judge-time invested by
the five  Judges would	be wasted  if it  is not  pronounced
before his  retirement. The  judge-time would  be so  wasted
because the  entire exercise  would have  to be done afresh.
The neck-to-neck  race against	time and circumstances is so
keen that  it is impossible to prepare an elaborate judgment
presenting  the	  other	 point	of  view  within  hours	 and
circulate the  same amongst  all the Judges constituting the
Bench in  this important  matter which was heard for months,
months ago.  I am,  therefore, adopting the only course open
to me in undertaking the present exercise.
</p><p id="p_265">     'Challappan', in  my opinion, has been rightly decided.
And there  is no  compulsion to	 overrule it  - Even  if the
other point  of view were to appear to be more 'attractive',
it is  neither a  good nor  a sufficient  ground to overrule
'Challappan'. After  all what  does 'Challappan' do? It does
no more	 than enjoin  in the  context of  Rule 14(1) (a) and
therefore, as  a logical  corollary, also  in the context of
Rule 14(a)  (b) of  the	 Railway  Servants  (Discipline	 and
Appeal) Rules, 1968, that an employee must at least be heard
on the	question of  quantum  of  punishment  before  he  is
dismissed  or  removed	from  service  without	holding	 any
inquiry. The  ratio of	the decision  is so  innocuous	that
there is  hardly any  need to  overturn it.  Apart from	 the
weighty reasons	 articulated by the three-Judge Bench, there
are some  more which  can be  called into aid. But while the
'will' is  very much there, not the 'time', to elaborate the
reasons	 to   buttress	'Challappan'   and  to	counter	 the
criticism levelled against the thesis
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">300</span>
propounded therein. Or to expound my point of view in regard
to propositions	 in respect  of which I have reservations. I
propose to do so later if deemed necessary.
</p><p id="p_266">     For the  present, therefore,  suffice it  to say,	I am
unable to  persuade myself to fall in line with the majority
in overruling  'Challappan' and	 unable to  concur with	 the
consequential orders being passed in that context. I am also
unable to  associate myself  with the  exposition of  law in
regard to  the true  meaning and  content of  the  'pleasure
doctrine' and its implications and impact.
</p><p id="p_267">     The sphere	 in which  I  am  able	to  agree  with	 the
proposed judgment is in regard to the matters arising out of
orders passed in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/282836/" id="a_709">Article 311(2) (c)</a>
