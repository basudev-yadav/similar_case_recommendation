</p><p id="p_3">    1.   Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_4">    2.   This appeal arises out of the final order dated 3.8.2006 passed

    by the High Court of Allahabad at Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Writ

    Petitions Nos. 8967, 10514 and 7227 of 2004 whereby the above

    three separate writ petitions filed by the appellants herein were

    dismissed. In the said writ petitions the appellants herein challenged

    the FIR registered against them under <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_1">Sections 420</a> and <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_2">409</a> of the

     <a href="/doc/174581203/" id="a_6">69</a> of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (in short `<a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_7">Stamp Act</a>').

</p><p id="p_5">3.     Brief facts necessary for the purpose of disposal of present appeal

are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_6">          Appellants herein were working as officers in different capacities

at relevant point of time in the Life Insurance Corporation of India (in

short `LIC') and were then posted in different offices in the State of

Uttar Pradesh. All the three appellants have since retired from the

service of the LIC.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     1.    It has been stated that various branch offices of the LIC in the

     course of their business have to purchase large quantity of adhesive

     stamps for affixation on their policies and for issuing receipts etc.

     While the stamps used for receipts are the normal revenue stamps,

     the stamps used in respect of the policies issued by LIC are special

     `insurance stamps' which are affixed at the rates fixed under the

     Stamps Act.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     2.    For the purposes of execution of insurance policies by the LIC,

     under the law at the relevant point of time, on a sum of Rs. 1,000/-

     the rate of `stamp duty' is fixed at 40 paise on each policy. In order




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">             Page 2 of 20</span>
to execute the insurance policies promptly, from time to time, heavy

purchases of insurance stamps are stated to be done by the LIC. The

LIC used to purchase the same from the Treasury in any district as

well as from authorised licensed stamp vendors.

</p><p id="p_9">3.   On 30.07.2004, a First Information Report (in short 'FIR')

bearing Crime No. 271/04 was lodged against the appellants at

Police Station Bhelupura, Tehsil Sadar, District Varanasi for the

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_8">Sections 420</a>/<a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_9">409</a> of IPC and under

Sections 64/69 of the Stamps Act in relation to the purchase of

certain stamps. A perusal of the FIR shows that it was lodged on the

basis of a letter bearing No. 11912/Stamps-693(P)/2002-2003(83-

</p><p id="p_10">84) dated 26.06.2004 written by the Commissioner, Stamps, U.P.,

Allahabad and letter No. 237245-6 (2003-04) Mu, Ra, La. dated

28.7.2004 written by the Commissioner, Varanasi Division,

Varanasi. It has been stated in the FIR that the Divisional Office of

the LIC, Varanasi has not purchased the Insurance Stamps from the

Treasury office of U.P. but the same was purchased from the Stamp

Vendors, outside of State, which caused loss of Rs. 1,67,21,520.00/-

to the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_11">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">       Page 3 of 20</span>
</p><p id="p_12">4.   The appellants herein approached the Allahabad High Court for

quashing of the aforesaid FIR. However, the High Court on

03.08.2006 dismissed all the three writ petitions vide three separate

but identical orders holding that the FIR prima facie discloses the

commission of cognizable offence and there was no ground of

interference.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.   Aggrieved by the said orders of the High Court, the appellants

have preferred the present appeal. It was contended by the appellants

that the FIR was lodged only on the directions of the higher

authorities for the purpose of arresting the present appellants so as to

humiliate and harass them. It has been submitted that the provisions

of the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_10">Stamp Act</a> and relevant provisions of Constitution clearly

indicates the untenability of the allegations made in the FIR.

</p><p id="p_14">6.   It is the case of the appellant that purchasing of stamps assumes

urgency because the insurance contract must be executed along with

insurance policies at the earliest possible time and immediately on

receipt of the first premium and if there is any delay in issuing the

insurance stamps and if in the meantime there is a death of life

assured, then difficulties arise regarding payment of insurance

money/claim. As there are various sources for purchase of insurance




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">       Page 4 of 20</span>
     stamps viz. from the Treasury of any district throughout the State

     and also from any duly authorised licensed stamp vendors, the LIC is

     entitled to purchase the insurance stamps from any such stamp

     vendors throughout the country. It has been submitted that there is

     no prohibition under the law and in the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_11">Stamp Act</a> which mandates

     that the LIC will purchase the insurance stamps only from a

     particular district or from a particular State.

</p><p id="p_15">     7.   On the other hand, it is the case of the respondent that if the

     stamps are permitted to be purchased from any other State other than

     the State in which the instrument is to be first executed, it shall not

     only cause huge loss of revenue to the State in which the instrument

     is executed but would also render the rules framed by the State

     Government for regulation of sale and supply of the stamps and the

     administrative    machinery     established       therein   as   futile   and

     meaningless. It is also the case that it would further prevent the State

     Government from examining as to whether the stamps are fake or

     genuine.
</p>
<p id="p_16">8.    The law which governs the rate of payment of `stamp duty' in

respect of policies of insurance and certain other transactions has been




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">            Page 5 of 20</span>
dealt under Entry 91 of List 1(Union List) of 7th Schedule to the

Constitution of India (in short `Constitution'). It reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "91. Rates of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange,
             cheques, promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit,
             policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies
             and receipts."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_17">1.    Our attention has been drawn towards Entry 63 of List II (State

List) of 7thSchedule which provide for power to the State Legislatures in

regard to the rate of `stamp duty' other than those specified in List I

(Union List).
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "63. Rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other than
             those specified in the provisions of List I with regard to rates
             of stamp duty."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_18">1.     Other relevant entry which has been cited is Entry 44 of List III

(Concurrent List) which excludes `rates of stamp duty'.


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "44. Stamp duties other than duties or fees collected by
             means of judicial stamps, but not including rates of stamp
             duty."</blockquote><p id="p_19">



</p><p id="p_20">     1.   The above-mentioned various entries in the three lists are the

     fields of legislation with regard to stamps. They are designed to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">            Page 6 of 20</span>
     define and delimit the respective areas of legislative competence of

     the Union and State Legislatures. Under Entry 44 of List III, the

     power to levy stamp duty on all documents, is concurrent. But the

     power to prescribe the rate of such levy is excluded from Entry 44 of

     List III and is divided between Parliament and the State Legislatures.

     If the instrument falls under the categories mentioned in Entry 91 of

     List I, the power to prescribe the rate will belong to Parliament, and

     for all other instruments or documents, the power to prescribe the

     rate belongs to the State Legislature under Entry 63 of List II.

     Therefore, the meaning of Entry 44 of List III is that excluding the

     power to prescribe the rate, the charging provisions of a law relating

     to stamp duty can be made both by the Union and the State

     Legislature, in the concurrent sphere, subject to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_12">Article 254</a> in case

     of repugnancy.
</p>
<p id="p_21">2.    With regards to the polices of life insurance the rates of stamp duty

have been stipulated by Parliament in the Schedule I to the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_13">Stamp Act</a>

</p><p id="p_38">     1.   <a href="/doc/179805872/" id="a_19">Section 64</a> of the Stamp Act provides for the penalty in case of

     omission to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/180050689/" id="a_20">Section 27</a>. On the other

     hand, <a href="/doc/174581203/" id="a_21">Section 69</a> deals with the penalty to be imposed for breach of

     rule relating to sale of stamps and for unauthorised sales.

</p><p id="p_39">2.     Pursuant to rule making powers given to States under <a href="/doc/15501804/" id="a_22">Section 74</a>

and <a href="/doc/166262986/" id="a_23">75</a> of the Stamp Act, the State of U. P. has made rules called the

United Provinces Stamp Rules, 1942 (in short `Stamps Rules'. Our

attention has been drawn towards Rule 3 of the Stamp Rules which

provides the description of stamps as follows:


</p><p id="p_40">             "Rule 3. Description of Stamps. - (1) Except as otherwise

</p><p id="p_43">           (2) There shall be three kinds of stamps for indicating the
           payment of duty with which     instruments are chargeable,
           namely:-
</p><p id="p_44">           (a) impressed stamps, that is to say stamped papers bearing
           the words `Indian non- judicial' printed thereon, which

</p><p id="p_49">1.   Further, Rule 115-A of the Stamps Rules provides for the mode of

sale of such stamps. It reads as follows:

          stamps shall be sold to the public of local and branch depots
          at which they are stocked."
</p>
<p id="p_52">

</p><p id="p_53">1.     Placing reliance on the above-mentioned rules, it was contended

on behalf of the State of U.P. that the acts of the appellants of

purchasing insurance stamps from outside the State was contrary to

above-mentioned rules. However, one cannot lose sight of the fact

that the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_25">Stamp Act</a> being a central legislation is covered under List I

(Union List) of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. Rule making

power has been given to the States under <a href="/doc/15501804/" id="a_26">Section 74</a> and <a href="/doc/166262986/" id="a_27">75</a> of the

Stamp Act which deals with `power to make rules relating to sale of

stamps' and `power to make rules generally to carry out Act'

respectively. The scope of such rule making power of the State are

only upto the extent as provided under the central law i.e. <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_28">Stamp

Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_54">2.     In the case at hand, the Stamp Rules were framed by the U.P.

Government in the year 1942. A perusal of the statement of object of

the said Rules shows that the such Rules was framed in exercise of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">        Page 11 of 20</span>
the powers conferred by the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_29">Stamp Act</a> and in pursuance of the

powers conferred by the notification of the Government of India,

Finance Department (Central Revenues) No. 9/Stamps, dated the 13th

November, 1937, and in supersession of all previous notifications of

the Government of India and the Provincial Government in this

behalf. Undoubtedly, when these Rules were framed the present

constitutional scheme was not in place.
</p>
<p id="p_55">3.   As mentioned earlier, Under Entry 44 of List III, the power to

levy stamp duty on all documents, is concurrent. But the power to

prescribe the rate of such levy is excluded from Entry 44 of List III

and is divided between Parliament and the State Legislatures. If the

instrument falls under the categories mentioned in Entry 91 of List I,

the power to prescribe the rate will belong to Parliament, and for all

other instruments or documents, the power to prescribe the rate

belongs to the State Legislature under Entry 63 of List II. Therefore,

the meaning of Entry 44 of List III is that excluding the power to

prescribe the rate, the charging provisions of a law relating to stamp

duty can be made both by the Union and the State Legislature, in the

concurrent sphere, subject to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_30">Article 254</a> in case of repugnancy. So,

in the case at hand, it is Entry 91 of List I of the 7th Schedule which




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">      Page 12 of 20</span>
     would be applicable and the States does not have the power to

     circumvent a central law.
</p>
<p id="p_56">4.    As far as quashing of FIR is concerned, the scope of power under

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_31">Section 482</a> CrPC has been explained in a series of decisions by this

Court. <a href="/doc/56823/" id="a_32">In Nagawwa v. Veeranna Shivalingappa Konjalgi</a>, (1976) 3

SCC 736, it was held that the Magistrate while issuing process against

the accused should satisfy himself as to whether the allegations in the

complaint, if proved, would ultimately end in the conviction of the

accused. It was held that the order of Magistrate issuing process against

the accused could be quashed under the following circumstances: (SCC

p. 741, para 5)


            "(1) Where the allegations made in the complaint or the
            statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same
            taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against

            ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the
            accused;
</p>
<p id="p_57">            (2) Where the allegations made in the complaint are patently
            absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person
            can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground
            for proceeding against the accused;
</p>
<p id="p_58">            (3) Where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in
            issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based
            either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly
            irrelevant or inadmissible; and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">           Page 13 of 20</span>
           (4) Where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal
           defects, such as, want of sanction, or absence of a complaint
           by legally competent authority and the like."

filed against the respondent Bhajan Lal for the offences under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_34">Sections

161</a> and <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_35">165</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_36">Section 5(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act

was proper and legal. Reversing the order passed by the High Court,

this Court explained the circumstances under which such power could

be exercised. Apart from reiterating the earlier norms laid down by this

Court, it was further explained that such power could be exercised

where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and

inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever

reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding

against the accused. It observed as follows in para 102:

           and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute
           any offence or make out the case alleged against the accused.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           For this purpose, the complaint has to be examined as a
           whole, but without examining the merits of the allegations.
           Neither a detailed inquiry nor a meticulous analysis of the
           material nor an assessment of the reliability or genuineness

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           (ii) A complaint may also be quashed where it is a clear
           abuse of the process of the court, as when the criminal

           fides/malice for wreaking vengeance or to cause harm, or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">         Page 16 of 20</span>
<p id="p_69">          (iii) The power to quash shall not, however, be used to stifle
          or scuttle a legitimate prosecution. The power should be
          used sparingly and with abundant caution.
</p>
<p id="p_70">          (iv) The complaint is not required to verbatim reproduce the
          legal ingredients of the offence alleged. If the necessary
          factual foundation is laid in the complaint, merely on the
          ground that a few ingredients have not been stated in detail,
          the proceedings should not be quashed. Quashing of the
          complaint is warranted only where the complaint is so bereft
          of even the basic facts which are absolutely necessary for
          making out the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_71">          (v) A given set of facts may make out: (a) purely a civil
          wrong; or (b) purely a criminal offence; or (c) a civil wrong
          as also a criminal offence. A commercial transaction or a
          contractual dispute, apart from furnishing a cause of action
          for seeking remedy in civil law, may also involve a criminal
          offence. As the nature and scope of a civil proceeding are
          different from a criminal proceeding, the mere fact that the
          complaint relates to a commercial transaction or breach of
          contract, for which a civil remedy is available or has been
          availed, is not by itself a ground to quash the criminal
          proceedings. The test is whether the allegations in the
          complaint disclose a criminal offence or not."

          particular, a First Information Report unless the allegations
          contained therein, even if given face value and taken to be
          correct in their entirety, disclosed no cognizable offence.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">         Page 17 of 20</span>
<p id="p_73">        (2) For the said purpose, the Court, save and except in very
        exceptional circumstances, would not look to any document
        relied upon by the defence.
</p><p id="p_74">        (3) Such a power should be exercised very sparingly. If the
        allegations made in the FIR disclose commission of an
        offence, the court shall not go beyond the same and pass an
        order in favour of the accused to hold absence of any mens
        rea or actus reus.
</p><p id="p_75">        (4) If the allegation discloses a civil dispute, the same by
        itself may not be a ground to hold that the criminal
        proceedings should not be allowed to continue.
</p><p id="p_76">        16. It is furthermore well known that no hard and fast rule
        can be laid down. Each case has to be considered on its own
        merits. The Court, while exercising its inherent jurisdiction,
        although would not interfere with a genuine complaint
        keeping in view the purport and object for which the
        provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_54">Sections 482</a> and <a href="/doc/291563/" id="a_55">483</a> of the Code of Criminal
        Procedure had been introduced by Parliament but would not
        hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction in appropriate cases. One
        of the paramount duties of the superior courts is to see that a
        person who is apparently innocent is not subjected to
        persecution and humiliation on the basis of a false and
        wholly untenable complaint."

<p id="p_77">

</p><p id="p_78">1.   In the case at hand, it has been stated in the FIR that the

Divisional Office of the LIC, Varanasi has not purchased the

Insurance stamps from the Treasury office of U.P. but the same was

purchased from the Stamp Vendors, outside of State, which caused

loss to the State exchequer to the tune of Rs. 1,67,21,520.00/- to the

state government. So, the sole allegation against the appellants is

that they have purchased the insurance stamps from outside the State



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">      Page 18 of 20</span>
of UP. However, as we have already noted that the said act of the

appellant cannot be said to be inconsistent with any provisions of the

<a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_56">Stamp Act</a> or any other rules. So, the allegation made in the FIR

even if proved by the prosecution does not constitute any offence.

</p><p id="p_79">2.   Further, the registration of FIR shows complete non-application

of mind as the said FIR also brings within its ambit purchase of

insurance stamps done within the State of U.P. There cannot be any

dispute with regard to the insurance stamps which has been duly

purchased from the State of U.P. itself. As already noted, the State of

U.P. has sought to invoke <a href="/doc/179805872/" id="a_57">Section 64</a> (c) of the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_58">Stamp Act</a> to contend

that the action of appellants was `calculated to deprive the

Government of any duty or penalty', but there is no denial of the fact

that appellants were indeed paying the duties, and by no means

`depriving the government of any duty or penalty'. So, the act of the

respondent is nothing but clear a case of its mala fide intention to

harass the appellants herein. It is wholly immaterial whether

appellants are purchasing the insurance stamps from the State of

U.P. or from any other State. In fact, as mentioned earlier, Rules

115-A of the U.P. Stamp Rules itself declares that `Stamps which are

the property of the central Government'. That being the legal




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">      Page 19 of 20</span>
     position, it is legally untenable to contend that the insurance stamps

     must be purchased from the State of U. P. only. Further, it must be

     kept in mind that Section 69 of the Stamps Act will also have no

     application as, admittedly, the appellants are neither the stamp

     vendors nor doing any unauthorised sale of the insurance stamps.

     Keeping this in mind, the High Court ought to have quashed the

     criminal proceedings launched against the appellants.

</p><p id="p_80">3.    Hence, the decision of the High Court is liable to be set aside and

accordingly, we set it aside. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
