RUMA PAL,J

In 1972 Sabhajit Tewary, a Junior Stenographer with the
Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) filed a writ
petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article 32</a> of the Constitution claiming parity of
remuneration with the  stenographers who were newly recruited to
the CSIR.  His claim was based on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
A Bench of five judges of this Court denied him the benefit of that
Article because they held in <a href="/doc/435970/" id="a_3">Sabhajit Tewari V. Union of India</a>
that the writ application was not maintainable against CSIR as it
was not an "authority" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution.  The correctness of the decision is before us for re-
consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       The immediate cause for such re-consideration is a writ
application filed by the appellants in the Calcutta High Court
challenging the termination of their services by the respondent
No.1 which is a unit of CSIR.  They prayed for an interim order
before the learned Single Judge.  That was refused by the Court on
the prima view that the writ application was itself not
maintainable against the respondent No.1.  The appeal was also
dismissed in view of the decision of this Court in Sabhajit
Tewary's case .
</p>
<p id="p_4">	Challenging the order of the Calcutta High Court, the
appellants filed an appeal by way of special leave before this
Court.	On 5th August, 1986 a Bench of two Judges of this Court
referred the matter to a Constitution Bench  being of the view that
the decision in Sabhajit Tewary required re-consideration
"having regard to the pronouncement of this Court in several
subsequent decisions in respect of several other institutes of
similar nature set up by the Union of India".
The questions therefore before us are - is the CSIR a State
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_5">Article 12</a> of the Constitution and if it is
should this Court reverse a decision which has stood for over a
quarter of a century?
</p>
<p id="p_5">	The Constitution has to an extent defined the word 'State' in
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_6">Article 12</a> itself as including:
</p>
<p id="p_6"> "the Government and Parliament of India and
the Government and the Legislature of each of
the States and all local or other authorities
within the territory of India or under the
control of the Government of India".
</p>
<p id="p_7">    That an 'inclusive' definition is generally not exhaustive is
a statement of the obvious and as far as <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_7">Article 12</a> is concerned,
has been so held by this Court .  The words 'State' and
'Authority' used in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_8">Article 12</a> therefore remain, to use the words
of Cardozo , among "the great generalities of the Constitution"
the content of which has been and continues to be supplied by
Courts from time to time.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	It would be a practical impossibility and an unnecessary
exercise to note each of the multitude of decisions on the point.  It
is enough  for our present purposes to merely note that the
decisions may be categorized broadly into those which express a
narrow and  those that express a more liberal view and to consider
some decisions of this Court as illustrative of	 this apparent
divergence.  In the ultimate analysis the difference may perhaps
be attributable to different stages in the history of the development
of the law by judicial decisions on the subject.
</p>
<p id="p_9">But before considering the decisions it must be emphasized
that the significance of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_9">Article 12</a> lies in the fact that it occurs in
Part III of the Constitution which deals with fundamental rights.
The various Articles in Part-III have placed responsibilities and
obligations on the 'State' viz-a-vis the individual to ensure
constitutional protection of the individual's rights against the
State, including the right to equality under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14</a> and equality
of opportunity in matters of public employment under <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_11">Article 16</a>
and most importantly the right to enforce all or any of these
fundamental rights against the 'State' as defined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_12">Article 12</a>
either under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_13">Article 32</a> by this Court or under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> by the
High Courts by issuance of writs or directions or orders.
The range and scope of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_15">Article 14</a> and consequently <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_16">Article
16</a> have been widened by a process of judicial interpretation so
that the right to equality now not only means the right not to be
discriminated against but also protection against any arbitrary or
irrational act of the State.  It has been said that:
</p>
<p id="p_10">"Articles 14 and 16 strike at
arbitrariness in State action and ensure
fairness and equality of treatment".
</p>
<p id="p_11">	Keeping pace with this broad approach to the concept of
equality under Articles 14 and 16, Courts have	whenever
possible, sought to curb an arbitrary exercise of power against
individuals by 'centres of power', and there was  correspondingly
an expansion in the judicial definition of 'State' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_17">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_12">     Initially the definition of State was treated as exhaustive and
confined to the authorities or those which could be read ejusdem
generis with the authorities mentioned in the definition of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article
12</a> itself.  The next stage was reached when the definition of
'State'	 came to be understood with reference to the remedies
available against it. For example, historically, a writ of mandamus
was available for enforcement of statutory duties or duties of a
public nature . Thus a statutory corporation, with regulations
framed by such Corporation pursuant to statutory powers was
considered  a State, and the public duty was limited to those which
were created by statute.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	   The decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in
<a href="/doc/459864/" id="a_19">Rajasthan Electricity Board vs. Mohan Lal &amp; Ors</a>. (1967) 3
SCR 377	 is illustrative of this.  The question there was whether
the Electricity Board -	 which was a Corporation constituted under
a statute primarily for the purpose of carrying on commercial
activities could come within the definition of 'State' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_20">Article 12.</a>
After considering earlier decisions, it was said:
</p>
<p id="p_14">"These decisions of the Court support
our view that the expression "other
authorities" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_21">Article 12</a> will include
all constitutional or statutory
authorities on whom powers are
conferred by law.  It is not at all
material that some of the powers
conferred may be for the purpose of
carrying on commercial activities".
</p>
<p id="p_15">It followed that since a Company incorporated under the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_22">Companies Act</a> is not formed statutorily and is not subject to any
statutory duty vis a vis an individual, it was	excluded from the
purview of '<a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_23">State'  In Praga Tools Corporation V. Shri C.A.
Imanual &amp; Ors</a>.	where the question was whether an application
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a>  for issuance of a writ of mandamus would lie
impugning an agreement arrived at between a Company and its
workmen,  the Court held that:
</p>
<p id="p_16">".there was neither a statutory nor a
public duty imposed on it by a statute
in respect of which enforcement could
be sought by means of a mandamus,
nor was there in its workmen any
corresponding legal right for
enforcement of any such statutory or
public duty.  The High Court,
therefore, was right in holding that no
writ petition for a mandamus or an
order in the nature of mandamus
could lie against the company".
</p>
<p id="p_17">	By 1975 Mathew, J. in Sukhdev Singh &amp; Ors. v.
</p><p id="p_18">Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi &amp; Ors.  noted that the
concept of "State" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_25">Article 12</a> had undergone "drastic changes in
recent years". The question in that case was whether the Oil and

Natural Gas Commission, the Industrial Finance Corporation and
the Life Insurance Corporation each of which were public
corporations set up by	statutes were authorities and therefore
within the definition of State in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_26">Article 12.</a> The Court affirmed
the decision in <a href="/doc/459864/" id="a_27">Rajasthan State Electricity Board V. Mohan
Lal</a> (supra) and held that the Court could compel compliance of
statutory rules. But the majority view expressed by A.N. Ray, CJ
also indicated that the concept would include a public authority
which:
</p>
<p id="p_19">" is a body which has public or statutory
duties to perform and which performs those
duties and carries out its transactions for the
benefit of the public and not for private
profit.	 Such an authority is not precluded
from making a  profit for the public
benefit".
</p>
<p id="p_20">				(emphasis added)

	      The use of the alternative is significant.   The Court
scrutinised the history of the formation of the three Corporations,
the financial  support	given  by  the	Central	  Government,	the
utilization of the finances so provided, the nature of service
rendered and noted that despite the fact that each of the
Corporations ran on profits earned by it nevertheless the structure
of each of the Corporations showed that the three Corporations
represented the 'voice and hands' of the Central Government.
The Court came to the conclusion that although the employees of
the three Corporations were not servants of the Union or the State,
"these statutory bodies are 'authorities' within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_28">Article 12</a> of the Constitution".
</p>
<p id="p_21">	 Mathew J in his concurring judgment went further and
propounded a view which presaged the subsequent developments
in the law. He said:
</p>
<p id="p_22">"A state is an abstract entity.	 It can only act
through the instrumentality or agency of
natural or juridical persons.  Therefore,
there is nothing strange in the notion of the
state acting through a corporation and
making it an agency or instrumentality of
the State.."
</p>
<p id="p_23">      For identifying such an agency or instrumentality he
propounded four indicia:
</p>
<p id="p_24">(1) "A finding of the state financial support
plus an unusual degree of control over the
management and policies might lead one to
characterize an operation as state action."
</p>
<p id="p_25">(2)	"Another factor which might be
considered is whether the operation is an
important public function."
</p>
<p id="p_26">(3) "The combination of state aid and the
furnishing of an important public service
may result in a conclusion that the
operation should be classified as a state
agency.	 If a given function is of such
public importance and so closely related to
a governmental functions as to be classified
as a government agency, then even the
presence or absence of state financial aid
might be irrelevant in making a finding of
state action.  If the function does not fall
within such a description then mere
addition of state money would not influence
the conclusion."
</p>
<p id="p_27">(4) "The ultimate question which is relevant
for our purpose is whether such a
corporation is an agency or instrumentality
of the government for carrying on a
business for the benefit of the public.	 In
other words, the question is, for whose
benefit was the corporation carrying on the
business?"
</p>
<p id="p_28">	     Sabhajit Tewary  was decided by the same Bench on the
same day as Sukhdev Singh (supra).  The contentions of the
employee was that CSIR is an agency of the Central Government
on the basis of the CSIR Rules which, it was argued, showed that
the Government controlled the functioning of CSIR in all its
aspects.   The submission was somewhat cursorily negatived by
this Court on the ground that all this

   "will not establish anything more
than the fact that the Government takes
special care that the promotion, guidance
and co-operation of scientific and industrial
research, the institution and financing of
specific researches, establishment or
development and assistance to special
institutions or departments of the existing
institutions for scientific study of problems
affecting particular industry in a trade, the
utilisation of the result of the researches
conducted under the auspices of the Council
towards the development of industries in
the country are carried out in a responsible
manner."
</p>
<p id="p_29">	Although the Court noted that it was the Government which
was taking the "special care" nevertheless the writ petition was
dismissed ostensibly because the Court factored into its decision
two premises:
</p>
<p id="p_30">i)	"The society does not have a statutory
character like the Oil and Natural Gas
Commission or the Life Insurance
Corporation or Industrial Finance
Corporation.  It is a Society incorporated in
accordance with the provisions of the
Society's <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_29">Registration Act</a>", and


</p><p id="p_31">ii)	"This Court has held in <a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_30">Praga Tools
Corporation  V. Shri C.A. Imanual &amp; Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_32">[1969] 3 SCR 773, <a href="/doc/14624/" id="a_31">Heavy Engineering
Mazdoor Union v. The State of Bihar &amp;
Ors</a>. [1969] 3 SCR 995 and in <a href="/doc/1924249/" id="a_32">S.L. Agarwal
v. General Manager Hindustan Steel Ltd</a>.
</p><p id="p_33">[1970]3 SCR 363 that the Praga Tools
Corporation, Heavy Engineering Mazdoor
Union and Hindustan Steel Ltd. are all
companies incorporated under the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_33">Companies Act</a> and the employees of these
companies do not enjoy the protection
available to Government servants as
contemplated in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_34">Article 311.</a>  The
companies were held in these cases to have
independent existence of the Government
and by the law relating to corporations.
</p><p id="p_34">These could not be held to be departments
of the Government".
</p>
<p id="p_35">	  With respect, we  are of the view that both the premises
were not really relevant and in fact contrary to the 'voice' and
'hands' approach in Sukhdev Singh. Besides reliance by the
Court on decisions pertaining to <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_35">Article 311</a> which is contained in
Part XIV of the Constitution was inapposite. What was under
consideration was <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_36">Art. 12</a> which by definition is limited to Part
III and by virtue of <a href="/doc/784506/" id="a_37">Art. 36</a> to Part IV of the Constitution. As said
by another Constitution Bench later in this context:
</p>
<p id="p_36">"Merely because a juristic entity may be an
"authority" and therefore "State" within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_38">Article 12</a>, it may not be elevated to
the position of "State" for the purpose of Articles
309, 310 and 311 which find a place in Part XIV.
The definition of "State" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_39">Article 12</a> which
includes an "authority" within the territory of
India or under the control of the Government of
India is limited in its application only to Part III
and by virtue of <a href="/doc/784506/" id="a_40">Article 36</a>, to Part IV: it does not
extend to the other provisions of the Constitution
and hence a juristic entity  which may be "State"
for the purpose of Parts III and IV would not be so
for the purpose of Part XIV or any other provision
of the Constitution.  This is why the decisions of
this Court in <a href="/doc/1924249/" id="a_41">S.L. Aggarwal  v. Hindustan Steel
Ltd</a>.,  and other cases involving the applicability
of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_42">Article 311</a> have no relevance to the issue
before us".
</p>
<p id="p_37">	Normally, a precedent like Sabhajit Tewary which has
stood for a length of time should not be reversed, however
erroneous the reasoning if it has stood unquestioned, without its
reasoning being 'distinguished' out of all recognition by
subsequent decisions and if the	 principles enunciated in the
earlier decision can stand consistently and be reconciled with
subsequent decisions of this Court, some equally authoritative.	 In
our view Sabhajit Tewary   fulfills both conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_38">	Side-stepping the majority approach in Sabhajit Tewary,
the 'drastic changes' in the perception of 'State' heralded in
Sukhdev Singh  by Mathew, J and the tests formulated by him
were affirmed and amplified in <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_43">Ramana v. International
Airport Authority of India</a> . Although the International Airport
Authority of India is a statutory corporation and therefore within
the accepted connotation of State, the Bench of three Judges
developed  the concept of State.  The rationale for the approach
was the one adopted by Mathew J in Sukhdev Singh:
</p>
<p id="p_39">" In the early days, when the
Government had limited functions, it could
operate effectively through natural persons
constituting its civil service and they were
found adequate to discharge governmental
functions, which were of traditional vintage.
But as the tasks of the Government
multiplied with the advent of the welfare
State, it began to be increasingly felt that the
frame work of civil service was not
sufficient to handle the new tasks which
were often of specialised and highly
technical character.  The inadequacy of the
civil service to deal with these new
problems came to be realised and it became
necessary to forge a new instrumentality or
administrative device for handling these new
problems.  It was in these circumstances and
with a view to supplying this administrative
need that the public corporation came into
being as the third arm of the Government".
</p>
<p id="p_40">	 From this perspective, the logical sequitur  is that it really
does not matter what guise the State adopts for this purpose,
whether by a Corporation established by statute or incorporated
under a law such as the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_44">Companies Act</a> or formed under  the
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_45">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860.  Neither the form of the
Corporation, nor its ostensible autonomy would take away from
its character as 'State' and its constitutional accountability under
Part III vis-a-vis the individual if it were in fact acting as an
instrumentality or agency of Government.
</p>
<p id="p_41">As far as Sabhajit Tewary  was concerned it was
'explained' and distinguished in Ramana saying:
"The Court no doubt took the view on the basis
of facts relevant to the constitution and
functioning of the Council that it was not an
'authority', but we do not find any discussion
in this case as to what are the features which
must be present before a corporation can be
regarded as an 'authority' within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_46">Art.12.</a>  This decision does not lay down any
principle or test for the purpose of determining
when a corporation can be said to be an
'authority'.  If at all any test can be gleaned
from the decision, it is whether the Corporation
is 'really an agency of the Government'.  The
Court seemed to hold on the facts that the
Council was not an agency of the Government
and was, therefore, not an 'authority' ".
</p>
<p id="p_42">The tests propounded by Mathew, J in Sukhdev Singh  were
elaborated in Ramana and were re-formulated two years later by
a Constitution Bench in	 <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_47">Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib
Sehravardi</a>  .	What may have been technically characterised as
'obiter dicta' in Sukhdev Singh and Ramana   (since in both
cases the "authority" in fact involved was a statutory corporation),
formed the ratio decidendi of Ajay Hasia.  The case itself dealt
with a challenge under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_48">Article 32</a> to admissions made to a college
established and administered by a Society registered under the
Jammu &amp; <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_49">Kashmir Registration of Societies Act</a> 1898.  The
contention of the Society was that even if there were an arbitrary
procedure followed for selecting candidates for admission, and
that this may have resulted in denial of equality to the petitioners
in the matter of admission in violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_50">Article 14</a>, nevertheless
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_51">Article 14</a> was not available to the petitioners because the Society
was not a State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_52">Art. 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_43">	The Court recognised that:
</p>
<p id="p_44"> " Obviously the Society cannot be
equated with the Government of India or
the Government of any State nor can it be
said to be a local authority and therefore, it
must come within the expression "other
authorities" if it is to fall within the
definition of 'State' ".
</p>
<p id="p_45">But it said that:
</p>
<p id="p_46">"The courts should be anxious to enlarge
the scope and width of the Fundamental
Rights by bringing within their sweep every
authority which is an instrumentality or
agency of the government or through the
corporate personality of which the
government is acting, so as to subject the
government in all its myriad activities,
whether through natural persons or through
corporate entities, to the basic obligation of
the Fundamental Rights".
</p>
<p id="p_47">It was made clear that the genesis of the corporation was
immaterial and that:
</p>
<p id="p_48"> " The concept of instrumentality or
agency of the government is not limited to a
corporation created by a statute but is equally
applicable to a company or society and in a
given case it would have to be decided, on a
consideration of the relevant factors, whether
the company or society is an instrumentality
or agency of the government so as to come
within the meaning of the expression
"authority" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_53">Article 12".</a>
</p>

<p id="p_49">	  Ramana was noted and quoted with approval in extenso
and  the tests propounded for determining as to when a
corporation can be said to be an instrumentality or agency of the
Government therein were culled out and summarised as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_50">(1)	One thing is clear that if the entire
share capital of the corporation is held
by Government, it would go a long way
towards indicating that the corporation
is an instrumentality or agency of
Government.
</p>

<p id="p_51">(2)	Where the financial assistance of the
State is so much as to meet almost
entire expenditure of the corporation, it
would afford some indication of the
corporation being impregnated with
governmental character.
</p>
<p id="p_52">(3)	It may also be a relevant
factor..whether the corporation
enjoys monopoly status	which is State
conferred or State protected.
</p>
<p id="p_53">(4)	Existence of deep and pervasive State
control may afford an indication that
the corporation is a State agency or
instrumentality.
</p>

<p id="p_54">(5)	If the functions of the corporation are
of public importance and closely
related to governmental functions, it
would be a relevant factor in
classifying the corporation as an
instrumentality or agency of
Government.
</p>

<p id="p_55">(6)	Specifically, if a department of
Government is transferred to a
corporation, it would be a strong factor
supportive of this inference of the
corporation being an instrumentality or
agency of Government.
</p>
<p id="p_56">	In dealing with Sabhajit Tewary the Court in  Ajay Hasia
noted that since  Sabhajit Tewary  was a decision given by a
Bench of Five Judges of this Court it was undoubtedly binding.
The Court read Sabhajit Tewary	as implicity assenting to the
proposition that CSIR could have been an instrumentality of
agency of the Government even though it was a Registered
Society and limited the decision to the facts of the case. It held
that the Court in Sabhajit Tewari :
</p>
<p id="p_57">" did not rest its conclusion on the ground
that the council was a society registered
under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_54">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860,
but proceeded to consider various other
features of the council for arriving at the
conclusion that it was not an agency of the
government and therefore not an 'authority'".
</p>
<p id="p_58">		The conclusion was then reached applying the tests
formulated to the facts that the Society in Ajay Hasia	was an
authority falling within the definition of "State" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_55">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_59">	On the same day that the decision in Ajay Hasia was
pronounced came the decision of <a href="/doc/1602162/" id="a_56">Som Prakash Rekhi v. Union
of India</a> .  Here too, the reasoning in Ramana was followed and
Bharat Petroleum Corporation was held to be a 'State' within the
"enlarged meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_57">Art.12".</a>	Sabhajit Tewary was criticised
and distinguished as being limited to the facts of the case. It was
said:
</p>
<p id="p_60">"The rulings relied on are,
unfortunately, in the province of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_58">Art.311</a> and it is clear that a body may
be 'State' under Part III but not under
Part XIV.  Ray, C.J., rejected the
argument that merely because the
Prime Minister was the President or
that the other members were
appointed and removed by
Government did not make the Society
a 'State'.  With great respect, we
agree that in the absence of the other
features elaborated in Airport
Authority case (1979) 3 SCC 489:
</p><p id="p_61">(AIR 1979 SC 1628) the composition
of the Government Body alone may
not be decisive.  The laconic
discussion and the limited ratio in
Tewary (1975) 3 SCR 616 : (AIR
1975 SC 1329) hardly help either side
here."

<p id="p_62">	The tests to determine whether a body falls within the
definition of 'State' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_59">Article 12</a> laid down in Ramana with the
Constitution Bench  imprimatur in Ajay Hasia form the keystone
of the subsequent jurisprudential superstructure  judicially crafted
on the subject which is apparent from a chronological
consideration of the authorities cited.
</p>
<p id="p_63"><a href="/doc/1364553/" id="a_60">In P.K. Ramachandra Iyer and Others V. Union of India
and Others</a> 1984 (2) SCC 141,  it was held that both the Indian
Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and its affiliate Indian
Veterinary Research Institute  were bodies as would be
comprehended in the expression 'other authority' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_61">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution.   Yet another judicial blow was dealt to the
decision in Sabhajit Tewary when it was said:
</p>
<p id="p_64">"Much water has flown down the
Jamuna since the dicta in Sabhajit
Tewary case   and conceding that
it is not specifically overruled in
later decision, its ratio is
considerably watered down so as
to be a decision confined to its
own facts."
</p>
<p id="p_65"><a href="/doc/1930527/" id="a_62">B. S. Minhas v. Indian Statistical Institute &amp; Ors</a>.   held
that the Indian Statistical Institute, a registered Society is an
instrumentality of the Central Government and as such is an
'authority' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_63">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
The basis was that the composition of respondent No.1 is
dominated by the representatives appointed by the Central
Government.  The money required for running the Institute is
provided entirely by the Central Government and even if any
other moneys are to be received by the Institute it can be done
only with the approval of the Central Government, and the
accounts of the Institute have also to be submitted to the Central
Government for its scrutiny and satisfaction. The Society has to
comply with all such directions as may be issued by the Central
Government.  It was held that the control of the Central
Government is deep and pervasive.
</p>
<p id="p_66">The decision in <a href="/doc/477313/" id="a_64">Central Inland Water Transport
Corporation Ltd. V. Brojo Nath Ganguli</a>	held that the
appellant company was covered by <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_65">Article 12</a> because it is
financed entirely by three Governments and is completely under
the control of the Central Government and is managed by the
Chairman and Board of Directors appointed by the Central
Government and removable by it and also that the activities
carried on by the Corporation are of vital national importance.
However, the tests propounded in  Ajay Hasia  were not
applied in Tekraj Vasandi alias <a href="/doc/1837473/" id="a_66">K.S. Basandhi V. Union of
India and Others</a> 1988 (1) SCC 237, where the Institute of
Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies (ICPS), a society
registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_67">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 was held
not to be an "other authority" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_68">Article 12.</a>
The reasoning is not very clear.  All that was said was :
</p>
<p id="p_67"> "Having given our anxious
consideration to the facts of this case,
we are not in a position to hold that
ICPS is either an agency or
instrumentality of the State so as to
come within the purview of 'other
authorities' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_69">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution".
</p>

<p id="p_68">		However, the Court was careful to say that "ICPS is a
case of its type  typical in many ways and the normal tests may
perhaps not properly apply to test its character".
</p>
<p id="p_69">		<a href="/doc/289990/" id="a_70">All India Sainik Schools Employees' Association
V. Defence Minister-cum-Chairman Board of Governors,
Sainik Schools Society, New Delhi and Others</a> 1989 Supp.(1)
SCC 205 held applying the tests indicated in Ajay Hasia that the
Sainik School Society is a 'State'.
</p>
<p id="p_70">Perhaps this rather over - enthusiastic application of the
broad limits set by Ajay Hasia may have persuaded this Court to
curb the tendency in <a href="/doc/700858/" id="a_71">Chander Mohan Khanna v. National
Council of Educational Research and Training and Others</a>
1991 (4) SCC 578. The Court referred to the tests formulated in
Sukhdev Singh, Ramana, Ajay Hasia, and Som Prakash Rekhi
but striking a note of caution said that "these are merely indicative
indicia and are by no means conclusive or clinching in any case".
In that case,  the  question arose whether the National Council of
Educational Research (NCERT) was a 'State'  as defined under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_72">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.	 The NCERT is a society registered
under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_73">Societies Registration Act</a>.	After considering the
provisions of its Memorandum of Association as well as the rules
of NCERT, this Court came to the conclusion that since NCERT
was largely an autonomous body and the activities of the NCERT
were not wholly related to governmental functions and that the
Government control was confined only to the proper utilisation of
the grant and since its funding was not entirely from Government
resources, the case did not satisfy the requirements of the State
under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_74">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.	The Court relied principally
on the decision in   <a href="/doc/1837473/" id="a_75">Tekraj Vasandi @ K.L.Basandhi v. Union
of India</a> (supra)  However, as far as the decision  in  <a href="/doc/435970/" id="a_76">Sabhajit
Tewary v. Union of India</a> (supra)   was concerned, it was noted
that "the decision has been distinguished and watered down in the
subsequent decisions".
</p>
<p id="p_71"> Fresh off the judicial anvil is the decision in the <a href="/doc/1944115/" id="a_77">Mysore
Paper Mills Ltd. vs. The Mysore Paper Mills Officers
Association  JT</a> 2002 (1) SC 61 which fairly represents what we
have seen as a continuity of thought commencing from the
decision in  Rajasthan Electricity Board  in 1967 upto the
present time.  It held that a company substantially financed and
financially controlled by the Government, managed by a Board of
Directors nominated and removable at the instance of the
Government and carrying on important functions of public interest
under the control of the Government is 'an authority' within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_78">Art.12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_72">	The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests
formulated in Ajay Hasia  are not a rigid set of principles so that
if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex hypothesi,  be
considered to be a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_79">Article 12.</a>  The
question in each case would be	whether in the light of the
cumulative facts as established, the body is financially,
functionally and  administratively dominated by or under the
control of the Government.  Such control must be particular to the
body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the
body is a State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_80">Article 12.</a>  On the other hand, when the
control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it
would not serve to make the body a State.
</p>
<p id="p_73">       Coming now to the facts relating to CSIR, we have no doubt
that it is well within the range of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_81">Article 12</a>, a conclusion which is
sustainable when judged according to the tests judicially evolved
for the purpose.
</p><p id="p_74">The Formation of CSIR

	On 27th April  1940 the Board of Scientific and Industrial
Research and on 1st February 1941, the Industrial Research
Utilisation Committee were set up by the Department of
Commerce, Government of India with the broad objective of
promoting industrial growth in this country.  On 14th November
1941,  a resolution was passed by the Legislative Assembly and
accepted by the Government of India to the following effect:
</p>
<p id="p_75">"This Assembly recommends to the Governor
General in Council that a fund called the
Industrial Research Fund be constituted, for
the purpose of fostering industrial
development in this country and that
provision be made in the Budget for an annual
grant of rupees ten lakhs to the fund for a
period of five years."
</p>
<p id="p_76">	For the purpose of coordinating and exercising
administrative control over the working of the two research bodies
already set up by the Department of Commerce, and to oversee the
proper utilisation of the Industrial Research Fund, by a further
resolution dated 26th September 1942, the Government of India
decided to set up a Council of Industrial Research on a permanent
footing which would be a registered society under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_82">Registration
of Societies Act</a>, 1860. Pursuant to the resolution, on 12th March,
1942 the CSIR was duly registered.  Bye-laws and Rules were
framed by the Governing Body of the Society in 1942 which have
been subsequently revised and amended.	Unquestionably this
shows that the CSIR was 'created' by the Government to carry on
in an organized manner what was being done earlier by the
Department of Commerce of the Central Government.  In fact the
two research bodies which were part of the Department of
Commerce have since been subsumed in the CSIR.
Objects and Functions:
</p>
<p id="p_77">The 26th September 1942 Resolution had provided that the
functions of the CSIR would be:
</p>
<p id="p_78">(a)	to implement and give effect to the
following resolution moved by the
Hon'ble Dewan Bahadur  Sir A.R.
</p><p id="p_79">Mudaliar and passed by the Legislative
Assembly on the 14th Nov' 1941 and
accepted by the Government of India.
</p><p id="p_80">(quoted earlier in this Judgment)

</p><p id="p_81">(b)	the promotion, guidance and co-
</p><p id="p_82">ordination of scientific and industrial
research in India including the institution
and the financing of specific researches;
</p>
<p id="p_83">(c)	the establishment or development and
assistance to special institutions or
Department of existing institutions for
scientific study of problems affecting
particular industries and trade;
</p>
<p id="p_84">(d)	the establishment and award of research
student-ships and fellowships;
</p>
<p id="p_85">(e)	the utilisation of the results of the
researches conducted under the auspices
of the Council towards the development
of industries in the country and the
payment of a share of royalties arising
out of the development of the results of
researches to those who are considered
as having contributed towards the pursuit
of such researches;
</p>
<p id="p_86">(f)	the establishment, maintenance and
management of laboratories, workshops,
institutes, and organisation to further
scientific and industrial research and
utilise and exploit for purposes of
experiment or otherwise any discovery
or invention likely to be of use Indian
Industries;
</p>
<p id="p_87">(g)	the collection and dissemination or
information in regard not only to
research but to industrial matters
generally;
</p>
<p id="p_88">(h)	publication of scientific papers and a
journal of industrial research and
development, and

</p><p id="p_89">(i)	any other activities to promote generally
the objects of the resolution mentioned
in (a) above.
</p>
<p id="p_90">  These objects which have been incorporated in the
Memorandum of Association of CSIR manifestly demonstrate that
CSIR was set up in the national interest to further the economic
welfare of the society by fostering planned industrial development
in the country.	 That such a function is fundamental to the
governance of the country has already been held by a Constitution
Bench of this Court as far back as in 1967 in <a href="/doc/459864/" id="a_83">Rajasthan
Electricity Board v. Mohan Lal (Supra</a>) where it was said:
</p>
<p id="p_91">"The State, as defined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_84">Art.12</a>, is thus
comprehended to include bodies created for the
purpose of promoting the educational and
economic interests of the people".
</p>
<p id="p_92"> We are in respectful agreement with this statement of the
law.  The observations to the contrary in  Chander Mohan
Khanna v. NCERT	 (supra)  relied on by the Learned Attorney
General in this context, do not represent the correct legal position.
</p>
<p id="p_93">	Incidentally, the CSIR was and continues to be a non-profit
making organization and according to  clause (4) of CSIR's
Memorandum of Association, all its income and property,
however derived shall be  applied only 'towards the promotion of
those objects subject nevertheless in respect of the expenditure to
such limitations as the Government of India may from time to
time impose'.
</p>
<p id="p_94">  Management and Control:
</p>
<p id="p_95">	 When the Government of India resolved to set up the
CSIR on 26th February, 1942 it also decided that the
Governing Body would consist of the following members:
</p>
<p id="p_96">(1)	The Honourable Member of the Council of
His Excellency the Governor General in
charge of the portfolio of Commerce (Ex-
</p><p id="p_97">officio).
</p>
<p id="p_98">(2)	A representative of the Commerce
Department of the Government of India,
appointed by the Government of India.
</p>
<p id="p_99">(3)	A representative of the Finance Department
of the Government of India, appointed by
the Government of India.
</p>
<p id="p_100">(4)	Two members of the Board of Scientific
and Industrial Research elected by the said
Board.
</p>
<p id="p_101">(5)	Two members of the Industrial Research
Utilisation committee elected by the said
Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_102">(6)	The Director of Scientific and Industrial
Research.
</p>
<p id="p_103">(7)	One or more members to be nominated by
the Government of India to represent
interests not otherwise represented.
</p>
<p id="p_104">	The present Rules and Regulations 1999 of CSIR
provide that :
</p>
<p id="p_105">(a)	The Prime Minister of India shall be the
ex-officio President of the Society.
</p>
<p id="p_106">(b)	The Minister-in-Charge of the Ministry or
Deptt. dealing with the Council of
Scientific &amp; Industrial Research shall be
the ex-officio Vice President of the
Society.
</p>
<p id="p_107">     Provided that during any period when the
Prime Minister is also such Minister, any person
nominated in this behalf by the Prime Minister
shall be the Vice-President.
</p>
<p id="p_108">(c)	Ministers Incharge of Finance and Industry
(ex-officio).
</p>
<p id="p_109">(d)	The members of the Governing Body.
</p>
<p id="p_110">(e)	Chairman, Advisory Board.
</p>
<p id="p_111">(f)	Any other person or persons appointed by
the President, CSIR."
</p>
<p id="p_112">The Governing Body of the Society is constituted by
the:
</p>
<p id="p_113">(a)	Director General,
</p><p id="p_114">(b)	Member Finance,
</p><p id="p_115">(c)	Directors of two National Laboratories,

</p><p id="p_116">(d)	Two eminent Scientists/ Technologists, one
	of whom shall be from Academia;
</p><p id="p_117">(e)	Heads of two Scientific
	Departments/Agencies of the Government
	of India.
</p>
<p id="p_118">     The dominant role played by the Government of India in
the Governing Body of CSIR is evident.	  The Director-
General who is ex-officio Secretary of the Society is
appointed by the Government of India [Rule 2(iii)]. The
submission of the learned Attorney General that the
Governing Body consisted of members, the majority of
whom were non-governmental members is, having regard to
the facts on record, unacceptable.  Furthermore, the
members of the Governing Body who are not there
ex officio are nominated by the President and their
membership can also be terminated by him and the Prime
Minister is the ex-officio President of CSIR.	It was then
said that although the Prime Minister was ex-officio
President of the Society but the power being exercised by
the Prime Minister is as President of the Society. This is also
the reasoning in Sabhajit Tewary . With respect, the
reasoning was and the submission is erroneous.	An ex-
officio appointment means that the appointment is by virtue
of the office; without any other warrant or appointment than
that resulting from the holding of a particular office.	 Powers
may be exercised by an officer, in this case the Prime
Minister, which are not specifically conferred upon him, but
are necessarily implied in his office (as Prime Minister),
these are ex-officio .
</p>
<p id="p_119">The control of the Government in the CSIR is
ubiquitous.  The Governing Body is required to administer,
direct and control the affairs and funds of the Society and
shall, under Rule 43, have authority 'to exercise all the
powers of the Society subject nevertheless in respect of
expenditure to such limitations as the Government of India
may from time to time impose'.	 The aspect of financial
control by the Government is not limited to this and is
considered separately.	The Governing Body also has the
power to frame, amend or repeal the bye-laws of CSIR but
only with the sanction of the Government of India.  Bye-law
44 of the 1942 Bye-laws had provided 'any alteration in the
bye-laws shall require the prior approval of the Governor
General in Council'.
</p>
<p id="p_120"> Rule 41 of the present Rules provide that:
</p>
<p id="p_121"> " The President may review/amend/vary any
of the decisions of the Governing Body and
pass such orders as considered necessary to
be communicated to the Chairman of the
Governing Body within a month of  the
decision of the Governing Body and such
order shall be binding on the Governing
Body.  The Chairman may also refer any
question which in his opinion is of sufficient
importance to justify such a reference for
decision of the President, which shall be
binding on the Governing Body."
</p>
<p id="p_122">				      (emphasis added)

	Given the fact that the President of CSIR is the Prime
Minister, under this Rule the subjugation of the Governing
Body to the will of the Central Government is complete.
As far as the employees of the CSIR are concerned the
Central Civil Services (Classification, Control &amp; Appeal)
Rules and the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, for
the time being in force, are from the outset applicable to
them subject to the modification that references to the
'President' and 'Government Servant' in the Conduct Rules
would be construed as 'President of the Society' and
'Officer &amp; establishments in the service of the Society'
respectively. ( Bye Law 12).  The scales of pay applicable
to all the employees of CSIR are those prescribed by the
Government of India for similar personnel, save in the case
of specialists (Bye Law 14) and in regard to all matters
concerning service conditions of employees of the CSIR,
the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules framed by the
Govt. of India and such other rules and orders issued by the
Govt. of India from time to time  are also, under Bye Law
15 applicable to the employees of the CSIR.  Apart from
this, the rules/Orders issued by Government of India
regarding reservation of posts for SC/ST apply in regard to
appointments to posts to be made in CSIR.( Bye Law 19)
The CSIR cannot lay down or change the terms and
conditions of service of its employees and any alteration in
the bye-laws can be carried out only with the approval of
Government of India. (Bye Law 20).
</p>
<p id="p_123">Financial Aid

The initial capital of the CSIR was Rs. 10 lakhs, made
available pursuant to the Resolution of the Legislative
Assembly on 14th November, 1941.  Paragraph 5 of the 26th
September, 1942 Resolution of the Government of India
pursuant to which CSIR was formed reads:
</p>
<p id="p_124">"The Government of India have decided that a
fund, viz., the Industrial Research Fund,
should be constituted by grants from the
Central Revenues to which additions are to be
made from time to time as moneys flow in
from other sources.  These 'other sources' will
comprise grants, if any, by Provincial
Governments by industrialists for special or
general purposes, contributions from
Universities or local bodies, donations or
benefactions, royalties, etc., received from the
development of the results of industrial
research, and miscellaneous receipts.  The
Council of Scientific and Industrial Research
will exercise full powers in regard to the
expenditure to be met out of the Industrial
Research Fund subject to its observing the
Bye-laws framed by the Governing Body of
the Council, from time to time, with the
approval of the Governor General-in-Council,
and to its annual budget being approved by the
Governor General-in-Council."
</p>
<p id="p_125">	As already noted, the initial capital of Rs. 10 lakhs was
made available by the Central Government.  According to
the statement handed up to the Court on behalf of CSIR the
present financial position of CSIR is that at least 70% of the
funds of CSIR are available from grants made by the
Government of India.  For example out of the total funds
available to CSIR for the years 1998-99, 1999-2000, 2000-
01 of  Rs.1023.68 crores, Rs.1136.69 crores and Rs.1219.04
crores respectively, the Government of India has contributed
Rs.713.32 crores, Rs.798.74 crores and Rs.877.88 crores.  A
major portion of the balance of the funds available is
generated from charges for rendering research and
development works by CSIR for projects such as the Rajiv
Gandhi Drinking Water Mission Technology Mission on
oilseeds and pulses and maize or grant in aid projects from
other Government Departments.  Funds are also received by
CSIR from sale proceeds of its products, publications,
royalties etc. Funds are also received from investments but
under Bye-Law 6 of CSIR, funds of the Society may be
invested only in such manner as prescribed by the
Government of India.  Some contributions are made by the
State Governments and to a small extent by 'individuals,
institutions and other agencies'. The non-governmental
contributions are a pittance compared to the massive
governmental input.
</p>
<p id="p_126">As far as expenditure is concerned, under Bye-law (1)
as it stands at present, the  budget estimates of the Society
are to be prepared by the Governing Body 'keeping in view
the instructions issued by the Government of India from time
to time in this regard'.  Apart from an internal audit, the
accounts of the CSIR are required to be audited by the
Controller and Auditor General	and placed before the table
of both Houses of Parliament(Rule 69).
</p>
<p id="p_127">	In the event of dissolution, unlike other registered
societies which are governed by <a href="/doc/1663305/" id="a_85">Section 14</a> of the Societies
Registration Act, 1860, the members of CSIR have no say in
the distribution of its assets and under clause (5) of the
Memorandum of Association of CSIR, on the winding up or
dissolution of CSIR any property remaining after payment of
all debts shall have to be dealt with "in such manner as the
Government of India may determine".  CSIR is therefore
both historically and in its present operation subject to the
financial control of the Government of India. The assets and
funds of CSIR though nominally owned by the Society are
in the ultimate analysis owned by the Government.
From whichever perspective the facts are considered
there can be no doubt that the conclusion reached in Sabhajit
Tewary	was erroneous.	If the decision of Sabhajit Tewary
had sought to lay down as a legal principle that a society
registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_86">Societies Act</a> or a company incorporated
under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_87">Companies Act</a> is, by that reason alone, excluded
from the concept of State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_88">Article 12</a>, it is a principle
which has long since been discredited.	"Judges have made
worthy, if shamefaced, efforts, while giving lip service to the
rule, to riddle it with exceptions and by distinctions reduce it
to a shadow".
</p>
<p id="p_128">       In the assessment of the	 facts, the  Court had assumed
certain principles, and sought precedential support from
decisions which were irrelevant and had "followed a groove
chased amidst a context which has long since crumbled".
Had the facts been closely scrutinised in the proper
perspective, it could have led and can only lead to the
conclusion that CSIR is a State within the meaning of Art.
</p><p id="p_129">12.

Should Sabhajit Tewary still stand as  an authority
even on the facts merely because it has stood for 25 years?
We think not.	 Parallels may be drawn even on the facts
leading to an untenable interpretation of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_89">Art. 12</a> and a
consequential denial of the benefits of fundamental rights to
individuals who would otherwise be entitled to them and
"there is nothing in our Constitution which prevents us from
departing from a previous decision if we are convinced of
its error and its baneful effect on the general interests of the
public."   Since on a re-examination of the question we
have come to the conclusion  that the  decision was plainly
erroneous, it is our duty to say so and	 not  perpetuate our
mistake.
</p>
<p id="p_130">	Besides a new fact relating to CSIR has come to light
since the decision in Sabhajit Tewary which unequivocally
vindicates the conclusion reached by us and fortifies us in
delivering the coup de grace to the already attenuated
decision in Sabhajit Tewary.  On 31st October 1986 in
exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/796793/" id="a_90">Section 14</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, the
Central Government specified  17th November 1986 as the
date on and from which the provisions of sub-section (3) of
<a href="/doc/1663305/" id="a_91">Section 14</a> of the 1985 Act would apply to CSIR 'being the
Society owned and controlled by Government'.
</p>
<p id="p_131">	The learned Attorney General contended that the
notification was not conclusive of the fact that the CSIR was
a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_92">Article 12</a> and that even if an
entity is not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_93">Article 12</a>, it is
open to the Government to issue a notification for the
purpose of ensuring the benefits of the provisions of the Act
to its employees.
</p>
<p id="p_132">We cannot accept this.	Reading <a href="/doc/1254475/" id="a_94">Art. 323 (A)</a> of the
Constitution and <a href="/doc/1663305/" id="a_95">Section 14</a> of the 1985 Act it is clear that
no notification under <a href="/doc/1663305/" id="a_96">section 14</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_97">Administrative
Tribunals Act</a> could have been issued by the Central
Government unless the employees of the CSIR were either
appointed to public services and posts in connection with
the affairs of the Union or of any State or of any local or
other authority within the territory of India or under the
control of the Government of India or of any corporation
owned or controlled by the Government. Once such a
notification has been issued in respect of CSIR, the
consequence will be that an application would lie at the
instance of the appellants at least before the Administrative
Tribunal. No new jurisdiction was created in the
Administrative Tribunal.  The notification which was issued
by the Central Government merely served to shift the
service disputes of the employees of CSIR  from the
constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_98">Article

We have had the advantage of reading the judgment proposed
by our learned sister Ruma Pal, J..   With greatest respect to her, we
find ourselves not persuaded to subscribe to her view overruling
Sabhajit Tewary's case and holding Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR) 'the State' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_102">Article
12</a> of the Constitution.	 The development of law has travelled through
apparently a zig-zag track of judicial pronouncements, rhythmically
traced by Ruma Pal, J. in her judgment.	 Of necessity, we shall have to
retread the track, for, we find that though the fundamentals and basic
principles for determining whether a particular body is 'the State' or
not may substantially remain the same but we differ in distributing the
emphasis within the principles in their applicability to the facts found.
We also feel that a distinction has to be borne in mind between an
instrumentality or agency of 'the State' and an authority includible in
'other authorities'.  The distinction cannot be obliterated.
</p>
<p id="p_136"><a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_103">Article 12</a> of the Constitution reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_137">"12.  In this part, unless the context
otherwise requires, "the State" includes the
Government and Parliament of India and the
Government and the Legislature of each of
the States and all local or other authorities
within the territory of India or under the
control of the Government of India."
</p>
<p id="p_138">	This definition is for the purpose of attracting applicability of
the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution dealing with
fundamental rights.  It is well-settled that the definition of 'the State'
in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_104">Article 12</a> has nothing to do with Articles 309, 310 and 311 of the
Constitution which find place in Part XIV.  Merely because an entity
is held to be the State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_105">Article 12</a>, its employees
do not ipso facto become entitled to protection of Part XIV of the
Constitution.

<p id="p_139">Dr. B.R. Ambedkar explaining the scope of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_106">Article 12</a> and
reason why this Article was placed in the Chapter on Fundamental
Rights so spoke in the Constituent Assembly :
</p>
<p id="p_140">"The object of the fundamental rights is
two-fold.   First, that every citizen must be in a
position to claim those rights.	 Secondly, they must
be binding upon every authority	 I shall presently
explain what the word "authority" means	 upon
every authority which has got either the power to
make laws or the power to have discretion vested
in it.	Therefore, it is quite clear that if the
Fundamental Rights are to be clear, then they must
be binding not only upon the Central Government,
they must not only be binding the Provincial
Government, they must not only be binding upon
the Governments established in the Indian States,
they must also be binding upon District Local
Boards, Municipalities, even village panchayats
and taluk boards, in fact, every  authority which
has been created by law and which has got certain
power to make laws, to make rules, or make bye-
laws.
</p>
<p id="p_141">If that proposition is accepted	 and I do not
see anyone who cares for Fundamental Rights can
object to such a universal obligation being
imposed upon every authority created by law
then, what are we to do to make our intention
clear?	There are two ways of doing it.	 One way is
to use a composite phrase such as "the State", as
we have done in <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_107">article 7;</a> or, to keep on repeating
every time, "the Central Government, the
Provincial Government, the State Government, the
Municipality, the Local Board, the Port Trust, or
any other authority".  It seems to me not only most
cumbersome but stupid to keep on repeating this
phraseology every time we have to make a
reference to some authority.  The wisest course is
to have this comprehensive phrase and to
economise in words".
</p>
<p id="p_142">	(1948 (Vol.VII) CAD 610)
	[emphasis supplied]

	Thus the framers of the Constitution used the word "the State"
in a wider sense than what is understood in the ordinary or narrower
sense.	So far	as 'other authorities' are concerned they were included
subject to their satisfying the test of being 'within the territory of
India' or being 'under the control of the Government of India'. It is
settled that the expression 'under the control of the Government of
India' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_108">Article 12</a> does not qualify the word 'territory'; it qualifies
'other authorities'.
</p>
<p id="p_143">	The terms  'instrumentality' or 'agency' of the State  are not
to be found mentioned in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_109">Article 12.</a>  It is by the process of judicial
interpretation	nay, expansion - keeping in view the sweep of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_110">Article

subject to satisfying certain tests.  While defining, the use of
'includes' suggest  what follows is not exhaustive.  The definition is
expansive of the meaning of the term defined.  However, we feel that
expanding dimension of 'the State' doctrine through judicial wisdom
ought to be accompanied by wise limitations else the expansion may
go much beyond what even the framers of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_112">Article 12</a> may have
thought of.
</p>
<p id="p_144">Instrumentality, Agency, Authority  meaning of

It will be useful to understand what the terms - instrumentality,
agency and authorities mean before embarking upon a review of
judicial decisions dealing with the principal issue which arises for our
consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_145">	Black's Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition) defines
'instrumentality' to mean "a means or agency through which a
function of another entity is accomplished, such as a branch of a
governing body."  'Agency' is defined as "a fiduciary relationship
created by express or implied contract or by law, in which one party
(the agent) may act on behalf of another party (the principal) and bind
that  other party by words or actions."	  Thus instrumentality and
agency are the two terms which to some extent overlap in their
meaning; 'instrumentality' includes 'means' also, which 'agency'
does not, in its meaning.   'Quasi- governmental agency' is "a
government  sponsored enterprise or Corporation (sometimes called
a government-controlled corporation)". Authority, as Webster
Comprehensive Dictionary (International Edition) defines, is "the
person or persons in whom government or command is vested; often
in the plural".	 The applicable meaning of the word "authority" given
in Webster's Third New International Dictionary, is 'a public
administrative agency or corporation having quasi-governmental
powers and authorized to administer a revenue-producing public
enterprise'.  This was quoted with approval by Constitution Bench in
RSEB's case (infra) wherein the Bench held  "This dictionary
meaning of the word "authority" is clearly wide enough to include all
bodies created by a statute on which powers are conferred to carry out
governmental or quasi-governmental functions.  The expression
"other authorities" is wide enough to include within it every authority
created by a statute and functioning within the territory of India, or
under the control of the Government of India; and we do not see any
reason to narrow down this meaning in the context in which the words
"other authorities" are used in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_113">Art.12</a> of the Constitution". (emphasis
added)

With the pronouncements in N. Masthan Sahib Vs. The Chief
Commissioner, Pondicherry and Anr.  (1962) Supp.1 SCR 981 and
K.S. Ramamurthy Reddiar Vs. Chief Commissioner, Pondicherry
and Anr.  (1964) 1 SCR 656 it is settled that <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_114">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution has to be so read :
</p>
<p id="p_146">	"12.	In this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the
'State' includes

</p><p id="p_147">(i)	the Government and Parliament of India,

</p><p id="p_148">(ii)	the Government and the Legislature of each State,


</p><p id="p_149">(iii)	(a) all local or other authorities within the territory of India,
</p><p id="p_150">	(b) all local or other authorities under the control of the
	    Government of India."
</p>
<p id="p_151">The definition of the State as contained in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_115">Article 12</a> is inclusive and
not conclusive.	 The net of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_116">Article 12</a> has been expanded by
'progressive' judicial thinking, so as to include within its ken several
instrumentalities and agencies performing State function or entrusted
with State action.  To answer the principal question in the context in
which it has arisen, incidental but inseparable issues do arise: Wide
expansion but how far wide? Should such wide expansion be not
subject to certain wise limitations?  True, the width of expansion and
the wisdom of limitations both have to be spelled out from <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_117">Article 12</a>
itself and the fundamentals of constitutional jurisprudence.

<p id="p_152">	We now deal with a series of decisions wherein tests were
propounded, followed (also expanded) and applied to different entities

<p id="p_153">A review of judicial opinion

	Though judge-made law is legend on the issue, we need not
peep too much deep in the past unless it becomes necessary to have a
glimpse of a few illuminating points thereat.  It would serve our
purpose to keep ourselves confined, to begin with, to discerning the
principles laid down in Rajasthan State Electricity Board, Jaipur
Vs. Mohal Lal and Ors.	(1967) 3 SCR 377, Sukhdev Singh and
Ors. Vs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and Anr.  (1975) 1
SCC 421, Ramana Dayaram Shetty Vs. The International Airport
Authority of India and Ors. (1979) 3 SCC 489, Ajay  Hasia etc. Vs.
Khalid Mujib Sehravardi and Ors. etc.  (1981) 1 SCC 722 and Som
Prakash Rekhi Vs. Union of India and Anr.  (1981) 1 SCC 449
which have come to be known as landmarks on the State
conceptualisation .  Out of these five decisions, R.D. Shetty and Som
Prakash are three-Judges Bench decisions; the other 3 are each by
Constitution Bench of five-Judges.
</p>
<p id="p_154">	The Constitution Bench decision in Rajasthan State
Electricity Board (RSEB)'s case was delivered by a majority of 4:1.
V. Bhargava, J. spoke for himself and K. Subba Rao, C.J. and M.
Shelat and G.K. Mitter, JJ.   J.C. Shah, J. delivered his dissenting
opinion.  We will refer to majority opinion only.  The Court quoted
the interpretation placed by Ayyangar, J. from the pronouncement of
seven-Judges Bench of this Court in Smt. Ujjam Bai Vs. State of
Uttar Pradesh and Anr.	(1963) 1 SCR 778 that the words 'other
authorities' employed in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_118">Article 12</a> are of wide amplitude and capable
of comprehending every authority created under a statute and though
there is no characterisation of the nature of the "authority" in the
residuary clause of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_119">Article 12</a> it must include every authority set up
under a statute for the purpose of administering laws enacted by the
Parliament or by the State including those vested with the duties to
make decisions in order to implement those laws.  The Court refused
to apply the doctrine of  ejusdem generis for interpretation of the
'other authorities' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_120">Article 12.</a>  "Other authorities" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_121">Article 12</a>
include, held the Court, "all constitutional or statutory authorities on
whom powers are conferred by law" without regard to the fact that
some of the powers conferred may be for the purpose of carrying on
commercial activities or promoting the educational and economic
interests of the people.  Regard must be had (i) not only to the sweep
of fundamental rights over the power of the authority, (ii) but also to
the restrictions which may be imposed upon the exercise of certain
fundamental rights by the authority.  This dual phase of fundamental
rights would determine "authority".  Applying the test formulated by
it to Rajasthan State Electricity Board, the Court found that the Board
though it was required to carry on some activities of the nature of
trade or commerce under the <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_122">Electricity Supply Act</a>, yet the statutory
powers conferred by the <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_123">Electricity Supply Act</a> on the Board included
power to give directions, the disobedience of which is punishable as a
criminal office and therefore the Board was an authority for the
purpose of Part III of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_155">	Praga Tools Corporation Vs. C.V. Imanual and Ors.  (1969)
1 SCC 585 may not be of much relevance.	 The question posed before
the Court was not one referable to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_124">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.  The
question was whether a prayer seeking issuance of a mandamus or an
order in the nature of mandamus could lie against a company
incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_125">Companies Act</a> wherein the Central and the
State Governments held respectively 56 and 32 per cent shares.	The
two-Judge Bench of this Court held that the company was a separate
legal entity and could not be said to be either a government
Corporation or an industry run by or under the authority of the Union
Government.  A mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public
or statutory duty in the performance of which the petitioner has a
sufficient legal interest.  A mandamus can issue to an official or a
society to compel him to carry out the terms of the Statute under or by
which the society is constituted or governed and also to companies or
Corporations to carry out duties placed on them by the Statute
authorizing their undertaking.	A mandamus would also lie against a
company constituted by a Statute for the purpose of fulfilling public
responsibilities.  The Court held that the company being a non-
statutory body with neither a statutory nor a public duty imposed on it
by a Statute, a writ petition for mandamus did not lie against it.  The
limited value of this decision, relevant for our purpose, is that because
a writ of mandamus can issue against a body solely by this test it does
not become 'State' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_126">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_156">	In Sukhdev Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh
Raghuvanshi and another (supra), question arose whether Oil and
Natural Gas Commission, the Industrial Finance Corporation and Life
Insurance Corporation are 'authorities' within the meaning of Article
</p><p id="p_157">12.  The case was decided by a majority of 4:1.	  A.N. Ray, CJ
speaking for himself and on behalf of Y.V. Chandrachud and A.C.
Gupta, JJ. held that all the three were statutory Corporations, i.e.,
given birth by Statutes.  The circumstance that these statutory bodies
were required to carry on some activities of the nature of trade or
commerce did not make any difference.  The Life Insurance
Corporation is (i) an agency of the Government (ii) carrying on the
exclusive business of Life Insurance (i.e. in monopoly), and (iii) each
and every provision of the Statute creating it showed in no uncertain
terms that the Corporation is the voice and the hands of the Central
Government.  The Industrial Financial Corporation is in effect
managed and controlled by the Central Government, citizens cannot
be its shareholder. ONGC (i) is owned by the Government, (ii) is a
statutory body and not a company and (iii) has the exclusive privilege
of extracting petroleum. Each of the three, respectively under the three
Acts under which they are created, enjoy power to do certain acts and
to issue directions obstruction in or breach whereof is punishable as
an offence.  These distinguish them from a mere company
incorporated under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_127">Indian Companies Act</a>.   The common features
of the three are (i)  rules and regulations framed by them have the
force of law, (ii) the employees have a statutory status, and (iii) they
are entitled to declaration of being in employment when the dismissal
or removal is in contravention of statutory provisions.	 The learned
Chief Justice added, by way of abundant caution, that these provisions
did not however make the employees as servants of the Union or the
State though the three statutory bodies are authorities within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_128">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_158">	Mathew, J. recorded his separate concurring opinion.  As to
ONGC he hastened to arrive at a conclusion that the Commission was
invested with sovereign power of the State and could issue binding
directions to owners of land and premises, not to prevent employees
of the Commission from entering upon their property if the
Commission so directs.	Disobedience of its directions is punishable
under the relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_129"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> as the
employees are deemed to be public servants.  Hence the Commission
is an authority.  As to the other two Corporations, viz., LIC and IFC,
Mathew, J. entered into a short question and began by observing that
in recent years the concept of State has undergone drastic change.
"Today State cannot be conceived of simply as a coercive machinery
wielding the thunderbolt of authority".	 Having reviewed some
decisions of United States and English decisions and some other
authorities, he laid down certain principles with which we will deal
with a little later and at appropriate place.  He observed that
institutions engaged in matters of high public interest or performing
public functions are, by virtue of the nature of the function performed
by them, governmental agencies.	 He noticed the difficulty in
separating vital government functions from non-governmental
functions in view of the contrast between governmental activities
which are private and private activities which are governmental.  For
holding Life Insurance Corporation  "the State" he relied on the
following features : (i) the Central Government has contributed the
original capital of the Corporation, (ii) part of the profit of the
Corporation goes to Central Government, (iii) the Central
Government exercises control over the policy of the Corporation, (iv)
the Corporation carries on a business having great public importance,
and (v) it enjoys a monopoly in the business.  As to Industrial
Financial Corporation he relied on the circumstances catalogued in the
judgment of A.N. Ray, J.  The common feature of the two
Corporations was that they were instrumentalities or agencies of the
State for carrying on business which otherwise would have been run
by the State departmentally and if the State had chosen to carry on
these businesses through the medium of government departments,
there would have been no question that actions of these departments
would be "state actions".  At the end Mathew, J. made it clear that he
was  expressing no opinion on the question whether private
Corporations or other like organizations though they exercise power
over their employees which might violate their fundamental rights
would be the State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_130">Article 12.</a>  What is 'state
action' and how far the concept of 'state action' can be expanded,
posing the question, Mathew J. answered	 "..it is against State
action that fundamental rights are guaranteed.	Wrongful individual
acts unsupported by State authority in the shape of laws, customs, or
judicial or executive proceeding are not prohibited.  Articles 17, 23
and 24 postulate that fundamental rights can be violated by private
individuals and that the remedy under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_131">Article 32</a> may be available
against them.  But by and large, unless an act is sanctioned in some
way by the State, the action would not be State action.	 In other
words, until some law is passed or some action is taken through
officers or agents of the State, there is no action by the State."  So also
commenting on the relevance of 'state help' and 'state control' as
determinative tests, Mathew, J. said  "It may be stated generally that
State financial aid alone does not render the institution receiving such
aid a state agency.  Financial aid plus some additional factor might
lead to a different conclusion.	 A mere finding of state control also is
not determinative of the question, since a state has considerable
measure of control under its police power over all types of business
operations."
</p>
<p id="p_159">Alagiriswami, J. recorded a dissenting opinion which however
we propose to skip over.   It is pertinent to note that the dispute in
Sukhdev Singh Vs. Bhagat Ram was a service dispute and the
employees were held entitled to a declaration of being in employment
when their dismissal or removal was in contravention of statutory
provisions; the rules and regulations framed by corporations or
commission were found having the force of law, being delegated
legislation and these statutory bodies were held to be 'authorities'
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_132">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_160">	In Ramanna Dayaram Shetty Vs. The International Airport
Authority of India &amp; Ors. (supra), the dispute related to trends
within the domain of administrative law.  A question arose whether
International Airport Authority of India (IA, for short) was within the
scope of 'other authorities' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_133">Article 12</a> so as to be amenable to
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_134">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.	 P.N. Bhagwati, J. who delivered the
judgment for the three-Judge Bench stated the ratio of Rajasthan
State Electricity Boards case, in these words :
</p>
<p id="p_161">	"The ratio of this decision may thus be
stated to be that a constitutional or statutory
authority would be within the meaning of the
expression 'other authorities', if it has been
invested with statutory power to issue binding
directions to third parties, the disobedience of
which would entail penal consequence or it has the
sovereign power to make rules and regulations
having the force of law".
</p>
<p id="p_162">He then referred to what he termed as a 'broader test' laid down
by Mathew, J. in Sukhdev Singh's case and said that judgment by
Mathew, J. provided 'one more test and perhaps a more satisfactory
one' for determining whether a statutory corporation, body or other
authority falls within the definition of 'the State' and the test is___"If a
statutory corporation, body or other authority is an instrumentality or
agency of government, it would be an authority and therefore 'the
State' within the meaning of the expression in	<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_135">Article 12."</a>  Having
minutely examined the provisions of the International Airport
Authority Act, 1971 he found out the following features of IA :- (i)
The Chairman and Members are all persons nominated by the Central
Government and Central Government has power to terminate the
appointment or remove them;  (ii) The Central Government is vested
with the power to take away the management of any airport from the
IA; (iii) The Central Government has power to give binding directions
in writing on questions of policy; (iv) The capital of IA needed for
carrying out its functions is  wholly provided by Central Government;
</p><p id="p_163">(v) The balance of net profit made by IA, after making certain
necessary provisions, does not remain with the IA and is required to
be taken over to the Central Government; (vi) The financial estimates,
expenditure and programme of activities can only be such as approved
by Central Government; (vii) The Audit Accounts and the Audit
Report of IA, forwarded to the Central Government, are required to be
laid before both Houses of Parliament; (viii) It was a department of
the Central Government along with its properties, assets, debts,
obligations, liabilities, contracts, cause of action and pending
litigation taken over by the IA; (ix) IA was charged with carrying out
the same functions which were being carrying out by the Central
Government; (x) The employees and officials of IA are public
servants and enjoy immunity for anything done or intended to be
done, in good faith, in pursuance of the Act or any rules or regulations
made by it; (xi) IA is given (delegated) power to legislate and
contravention of certain specified regulations entails penal
consequences.  Thus, in sum, the IA was held to be an instrumentality
or agency of the Central Government falling within the definition of
the State both on the narrower view propounded in the judgment of
A.N. Ray, CJ and broader view propounded by Mathew, J. in
Sudhdev Singh's case.
</p>
<p id="p_164">	Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi and Ors. etc.
(supra), is a Constitution Bench judgment wherein P.N. Bhagwati, J.
spoke for the Court.  The test which he had laid down in Ramanna's
case were summarized by him as six in number and as under:
</p>
<p id="p_165">"1.	One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the
Corporation is held by Government it would go a long way
towards indicating that the Corporation is an instrumentality or
agency of Government.
</p>
<p id="p_166">2.	Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to
meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would
afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated
with governmental character.
</p>
<p id="p_167">3.	It may also be a relevant factor.whether the corporation
enjoys monopoly status which is the State conferred or State
protected.
</p>
<p id="p_168">4.	Existence of "deep and pervasive State control may afford an
indication that the corporation is a State agency or
instrumentality".
</p>
<p id="p_169">5.	If the functions of the Corporation of public importance and
closely related to government functions, it would be a relevant
factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or
agency of Government.
</p>
<p id="p_170">6.	"Specifically, if a department of Government is transferred to a
corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of this
inference" of the corporation being an instrumentality or agency
of Government."
</p>
<p id="p_171">The footnote to the tests, as put by him, is  "if on a consideration of
all these relevant factors it is found that the corporation is an
instrumentality or agency of government, it would, be an
authority, and therefore, 'the State' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_136">Article 12.</a>
Bhagwati, J. placed a prologue to the above said tests emphasizing
the need to use care and caution, "because while stressing the
necessity of a wide meaning to be placed on the expression "other
authorities", it must be realized that it should not be stretched so far as
to bring in every autonomous body which has some nexus with the
Government within the sweep of the expression.	A wide enlargement
of the meaning must be tempered by a wise limitation."
</p>
<p id="p_172">	In Ajay Hasia, the 'authority' under consideration was a
society registered  under the Jammu &amp; <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_137">Kashmir Registration of
Societies Act</a>, 1898, administering and managing the Regional
Engineering College, Srinagar.	The College was sponsored by the
Government of India.  The prominent features of the society indicated
complete financing and financial control of the Government, complete
administrative control over conducting of the affairs of the society and
administration and assets of the College being taken over by the State
Government with the prior approval of the Central Government.
These are some of the material features.  Some of the observations
made by the Court during the course of its judgment are pertinent and
we proceed to notice them quickly.  The society could not be equated
with the Government of India or the Government of any State nor
could it be said to be 'local authority', and therefore, should have
come within the expression of 'other authorities' to be 'the State'.
The Government may act through the instrumentality or agency of
natural persons or it may employ the instrumentality or agency of
juridical persons to carry out its functions.  With the enlargement of
governmental activities, specially those in the field of trade and
commerce and welfare, corporation is most resourceful legal
contrivance resorted to frequently by the Government.  Though a
distinct juristic entity came into existence because of its certain
advantages in the field of functioning over a department of the
Government but behind the formal ownership  cast in the corporate
mould, the reality is very much the deeply pervasive presence of the
Government.  It is really the Government which acts through the
instrumentality or agency of the Corporation and the juristic veil of
corporate personality is worn for the purpose of convenience of
management and administration which cannot be allowed to obliterate
the true nature of the reality behind which is the Government.
Dealing at length with the corporate contrivance, the Court summed
up its conclusion by saying that if a Corporation is found to be a mere
agency or surrogate of the Government, 3 tests being satisfied viz., (i)
in fact, owned by the Government, (ii) in truth, control by the
Government, and (iii) in effect, an incarnation of the Government,
then the Court would hold the Corporation to be Government, and
therefore, subject to constitutional limitations including for
enforcement of fundamental rights.  The Court went on to say that
where a Corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the
Government, it must be held to be an 'authority' for <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_138">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_173">	Here itself we have few comments to offer. Firstly, the
distinction between 'instrumentality and agency' on the one hand, and
'authority (for the purpose of 'other authorities')' on the other, was
totally obliterated.   In our opinion, it is one thing to say that if an
entity veiled or disguised as a Corporation or a society or in	any other
form is found to be an instrumentality or agency of the State then in
that case it will be the State itself in narrower sense acting through its
instrumentality or agency and therefore, included in 'the State' in the
wider sense for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_139">Article 12.</a>  Having found an entity
whether juristic or natural to be an instrumentality or agency of the
State, it is not necessary to call it an 'authority'.  It would make a
substantial difference to find whether an entity is an instrumentality or
agency or an authority.	 Secondly, Ajay Hasia  was the case of a
registered society; it was not an appropriate occasion for dealing with
corporations or entities other than society.  On the inferences drawn
by reading of the Memorandum of Association of the society and
rules framed thereunder, and subjecting such inferences to the tests
laid down in the decision itself, it was found that the society was an
instrumentality or agency of the State and on tearing the veil of
society what was to be seen was the State itself though in disguise.  It
was not thereafter necessary to hold the society an 'authority' and
proceed to record "that the society is an instrumentality or the agency
of the State and the Central Government and it is an 'authority' within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_140">Article 12</a>", entirely obliterating, the dividing line
between 'instrumentality or agency of the State' and 'other
authorities'.  This has been a source of confusion  and misdirection in
thought process as we propose to explain a little later.  Thirdly, though
six tests are laid down but there is no clear indication in the judgment
whether in order to hold a legal entity the State, all the tests must be
answered positively and it is the cumulative effect of such positive
answers which will solve the riddle or positive answer to one or two
or more tests would be enough to find out a solution.  It appears what
the court wished was reaching a final decision on an overall view of
the result of the tests.  Compare this with what was said by Bhagwati,
J. in Ramanna's case.  We have already noticed that in Ajay Hasia,
Bhagwati, J. has in his own words summarized the test laid down by
him in Ramanna's case.	In Ramanna's case he had said that the
question whether a corporation is governmental instrumentality or
agency would depend on a variety of factors which defy exhaustive
enumeration and moreover even amongst these factors described in
Ramanna's case "the Court will have to consider the cumulative
effect of these various factors and arrive at its decision."  "It is the
aggregate or cumulative effect of all the relevant factors that is
controlling".

<p id="p_174">	Criticism of too broad a view taken of the scope of the State
under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_141">Article 12</a> in Ramanna's case invited some criticism which
was noticed in Som Prakash Rekhi's case (infra).   It was pointed out
that the observations in Ramanna's case spill over beyond the
requirements of the case and must be dismissed as obiter; that IA is a
Corporation created by a statute and there was no occasion to go
beyond the narrow needs of the situation and expand the theme of the
State in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_142">Article 12</a> vis--vis government companies, registered
society, and what not; and that there was contradiction between
Sukhdev Singh's case and Ramanna's case.

</p>
<p id="p_176">	The Court in <a href="/doc/1602162/" id="a_144">Som Parkash Rekhi v. Union of India and
another</a> (supra), was posed with the question __ whether Bharat
Petroleum Corporation Ltd., a statutory corporation, was an
'authority', and therefore 'the State' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_145">Article 12.</a>  Certain
observations made by Krishna Iyer, J. are pertinent.  To begin with, he
said, "any authority under control of the Government of India comes
within the definition." While dealing with the corporate personality, it
has to be remembered that "while the formal ownership is cast in the
corporate mould, the reality reaches down to State control".  The core
fact is that the Central Government chooses to make over, for better
management, its own property to its own offspring.  A Government
Company is a mini-incarnation of Government itself, made up of its
blood and bones and given corporate shape and status for defined
objectives and not beyond.  The device is too obvious for deception.
A Government Company though, is but the alter ego of the Central
Government and tearing of the juristic veil worn, would bring out the
true character of the entity being 'the State'.	 Krishna Iyer, J. held it to
be immaterial whether the Corporation is formed by a statute or under
a statute, the true test is functional.	 "Not how the legal person is born
but why it is created."	 He further held that both the things are
essential: (i) discharging functions or doing business as the proxy of
the State by wearing the corporate mask, and (ii) an element of ability
to affect legal relations by virtue of power vested in it by law.  These
tests, if answered in positive, would entail the Corporation being an
instrumentality or agency of the State.	 What is an 'authority'?
Krishna Iyer, J. defined 'authority' as one which in law belongs to the
province of power and the search here must be to see whether the Act
vests authority, as agent or instrumentality of the State, to affect the
legal relations of oneself or others.  He quoted the definition of
'authority' from the Law Lexicon by P. Ramnath Iyer to say
"Authority is a body having jurisdiction in certain matters of a public
nature" and from Salmond's Jurisprudence, to say that the "ability
conferred upon a person by the law to alter, by his own will directed
to that end, the rights, duties, liabilities or other legal relations, either
of himself or of other persons,' must be present ab extra to make a
person an 'authority'."	 He held BPL to be "a limb of Government and
agency of the State, a vicarious creature of statute", because of these
characteristics, which he found from the provisions of the Act which
created it and other circumstances, viz., (i) it is not a mere company
but much more than that, (ii) it has a statutory flavour in its operations
and functions, in its powers and duties and in its personality itself,
</p><p id="p_177">(iii) it is functionally and administratively under the thumb of
Government; and (iv) the Company had stepped into the shoes of the
executive power of the State and had unique protection, immunity and
powers.	 In conclusion Krishna Iyer, J. held that the case of BPL was
a close parallel to the Airport Authority's case (Ramanna's case)
excepting that Airport Authority is created by a statute while BPL is
recognized by and clothed with rights and duties by the statute.
Krishna Iyer, J. having culled out the several tests from Ramanna's
case added a clinching footnote	 the finale is reached when the
cumulative effect of all the relevant factors above set out is assessed
and once the body is found to be an instrumentality or agency of
Government, the further conclusion emerges that it is 'the State' and
is subject to the same constitutional limitations as Government and it
is this divagation  which explains the ratio of Ramanna's case.

Officers Association and Anr.  JT 2002 (1) SC 61, to be an

form of company being a mere cloak or cover for the Government.
What is significant in this decision is that the conclusion whether an
independent entity satisfies the test of instrumentality or agency of the
government is not whether it owes its origin to any particular Statute
or Order but really depends upon a combination of one or more of the
relevant factors, depending upon the essentiality and overwhelming
nature of such factors in identifying the real source of governing
power, if need be, by piercing the corporate veil of the entity
concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_180">What is 'Authority' and when includible in 'other authorities',
re: <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_148">Article 12</a>

	We have, in the earlier part of this judgment, referred to the
dictionary meaning of 'authority', often used as plural, as in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_149">Article
12</a> viz. 'other authorities'.  Now is the time to find out the meaning to
be assigned to the term as used in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_150">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_181">	A reference to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_151">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution is apposite.  It
provides ___ "The State shall not make any law which takes away or
abridges the right conferred by this part and any law made in
contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention,
be void".  Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_152">Article 13</a> defines 'law' as including any
Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or
uses having in the territory of India the force of law.	 We have also
referred to the speech of  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in Constituent
Assembly explaining the purpose sought to be achieved by Article
</p><p id="p_182">12.  In RSEB's case, the majority adopted the test that a statutory
authority "would be within the meaning of 'other authorities' if it has
been invested with statutory power to issue binding directions to the
parties, disobedience of which would entail penal consequences or it
has the sovereign power to make rules and regulations having the
force of law".	 In Sukhdev Singh's case, the principal reason which
prevailed with A.N. Ray, CJ for holding ONGC, LIC and IFC as
authorities and hence 'the State' was that rules and regulations
framed by them have the force of law.  In Sukhdev Singh's case,
Mathew J. held that the test laid down in RSEB's case was satisfied
so far as ONGC is concerned but the same was not satisfied in the
case of LIC and IFC and, therefore, he added to the list of tests laid
down in RSEB's case, by observing that though there are no statutory
provisions, so far as LIC and IFC are concerned, for issuing binding
directions to third parties, the disobedience of which would entail
penal consequences, yet these corporations (i) set up under statutes,
</p><p id="p_183">(ii) to carry on business of public importance or which is fundamental
to the life of the people ___ can be considered as the State within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_153">Article 12.</a>	Thus, it is the functional test which was
devised and utilized by Mathew J. and there he said, "the question for
consideration is whether a public corporation set up under a special
statute to carry on a business or service which Parliament thinks
necessary to be carried on in the interest of the nation is an agency or
instrumentality of the State and would be subject to the limitations
expressed in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_154">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution.	 The State is an
abstract entity.  It can only act through the instrumentality or agency
of natural or juridicial persons.  Therefore, there is nothing strange in
the notion of the State acting through a corporation and making it an
agency or instrumentality of the State".  It is pertinent to note that
functional tests became necessary because of the State having chosen
to entrust its own functions to an instrumentality or agency in
absence whereof that function would have been a State activity on
account of its public importance and being fundamental to the life of
the people.
</p>
<p id="p_184">The philosophy underlying the expansion of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_155">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution so as to embrace within its ken  such entitites which
would not otherwise be the State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_156">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution has been pointed out by the eminent jurist H.M.
Seervai in Constitutional Law of India (Silver Jubilee Edition, Vol.1).
"The Constitution should be so interpreted that the governing power,
wherever located, must be subjected to fundamental constitutional
limitations.  . . . . . . . . . . . .  Under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_157">Article 13(2)</a> it is State action of a
particular kind that is prohibited.  Individual invasion of individual
rights is not, generally speaking, covered by <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_158">Article 13(2).</a>  For,
although Articles 17, 23 and 24 show that fundamental rights can be
violated by private individuals and relief against them would be
available under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_159">Article 32</a>, still, by and large, <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_160">Article 13(2)</a> is directed
against State action.  A public corporation being the creation of the
State, is subject to the same constitutional limitations as the State
itself.	 Two conditions are necessary, namely, that the Corporation
must be created by the State and it must invade the constitutional
rights of individuals"(Para 7.54).  "The line of reasoning developed
by Mathew J. prevents a large-scale evasion of fundamental rights by
transferring work done in Govt. Departments to statutory
Corporations, whilst retaining Govt. control.  Company legislation in
India permits tearing of the corporate veil in certain cases and to look
behind the real legal personality.  But Mathew J. achieved the same
result by a different route, namely, by drawing out the implications of
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_161">Article 13(2)" (Para 7.57 ibid).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_185">	The terms instrumentality or agency of the State are not to be
found mentioned in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_162">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.  Nevertheless they
fall within the ken of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_163">Article 12</a> of the Constitution for the simple
reason that if the State chooses to set up an instrumentality or agency
and entrusts it with the same power, function or action which would
otherwise have been exercised or undertaken by itself, there is no
reason why such instrumentality or agency should not be subject to
same constitutional and public law limitations as the State would
have been.  In different judicial pronouncements, some of which we
have reviewed, any company, corporation, society or any other entity
having a juridical existence if it has been held to be an
instrumentality or agency of the State, it has been so held only on
having found to be an alter ego, a double or a proxy or a limb or an
off-spring or a mini-incarnation or a vicarious creature or a surrogate
and so on __ by whatever name called __ of the State. In short, the
material available must justify holding of the entity wearing a mask
or a veil worn only legally and outwardly which on piercing fails to
obliterate the true character of the State in disguise.	 Then it is an
instrumentality or agency of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_186">	It is this basic and essential distinction between an
'instrumentality or agency' of the State and 'other authorities' which
has to be borne in mind.  An authority must be an authority sui juris
to fall within the meaning of the expression 'other authorities' under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_164">Article 12.</a>  A juridical entity, though an authority, may also satisfy
the test of being an instrumentality or agency of the State in which
event such authority may be held to be an instrumentality or agency
of the State but not the vice versa.
</p>
<p id="p_187">	We sum up our conclusions as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_188">(1)	Simply by holding a legal entity to be an instrumentality or
agency of the State it does not necessarily become an authority
within the meaning of 'other authorities' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_165">Article 12.</a>   To be an
authority, the entity should have been created by a statute or under
a statute and functioning with liability and obligations to public.
Further, the statute creating the entity should have vested that
entity with power to make law or issue binding directions
amounting to law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_166">Article 13(2)</a> governing
its relationship with other people or the affairs of other people __
their rights, duties, liabilities or other legal relations.  If created
under a statute, then there must exist some other statute conferring
on the entity such powers.  In either case, it should have been
entrusted with such functions as are governmental or closely
associated therewith by being of public importance or being
fundamental to the life of the people and hence governmental.
Such authority would be the State, for, one who enjoys the powers
or privileges of the State must also be subjected to limitations and
obligations of the State.  It is this strong statutory flavour and
clear indicia of power __ constitutional or statutory, and its
potential or capability to act to the detriment of fundamental rights
of the people, which makes it an authority; though in a given case,
depending on the facts and circumstances, an authority may also
be found to be an instrumentality or agency of the State and to that
extent they may overlap.  Tests 1, 2 and 4 in Ajay Hasia enable
determination of Governmental ownership or control.  Tests 3, 5
and 6 are 'functional' tests.  The propounder of the tests himself
has used the words suggesting relevancy of those tests for finding
out if an entity was instrumentality or agency of the State.
Unfortunately thereafter the tests were considered relevant for
testing if an authority is the State and this fallacy has occurred
because of difference between 'instrumentality and agency' of the
State and an 'authority' having been lost sight of  sub-silentio,
unconsciously and un-deliberated.  In our opinion, and keeping in
view the meaning which 'authority' carries, the question whether
an entity is an 'authority' cannot be answered by applying Ajay
Hasia tests.
</p>
<p id="p_189">(2)	The tests laid down in Ajay  Hasia's case are relevant for the
purpose of determining whether an entity is an instrumentality
or agency of the State.	 Neither all the tests are required to be
answered in positive nor a positive answer to one or two tests
would suffice.	It will depend upon a combination of one or
more of the relevant factors depending upon the essentiality and
overwhelming nature of such factors in identifying the real
source of governing power, if need be by removing the mask or
piercing the veil disguising the entity concerned.   When an
entity has an independent legal existence, before it is held to be
the State, the person alleging it to be so must satisfy the Court
of brooding presence of government or deep and pervasive
control of the government so as to hold it to be an
instrumentality or agency of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_190">CSIR, if 'the State'?
</p>
<p id="p_191">	Applying the tests formulated hereinabove, we are clearly of the
opinion that CSIR is not an 'authority' so as to fall within the meaning
of expression 'other authorities' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_167">Article 12.</a>  It has no statutory
flavour __ neither it owes its birth to a statute nor is there any other
statute conferring it with such powers as would enable it being
branded an authority.  The indicia of power is absent.	It does not
discharge such functions as are governmental or closely associated
therewith or being fundamental to the life of the people.
</p>
<p id="p_192">	We may now examine the characteristics of CSIR.	 On a careful
examination of the material available consisting of the memorandum
of association, rules and regulations and bye-laws of the society and
its budget and statement of receipts and outgoings, we proceed to
record our conclusions.	 The Government does not hold the entire
share capital of CSIR.	It is not owned by the Government.  Presently,
the Government funding is about 70% and grant by Government of
India is one out of five categories of avenues to derive its funds.
Receipts from other sources such as research, development,
consultation activities, monies received for specific projects and job
work, assets of the society, gifts and donations are permissible sources
of funding of CSIR without any prior permission/consent/sanction
from the Government of India.  Financial assistance from the
Government does not meet almost all expenditure of the CSIR and
apparently it fluctuates too depending upon variation from its own
sources of income.  It does not enjoy any monopoly status, much less
conferred or protected by Government.  The governing body does not
consist entirely of Government nominees.  The membership of the
society and the manning of its governing body - both consist
substantially of private individuals of eminence and independence
who cannot be regarded as hands and voice of the State.	 There is no
provision in the rules or the byelaws that the government can issue
such directives as it deems necessary to CSIR and the latter is bound
to carry out the same.	The functions of the CSIR cannot be regarded
as governmental or of essential public importance or as closely related
to governmental functions or being fundamental to the life of the
people or duties and obligations to public at large.  The functions
entrusted to CSIR can as well be carried out by any private person or
organization.	Historically it was not a department of government
which was transferred to CSIR.	There was a Board of Scientific and
Industrial Research and an Industrial Research Utilisation Committee.
The CSIR was set up as a society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_168">Societies
Registration Act</a>, 1860 to coordinate  and generally exercise
administrative control over the two organizations which would tender
their advice only to CSIR.  The membership of the society and the
governing body of the council may be terminated by the President not
by the Government of India.  The governing body is headed by the
Director General of CSIR and not by the President of Society (i.e. the
Prime Minister).  Certainly the board and the committee, taken over
by CSIR, did not discharge any regal, governmental or sovereign
functions.  The CSIR is not the offspring or the blood and bones or the
voice and hands of the government.  The CSIR does not and cannot
make law.
</p>
<p id="p_193">	However, the Prime Minister of India is the President of the
society.  Some of the members of the society and of the governing
body are persons appointed ex-officio by virtue of their holding some
office under the Government also.  There is some element of control
exercised by the government in matters of expenditure such as on the
quantum and extent of expenditure more for the reason that financial
assistance is also granted by the Government of India and the later
wishes to see that its money is properly used and not misused.	The
President is empowered to review, amend and vary any of the
decisions of the governing body which is in the nature of residual
power for taking corrective measures vesting in the President but then
the power is in the President in that capacity and not as Prime
Minister of India. On winding up or dissolution of CSIR any
remaining property is not available to members but 'shall be dealt
with in such manner as Government of India may determine'.  There
is nothing special about such a provision in Memorandum of
Association of CSIR as such a provision is a general one applicable to
all societies under <a href="/doc/1663305/" id="a_169">Section 14</a> of the Societies Registration Act, 1860.
True that there	 is some element of control of the government but not
a deep and pervasive control.  To some extent, it may be said that
Government's presence or participation is felt in the society but such
presence cannot be called a brooding presence or the overlordship of
government.  We are satisfied that the tests in Ajay Hasia's case are
not substantially or on essential aspects even satisfied to call CSIR an
instrumentality or agency of the State.	 A mere governmental
patronage, encouragement, push or recognition would not make an
entity 'the State'.
</p>
<p id="p_194">	On comparison, we find that in substance CSIR stands on a
footing almost similar to the Institute of Constitutional and
Parliamentary Studies (in Tekraj Vasandi @ K.L. Basandhi Vs.
Union of India &amp; Ors., (1988) 1 SCC 236) and National Council of
Educational Research and Training (in Chander Mohan Khanna Vs.
NCERT, (1991) 4 SCC 578), and those cases were correctly decided.
</p>
<p id="p_195">	Strong reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the
appellants on a notification dated 31.10.1986 issued in exercise of the
powers conferred by sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/796793/" id="a_170">Section 14</a> of the
Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 whereby the provisions of sub-
Section (3) of <a href="/doc/1663305/" id="a_171">Section 14</a> of the said Act have been made applicable to
the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, "being the society
owned or controlled by government".  On point of fact we may state
that this notification, though of the year 1986, was not relied on or
referred to in the pleadings of the appellants.	 We do not find it
mentioned anywhere in the proceedings before the High Court and not
even in the SLP filed in this Court.  Just during the course of hearing
this notification was taken out from his brief by the learned counsel
and shown to the Court and the opposite counsel.  It was almost
sprung as a surprise without affording the opposite party an
opportunity of giving an explanation.  The learned Attorney General
pointed out that the notification was issued by Ministry of Personnel,
Public Grievances and Pensions (Department of Personnel and
Training) and he appealed to the Court not to overlook the practical
side in the working of the government where at times one department
does not know what the other department is doing.  We do not
propose to enter into a deeper scrutiny of the notification.  For our
purpose, it would suffice to say that <a href="/doc/796793/" id="a_172">Section 14</a> of the Administrative
Tribunals Act, 1985, and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_173">Article 323A</a> of the Constitution to which
the Act owes its origin, do not apparently contemplate a society being
brought within the ambit of the Act by a notification of Central
Government.  Though, we guardedly abstain from expressing any
opinion on this issue as the present one cannot be an occasion for
entering into that exercise.  Moreover, on the material available, we
have recorded a positive finding that CSIR is not a society "owned or
controlled by Government".   We cannot ignore that finding solely by
relying on the contents of the notification wherein we find the user of
relevant expression having been mechanically copied but factually
unsupportable.
</p>
<p id="p_196">	For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is not the State within
