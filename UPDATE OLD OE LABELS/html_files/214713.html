ACT:
Limitation-Land	 Acquisition-Award  by	Collector-Notice  Of
award not given-Application for reference to Court-Time	 for
making-<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 (1 of 1894), s. r8.



HEADNOTE:
Certain	 lands belonging to the appellant were	compulsorily
acquired.   The Collector made an award with respect to	 the
amount of compensation, signed and filed it in his office as
required by<a href="/doc/1672733/" id="a_2"> S. 12(1)</a> Land Acquisition Act on March 19, 1950.
But  no	 notice of the award, as required by<a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_3"> s.	 12(2)</a>,	 was
given  to the appellant.  The appellant came to know of	 the
award  on  or about January 13, 1953, and  on  February	 24,
1953, he filed an application under<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_4"> s. 18</a> requiring that the
matter be referred for the determination of the Court.	 The
proviso to<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_5"> s. 18</a> prescribes that in cases where a person was
not present or represented at the time of the making of	 the
award  the application under<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_6"> s. 18</a> shall be made within	 six
weeks of the receipt of the notice from the Collector  under
s. 12(2), or "within six months from the date of the award",
whichever  shall expire first.	The appellant's	 application
was dismissed as time barred on the ground that it was	made
beyond six months of the date of the award.
Held, that the application made by the appellant under<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_7"> s. 18</a>
of the Act was not beyond time.	 The award of the  Collector
was not a decision but an offer of compensation on behalf of
the  Government to the owner of the property and it was	 not
effective  until  it  was communicated to  the	owner.	 The
making	of the award did not consist merely in the  physical
act  of writing the award or signing it or filing it in	 the
office of the Collector; it also involved the  communication
of the award to the owner either actually or constructively.
Consequently, the expression "the date of the award" in	 the
proviso	 to <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_8"> s.	 18</a>  meant  the	 date  when  the  award	 was
communicated to the owner or is known by him either actually
or constructively.  The application in the present case	 was
made within six months of the date when the appellants	came
to know of the award and was within the period prescribed.

1961.  March 30.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-These two appeals arise out Gajen, of two
writ  petitions filed by the appellant Raja  Harish  Chandra
Raj   Singh   against  the  respondents	 the   Deputy	Land
Acquisition Officer and another in the Allahabad High  Court
and they were based on the same facts and asked for the same
relief.	  Both	of  them raise a short	common	question  of
limitation  the	 decision  of which would  depend  upon	 the
determination  of the scope and effect of the provisions  of
the  proviso to s. 18 of the Land Acquisition Act I of	1894
(hereafter  called  the Act).  Since the facts in  both	 the
appeals	 are  substantially the same we would refer  to	 the
facts in Civil Appeal No. 25 of 1958.  The decision in	this
appeal would govern the decision of the other appeal,  Civil
Appeal No. 26 of 1958.
</p><p id="p_5">The  appellant	Raja  Harish  Chandra  Raj  Singh  was	 the
proprietor of a village Beljuri in the District of Nainital.
It  appears that proceedings for compulsory  acquisition  of
land  including the said village for a public  purpose	were
commenced  by  respondent  2, the State	 of  Uttar  Pradesh;
notifications  under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_10"> ss. 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_11">6</a> of the Act were  issued  in
that behalf, and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">678</span>
provisions of<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_12"> s. 17</a> were also made applicable.	Accordingly,
after  the notice under<a href="/doc/1015358/" id="a_13"> s. 9(1)</a> of the Act  was	   published
possession  of land was taken by the Collector on March	 19,
1960.	 Thereupon  the	 appellant  filed   his	  claim	  to
compensation  for the land acquired in	  accordance with<a href="/doc/1937844/" id="a_14"> s.
9(2)</a>,	and  proceedings  were	held  by  the  Deputy	Land
Acquisition  Officer,  respondent  1,  for  determining	 the
amount	 of   compensation.   It  appears  that	  in   these
proceedings  an	 award	was made, signed and  filed  in	 his
office by respondent I on March 25, 1951.  No notice of this
award was, however, given to the appellant as required by<a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_15"> s.
12(2)</a>  and it was only on or about January 13, 1953 that  he
received  information  about the making of the	said  award.
The appellant then filed an application on February 24, 1953
under  a. 18 requiring that the matter be referred  for	 the
determination of the Court, as, according to the  appellant,
the compensation amount determined by respondent I was quite
inadequate.  Respondent I took the view that the application
thus made by the appellant was beyond time under the proviso
to<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_16"> s. 18</a> and so he rejected it.	 The appellant then filed  a
writ  petition	in  the Allahabad  High	 Court	on  December
21,1953	 in which he claimed appropriate reliefs in  respect
of the order passed by respondent I on his application	made
under  a. 18.  This petition was heard by Mehrotra,  J.	 and
was  allowed.	The learned Judge directed respondent  1  to
consider the application made by the appellant on the merits
and  deal with it in accordance with law.  He held  that  in
dealing with the said application respondent 1 should  treat
the application as filed in time.  Against this decision the
respondents  preferred an appeal to a Division Bench of	 the
said  High  Court.  Mootham, C. J. and Chaturvedi,  J.,	 who
heard  this appeal took the view that the application  filed
by the appellant under<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_17"> s. 18</a> of the Act was barred by  time,
and  so they allowed the appeal, set aside the order  passed
by Mehrotra, J. and dismissed the writ petition filed by the
appellant.   The  appellant then moved for  and	 obtained  a
certificate  from  the said High Court and it is  with	this
certificate that he has come to this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">670</span>
Court in the present appeal; and so the short question which
the  appellant	raises	for  our  decision  is	whether	 the
application filed by him under<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_18"> s. 18</a> of the Act( was in time
or not.
</p><p id="p_6">Before proceeding to construe the material provisions of <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_19"> s.
18</a>  it	is necessary to refer very briefly  to,	 some  other
sections  of  the  Act	which  are  relevant  in(  order  to
appreciate the background of the scheme in relation to	land
acquisition   proceedings.    <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_20">Section  4</a>  deals	  with	 the
publication  of the preliminary notification and  prescribes
the powers of the appropriate officers.	 Whenever it appears
to  the appropriate Government that land in any locality  is
needed for any public purpose a notification to that  effect
shall  be  published in the official gazette  and  a  public
notice of its substance shall be given at convenient  places
in  the said locality; that is the effect of<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_21"> s. 4(1)</a>.	Sec-
tion   4(2)  deals  with  the  powers  of  the	 appropriate
authorities.   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_22">Section	5-A</a>  provides  for  the	 hearing  of
objections filed by persons interested in any land which has
been notified under<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_23"> s. 4(1)</a>.  After the objections are	thus
considered a declaration that land is required for a  public
purpose	 follows under<a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_24"> s. 6(1)</a>.	 <a href="/doc/263705/" id="a_25">Section 6(2)</a>  provides	 for
the  publication of the said declaration; and<a href="/doc/984542/" id="a_26"> s. 6(3)</a>  makes
the declaration conclusive evidence that the land is  needed
for  a public purpose.	<a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_27">Section 9</a> requires the Collector  to
give public notice in the manner specified stating that	 the
Government intend to take possession of the land and calling
for  claim,% to compensation in respect of all interests  in
such land.  <a href="/doc/1937844/" id="a_28">Section 9(2)</a> prescribes the particulars of	such
notice, and<a href="/doc/499767/" id="a_29"> s. 9(3)</a> an 4) provide for the manner of  serving
such notice.  Section II deals with the enquiry and provides
for the making of the award by the Collector.  <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_30">Section 12(l)</a>
then  lays  down that the award when made by  the  Collector
shall be filed in his office, and shall, except as otherwise
provided,  be final and conclusive evidence as	between	 the
Collector  and	the  persons interested	 whether  they	have
respectively  appeared before the Collector or not,  of	 the
true  area and value of the land, and the  apportionment  of
the compensation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">680</span>
among  the persons interested.	<a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_31">Section 12(2)</a> is  important.
It makes it obligatory on the Collector to give	   immediate
notice of his award to such of the persons interested as are
not present personally or by their  representatives when the
award is made.	It is common ground that no such notice	 was
given by respondent 1 to the appellant.	 That briefly is the
scheme	of  the relevant provisions of Part II of  the,	 Act
which deals with acquisition.
</p><p id="p_7">Part  III which deals with reference to Court and  procedure
thereon	 opens with<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_32"> s. 18</a>.  <a href="/doc/868941/" id="a_33">Section 18(1)</a> provides that	 any
person	interested  who has not accepted the award  may,  by
written	 application  to  the Collector,  require  that	 the
matter	be referred by him for determination of	 the  Court,
inter  alia, whether the amount of compensation is  adequate
or not.	 It is under this provision that the appellant	made
an  application	 from  which  the  present  appeal   arises.
<a href="/doc/1920288/" id="a_34">Section 18(2)</a> requires that the application shall state	 the
grounds	 on  which objection to the award is  taken.   These
grounds	  have	 been  stated  by  the	appellant   in	 his
application.   The proviso to<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_35"> s. 18</a> deals with the  question
of  limitation.	 It prescribes that every  such	 application
shall  be  made (a) if the person making it was	 present  or
represented  before the Collector at the time when  he	made
his award within six weeks from the date of the	 Collector's
award; (b) in other cases within six weeks of the receipt of
the notice from the Collector under<a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_36"> s. 12(2)</a>, or within	 six
months	from  the date of the  Collector's  award  whichever
shall  first expire.  The appellant's case falls  under	 the
latter part of el. (b) of the proviso.	It has been held  by
the Allahabad High Court that since the application made  by
the appellant before respondent I was made beyond six months
from  the date of the award in question it was beyond  time.
The  view  taken by the High Court proceeds on	the  literal
construction  of  the relevant clause.	As we  have  already
seen  the  award was signed and delivered in his  office  by
respondent  1 on March 25, 1951 and the application  by	 the
appellant was made under<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_37"> s. 18</a> on February 24, 1953.  It has
been held that the effect of the relevant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">681</span>
clause	is  that the application made by  the  appellant  is
plainly	 beyond the six months permitted by the said  clause
and  so respondent I was right in rejecting it as barred  by
time.  The question which arises for our decision is whether
this  literal and mechanical way of construing the  relevant
clause is justified in A law.  It is obvious that the effect
of this construction is that if a person does not know about
the making of the award and is himself not to blame for	 not
knowing	 about	the award his right to make  an	 application
under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_38"> s. 18</a> may in many cases be rendered ineffective.	  If
the  effect  of the relevant provision unambiguously  is  as
held by the High Court the unfortunate consequence which may
flow from it may not have a material or a decisive  bearing.
If, on the other hand, it is possible reasonably to construe
the  said  provision so as to avoid such  a  consequence  it
would  be  legitimate  for  the Court to  do  so.   We	must
therefore enquire whether the relevant provision is  capable
of  the construction for which the appellant  contends,	 and
that naturally raises the question as to what is the meaning
of the expression "the day of the Collector's award".
In dealing with this question it is relevant to bear in mind
the legal character of the award made by the Collector under
s. 12.	In a sense it is a decision of the Collector reached
by  him after holding an enquiry as prescribed by  the	Act.
It  is a decision, inter alia, in respect of the  amount  of
compensation  which should be paid to the person  interested
in  the property acquired; but legally the award  cannot  be
treated	 as a decision; it is in law an offer or  tender  of
the compensation determined by the Collector to the owner of
the  property under acquisition.  If the owner	accepts	 the
offer  no  further proceeding is required to be	 taken;	 the
amount	is paid and compensation proceedings are  concluded.
If, however, the owner does not accept the offer<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_39"> s. 18</a> gives
him the statutory,, right of having the question  determined
by  Court, and' it is the amount of compensation  which	 the
Court may determine that would bind both the owner and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">86</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">682</span>
the  Collector.	  In  that case it is  on  the	amount	thus
determined judicially that the acquisition proceedings would
be  concluded.	 It is because of this nature of  the  award
that  the award can be appropriately  described as a  tender
or offer made by the Collector	on behalf of the  Government
to the owner of the property for his acceptance.  In Ezra v.
The  Secretary	of State (1).  It has been  held  that	"the
meaning	 to be attached to the word "award" under<a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_40"> s. 11</a>	 and
its  nature and effect must be arrived at not from the	mere
use  of the same expression in both instances but  from	 the
examination  of	 the provisions of the law relating  to	 the
Collector's  proceedings  culminating  in  the	award.	 The
considerations to which we have referred satisfy us that the
Collector  acts	 in  the  matter  of  the  enquiry  and	 the
valuation of the land only as an agent of the Government and
not  as a judicial officer; and that consequently,  although
the  Government	 is bound by his  proceedings,	the  persons
interested  are not concluded by his finding  regarding	 the
value  of the land or the compensation to be awarded."	Then
the  High  Court  has added that such tender  once  made  is
binding on the Government and the Government cannot  require
that the value fixed by its own officer acting on its behalf
should	be open to question at its own instance	 before	 the
Civil  Court.	The  said case was taken  before  the  Privy
Council	 in Ezra v. Secretary of State for India (2  ),	 and
their Lordships have expressly approved of the	observations
made  by  the  High Court to which we  have  just  referred.
Therefore;  if the award made by the Collector is in law  no
more than an offer made on behalf of the Government to,	 the
owner  of  the	property then the making  of  the  award  as
properly  understood must involve the communication  of	 the
offer	to  the	 party	concerned.   That  is	the   normal
requirement under the contract law and its applicability  to
cases  of  award  made under the Act  cannot  be  reasonably
excluded.   Thus considered the date of the award cannot  be
determined solely by reference to the time when the award is
signed	by the Collector or delivered by him in his  office;
it must
(1) (1903) I.L.R. 30 Cal. 36, 86.
</p><p id="p_8">(2) (1905) I.L.R. 32 Cal. 605.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">683</span>
<p id="p_9">involve the consideration of the question as to when it	 was
known	to   the   party  concerned   either   actually	  or
constructively.	  If  that  be the true	 position  then	 the
literal	 and mechanical construction of the words "the	date
of the award" occurring in the relevant section would not be
appropriate.
</p><p id="p_10">There  is  yet	another	 point	which  leads  to  the	same
conclusion.   If the award is treated as  an  administrative
decision  taken	 by  the  Collector in	the  matter  of	 the
valuation of the property sought to be acquired it is  clear
that the said decision ultimately affects the' rights of the
owner of the property and in that sense, like all  decisions
which  affect persons, it is essentially fair and just	that
the said decision should be communicated to the said  party.
The  knowledge	of the party affected by  such	a  decision,
either	actual	or constructive, 'is  an  essential  element
which  must be satisfied before the decision can be  brought
into force.  Thus considered the making of the award  cannot
consist	 merely in the physical act of writing the award  or
signing it or even filing it in the office of the Collector;
it  must involve the communication of the said award to	 the
party  concerned either actually or constructively.  If	 the
award  is  pronounced  in the presence of  the	party  whose
rights	are  affected  by it  can be said to  be  made	when
pronounced.  If the date for the pronouncement of the  award
is   communicated  to  the  party  and	it  is	 accordingly
pronounced  on	the date previously announced the  award  is
said  to be communicated to the said party even if the	said
party	is  not	 actually  present  on	the  date   of	 its
pronouncement.	 Similarly if without notice of the date  of
its pronouncement an award is pronounced and a party is	 not
present	 the  award  can  be said to  be  made	when  it  is
communicated to the party later.  The knowledge of the party
affected by the award, either actual or constructive,  being
an  essential requirement of fair-play and  natural  justice
the  expression "the date of the award" used in the  proviso
must mean the date when the award is either communicated  to
the   party   or  is  known  by	 him  either   actually	  or
constructively.	  In  our opinion, therefore,  it  would  be
unreasonable to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">684</span>
construe the words "from the date of the Collector's  award"
used in the proviso to<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_41"> s. 18</a> in a literal or mechanical way.
In  this connection it is material to recall the fact	that
under <a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_42"> s. 12(2)</a> it is obligatory on the Collector  to	give
immediate notice of the award to the persons interested	 a,,
are not present personally or by their representatives	when
the  award is made.  This requirement itself postulates	 the
necessity  of  the communication of the award to  the  party
concerned.   The Legislature recognised that the  making  of
the award under<a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_43"> s. 11</a> followed by its filing under<a href="/doc/1672733/" id="a_44"> s.  12(1)</a>
would  not meet the requirements of justice before  bringing
the award into force.  It thought that the communication  of
the award to the party concerned was also necessary, and  so
by the use of the mandatory words an obligation is placed on
the  Collector to communicate the award immediately  to	 the
person	concerned.   It	 is  significant  that	the  section
requires   the	Collector  to  give  notice  of	 the   award
immediately  after making it.  This provision lends  support
to  the view which we have taken about the  construction  of
the  expression "from the date of the Collector's award"  in
the  proviso to<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_45"> s. 18</a>.	It is because communication  of	 the
order  is regarded by the Legislature as necessary  that <a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_46"> s.
12(2)</a> has imposed an obligation on the Collector and if	 the
relevant clause in the proviso is read in the light of	this
statutory requirement it tends to show that the literal	 and
mechanical  construction of the said clause would be  wholly
inappropriate.	 It  would indeed be a very  curious  result
that   the  failure  of	 the  Collector	 to  discharge	 his
obligation  under <a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_47"> s.  12(2)</a> should directly  tend  to	make
ineffective  the right of the party to make  an	 application
under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_48"> s. 18</a>, and this result could not possibly  have	been
intended by the legislature.
</p><p id="p_11">It may now be convenient to refer to some judicial decisions
bearing	 on  this point.  In Magdonald v. The  Secretary  of
State,	for India in Council (1) Rattigan and Shah Din,	 JJ.
held  that  under  the proviso to<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_49"> s. 18</a> until  an  award  is
announced or communicated to the parties concerned it cannot
be said to be legally made.
</p><p id="p_12">(1)  (1005) 4 Ind.  C. 914.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">685</span>
<p id="p_13">An award under the Act, it was observed in the judgment,  is
in  the	 nature of a tender and obviously no tender  can  be
made unless it is brought to the(-, knowledge of the  person
to  whom it is made.  The learned Judges observed that	this
proposition  seemed  to them to be self-evident.   The	same
view has been expressed by the Oudh Judicial Commissioner in
Hari Das Pal v. The Municipal Board, Lucknow (1).
On the other hand, in <a href="/doc/192778/" id="a_50">Jehangir Bomanji v. G. D. Gaikwad</a>	 (2)
the Bombay High Court has taken the view that the element of
notice is only an essential ingredient of the first part  of
cl.  (b) of the proviso to s.18 which prescribes the  period
of  limitation as six weeks from the date of the receipt  of
the notice from the Collector, not of the second part  which
prescribes the maximum period of six months from the date of
the Collector's award in absolute terms.  According to	that
decision, as far as the limitation under the latter part  is
concerned it runs from the date of the award and the date of
the award has nothing whatever to (lo with the notice  which
the  Collector has to give under<a href="/doc/306303/" id="a_51"> s. 12(2)</a>.  In	our  opinion
this decision is based on a misconstruction of the  relevant
clause	in the proviso to<a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_52"> s. 18</a>.  The same comment falls  to
be  made in regard to the decision of the Kerala High  Court
in State of Travancore-Cochin v. Narayani Amma Ponnamma (3).
It  may, however, be pertinent to point out that the  Bombay
High  Court has taken a somewhat different view	 in  dealing
with the effect of the provision as to limitation prescribed
by <a href="/doc/1605951/" id="a_53"> s. 33A(2)</a> of the Indian Income-tax Act.  This  provision
prescribes limitation for an application by an assessee	 for
the  revision of the specified class of orders, and it	says
that such an application should be made within one year from
the date of the order.	It is significant that while provid-
ing for a similar period of limitation<a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_54"> s. 33(1)</a> specifically
lays  down  that  the  limitation  of  sixty  days   therein
prescribed  is to be calculated from the date on  which	 the
order in question is communicated to the
(1) (1914) 22 Ind.  C. 652.  (2) A.I.R. 1954 Bom. 419,
(3) A.I.R. (1958) Kerala 272.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">686</span>
<p id="p_14">assessee.  In other words, in prescribing limitation<a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_55"> s. 33(1)</a>
expressly provides for the commencement	 of  the period from
the date of the communication	of the	order,	whereas	 <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_56"> s.
33A(2)</a> does not refer to any  such    communication;	 and
naturally the argument was that communication was irrelevant
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_57"> s. 33A(2)</a> and limitation would commence as from	'the
making of the order without reference to its  communication.
This  argument was rejected by the Bombay High Court and  it
was  hold  that it would be a reasonable  interpretation  to
hold that the making of the order implies notice of the said
order, either actual or constructive, to the party  affected
by it.	It would not be easy to reconcile this decision	 and
particularly  the  reasons  given in its  support  with	 the
decision  of  the same High Court in the  case	of  Jehangir
Bomanji	 (1).	The relevant clause under<a href="/doc/1605951/" id="a_58"> s. 33A(2)</a>  of	 the
Indian	Income-tax Act has also been similarly construed  by
the  Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/465236/" id="a_59">O.A.O.A.M. Muthia Chettiar v.	 The
Commissioner  of  Income-tax, Madras</a> (2).  "If a  person  is
given a right to resort to a remedy to get rid of an adverse
order within a prescribed time", observed Rajamannar,  C.J.,
"limitation should not be computed from a date earlier	than
that on which the party aggrieved actually knew of the order
or  had an opportunity of knowing the order,  and  therefore
must  be presumed to have the knowledge of the	order".	  In
other  words the Madras High Court has taken the  view	that
the   omission	 to  use  the  words  "from  the   date	  of
communication"	in<a href="/doc/1605951/" id="a_60"> s. 33A(2)</a> does not mean  that  limitation
can  start  to	run against a party even  before  the  party
either	knew or should have known about the said order.	  In
our opinion this conclusion is obviously right.
A  similar  question arose before the Madras High  Court  in
Annamalai  Chetti v. Col.  J. G. Cloete(3).  Section  25  of
the  Madras  Boundary Act XXVIII of 1860  limited  the	time
within which a suit may be brought to set side the  decision
of the settlement officer to two months from the date of the
award, and
(1) A.I.R 1954 Bom. 419.    (2) I.L.R. 1951 Mad. 815.
(3) (1883) I.L. R. 6 Mad. 1 89.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">687</span>
<p id="p_15">so  the	 question arose as to when the time would  begin  to
run.   The  High Court held that the time can begin  to	 run
only from the date on which the decision is communicated  to
the parties.  "If there was any decision at all in the sense
of  the Act", says the judgment, "it could not date  earlier
than  the  date of the communication of it to  the  parties;
otherwise  they might, be barred of their right,  of  appeal
without	 any knowledge of the decision having been  passed".
Adopting the same principle a, similar construction has been
placed	by  the Madras High Court in K.	 V.  E.	 Swaminathan
alias <a href="/doc/956464/" id="a_61">Chidambaram Pillai v. Letchmanan Chettiar</a> (1).  On the
limitation  provisions contained in ss. 73(1) and  77(l)  of
the  Indian Registration Act XVI of 1908.  It was held	that
in  a case where an order was not passed in the presence  of
the  parties  or after notice to them of the date  when	 the
order  would  be passed the expression "within	thirty	days
after  the  making of the order" used in the  said  sections
means  within  thirty  days  after the	date  on  which	 the
communication  of the order reached the parties affected  by
it.  These decisions show that where the rights of a  person
are  affected by any order and limitation is prescribed	 for
the  enforcement  of  the remedy  by  the  person  aggrieved
against	 the  said order by reference to the making  of	 the
said order, the making of the order must mean either  actual
or constructive communication of the said order to the party
concerned.  Therefore, we are satisfied that the High  Court
of  Allahabad was in error in coming to the conclusion	that
the  application  made	by  the	 appellant  in	the  present
proceedings  was  barred under the proviso to<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_62"> s. 18</a>  of	 the
Act.
</p><p id="p_16">In  the	 result we allow the appeal, set  aside	 the  orders
passed	by  Mootham, C. J. and Chaturvedi, J.,	and  restore
those  of  Mehrotra, J. In the circumstances  of  this	case
there would be no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_17">Appeal allowed.
