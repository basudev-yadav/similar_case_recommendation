ACT:
     Indian Stamp  (Andhra Pradesh  Extension and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1">Amendment)
Act</a> XIX	 of 1959-Arts.	31(c) and  35(c)-Scope of-Lease	 and
licence-Distinction.
     Sales Tax-Whether payable on annual auction Sales.



HEADNOTE:
     Under the terms and conditions of sale the respondents,
who were  the  highest	bidders	 at  an	 auction  of  forest
produce,  were	 called	 upon  to  pay	stamp  duty  on	 the
agreements to  be executed by them as if they were leases of
immovable property  falling under  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_2">Art.	 31(c)</a>	and  on	 the
deposits of  security as  mortgages under  <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_3">art. 35(c)</a> of the
<a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_4">Indian Stamp Act</a>, 1899 as also sales tax on the bid amounts.
In a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">art. 226</a>, the respondents contended that
the right to pluck, collect and take away the forest produce
was not a right or interest in immovable property within the
meaning of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_6">art.  31(c)</a>	 of  the  <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_7">Stamp	 Act</a>,  the  security
deposits were  not mortgages nor did the Government carry on
any business  of sale  and, as such, they were not liable to
pay  the  amounts  demanded.  The  High	 Court	allowed	 the
petitions.
     Dismissing the State's appeal,
^
     HELD :  The acquisition by the respondents not being an
interest in  the soil  but merely a right to cut the fructus
naturales, the	agreements possessed  the characteristics of
licences and  did not  amount to leases so as to attract the
applicability of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_8">art. 31 (c)</a> of the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_9">Stamp Act</a>. [667D]

     (1) A  study of  the definitions  of immovable property
occurring in  the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_12">Transfer of Property Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_13">Registration
Act</a> and	 the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_14">General  Clauses  Act</a>  shows  that	 it  is	 the
creation of  an interest in immovable property or a right to
possess it  that distinguishes	a lease	 from a	 licence.  A
licence does not create an interest in the property to which
it relates  while a lease does. In the case of a lease there
is transfer  of a  right to  enjoy  the	 property.  For	 the
purpose of  deciding whether a particular grant amounts to a
lease or a licence, it is essential to look to the substance
and essence of the agreement and not to its form. [665F-<a href="/doc/1719430/" id="a_15">G]

     In the  instant case the salient features emerging from
the agreements	are (i)	 that they  were made  for  a  short
duration of  9 to  10 months;  (ii) they  did not create any
estate or  interest in	the land  and (iii)  the respondents
were not  granted exclusive  possession and  control of	 the
land but  were merely granted the right to pluck, cut, carry
away and  appropriate the forest produce, present or future.
The right  to go  on the land was only ancillary to the real
purpose of the contract. [667C-D]
662
     (2) The  respondent could	not be	called upon  to	 pay
stamp duty  under <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_18">Art.	35(c)</a>  of  the	<a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_19">Stamp  Act</a>.  For  an
instrument to  fall within  the definition  of mortgage deed
contained in <a href="/doc/13922401/" id="a_20"> s. 2(17)</a> of the Stamp Act it is necessary that
it should  satisfy the	essential conditions  by creating  a
right over  or in  respect of a specified property in favour
of another person. [671D; 670G]
     In the  instant case  there is  nothing in the relevant
clause of the sale notice to indicate that any right over or
in the	security deposits was created in favour of the State
Government. [671A]
     Reference under  <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_21">Stamp Act</a>,  Section 46  15 I.L.R. Mad.

All. 190 F.B. approved.
     (3) (a)  The respondents  were not	 liable to pay sales
tax. It	 cannot be  said that  the  Government,	 by  holding
auction of  forest produce,  carried on business in the sale
of that	 class of  goods, which is an essential condition to
make the respondents liable to pay sales tax. [670D]

     (b)  The  consideration  of  profit  motive  cannot  be
regarded as  an essential  ingredient of the term 'business'
in view	 of the	 amendment in  the definition of 'dealer' in
1966. The  auctions were carried on only annually and not at
frequent intervals. The important element of frequency being
lacking it  cannot be  held that the Government was carrying
on the business of sale of forest produce. [669D-E]

the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_28">Indian  Stamp Act</a>,	1899 and  the Andhra Pradesh General
Sales Tax Act, 1957 shall be disposed of by this judgment.
</p><p id="p_6">     The facts	giving rise to these appeals are: The Forest
Department of  the Government of Andhra Pradesh after giving
a sale	notice	held,  in  accordance  with  the  terms	 and
conditions thereof, an auction in 1967 in respect of various
items of  forest produce  viz. timber,	fuel, bamboos, minor
forest produce,	 beedi leaves,	tanning barks,	parks  mohwa
etc. Clause  23	 of  the  notice  inter	 alia  required	 the
contractors to	pay within  10 days  of the  receipt of	 the
confirmation orders  of the  competent	authority:  (a)	 the
balance of  the 1st  instalment amount, as might be fixed by
the Divisional	Forest Officer, (b) 6 1/4% of the bid amount
as security  deposit; (c) sales tax on the bid amount at the
rates current  at the  time of	the sale.  Clause 60  of the
notice provided	 that the  contractors would  at  all  times
comply with  the provisions  of	 the  Indian  Stamp  (Andhra
Pradesh Extension  and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_29">Amendment)  Act</a> XIX  of 1959, and the
Andhra Pradesh Court Fees and <a href="/doc/867444/" id="a_30">Suits Valuation Act</a>, 1956, and
all the	 rules that  might, from  time to  time, be in force
thereunder.
</p><p id="p_7">     The respondents  herein being  the highest	 bidders  in
respect of some items of the forest produce were called upon
to pay in terms of the above noted conditions the stamp duty
on the	agreements to  be executed  by them  as if they were
leases of immovable property falling under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_31">Article 31 (c)</a> of
the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_32">Indian  Stamp Act</a>,	1899. They  were also called upon to
pay sales  tax on  the bid amount in terms of clause (23) of
the sale  notice. They were further called upon to pay stamp
duty on	 the deposits  made by	them by	 way of	 security as
mortgages, falling  within <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_33">Article  35(c)</a> of  the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_34">Stamp Act</a>.
Aggrieved by  the said	notices, the  respondents filed	 the
aforesaid petitions  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article  226</a> of  the Constitution
for issue  of appropriate writs etc. declaring the aforesaid
demand notices	as illegal  and	 void  and  restraining	 the
appellants from	 enforcing or  taking any proceeding for the
levy and  recovery of  the amounts  mentioned  therein.	 The
respondents contended  before the  High Court  that  as	 the
right to  pluck, collect  and take  away beedi leaves and to
cut and	 carry away  bamboos, standing timber etc. was not a
right or  interest in  immovable property  so as  to attract
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_36">Article 31(c)</a>  of the  <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_37">Stamp Act</a>, there could be no question
of payment  by them  of the stamp duty. The respondents also
challenged the	demand made  from them	for payment of sales
tax on	the bid	 amount on the ground that as the Government
did not	 carry on  any business	 of  sale,  the	 demand	 was
illegal. They  further challenged  the demand  of stamp duty
under <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_38">Article  35(c)</a> of	 the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_39">Stamp  Act</a>	 pleading  that	 the
security deposits  were not  mortgages so  as to attract the
provisions of the said Article of the Stamp Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">664</span>
<p id="p_8">     The petitions  were contested  by the appellants herein
who contended inter alia that pursuant to clause (60) of the
terms and  conditions of  the sale  notice, the	 respondents
were bound  to pay  the stamp duties that were chargeable in
view of	 the extension	of the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_40">Indian Stamp Act</a> to the whole
of the	State of  Andhra Pradesh by the Indian Stamp (Andhra
Pradesh Extension and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_41">Amendment) Act</a> XIX of 1959 with effect
from April  1, 1959,  and repeal of the Hyderabad Stamp Act,
and the	 rules, notifications,	instructions  etc.  made  or
issued	thereunder:   that  the	  right	 acquired   by	 the
respondents was	 not merely  a right to collect, appropriate
and sell  beedi leaves	that had  already grown but also the
right to  collect, use	and sell  beedi	 leaves	 that  would
subsequently grow  on the  standing trees and their branches
taking nourishment  from the land during the period of lease
which  showed	that  the  respondents	obtained  under	 the
agreement an  interest in immovable property. The appellants
further contended  that the  respondents were,	according to
the sale  notice, liable  to pay sales tax on the bid amount
as also	 the stamp  duty on  security  deposits	 which	fell
within the  definition of  mortgages as	 contemplated by the
<a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_42">Stamp Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_9">     On a  careful consideration of the respective stands of
the parties, the High Court negatived the contentions of the
appellants and	allowed	 the  petitions.  Aggrieved  by	 the
Judgment and order of the High Court, the appellants applied
for certificate	 under <a href="/doc/1180604/" id="a_43">Article 133(1)(b)</a> of the Constitution
which, as  already stated,  was granted to them. This is how
the appeals are before us.
</p><p id="p_10">     Three  questions	fall  for   consideration  in  these
appeals. The  first question  that we  are  called  upon  to
determine is  whether the  agreements which  the respondents
were called  upon to  execute in  respect of  the  aforesaid
rights relating	 to forest  produce were  in the  nature  of
leases or licences.
</p><p id="p_11">     It is  necessary in  this connection  to notice  at the
outset the  distinction between	 a lease  and a	 licence  by
reference to  the relevant Acts. <a href="/doc/30073236/" id="a_44">Section 2</a> (16) of the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_45">Stamp
Act</a> defines  the lease	as  meaning  a	lease  of  immovable
property but  this definition, it would be noted, is neither
exhaustive nor	self-explanatory. We  are, therefore, driven
to find	 out the  true meaning of the term by turning to the
<a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_46">Transfer of  Property Act</a>.  <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_47">Section  105</a>  of  the  said	 Act
defines 'lease' as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "A lease  of immovable property is a transfer of a
     right to  enjoy such property, made for a certain time,
     express or	 implied, or  in perpetuity in consideration
     of a price paid or promised, or of money."</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">     'Licence' is defined in section 52 of the Easement Act,
1882 as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  "Where one  person grants  to	 another,  or  to  a
     definite number  of other	persons, a  right to  do, or
     continue to  do, in  or upon  the immovable property of
     the grantor,  something which  would, in the absence of
     such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount
     to an  easement or	 an interest  in the  property,	 the
     right is called a licence".</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">665</span>
<p id="p_13">     The expression  'immovable property'  is not defined in
the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_48">Stamp Act</a> but is defined in <a href="/doc/1345438/" id="a_49">section 3</a> of the Transfer of
Property Act,  <a href="/doc/462798/" id="a_50">section 2(6)</a>  of	 the  Registration  Act	 and
<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_51">section 3(26)</a>  of the General Clauses Act. An idea as to the
meaning of  the expression  can also be gleaned from <a href="/doc/314854/" id="a_52">section
2(7)</a> of the Sales of Goods Act. According to learned counsel
for the	 appellants, it	 is  the  definition  of  'immovable
property as  given in  <a href="/doc/162731467/" id="a_53">section 3</a> (26) of the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_54">General Clauses
Act</a> that  has to  be applied  in  determining.	whether	 the
agreements in question fall within the definition of 'lease'
or not.	 It would  be useful  at this  stage to	 set out  in
juxtaposition the  definitions of  'immovable  property'  as
contained in  the aforesaid  Acts, as also the definition of
goods as given in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_55">Sale of Goods Act</a>:-

</p><p id="p_17">     A close study of the above definitions shows that it is
the creation  of an  interest in immovable property or right
to possess  it that  distinguishes a lease from a licence. A
licence does not create an interest in the property to which
it relates  while a  lease does.  There is  in	other  words
transfer of  a right  to enjoy	the property  in case  of  a
lease. As  to whether  a particular  transaction  creates  a
lease or  a licence is always a question of intention of the
parties which  is to  be inferred  from the circumstances of
each case.  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
grant amounts  to a  lease or  a licence,  it is  essential,
therefore, to  look to	the substance  and  essence  of	 the
agreement and not to its form. We are fortified in this view
by the	decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1719430/" id="a_58">Associated Hotels of India
Ltd. v.	 R. N. Kapoor</a> where Subba Rao, J. (with whom Das, J.
agreed) observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "If a  document gives  only a right to use the property
     in a  particular way  or under  certain terms  while it
     remains in possession and control of the owner thereof,
     it will  be a licence. The legal possession, therefore,
     continues to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">666</span>
     with the  owner of	 the property,	but the	 licensee is
     permitted to  make use of the premises for a particular
     purpose. But  for the  permission, his occupation would
     be unlawful.  It does  not create	in  his	 favour	 any
     estate or interest in the property. There is therefore,
     clear  distinction	  between  the	 two  concepts.	 The
     dividing line is clear though sometimes it becomes very
     thin or  even blurred.  At one time it was thought that
     the test  of exclusive possession was infallible and if
     a person  was given exclusive possession of a premises,
     it would  conclusively establish  that he was a lessee.
     But there was a change and the recent trend of judicial
     opinion is reflected in Errington v. Errington [1952] 1
     All ER 149, wherein Lord Denning reviewing the case law
     on the  subject summarizes the result of his discussion
     thus at p. 155:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	  "The result of all these cases is that, although a
     person who	 is let	 into exclusive possession is, prima
     facie, to	be considered  to be tenant, nevertheless he
     will not be held to be so if the circumstances negative
     any intention to create a tenancy."
	  The Court of Appeal again in Cobb v. Lane [1952] I
     All ER  1199, considered  the legal  position and	laid
     down that	the intention  of the  parties was  the real
     test for  ascertaining the	 character of a document. At
     p. 1201, Somervell L.J., stated:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	  "..... The  solution that  would seem to have been
     found is,	one would expect, that it must depend on the
     intention of the parties".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  Denning L.J.	said much  to the  same effect at p.
     1202:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  "The	question  in  all  these  cases	 is  one  of
     intention: Did the circumstances and the conduct of the
     parties show  that all  that was  intended was that the
     occupier should  have  a  personal	 privilege  with  no
     interest in the land?"
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  The  following  propositions	may,  therefore,  be
     taken as  well-established: (1)  To ascertain whether a
     document creates  a licence  or lease, the substance of
     the document  must be  preferred to  the form:  (2) the
     real test	is the intention of the parties-whether they
     intended to  create a  lease or  a licence;  (3) if the
     document creates  an interest  in the property, it is a
     lease; but,  if it	 only permits another to make use of
     the property,  of which  the legal possession continues
     with the  owner, it  is a licence; and (4) if under the
     document a	 party	gets  exclusive	 possession  of	 the
     property, 'prima  facie'  he  is  considered  to  be  a
     tenant, but  circumstances	 may  be  established  which
     negative the intention to create a lease."</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">     The crucial  tests to  be	employed  in  cases  of	 the
present nature can be gathered from the observations made by
Lord Shaw  while delivering  the judgment  of the  Board  in
Kauri Timber Company Limited v.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">667</span>
<p id="p_19">The   Commissioner   of	  Taxes(1).   According	  to   those
observations, in  order, an agreement can be said to partake
of the	character of lease, it is necessary that the grantee
should have  obtained an interest in and possession of land.
If the	contract does not create an interest in land then to
use the	 words	of  Lord  Coleridge,  C.J.  in	Marshall  v.
Green(2) the land would be considered as a mere warehouse of
the thing  sold and  the contract  would be  a contract	 for
goods.
</p><p id="p_20">     For  the	purpose,  therefore,   of  ascertaining	 the
intention of  the parties  and finding	out the character of
the agreements	in question,  it is  necessary to notice the
salient	 features  of  the  agreements.	 The  first  salient
feature of  the agreements  is that  they were	for a  short
duration of nine to ten months. The second important feature
of the	agreements is that they did not create any estate or
interest  in   land.  The   third  salient  feature  of	 the
agreements  is	 that  the   respondents  were	not  granted
exclusive possession and control of the land but were merely
granted the  right to pluck, cut, carry away and appropriate
the forest produce that might have been existing at the time
of the	contract or  which might  have come  into  existence
during the  short period  of the currency of the agreements.
The right  to go  on the land was only ancillary to the real
purpose	 of  the  contract.  Thus  the	acquisition  by	 the
respondents not	 being an  interest in the soil but merely a
right to  cut the  fructus naturales,  we are clearly of the
view  that   the  agreements   in  question   possessed	 the
characteristics of  licences and did not amount to leases so
as to  attract the  applicability of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_59">Article 31(c)</a>  of	 the
<a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_60">Stamp Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_21">     The conclusion arrived at by us gains strength from the
judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/258864/" id="a_61">Firm Chhotabhai Jethabai Patel and
Co. &amp;  Ors. v.	The State  of Madhya Pradesh</a> where contracts
and agreements	entered into  by person	 with  the  previous
proprietors of certain estates and mahals in the State under
which they  acquired the  rights to pluck, collect and carry
away tendu  leaves, to	cultivate, culture  and acquire lac,
and to	cut and carry away teak and timber and miscellaneous
species of  trees called  hardwood and	bamboos were held in
essence and effect to be licences.
</p><p id="p_22">     There is, of course a judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/12663/" id="a_62">Mahadeo
v. State  of Bombay</a>(4)	where seemingly a somewhat different
view was  expressed but	 the facts  of that  case were quite
distinguishable. In  that case	apart from the bare right to
take the  leaves of tendu trees, there were further benefits
including the  right to	 occupy the land, to erect buildings
and to	take  away  other  forest  produce  not	 necessarily
standing timber,  growing crop	or grass and the rights were
spread over many years.
</p><p id="p_23">     For the  foreging reasons, the first question has to be
decided in favour of the respondents.
</p><p id="p_24">     The second	 question that	falls for  consideration  is
whether the  respondents could be validly called upon to pay
the sales tax. For
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">668</span>
the decision  of this question, it is necessary to examine a
few provisions	of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act,
1957. The  charging section  is <a href="/doc/24401139/" id="a_63">section 5</a> which in so far as
it is relevant for the purpose of these appeals runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "5. Levy  of tax  on Sales or Purchases of Goods:-
     (1) Every	dealer (other  than a  casual trader  and an
     agent of  a non-resident  dealer) whose  total turnover
     for a  year is not less than Rs. 25,000 and every agent
     of a  nonresident dealer  whatever be  his turnover for
     the year, shall pay a tax for each year, at the rate of
     four paise on every rupee of his turnover:
	  "Every casual	 trader shall  pay a tax at the rate
     of four paise on every rupee of his turnover:
	  Provided that	 a dealer in jaggery shall pay a tax
     at the  rate of  two paise on every rupee upto the 31st
     March 1966	 and at	 the rate  of three  paise on  every
     rupee on  and from the 1st April 1966, of his turn-over
     irrespective of the quantum of turnover".</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">     The term  'dealer' has  been defined in <a href="/doc/30073236/" id="a_64">section 2(e)</a> of
the Act as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "dealer" means  any  person  who  carries  on	 the
     business of  buying, selling, supplying or distributing
     goods, directly  or otherwise, whether for cash, or for

     other valuable  consideration,  and  includes  (i)	 the
     Central   Government,   a	 State	 Government,   local
     authority, a  company, a  Hindu undivided family or any
     society (including	 a co-operative society), club, firm
     or association which carries on such business ......"</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">     The term  'business' has been defined in <a href="/doc/30073236/" id="a_65">section 2(bbb)</a>
of the Act as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  " 'business'	includes-(i) any trade, commerce, or
     manufacture or  any adventure  or concern in the nature
     of trade, commerce or manufacturing whether or not with
     trade,  commerce,	manufacture,  adventure	 concern  is

	  'Sale' is defined in <a href="/doc/30073236/" id="a_66">section 2(n)</a> thus:
	  'Sale' with  all its	grammatical  variations	 and
     cognate  expressions   means  every   transfer  of	 the
     property in  goods by  one person	to  another  in	 the
     course of	trade or business, for cash, or for deferred
     payment, or  for any  other valuable consideration, and

     transfer of  such materials  can be  separated from the
     contract for  the services	 and the work done, although
     the two  contracts are embodied in a single document or
     in the  supply or	distribution of	 goods by  a society
     (including	 a  co-operative  society),  club,  firm  or
     association to  its members,  but does  not  include  a
     mortgage, hypothecation  or pledge	 of, or a charge on,
     goods".</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">     In order  that the	 sales tax  should be payable by the
respondents in	accordance with	 the obligation	 imposed  on
them by clause (23) of the sale notice, it is necessary that
the Government	of Andhra  Pradesh should have been carrying
on the	business of  selling the forest produce. <a href="/doc/1535888/" id="a_67">In State of
Gujarat v.  Raipur Manufacturing  Co. Ltd</a>., this court while
examining the  term 'business'	in another  context observed
that 'whether  a person	 carries on business in a particular
commodity must depend upon the volume, frequency, continuity
and regularity	of transactions	 of purchase  and sale	in a
class of  goods and  the  transactions	must  ordinarily  be
entered into with a profit motive. The Court further went on
to observe  that when  a subsidiary product is turned out in
the factory  of the  assessee regularly and continuously and
it is being sold from time to time, an intention to carry on
business in such product may be reasonably attributed to the
assessee. As  the consideration	 of profit  motive cannot be
regarded an  essential constituent of the term 'business' in
view of	 the amendment	introduced in  the definition of the
term 'dealer'  in 1966,	 what we  are left  to	consider  is
whether the  other ingredients	of the	term 'business' viz.
volume, frequency, continuity and regularity of transactions
of sale and purchase are satisfied in the instant cases. The
auctions of  the forest	 produce by the Government of Andhra
Pradesh are  admittedly carried	 on only annually and not at
frequent intervals.  Thus the important element of frequency
being lacking  in the  instant cases, it cannot be held that
the said  Government was carrying on the business of sale of
forest produce.	 In P.	T. C. C. S. Merchants Union v. State
of A.P.	 where a  person who  grew agricultural products and
incidentally sold  the same,  it was  held that no sales tax
was payable  as it could not be said that the person carried
on  business.	A  similar   view  was	 expressed  in	<a href="/doc/390570/" id="a_68">Raja
Bhairabendra v.	 Superintendent of  Taxes</a> where standing sal
trees grown  spontaneously in his Zamindari were sold by the
Zamindar by  auction and  the purchasers  were permitted  to
fell  the  trees  and  sell  them  after  sawing  and  other
processes.
</p><p id="p_28">     <a href="/doc/430310/" id="a_69">In Orient	Paper Mills  Ltd. v.  The  State  of  Madhya
Pradesh &amp;  Ors</a>. it was held that the State Government or the
forest department  could not,  merely by  selling the forest
produce grown  on their land, be regarded as carrying on any
business of buying, selling, supplying or distributing goods
and therefore  in respect  of mere  sales of forest produce,
neither the State Government nor the forest department was a
dealer within  the meaning of the definition in section 2(d)
of  the	  M.P.	General	 Sales	Tax  Act,  1958.  <a href="/doc/1664924/" id="a_70">In  Deputy
Commissioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">670</span>
of  Agricultural   Income-tax  and   Sales  Tax,  Quilon  v.
Travancore Rubber  and Tea  Co. and  Deputy Commissioner  of
Agricultural Income-tax</a>	 and Sales  Tax, Quilon	 v.  Midland
Rubber and  Produce Co. Lt. where the only facts established
were that  the assessee	 converted the latex tapped from its
rubber trees into sheets and effected a sale of those sheets
to its customers and the conversion of latex into sheets was
a process  essential for  the transport and marketing of the
produce, it  was held  that the department had not been able
to discharge  the onus	of proving  that  the  assessee	 was
carrying on business and was, therefore, a dealer within the
meaning of  <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_71">section 2(b)</a> of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.
<a href="/doc/1210354/" id="a_72">In Ramakrishna	Deo v.	The Collector  of Sales	 Tax, Orissa</a>
where Maharaja	of Jeypore  had sold  the sal trees from his
forest for preparing sleepers, it was held that he was not a
dealer within  the meaning  of the Orissa Act because he was
not carrying  on the  business of  selling or  supplying the
goods for  the reason  that the	 element of purchase, one of
the necessary ingredients of the business was absent.
</p><p id="p_29">     In view  of the foregoing discussion, we find ourselves
unable to  hold that  the Government  of Andhra	 Pradesh  by
holding auction of forest produce carried on business in the
sale of	 that class of goods. As such, the respondents could
not be made liable to pay the sales tax.
</p><p id="p_30">     There now	remains	 for  consideration  only  the	last
question as  to whether	 the security  deposits made  by the
respondents were  in the  nature of  mortgages so as to make
the respondents	 liable to  pay the stamp duty under <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_73">Article
35(c)</a> of  the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_74">Stamp  Act</a>.  For	the  determination  of	this
question, it  is necessary  to scrutinize  the definition of
'mortgage deed'	 as contained  in <a href="/doc/13922401/" id="a_75">section 2(17)</a> of the Stamp
Act which runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  "2(17). Mortgage-deed	 includes  every  instrument
     whereby, for the purpose of securing money advanced, or
     to be  advanced, by  way of  loan, or  an	existing  or
     future debt,  or the  performance of an engagement, one
     person transfers,	or creates  to,	 or  in	 favour	 of,
     another, a	 right	over  or  in  respect  of  specified
     property".</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">     A bare  perusal of	 the above definition makes it clear
that in	 order that  an instrument  should fall	 within	 the
above definition, it is necessary that the instrument should
satisfy the essential conditions by creating a right over or
in respect  of a  specified property  in favour	 of  another
person.
</p><p id="p_32">     Bearing  in   mind	 the   above   mentioned   essential
requisites of  a deed of mortgage let us examine clause (17)
of the	sale notice  to which  alone our  attention has been
invited. Clause (17) runs thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	  "Earnest money  deposit to be returned-The earnest
     money deposits  of all  bidders  except  those  of	 the
     successful	 bidders  collected  at	 the  time  of	sale
     according to condition 5 above, will be returned to the
     depositors, on the conclusion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">671</span>
     of the  sales provided  that the officer conducting the
     sale, may	if he  considers it  advisable,	 retain	 the
     deposits of any bidders".</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">     There is  nothing in  the above clause to indicate that
any right  over or  in the  security deposits was created in
favour of the State Government.
</p><p id="p_34">     In Reference  under <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_76">Stamp	Act</a>, <a href="/doc/72660593/" id="a_77">section  46(1)</a> where  a
licence issued to an arrack renter expressly required as one
of its	conditions that	 the licensee  should deposit  a sum
equal to  three months'	 rental as  a security	for the	 due
performance of	the contract  and the  licensee	 executed  a
muchalka stating  that	he  agreed  to	all  the  terms	 and
conditions mentioned  in  the  licence,	 it  was  held	that
neither the  licence nor  the muchalka	taken separately  or
together fulfilled  the conditions  of a mortgage as defined
in the	<a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_78">Stamp Act</a>  i.e., neither thereby actually created an
interest in the deposit in favour of the Government.
</p><p id="p_35">     In Rishidev  Sondhi v.  Dhampur Sugar Mills it was held
that an	 instrument in which specific sums have been offered
as security  is not  a mortgage	 deed within  the meaning of
<a href="/doc/13922401/" id="a_79">section 2(17)</a> as money is not `specified property'.
</p><p id="p_36">     In view  of the  above we	have no manner of doubt that
