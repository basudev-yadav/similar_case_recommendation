JUDGMENT


PATTANAIK, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	I have my respectful concurrence with the conclusions
and directions in the judgment of Brother Bharucha, J.	I  am
conscious of the fact that plurality of judgments should
ordinarily be avoided.	But, having regard to the importance
of the question involved, and the enormity of the
consequences, if the contentions of Respondent No. 2  are
accepted, I consider it appropriate to express my thoughts on
some aspects.  It is not necessary to reiterate the  facts which
have been lucidly narrated in the judgment of Brother
Bharucha,J.  The question that arises for consideration is
whether a non elected member, whose nomination for
contesting  the election to the Legislative Assembly stood
rejected,  and that order of rejection became final, not being
assailed, could still be appointed as the Chief Minister or the
Minister under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_1">Article 164</a> of the Constitution, merely
because the largest number of elected members to the
Legislative Assembly elects such person to be their leader.
Be it be stated, that the nomination of such person had been
rejected,  on the ground of disqualification incurred by such
person under <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_2">Section 8(3)</a> of the Representation of  People
Act, 1951, the said person having been convicted under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_3">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, and having
been sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years.  The main basis
of the arguments advanced by Mr. Venugopal, the learned
senior counsel, appearing for respondent no. 2, and Mr. PP
Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Tamil
Nadu, is that <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_4">Article 164</a> of the Constitution conferring
power on the Governor to appoint a person as Chief Minister,
and then appoint Ministers on the advice of such Chief
Minister, does not prescribe any qualification for being
appointed as Minister or Chief Minister, and on the other
hand, Sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_5">Article  (4)</a> of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_6">Article 164</a> enables such a Minister
to continue as a Minister for a period of six months and said
Minister ceases to be a Minister unless within that period of
six months gets himself elected as a member of the
Legislaure of the State.  As such, it would not be appropriate
to import the qualifications enumerated for the members of
the State Legislature under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_7">Article 173</a>, or the dis-
qualifications enumerated in respect of a person for being
chosen as or for being a member of the Legislative Assembly
under <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_8">Article 191</a> of the Constitution.	According to the
learned senior counsel, the Governor, while exercising power
under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_9">Article 164</a>, is duty bound to follow the well settled
Parliamentary convention and invites a person to be the Chief
Minister, which person commands the confidence of the
majority of the House. In other words, if a political party gets
elected to the majority of seats in a Legislative Assembly and
such elected legislatures elected a person to be their leader,
and that fact is intimated to the Governor then the Governor
is duty bound to call that person to be the Chief Minister,
irrespective of the fact whether that person does not possess
the qualifications for being a member of the Legislative
Assembly, enumerated under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_10">Article 173</a>, or is otherwise
disqualified for being chosen, or being a member of the
Legislative Assembly on account of any of the dis-
qualifications enumerated under	 <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_11">Article 191.</a>  The aforesaid
contention is based upon two reasonings.  (1) The lack of
prescription of qualification or dis-qualifications for a Chief
Minister or Minister under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_12">Article 164</a>, and  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_13">(2)</a> that in a
Parliamentary democracy the Will of the people must prevail.
Necessarily, therefore, the provisions of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_14">Article 164</a> of the
Constitution requires an indepth examination, and further the
theory that in a Parliamentary democracy, the Will of the
people must prevail under any circumstance, as propounded
by Mr. Venugopal and Mr. Rao, requires a deeper
consideration.	I would, therefore, focus my attention on the
aforesaid two issues.
</p>
<p id="p_4"> It is no doubt true, that Articles 164(1) and 164(4) do
not provide any qualification or disqualification, for being
appointed as a Chief Minister or a Minister, whereas,  <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_15">Article
173</a> prescribes the qualification for a person to be chosen to
fill a seat in the Legislature of a State.  <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_16">Article 191</a> provides
the disqualification for a person for being chosen as or being
a member of the Legislative  Assembly or Legislative
Council of a State.  In the case in hand, the respondent no. 2
was disqualified under <a href="/doc/1376064/" id="a_17">Article 191(1)(e)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_18">Section
8(3)</a> of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in as
much as the said respondent no. 2 has been convicted under
<a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_19">Section 13</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, and has been
sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 3 years, though the
execution of that sentence has been suspended by the
Appellate Court while the appeal against the conviction and
sentence is pending before the High Court of Madras.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	According to Mr. Venugopal, under the Constitution of
India,	when no qualification or disqualification exists under
<a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_20">Article 164(1)</a> or 164(4), it necessarily postulates that in the
area of constitutional governance for the limited period of six
months,	 any person could be appointed as a Chief Minister
or Minister and it would not be open to the Court to import
qualifications and disqualifications, prescribed under the
Constitution for being chosen as a member of the Legislative
Assembly.  According to the learned counsel, the reasonable
conclusion to be drawn from the aforesaid constitutional
provision is that the constitution does not contemplate the
scrutiny of the credentials of a non-member Prime Minister
or Chief Minister or Minister, as in constitutional theory it is
the House, consisting of the majority thereof which proposes
him for this transient, temporary and limited period of six
months.	 It is also contended by Mr. Venugopal that people
who are the  ultimate sovereign, express their will through
their elected representatives for selecting a non-elected
person as their leader and could be appointed as Chief
Minister and <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_21">Article 164(4)</a> unequivocally provides a period
of six months as locus poenitentia which operates as an
exception in deference to the voice of the majority of the
elected members, which in fact is the basis of a Parliamentary
Democracy.   Mr. Venugopal also urged that a
disqualification being in the nature of a penalty unless
expressly found	 to be engrafted in the constitution or in other
words, in <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_22">Article 164</a>, it would not be appropriate for the
Court to incorporate that disqualification, which is provided
for being chosen as a member of the legislative assembly into
<a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_23">Article	 164</a> and pronounce the validity of the appointment of
respondent No. 2, which has purely been made on the
strength of the voice of the majority of the elected members.
I am unable to accept these contentions of the learned
counsel, as in my considered opinion, the contentions are
based on a wrong premise.  In a Parliamentary system of
government, when political parties fight elections to the
legislative assembly or to the Parliament for being chosen as
a member after results are declared, it would be the duty of
the President in case of Parliament and the Governor in case
of Legislative Assembly of the State, to appoint the Prime
Minister or the Chief Minister, as the case may be.  When the
President appoints the Prime Minister under <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_24">Article 75</a> or the
Governor appoints a Chief Minister under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_25">Article 164</a>, the
question that weighs with  the President or the Governor is,
who will be able to provide a stable government.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Necessarily, therefore, it is the will of the majority party that
should ordinarily prevail and it is assumed that the elected
members belonging to a majority political party would elect
one amongst them to be their leader.  Constitution, however
does not prevent the elected members belonging to a political
party commanding the majority of seats in the legislative
assembly or the Parliament to elect a person who never
contested for being chosen as a member or a person who
though contested, got defeated in the election for one reason
or the other and it is in such a situation that person on being
elected as a leader of the political party commanding the
majority in the House, could be appointed as the Prime
Minister or the Chief minister.	 But the constitution certainly
does not postulate such elected representatives of the people
belonging to a political party commanding a majority in the
Parliament or the  Assembly to elect a person as their leader
so as to be called by the  President or the Governor to head
the government, who does not possess the qualification for
being chosen, to fill a seat in the Parliament or in the
legislative Assembly, as contained in Articles 84  and 173
respectively of the Constitution or who is disqualified for
being chosen as or for being a member of the House of
Parliament or the legislative Assembly, as stipulated under
Articles 102 and 191 of the Constitution respectively.	At any
rate, even if a person is elected as the leader by the elected
members of the legislative Assembly, commanding a
majority of seats in the Assembly and such person either does
not possess the qualification enumerated under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_26">Article 173</a> or
incurs disqualification for being chosen as, or for being a
member of the legislative Assembly, enumerated under
<a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_27">Article 191</a>, then the Governor would not  be bound to
respect that will of the elected members of the political party,
commanding the majority in the House, so as to appoint that
person as the Chief Minister under <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_28">Article 164(1)</a> of the
Constitution.  When <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_29">Article 164(1)</a> itself confers the
discretion on the Governor to appoint a Chief Minister at his
pleasure and when the  Governor has taken oath under
<a href="/doc/586056/" id="a_30">Article 159</a> of the Constitution to preserve, protect and
defend the Constitution and the law and shall devote himself
to the service and for the well-being of the people, it would
be against such oath, if such a person who does not possess
the qualification of being chosen as a member or has incurred
disqualification for being chosen as a member is appointed as
a Chief Minister, merely because <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_31">Article 164</a> does not
provide any qualification or disqualification for being
appointed as a Chief Minister or Minister.   It is indeed
axiomatic that the necessary qualification in <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_32">Article 173</a> and
the disqualification in <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_33">Article 191</a> proprio vigore applies to a
person for being appointed as the Chief Minister or a
Minister inasmuch as in a Parliamentary system of
government, a person is required to be chosen as a member
of the Legislative Assembly by	 the electorate of a
constituency and then would be entitled to be appointed as
the Chief Minister or a Minister on the advice of the Chief
Minister.  Non-prescribing any qualification or
disqualification under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_34">Article 164</a> for being chosen as the
Chief Minister or Minister would only enable the Governor
to appoint a person as the Chief Minister or Minister for a
limited period of six months, as contained in <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_35">Article 164(4)</a>
of the Constitution, only if such person possesses the
qualification for being chosen as a member of the legislative
Assembly, as required under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_36">Article 173</a> and is not otherwise
disqualified on account of any of the disqualifications
mentioned in <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_37">Article 191.</a>  Any other interpretation by way of
conferring an unfettered discretion on the Governor or
conferring an unfettered right on the elected members of a
political party commanding a majority in the legislative
Assembly to elect a person who does not possess the
qualifications, enumerated under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_38">Article 173</a> or who incurs
the disqualifications enumerated in <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_39">Article 191</a> would be
subversive of the constitution and would be repugnant to the
theory of good governance and would be contrary to the
constitution itself, which constitution has been  adopted,
enacted and given to the people of India by the people of
India.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	In this connection it would be appropriate to notice that
even under the Government of India Act, 1935 where
<a href="/doc/122883333/" id="a_40">Sections 51(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/122883333/" id="a_41">51(2)</a> were somewhat similar to <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_42">Article
164</a> of the Constitution, even the Joint Committee Report on
Indian Constitutional Reforms would indicate that a
disqualified person could not have been appointed as a
Minister, as is apparent from the following sentence:
</p>
<p id="p_8">	 It was, therefore, suggested to us that the
Governor ought not to be thus restricted in his
choice, and that he ought to be in a position, if the
need should arise, to select a Minister or Ministers
from persons otherwise qualified for appointment
but to whom the doubtful pleasures of
electioneering might make no appeal.
</p>

<p id="p_9">Even in the Constituent Assembly Debates when Mohd.
Tahir, an M.P. suggested an amendment to <a href="/doc/1799967/" id="a_43">Article 144(3)</a> of
the Draft Constitution, which corresponds with <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_44">Article
164(4)</a> of the Constitution to the effect:
</p>
<p id="p_10">	That a member shall, at the time of his
being chosen as such be a member of the
Legislative Assembly or the Legislative council of
the State, as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_11">and urged that it is wholly against the spirit of democracy
that a person who was not being chosen by the people of the
country, should be appointed as a Minister, Dr. Ambedkar
did not accept the amendment on the ground that tenure of a
minister must be subject to the condition of  purity of
administration and confidence of the House.  He further
stated:
</p>
<p id="p_12">It is perfectly possible to imagine that a person
who is otherwise competent to hold the post of a
Minister has been defeated in a constituency for
some reason which, although it may be perfectly
good, might have annoyed the constituency and
he might have incurred the displeasure of that
particular constituency.
</p>
<p id="p_13">If purity of administration and otherwise competence to hold
the post of Minister were the factors which weighed with the
founding fathers to allow a competent person to be appointed
as Chief Minister or a Minister for a limited period of six
months, who might have been defeated, it is difficult to
conceive that a person who is not an elected member, does
not possess even the minimum qualification for being chosen
as a member or has incurred the disqualification for being
chosen as a member could be appointed as a Chief Minister
or Minister,  on the simple ground that <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_45">Article 164</a> is quite
silent on the same and the Court cannot import anything into
the said Article.  Thus on a pure construction of provisions of
<a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_46">Article 164</a> of the Constitution, the discussions made in the
Constituent Assembly, referred to earlier, the pre-existing
pari materia provision in the Government of India Act, 1935
as well as the discussion of the Joint Committee on Indian
Constitutional Reforms referred to earlier, make it explicitly
clear that notwithstanding the fact that no qualification or
disqualification is prescribed in <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_47">Article 164(1)</a> or <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_48">Article
164(4)</a> but such qualification or disqualification provided in
Articles 173 and 191 of the Constitution for being chosen as
a member will have to be read into <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_49">Article 164</a> and so read,
respondent No. 2, who had incurred the disqualification
under <a href="/doc/1376064/" id="a_50">Article 191(1)(e)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_51">Section 8(3)</a> of the
Representation of the People Act, could not have been
appointed as the Chief Minister, whatever may be the
majority of her party members being elected to the legislative
assembly and they elected her as the leader of the party to
form the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	One ancillary argument raised by Mr. Venugopal, in this
connection requires some consideration.	  According to the
learned counsel, no adjudicatory machinery having been
provided for in <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_52">Article 164</a>, in the event the qualifications
and disqualifications prescribed for being chosen as a
member of the legislative assembly under Articles 173 and
191 are imported into <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_53">Article 164</a>, then it will be an
impossible burden for the Governor at that stage to decide the
question if the opponent raises the question of any
disqualification and no Governor can adjudicate on each one
of the disqualifications, enumerated in <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_54">Article 191</a> read with
<a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_55">Sections 8</a> to <a href="/doc/1102831/" id="a_56">11</a> of the Representation of the People Act.
According to the learned counsel, the constitution has
avowedly  not prescribed any qualification or disqualification
with regard to a non-member minister or Chief minister and
the only limitation is that such minister or Chief minister
must get elected within six months or else would cease to
become a minister.    In my considered opinion, the
appointment of a non-member as the Chief Minister or
Minister on the advice of a Chief Minister is made under
<a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_57">Article 164</a> on the Governors satisfaction.  If any of the
disqualifications mentioned in <a href="/doc/1376064/" id="a_58">Article 191(1)(e)</a> are brought
to the notice of the Governor which can be accepted without
any requirement of adjudication or if the Governor is
satisfied that the person concerned does not possess the
minimum qualification for being chosen as a member, as
contained in <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_59">Article 173</a>, then in such a case, there is no
question of an impossible burden on the Governor at that
stage and on the other hand, it would be an act on the part of
the Governor in accordance with the constitutional mandate
not to appoint such person as the Chief Minister or Minister
notwithstanding the support of the majority of the elected
members of the legislative assembly.  In a given case, if the
alleged disqualification is dependant upon the disputed
questions of fact and evidence, the Governor may choose not
to get into those disputed questions of fact and, therefore,
could appoint such person as the Chief Minister or Minister.
In such a case, Governor exercises his discretion under
<a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_60">Article 164</a> in the matter of appointment of the Chief
Minister or a Minister.	 But in a case where the
disqualification is one which is apparent as in the case in
hand namely the person concerned  has been convicted and
has been sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years
and operation of the conviction has not been stayed  and the
appeal is pending, thereby the disqualification under <a href="/doc/1376064/" id="a_61">Article
191(1)(e)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_62">Section 8(3)</a> of the Representation of the
People Act  staring at the face, the Governor would be acting
beyond his jurisdiction and against the constitutional
inhibitions and norms in appointing such a disqualified
person as the Chief Minister on the sole reasoning that the
majority of the elected members to the legislative council
have elected the person concerned to be their leader.  The
constitution does not permit brute force to impede the
constitution. The people of India  and so also the elected
members to the legislative assembly are bound by the
constitutional provisions and it would be the solemn duty of
the peoples representatives who have been elected to the
legislative assembly to uphold the constitution.  Therefore,
any act on their part, contrary to the constitution, ought not to
have weighed with the Governor in the matter of appointment
of the Chief Minister to form the Government.  In my
considered opinion, therefore, the arguments of Mr.
Venugopal, on this score cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	 One of the arguments advanced on behalf of the
respondents was the immunity  of the Governor under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_63">Article
361</a> of the constitution.  The genesis of the said arguments is
that the Governor of a State not being answerable to any
Court in  exercise of performance of the powers and duty of
his office or for any act done or purported to be done by him
in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties
and respondent No. 2 having been appointed as Chief
Minister in exercise of powers of the Governor under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_64">Article
164</a>, the said appointment as well as the exercise of discretion
by the Governor is immune from being challenged and is not
open to judicial review.  The arguments of the counsel for the
respondents is also based on the ground that any
consideration by the Court to the legality of such an
appointment is not permissible as it is a political thicket.  The
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1180101/" id="a_65">R.K. Jain vs. Union of India</a>,
1993(4) SCC 119	  has been relied upon.	 At the outset, it
may be stated that the immunity provided to the Governor
under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_66">Article 361</a> is certainly not extended to an appointee by
the Governor.  In the present proceedings, what has been
prayed for is to issue a writ of quo warranto on the averments
that respondent No. 2 was constitutionally  disqualified to
usurp the public office of the Chief Minister, who has been
usurping the said post unauthorisedly on being appointed by
the Governor.  In fact the Governor has not been arrayed as a
party respondent to the proceedings.  In the very case of R.K.
Jain, it has been held by this Court in paragraph 73 that
judicial review is concerned with whether the incumbent
possessed of qualification for appointment and the manner in
which the appointment came to be made or the procedure
adopted whether fair, just and reasonable.  It has been further
stated	in paragraph 70 of the said judgment that in a
democracy governed by rule of law surely the only
acceptable repository of absolute discretion should be the
courts.	 Judicial  review is the basic and essential feature of
the Indian constitutional scheme entrusted to the judiciary.
It is the essence of the rule of law that the exercise of the
power by the State whether it be the legislature or the
executive or any other authority, should be within the
constitutional limitation and if any practice is adopted by the
executive, which is in	violation of its constitutional
limitations, then the same could be examined by the Courts.
<a href="/doc/141126788/" id="a_67">In S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India</a>, 1994(3) SCC Page 1,
this Court held that a proclamation issued by the President on
the advice of the council of ministers	headed by the Prime
Minister is amenable to judicial review.  Even Justice
Ahmadi, as he then was, though was of the opinion that the
decision making of the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_68">Article 356</a> would not
be justiciable	but was firmly of the view that	 a proclamation
issued	by the President is amenable to judicial review.
Justice Verma and Justice Yogeshwar Dayal held that there is
no dispute that the proclamation issued	 under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_69">Article 356</a> is
subject to judicial review.  So also was the view of Justice
Sawant and Justice Kuldip Singh and Justice Pandian, where
Their Lordships have stated that the exercise of power by the
President under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_70">Article 356(1)</a> to issue Proclamation is
subject to the Judicial review at least to the extent of
examining whether the conditions precedent to the issuance
of the Proclamation have been satisfied or not.	 According to
Justice Ramaswamy, the action of the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_71">Article
356</a> is a constitutional function and the same is subject to
judicial review and   according to the learned Judge, the
question relating to the extent, scope and power of the
President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_72">Article 356</a> though wrapped up with political
thicket, per se it does not get immunity from judicial review.
According to Justice Jeevan Reddy and Agarwal, JJ, the
power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_73">Article 356(1)</a> is a conditional power and in
exercise of the power of judicial review, the court is entitled
to examine whether the condition has been satisfied or not.
But in the case in hand, when an application for issuance of a
writ of quo warranto is being examined, it is not the
Governor who is being made  amenable to answer the Court.
But it is the appointee respondent No. 2, who is duty bound
to satisfy that there has been no illegal usurpation of public
office.	 Quo warranto protects public from illegal usurpation
of public office by an individual and the necessary
ingredients to be satisfied by the Court before issuing a writ
is that the office in question must be public created by the
constitution and a person not legally qualified to hold the
office, in clear infringement of the provisions of the
constitution and the law viz. <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_74">Representation of the People
Act</a> has been usurping the same.	 If this Court ultimately
comes to the conclusion that the respondent No. 2 is
disqualified under the constitution to hold public office of the
Chief Minister, as has already been held, then the immunity
of Governor under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_75">Article 361</a> cannot stand as a bar from
issuing a writ of quo warranto.	 In the present case, it is the
State Government who has taken the positive stand that there
has been no violation of the constitutional provisions or the
violation of law in the	 appointment of respondent No. 2, as
Chief Minister, the correctness of that stand is the subject
matter of scrutiny.
</p>
<p id="p_16">		I am tempted to quote some observations of the United
States Supreme Court in the case of Lucas vs. Colorado
General Assembly 377 US 713, 12 L  ed 2d 632, 84 S Ct
1472.  It has been held in the aforesaid case:	 Manifestly,
the fact that an apportionment plan is adopted in a popular
referendum is insufficient to sustain its constitutionality or to
induce a Court of equity to refuse to act.   It has been further
held :	The protection of constitutional rights is not to be
approached either pragmatically or expediently, and though
the fact of enactment of a constitutional provision by heavy
vote of the electorate produces pause and generates restrain
we can not, true to our oath, uphold such legislation in the
face of palpable infringement of rights.  It is too clear for
argument that constitutional law is not a matter of majority
vote.  Indeed the entire philosophy of the Fourteenth
Amendment teaches that it is personal rights which are to be
protected against the will of the majority.   What has been
stated therein should more appropriately be applicable to a
case where the constitution is the supreme document which
should bind people of India as well as all other constitutional
authorities, including the Governor, and, therefore if
respondent No. 2 is found to have been appointed as the
Chief Minister, contrary to the constitutional prohibition and
prohibition under the relevant law of the <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_76">Representation of
the People Act</a>, there should be no inhibition on the Court to
issue a writ of quo warranto and the so-called immunity of
the Governor will not stand as a bar.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	According to Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel
appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu, Parliamentary
Democracy is admittedly a basic feature of the Constitution.
It would be the duty of every functionary under the
Constitution, including the Governor,  and the judiciary to
give effect to the will of the people as reflected in the
election to the Legislative Assembly of a State.  Once the
electorate has given its mandate to a political party and its
leader to run the Government of the State for a term of five
years, in the absence of any express provision in the
Constitution to the contrary, the Governor is bound to call
upon the leader of that Legislature Party, so elected by the
elected members, to form the Government.  According to Mr.
Rao, there is no express, unambiguous provision in the
Constitution or in the provisions of <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_77">Representation of People
Act</a>, declaring that a person convicted of an offence and
sentenced to imprisonment for a period not less than 2 years
by the Trial Court shall not be appointed as Chief Minister
during the pendency of the first appeal.  In such a situation,
the Governor is not expected to take a position of
confrontation with the people of the State who voted the
ruling party to power and plunge the State into a turmoil.   In
support of this contention, observation of this Court in the
case of	 <a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_78">Shamsher Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> (1974 (2) SCC
</p><p id="p_18">831), The head of the State should avoid getting involved in
politics, was pressed into service.  I am unable to persuade
myself to agree with the aforesaid submission of Mr. Rao,
inasmuch as, in my considered opinion, the people of this
country as well as their voice reflected through their elected
representatives in the Legislative Assembly, electing a
disqualified person for being chosen as a member of the
Legislative Assembly, to be their leader are as much
subservient to the Constitution of India as the Governor
himself.  In a democracy, constitutional law reflects the value
that people attach to orderly human relations, to individual
freedom under the law and to institutions such as Parliament,
political parties, free elections and a free press.  Constitution
is a document having a special legal sanctity which sets out
the frame-work and the principal functions of the organs of
government within the State and declares the principles by
which those organs must operate. Constitution refers to the
whole system of the governance of a country and the
collection of rules which establish and regulate or govern the
government.  In our country, we have a written constitution,
which	has been given by the people of India to themselves.
The said Constitution occupies the primary place.
Notwithstanding the fact, we have a written Constitution, in
course of time, a wide variety of rules and practices have
evolved which adjust operation of the Constitution to
changing conditions.  No written constitution would contain
all the detailed rules upon which the government depends.
The rules for electing the legislature are usually found not in
the written Constitution but in the statutes enacted by the
legislature within limits laid down by the Constitution.  A
Constitution is a thing antecedent to a government, and a
government or a good governance is a creature of  the
Constitution.  A documentary Constitution reflects the beliefs
and political aspirations of those who had framed it.  One of
the principle of constitutionalism is what it had developed in
the democratic traditions.  A primary function that is
assigned to the written Constitution is that of controlling the
organs of the Government.  Constitutional law pre-supposes
the existence of a State and includes those laws which
regulate the structure and function of the principal organs of
government and their relationship to each other and to the
citizens.  Where there is a written Constitution,  emphasis is
placed on the rules which it contains and on the way in which
they have been interpreted by the highest court with
constitutional jurisdiction.  Where there is a written
Constitution the legal structure of Government may assume a
wide variety of forms.	Within a federal constitution, the
tasks of government are divided into two classes, those
entrusted to the federal organs of government, and those
entrusted to the various states, regions or provinces which
make up the federation.	 But the constitutional limits bind
both the federal and state organs of government, which limits
are enforceable as a matter of law.  Many important rules of
constitutional behaviour, which are observed by the Prime
Minister and Ministers, Members of the Legislature, Judges
and Civil servants are contained neither in Acts nor in
judicial decisions.  But such rules have been nomenclatured
by the Constitutional Writers to be the rule of the positive
morality of the constitution and some times the authors
provide the name  to be the unwirtten maxims of the
constitution.	Rules of constitutional behaviour, which are
considered to be binding by and upon those who operate the
Constitution but which are not enforced by the law courts nor
by the presiding officers in the House of Parliament.  Sir Ivor
Jennings,  in his book, Law and the Constitution had stated
that constitutional conventions are  observed because of the
political difficulties which arise if they are not.  These rules
regulate the conduct of those holding public office and yet
possibly the most acute political difficulty can arise for such
a person is to be forced out of office.	 The Supreme Court of
Canada stated that the main purpose of conventions is to
ensure that legal frame work of the constitution is operated in
accordance with the prevailing constitutional values of the
period. (see (1982) 125 DLR(3d) 1, 84).	 But where the
country has a written constitution which ranks as
fundamental law, legislative or executive acts which conflicts
with the constitution must be held to be unconstitutional and
thus illegal.  The primary system of Government cannot be
explained solely in terms of legal and conventional rules.  It
depends essentially upon the political base which underlies it,
in particular on the party system around which political life is
organised.  Given the present political parties and the
electoral system, it is accepted that following a general
election, the party with a majority of seats in the State
legislature or the Parliament will form the Government.	 This
is what the Constitution postulates and permits.  But in the
matter of formation of Government if the said majority
political party elects a person as their leader, whom the
Constitution and the laws of the country disqualifies for
being chosen as a member of the Legislative Assembly, then
such an action of the majority elected member would be a
betrayal to the electorates and to the Constitution to which
they owe their existence.  In such a case, the so called will of
the people must be held to be unconstitutional and,  as such,
could not be and would not be tolerated upon.  When one
speaks of legislative supermacy and the will of the people,
the doctrine essentially consists of a rule which governs the
legal relationship between the legislature and the court, but
what is stated to be the legislative supermacy in the United
Kingdom has no application in our country with a written
Constitution limiting the extent of such supermacy of the
Legislature or Parliament.  In other words, the people of the
country, the organs of the Government, legislature, executive
and judiciary are all bound by the Constitution which Hon.
Justice Bhagwati, J. describes in  Minerva Mills case (1980
(3) Supreme Court Cases, 625) to be  suprema lex or the
paramount  law of the land  and nobody is above or beyond
the Constitution.  When Court has been	ascribed  the duty of
interpreting the Constitution and when Court finds that
manifestly there is an unauthorised exercise of power under
the Constitution, it would be the solemn duty of the Court to
intervene.  The doctrine of legislative supermacy
distinguishes the United Kingdom from those countries in
which they have a written constitution, like India, which
imposes limits upon the legislature and entrust the ordinary
courts or a constitutional court with the function of deciding
whether the acts of the legislature are in accordance with the
Constitution.  This being the position, the action of the
majority of the elected members of a political party in
choosing their leader to head the Government, if found to be
contrary to the Constitution and the laws of the land then the
Constitution and the laws must prevail over such
unconstitutional decision, and the argument of Mr. Rao, that
the will of the people would prevail must give way.  In a
democratic society there are important reasons for obeying
the law, which do not exist in other forms of government.
Our political system still is not perfect and there are always
the scope for many legislative reforms to be made.  But the
maintenance of life in modern society requires a willingness
from most citizens for most of the time to observe laws, even
when individually  they may not agree with them.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	In the aforesaid premises, and in view of the
conclusions already arrived at, with regard to the dis-
qualifications the  respondent no. 2 had incurred, which
prevents her for not being chosen as a member of the
Legislative Assembly, it would be a blatant violation of
Constitutional laws to allow her to be continued as the Chief
Minister of a State, howsoever short the period may be, on
the theory that the majority of the elected members of the
Legislative Assembly have elected her as the leader and that
is the expression of the will of the people.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	One  other thing which I would like to notice, is the
consciousness of the people who brought such Public Interest
Litigation to the Court.  Mr. Diwan in course of his
arguments, had raised some submissions on the subject -
Criminalisation of Politics and participation of criminals in
the electoral process as candidates and in that connection, he
had brought to our notice the order of the Election
Commission of India dated 28th of August, 1997.	 But for
answering the essential issue before us, it was not necessary
to delve into that matter and, therefore, we have not made an
in-depth inquiry into the subject.   In	 one of the speeches by
the Prime Minister of India on the subject- Whither
Accountability, published in the Pioneer, Shri Atal Bihari
Vajpayee had called for a national debate on all the possible
alternatives for systematic changes to cleanse our democratic
governing system of its present mess.  He has expressed his
dissatisfaction that neither Parliament nor the State Vidhan
Sabhas are doing with any degree of competence or
commitment what they are primarily meant to do: Legislative
function.  According to him, barring exceptions, those who
get elected to these democratic institutions are neither
trained, formally or informally, in law-making nor do they
seem to have an inclination to develop the necessary
knowledge and competence in their profession.  He has
further indicated that those individuals in society who are
generally interested in serving the electorate and performing
legislative functions are finding it increasingly difficult to
succeed in todays electoral system and the electoral system
has been almost totally subverted by money power, muscle
power, and vote bank considerations of castes and
communities.  Shri Vajpayee also had indicated that the
corruption in the governing structures has, therefore,
corroded the very core of elective democracy.	According to
him, the certainty of scope of corruption in the governing
structure has hightened opportunism and unscrupulousness
among political parties, causing them to marry and divorce
one another at will, seek opportunistic alliances and
coalitions often without the popular mandate.  Yet they
capture and survive in	power due to inherent systematic
flaws.	He further stated casteism, corruption and
politicisation have eroded the integrity and efficacy of our
civil service structure also.  The manifestoes, policies,
programmes of the political parties have lost meaning in the
present system of governance due to lack of accountability.
Lot of arguments had been advanced both by Mr. Venugopal
and Mr. Rao, on the ground that so far as the offences under
<a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_79">Section 8(3)</a> of the Representation of the People Act are
concerned, mere conviction itself will not incur the
disqualification, but conviction and sentence for not less than
two years would disqualify a person and, therefore, in such a
case, a person even being convicted of an offence under the
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_80">Prevention of Corruption  Act</a>, will not be disqualified, if the
trying Judge imposes the punishment of imprisonment for a
term of one year, which is the minimum under <a href="/doc/1987373/" id="a_81">Section 13(2)</a>
of the prevention of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_82">Corruption Act</a> and thus less than two
years, which is the minimum sentence required under <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_83">Section
8(3)</a> of the Representation of the People Act,  to disqualify a
person for being chosen as a member or continuing as a
member.	  As has been discussed in the Judgment of Brother
Bharucha, J, the validity of providing different punishments
under different sub-sections of <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_84">Section 8</a>, has already been
upheld by this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/298453/" id="a_85">Raghbir Singh vs. Surjit
Singh</a>, 1994 Supp.(3) S.C.C. 162.  But having regard to the
mass scale corruption which has corroded the core of elective
democracy, it is high time for the Parliament to consider the
question of bringing the conviction under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_86">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a>, as a disqualification under <a href="/doc/1130867/" id="a_87">Section 8(1)</a> of
the Representation of the People Act, 1951,  so that a person
on being convicted of an offence, punishable under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_88">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, could be
disqualified for being chosen, as a member or being
continuing as a member of the Legislative Assembly or the
Parliament.  I hope and trust, our representatives in the
Parliament will bestow due thought over this issue.

</p>
<p id="p_23">	Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_24">	A question of great constitutional importance arises in these
matters, namely, whether a person who has been convicted of a
criminal offence and whose conviction has not been suspended
pending appeal can be sworn in and can continue to function as the
Chief Minister of a State.
</p>
<p id="p_25">The second respondent, Ms. J. Jayalalitha, was Chief Minister
of the State of Tamil Nadu between 1991 and 1996.  In respect of that
tenure in office she was (in CC 4 of 1997 and CC 13 of 1997)
convicted for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_89">Section 120B</a> of the Indian
Penal Code read with <a href="/doc/529970/" id="a_90">Sections 13(1)(c)</a>, <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_91">13(1)(d)</a> and <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_92">13(2)</a> of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and for the offence under <a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_93">Section
409</a> of the Indian Penal Code.  She w as sentenced to undergo  3
years rigorous imprisonment and pay a fine of Rs.10,000	 in the first
case and to undergo 2 years rigorous imprisonment and pay a  fine of
Rs.5000	 in the second case.
</p>
<p id="p_26">The fine that was imposed in both cases was paid.
</p>
<p id="p_27">The second respondent preferred appeals against her conviction
before the High Court at Madras.  The appeals are pending.  On
applications filed by her in the two appeals, the High Court, by an
order dated 3rd November, 2000, suspended the sentences of
imprisonment under <a href="/doc/579488/" id="a_94">Section 389(3)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
and directed the release of respondent No.2 on bail on the terms and
conditions specified in that order.  Thereafter, she filed petitions in the
two appeals seeking the stay of the operation of the judgments in the
two criminal cases.  On 14th April, 2001 a learned Single Judge of the
High Court at Madras, Mr.Justice Malai Subramanium, dismissed
these petitions since the   convictions were, inter alia, for offences
under <a href="/doc/529970/" id="a_95">Section 13(1)(c)</a> and <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_96">13(1)(d)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988.  These orders were not challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_28">In April, 2001 the second respondent filed nomination papers
for four constituencies in respect of the general election to be held to
the Tamil Nadu Assembly.  On 24th April, 2001 three nomination
papers were rejected on account of her disqualification under <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_97">Section
8(3)</a> of the Representation of the People Act, 1951,  by reason of her
conviction and sentence in the two criminal cases.  The fourth
nomination paper was rejected for the reason that she had filed her
nomination for more than two seats. The correctness of the orders of
rejection was not called in question.
</p>
<p id="p_29">  On 13th May, 2001  the results of the election to the Tamil
Nadu Assembly were announced and the AIADMK party, which had
projected the second respondent as its Chief Ministerial nominee, won
by a large majority.  On 14th May, 2001, consequent upon the result of
the election, the AIADMK  elected the second respondent as its
leader.
</p>
<p id="p_30">On 14th May, 2001 the second respondent was sworn in as
Chief Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu.
</p>
<p id="p_31">These writ petitions and appeal contend that the second
respondent could not in law have been sworn in as Chief Minister and
cannot continue to function as such.  They seek directions in the
nature of quo warranto against her.
</p>
<p id="p_32">The provisions of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_98">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988,  that
are relevant to the second respondents conviction and sentence read
thus :
</p><p id="p_33">13. Criminal misconduct by a public servant

conviction and sentence, reads thus :

<p id="p_91">	Central to the controversy herein is <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_144">Article 164</a>, with special
reference to sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_145">Article (4)</a> thereof. This Court has considered its
import	in a number of decisions.  In Har Sharan Verma Vs. Shri
Tribhuvan Narain Singh, Chief Minister, U.P. and Another [1971 (1)
SCC 616], a Constitution Bench rendered the decision in connection
with the appointment of the first respondent therein as Chief Minister
of Uttar Pradesh at a time when he was not a member of either House
of the Legislature of that State.  The Court said :
</p>
<p id="p_92">3.   It seems to us that clause (4) of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_146">Article 164</a>
must be interpreted in the context of Articles 163
and 164 of the Constitution.  <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_147">Article 163(1)</a>
provides that there shall be a Council of Ministers
with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and
advise the Governor in the exercise of his
functions, except in so far as he is by or under this
Constitution required to exercise his functions or
any of them in his discretion.	Under clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_148">Article 164</a>, the Chief Minister has to be appointed
by the Governor and the other Ministers have to be
appointed by him on the advice of the Chief
Minister.  They all hold office during the pleasure
of the Governor.  Clause (1) does not provide any
qualification for the person to be selected by the
Governor as the Chief Minister or Minister, but
clause (2) makes it essential that the Council of
Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the
Legislative Assembly of the State.  This is the only
condition that the Constitution prescribes in this
behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_93">6.   It seems to us that in the context of the other
provisions of the Constitution referred to above
there is no reason why the plain words of clause
(4) of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_149">Article 164</a> should be cut down in any
manner and confined to a case where a Minister
loses for some reason his seat in the Legislature of
the State.  We are  assured that the meaning we
have given to clause (4) of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_150">Article 164</a> is the
correct one from the proceedings of the
Constituent Assembly and the position as it obtains
is England, Australia and South Africa.
</p>
<p id="p_94">The Court set out the position as it obtained in England, Australia and
South Africa and observed that this showed that <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_151">Article 164(4)</a> had
an ancient lineage.
</p>
<p id="p_95">In Har Sharan Verma Vs. State of U.P. and Another [ 1985 (2)
SCC 48], a two Judge Bench of this Court considered a writ petition
for the issuance of a writ in the nature of quo warranto to  one K.P.
Tewari, who had been appointed as a Minister of the Government of
Uttar Pradesh even though he was not a member of either House of the
State Legislature.  Reliance was placed upon the earlier judgment in
the case  of  Tribhuvan Narain Singh	and it was held that no material
change had been brought about by reason of the amendment of <a href="/doc/329930/" id="a_152">Article
173(a)</a> in the legal position that a person who was not a member	 of
the  State  Legislature might be appointed a Minister, subject to
<a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_153">Article 164(4)</a> which said that a Minister who for any period of six
consecutive months was not a member of the State Legislature would
at the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister.
</p>
<p id="p_96">	Another two Judge Bench of this Court in Harsharan Verma Vs.
Union of India and Another [1987 (Supp.) SCC 310] considered the
question in the context of membership of Parliament and <a href="/doc/206550/" id="a_154">Article
75(5</a>), which is similar in terms to <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_155">Article 164(4).</a>  The Court said that
a person who was not a member of the either House of Parliament
could be a Minister for not  more than six months; though he would
not have any right to vote, he would be entitled, by virtue of <a href="/doc/453721/" id="a_156">Article
88</a>, to participate in the proceedings of Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_97">	In S.P. Anand, Indore Vs. H.D. Deve Gowda and Others [1996
(6) SCC 734], the first respondent, who was not a member of
Parliament, was sworn in as  Prime Minister.  This was challenged in a
writ petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_157">Article 32.</a>	 Reference was made to the earlier
judgments.  It was held, on a parity of reasoning if a person who is
not a member of the State Legislature can be appointed a Chief
Minister of a State under <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_158">Article 164(4)</a> for six months,  a person who
is not a member of either House of Parliament can be appointed Prime
Minister for the same period.
</p>
<p id="p_98">	In S.R. Chaudhuri Vs. State of Punjab &amp; Ors. [2001 (5) SCALE
269], one Tej Parkash Singh was appointed a Minister of the State of
Punjab on the advice of the Chief Minister, Sardar Harcharan Singh
Barar.	At the time of his appointment as a Minister Tej Parkash Singh
was not a member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly.  He was not
elected as a member of that Assembly within a period of six months
and he submitted his resignation.  During the same legislative term
Sardar Harcharan Singh Barar was replaced as Chief Minister by Smt.
Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.	On her advice, Tej Parkash Singh was
appointed a Minister yet again.	 The appointment was challenged by a
writ petition in the High Court seeking a writ of  quo warranto. The
writ petition was dismissed in limine and an appeal was filed by the
writ petitioner in this Court.	The judgments aforementioned were
referred to by this Court  and it was said :
</p>
<p id="p_99">17.  The absence of the expression from amongst
members of the legislature in <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_159">Article 164 (1)</a> is
indicative of the position that whereas under that
provision a non-legislator can be appointed as a
Chief Minister or a Minister but that appointment
would be governed by <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_160">Article 164(4</a>), which places
a restriction on such a non-member to continue as
a Minister or the Chief Minister, as the case may
be, unless he can get himself elected to the
Legislature within the period of six consecutive
months from the date of his appointment.  <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_161">Article
164(4)</a> is, therefore, not a source of power or an
enabling provision for appointment of a non-
legislator as a Minister even for a short duration.  It
is actually in the nature of a disqualification or
restriction for a non-member who has been
appointed as a Chief Minister or a Minister, as the
case may be, to continue in office without getting
himself elected within a period of six consecutive
months.
</p>
<p id="p_100">The Court said that in England the position was this :
In the Westminster system, it is an established
convention that Parliament maintains its position
as controller of the executive.	 By a well settled
convention, it is the person who can rely on
support of a majority in the House of Commons,
who forms a government and is appointed as the
Prime Minister.	 Generally speaking he and his
Ministers must invariably all be Members of
Parliament (House of Lords or House of
Commons) and they are answerable to it for their
actions and policies.  Appointment of a non-
member as a Minister is a rare exception and if it
happens it is for a short duration.  Either the
individual concerned gets elected or is conferred
life peerage.
</p>
<p id="p_101">The Court noted the constitutional scheme that provided for a
democratic parliamentary  form of Government, which envisaged the
representation of the people, responsible Government and the
accountability of the Council of Ministers to the legislature.	Thus was
drawn a direct line of authority from the people through the legislature
to the executive.  The position in England, Australia and Canada
showed that the essentials of a system of representative Government,
like the one in India, were that, invariably, all Ministers were chosen
out of the members of the legislature and only in rare cases was a non-
member appointed a Minister and he had to get himself returned to the
legislature by direct or indirect election within a short period.  The
framers of the Constitution had not visualised that a non-legislator
could be repeatedly appointed a Minister, for a term of six months
each,  without getting elected because such a course struck at the very
root of parliamentary democracy.  It was accordingly held that the
appointment of Tej Parkash Singh as a Minister for a second time was
invalid and unconstitutional.
</p>
<p id="p_102">Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned counsel for the second
respondent, was right when he submitted that the question that arises
before us has not, heretofore, arisen before the courts.  This is for the
reason that, heretofore, so far as is known, no one who was ineligible
to become a member of the legislature has been made a Minister.
Certainly, no one who has earned a conviction and sentence covered
by <a href="/doc/733974/" id="a_162">Section 8</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act would appear to have
been appointed Chief Minister.
</p>
<p id="p_103">To answer the question before us, three sub-Articles of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_163">Article
164</a>  need, in our view, to be read together, namely, sub-Articles
(1),(2) and (4).  By reason of sub-<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_164">Article (1</a>), the Governor is
empowered to appoint the Chief Minister; the Governor is also
empowered to appoint the other Ministers, but, in this regard, he must
act on the advice of the Chief Minister.  Sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_165">Article (2)</a> provides, as is
imperative in a representative democracy, that the Council of
Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly
of the State.  The political executive, namely, the Council of
Ministers, is thus, through the Legislative Assembly, made
representative of and accountable to the people of the State who have
elected the Legislative Assembly.  There is necessarily implicit in
these provisions the requirement that a Minister must be a member of
the Legislative Assembly and thus representative of and accountable
to the people of the State.  It is sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_166">Article (4)</a> which makes the
appointment of a person other than a member of the Legislature of the
State as a Minister permissible, but it stipulates that a Minister who for
any period of six consecutive months is not a member of the
Legislature of the State shall at the expiration of that period cease to
be a Minister.	Necessarily implicit in sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_167">Article (4)</a> read with sub-
Articles (1) and (2) is the requirement that a Minister who is not a
member of the legislature must seek election to the legislature and, in
the event of his failing to secure a seat in the legislature within six
months, he must cease to be a Minister.	 The requirement of sub-
<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_168">Article (4)</a> being such, it follows as the night the day that a person
who is appointed a Minister though he is not a member of the
legislature shall be one who can stand for election to the legislature
and satisfy the requirement of sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_169">Article (4).</a>	 In other words, he must
be one who satisfies the qualifications for membership of the
legislature contained in the Constitution (<a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_170">Article 173</a>) and is not
disqualified from seeking that membership by reason of any of the
provisions therein (<a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_171">Article 191</a>) on the date of his appointment.
</p>
<p id="p_104">The provision of sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_172">Article (4)</a> of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_173">Article 164</a> is meant to
provide for a situation where, due to political exigencies or to avail of
the services of an expert in some field, it is requisite to induct into the
Council of Ministers a person who is not then in the legislature.  That
he is not in the legislature is not made an impassable barrier.	 To that
extent we agree with Mr. Venugopal, but we cannot accept his
submission that sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_174">Article (4)</a> must be so read as to permit the
induction into the Council of Ministers of short term Ministers whose
term would not extend beyond six months and who, therefore, were
not required to have the qualifications and be free of the
disqualifications contained in Articles 173 and 191 respectively.  What
sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_175">Article (4)</a> does is to give a non-legislator appointed Minister six
months to become a member of the legislature.  Necessarily, therefore,
that non-legislator must be one who, when he is appointed, is not
debarred from obtaining membership of the legislature : he must be
one who is qualified to stand for the legislature and is not disqualified
to do so.  Sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_176">Article (4)</a> is not intended for the induction into the
Council of Ministers of someone for six months or less so that it is of
no consequence that he is ineligible to stand for the legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_105">It would be unreasonable and anomalous to conclude that a
Minister who is a member of the legislature is required to meet the
constitutional standards of qualification and disqualification but that a
Minister who is not a member of the legislature need not.  Logically,
the standards expected of a Minister who is not a member should be
the same as, if not greater than, those required of a member.
</p>
<p id="p_106">The Constituent Assembly Debates (Volume VII) note that
when the corresponding Article relating to Members of Parliament
was being discussed by the Constituent Assembly,  Dr. B.R.
Ambedkar said:
</p>
<p id="p_107">.. The first amendment is by Mr. Mohd.
</p><p id="p_108">Tahir.	His suggestion is that no person should be
appointed a minister unless at the time of his
appointment he is an elected member of the House.
He does not admit the possibility of the cases
covered in the proviso, namely, that although a
person is not at the time of his appointment a
member of the House, he may nonetheless be
appointed as a minister in the cabinet subject to the
condition that within six months he shall get
himself elected to the House.  The second
qualification is by Prof. K.T. Shah.  He said that a
minister should belong to a majority party and his
third qualification is that he must have a certain
educational status.  Now, with regard to the first
point, namely, that no person shall be entitled to be
appointed a Minister unless he is at the time of his
appointment an elected member of the House.  I
think it forgets to take into consideration certain
important matters which cannot be overlooked.
First is this, - it is perfectly possible to imagine that
a person who is otherwise competent to hold the
post of a Minister has been defeated in a
constituency for some reason which, although it
may be perfectly good, might have annoyed the
constituency and he might have incurred the
displeasure of that particular constituency.  It is not
a reason why a member of the Cabinet on the
assumption that he shall be able to get himself
elected either from the same constituency or from
another constituency.  After all the privilege that is
permitted  is a privilege that extends only for six
months.	 It does not confer a right to that
individual to sit in the House without being elected
at all..
</p>
<p id="p_109">				       (Emphasis supplied)

	What was said by  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is self-explanatory. It
shows clearly that the Constituent Assembly envisaged that non-
legislator Ministers would have to be elected to the legislature within
six months and it proceeded on the basis that the Article as it read
required this. The manner in which we have interpreted <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_177">Article 164</a> is,
thus, borne out.
</p>
<p id="p_110">	It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that it was not
open to the Court to read into <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_178">Article 164</a> the requirement that a non-
legislator Minister must be elected to the legislature within six
months.	 No qualifications or disqualifications could, it was submitted,
be read into a constitutional provision. Reliance was placed upon
passages from the some of the judgments in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_179">His Holiness
Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru  v.	 State of Kerala</a>, [1973
(Supp.) S.C.R. 1].
</p>
<p id="p_111">What we have done is to interpret <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_180">Article 164</a> on its own
language and to read sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_181">Article (4)</a> thereof in the context of sub-
Articles (1) and (2).  In any event, it is permissible to read into sub-
<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_182">Article (4)</a> limitations based on the language of sub-Articles (1) and
(2).
</p>
<p id="p_112">A Constitution Bench in Minerva Mills Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs. Union
of India &amp; Ors. [1981 (1) SCR 206], considered in some detail the
judgment in Kesavananda Bharati. It was considering the validity of
the clauses introduced into <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_183">Article 368</a> by the Constitution (Forty-
second <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_184">Amendment) Act</a>.	They provided :
</p>
<p id="p_113">(4) No amendment of this Constitution (including
the provisions of Part III) made or purporting to
have been made under this <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_185">article (whether before
on after the commencement of section 55 of the
Constitution</a> (Forty-second Amendment) Act,
1976) shall be called in question in any court on
any ground.
</p>
<p id="p_114">(5) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared
that there shall be no limitation whatever on the
constituent power of Parliament to amend by way
of addition, variation or repeal the provisions of
this Constitution under this article.
</p>
<p id="p_115">Chandrachud, C.J. noted in his judgment that the avowed purpose
thereof was the removal of doubts.  He observed that after the
decision in Kesavananda Bharti, there could be no doubt as regards the
existence of limitations on Parliaments power to amend the
Constitution.  In the context of the constitutional history of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_186">Article
368</a>, the true object of the declaration contained in clause (5) was the
removal of those limitations.  Clause (5) conferred upon Parliament a
vast and undefined power to amend the Constitution, even so as to
distort it out of recognition.	The theme song of the Court in the
majority decision in Kesavananda Bharti had been, Amend as you
may even the solemn document which the founding fathers have
committed to your care, for you know best the needs of your
generation.  But, the Constitution is a precious heritage; therefore, you
cannot destroy its identity.  The majority judgment in Kesavananda
Bharti conceded to Parliament the right to make alterations in the
Constitution so long as they were within the basic framework.  The
Preamble assured the people of India of a polity whose basic structure
was described therein as a Sovereign Democratic Republic; Parliament
could make any amendments to the Constitution as it deemed
expedient so long as they did not damage or destroy Indias
sovereignty and its democratic, republican character.  Democracy was
a meaningful concept whose essential attributes were recited in the
Preamble itself : Justice, social, economic and political : Liberty of
thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; and Equality of status
and opportunity.  Its aim, again as set out in the Preamble, was to
promote among the people an abiding sense of Fraternity assuring the
dignity of the individual and the unity of the Nation.	The newly
introduced clause (5) demolished the very pillars on which the
Preamble rested by empowering  Parliament to exercise its constituent
power without any limitation whatever.	No constituent power could
conceivably go higher than the power conferred by clause (5) for it
empowered Parliament even to repeal the provisions of this
Constitution, that is to say, to abrogate  democracy and substitute for
it a totally antithetical form of government.  That could most
effectively be achieved, without calling  democracy by any other
name, by denial of social, economic and political justice to the people,
by emasculating liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and
worship and by abjuring commitment to the magnificient ideal of a
society of equals.  The power to destroy was not a power to
amendment.  Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending
power on  Parliament,  Parliament could not under the exercise of that
limited power enlarge that very power into an absolute power.  A
limited amending power was one of the basic features of the
Constitution and, therefore, the limitations on that power could not be
destroyed.  In other words, Parliament could not, under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_187">Article 368</a>,
expand its amending power so as to acquire for itself the right to
repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic and essential
features.  The donee of a limited power could not by the exercise of
that power convert the limited power into an unlimited one.
</p>
<p id="p_116">	All this was said in relation to the <a href="/doc/528655/" id="a_188">Article 368(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_189">(5).</a> Sub-
<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_190">Article (1)</a> read thus :
</p>
<p id="p_117">368. Power of Parliament to amend the
Constitution and procedure therefor

(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution,
Parliament may in exercise of its constituent power
amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any
provision of this Constitution in accordance with
the procedure laid down in this article.
</p>
<p id="p_118">Nothing can better demonstrate that is permissible for the Court to
read limitations into the Constitution based on its language and
scheme and its basic structure.
</p>
<p id="p_119">	We hold, therefore, that a non-legislator can be made Chief
Minister or Minister under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_191">Article 164</a> only if he has the qualifications
for membership of the legislature prescribed by <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_192">Article 173</a> and is not
disqualified from the membership thereof by reason of the
disqualifications set out in <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_193">Article 191.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_120">	The next question is : Was the second respondent qualified for
membership of the legislature and not disqualified therefor when she
was appointed Chief Minister on 14th May, 2001.
</p>
<p id="p_121">It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that the
suspension of the sentences passed against the second respondent by
the High Court at Madras was tantamount to the suspension of the
convictions against her.  Our attention was then drawn to <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_194">Section 8(3)</a>
of the Representation of the People Act, which says that a person
convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less
than two years shall be disqualified..	In learned
counsels submission, for the purposes of <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_195">Section 8(3)</a>, it was the
sentence alone which was relevant and if there were a suspension of
the sentence, there was a suspension of the disqualification.  The
sentences awarded to the second respondent having been suspended,
the disqualification under <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_196">Section 8(3)</a>, in so far as it applied to her,
was also suspended.
</p>
<p id="p_122">	<a href="/doc/985477/" id="a_197">Section 389</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the basis of
which the second respondent was released on bail by the Madras High
Court reads, so far as is relevant, as follows :
</p><p id="p_123">389. Suspension of sentence pending the appeal;
release of appellant on bail

(1) Pending any appeal by a convicted person, the
Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by
it in writing, order that the execution of the
sentence or order appealed against be suspended
and, also, if he is in confinement, that he be
released on bail, or on his own bond.
</p>
<p id="p_124">				   (Emphasis supplied)

	It is true that the order of the High Court at Madras on the
application of the second respondent states, Pending criminal appeals
the sentence of imprisonment alone is suspended and the petitioners
shall be released on bail.., but this has to be read in the
context of <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_198">Section 389</a> under which the power was exercised.  Under
<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_199">Section 389</a> an appellate court may order that the execution of the
sentence or order appealed against be suspended...  It is
not within the power of the appellate court to suspend the sentence; it
can only suspend the execution of the sentence pending the disposal of
appeal.	 The suspension of the execution of the sentence does not alter
or affect the fact that the offender has been convicted of a grave
offence and has attracted the sentence of imprisonment of not less than
two years.  The suspension of the execution of the sentences,
therefore, does not remove the disqualification against the second
respondent.  The suspension of the sentence, as the Madras High
Court erroneously called it, was in fact only the suspension of the
execution of the sentences pending the disposal of the appeals filed by
the second respondent.	The fact that she secured the suspension of the
execution of the sentences against her did not alter or affect the
convictions and the sentences imposed on her and she remained
disqualified from seeking legislative office under <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_200">Section 8(3)</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_125">In the same connection, learned counsel for the respondents
drew our attention to the judgment of a learned single Judge of the
High Court at Madras, Mr. Justice Malai Subramanium, on the
application of the second respondent for stay of the execution of the
orders of conviction against her.  The learned Judge analysed <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_201">Section
8</a> of the Representation of the People Act and came to this conclusion:
</p>
<p id="p_126">In this case, sentence of imprisonment has already
been suspended.	 Under such circumstances, in my
view, there may not be any disqualification for the
petitioner to contest in the election.
</p>
<p id="p_127">Learned counsel submitted that it was because of this conclusion that
the learned Judge had not stayed the execution of the orders, and his
conclusion bound the Governor.	In the first place, the interpretation of
the provision by the learned Judge is, as shown above, erroneous.
Secondly, the reason why he refused to stay the execution of the
orders was because the second respondent had been found guilty of
offences under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_202">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>.  Thirdly, the learned
Judge was required by the application to consider whether or not the
execution of the orders against the second respondent should be
stayed; the consideration of and conclusion upon the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_203">Section 8</a> of the Representation of the People Act was wholly
extraneous to that issue.  Fourthly, the conclusion was tentative, as
indicated by the use of the word may in the passage quoted from his
judgment above.	 Lastly, as will be shown, we are not here concerned
with what the Governor did or did not do; we are concerned with
whether the second respondent can show that she was, when she was
appointed Chief Minister, qualified to be a legislator under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_204">Article 173</a>
and not disqualified under <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_205">Article 191.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_128">	In relation to the difference in the periods of disqualification in
sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_206">Section 8</a> of the Representation of the
People Act an argument similar to that which was raised and rejected
in Raghbir Singh Vs. Surjit Singh [1994 Supp (3) SCC 162] was
advanced.  This Court there said :
</p>
<p id="p_129">5. <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_207">Section 8</a> prescribes disqualification on
conviction for certain offences.  Sub-section (1)
provides the disqualification for a period of six
years from the date of conviction for the offences
specified in clauses (a) to (i) thereof.  In sub-
section (1), the only reference is to conviction for
the specified offences irrespective of the sentence
awarded on such conviction.  Sub-section (2) then
prescribes that on conviction for the offences
specified therein and sentence to imprisonment for
not less than six months, that person shall be
disqualified from the date of such conviction and
shall continue to be disqualified for a further
period of six years since his release.	Thus, in case
of conviction for the offences specified in sub-
section (2), the disqualification is attracted only if
the sentence is of imprisonment for not less than
six months and in that event the disqualification is
for a period of not merely six years from the date
of such conviction but commencing from the date
of such conviction it shall continue for a further
period of six years since his release.	Sub-section
(3) then prescribes a similar longer period of
disqualification from the date of such conviction to
continue for a further period of six years since his
release where a person is convicted of any offence
and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than
two years, other than any offence referred to in
sub-section (1) or sub-section (2).  The
classification is clear.  This classification is made
with reference to the offences and the sentences
awarded on conviction.	In sub-section (1) are
specified the offences which are considered to be
of one category and the period of six years
disqualification from the date of conviction is
provided for them irrespective of one sentence
awarded on such conviction.  In sub-section (2) are
specified some other offences, the conviction for
which is considered significant for disqualification
only if the sentence is of imprisonment for not less
than six months and in that case a longer period of
disqualification has been considered appropriate.
Then comes sub-section (3) which is the residuary
provision of this kind wherein the disqualification
is prescribed only with reference to the period of
sentence of imprisonment of not less than two
years for which the longer period of
disqualification is considered appropriate.  The
legislature itself has classified the offences on the
basis of their nature and in the residuary provision
contained in sub-section (3), the classification is
made only with reference to the period of sentence
being not less than two years.
</p>
<p id="p_130">6. In sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_208">Section 8</a>, all persons
convicted of any offence and sentenced to
imprisonment for not less than two years [other
than any offence referred to in sub-section (1) or
sub-section (2)] are classified together and the
period of disqualification prescribed for all of them
is the same.  All persons convicted of offences
other than any offence referred to in sub-section
(1) or sub-section (3) and sentenced to
imprisonment of not less than two years constitute
one class and are governed by sub-section (3)
prescribing the same period of disqualification for
all of them.  The category of persons covered by
sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) being different and
distinct, the question of comparison inter se
between any two of these three distinct classes
does not arise.	 Without such a comparison
between persons governed by these different sub-
sections being permissible, the very basis of attack
on the ground of discrimination is not available.
Prescription of period of disqualification for
different classes of persons convicted of different
offences is within the domain of legislative
discretion and wisdom, which is not open to
judicial scrutiny.
</p>

<p id="p_131">It was pointed out by learned counsel for the respondents that
under <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_209">Section 8(3)</a> of the Representation of the People Act the
disqualification was attracted on the date on which a person was
convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less
than two years.	 It was pointed out, rightly, that the law contemplated
that the conviction and the sentence could be on different dates.  It was
submitted that it was unworkable that the disqualification should
operate from the date of conviction which could precede the date of
sentence; therefore, the conviction referred to in <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_210">Section 8(3)</a> should
be taken to be that confirmed by the appellate court because it was
only in the appellate court that conviction and sentence would be on
the same day.  We find the argument unacceptable.  In those cases
where the sentence is imposed on a day later that the date of
conviction (which, incidentally, is not the case here) the
disqualification would be attracted on the date on which the sentence
was imposed because only then would a person be both convicted of
the offence and sentenced to imprisonment for less not	that two years
which is cumulatively requisite to attract the disqualification under
<a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_211">Section 8(3)</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_132">	The focus was then turned upon <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_212">Section 8(4)</a> of the
Representation of the People Act and it was submitted that all the
disqualifications set down in <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_213">Section 8</a> would not apply until a final
court had affirmed the conviction and sentence.	 This was for the
reason that the principle underlying <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_214">Section 8(4)</a> had to be extended to
a non legislator as, otherwise, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_215">Article 14</a> would stand violated for the
presumption of innocence would apply to a sitting member till the
conviction was finally affirmed but in the case of a non-legislator the
disqualification would operate on conviction by the court of first
instance.  It was submitted that <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_216">Section 8(4)</a> had to be read down so
that its provisions were not restricted to sitting members and in all
cases the disqualification applied only when the conviction and
sentence was finally upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_133">	 <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_217">Section 8(4)</a> opens with the words Notwithstanding anything
in sub-section (1), sub-section (2) and sub-section (3), and it applies
only to sitting members of legislatures.  There is no challenge to it on
the basis that it violates <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_218">Article 14.</a>	If there were, it might be tenable
to contend that legislators stand in a class apart from non legislators,
but we need to express no final opinion.  In any case, if it were found
to be violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_219">Article 14</a>, it would be struck down in its entirety.
There would be, and is no question of so  reading it that its provisions
apply to all, legislators and non-legislators, and that, therefore, in all
cases the disqualification must await affirmation of the conviction and
sentence  by a final court.  That would be reading up the provision,
not reading down, and that is not known to the law.
</p>
<p id="p_134">	In much the same vein, it was submitted that the presumption of
innocence continued until the final judgment affirming the conviction
and sentence was passed and, therefore, no disqualification operated
as of now against the second respondent.  Before we advert to the four
judgments relied upon in support of this submission, let us clear the
air.  When a lower court convicts an accused and sentences him, the
presumption that the accused is innocent comes to an end.  The
conviction operates and the accused has to undergo the sentence.  The
execution of the sentence can be stayed by an appellate court and the
accused released on bail.  In many cases, the accused is released on
bail so that the appeal is not rendered infructuous, at least in part,
because the accused has already undergone imprisonment.	 If the
appeal of the accused succeeds the conviction is wiped out as cleanly
as if it had never existed and the sentence is set aside.  A successful
appeal means that the stigma of the offence is altogether erased.  But
that it is not to say that the presumption of innocence continues after
the conviction by the trial court.  That conviction and the sentence it
carries operate against the accused in all their rigour until set aside in
appeal, and a disqualification that attaches to the conviction and
sentence applies as well.
</p>
<p id="p_135">	Learned counsel cited from the judgment of this Court in Padam
Singh Vs. State of U.P. [2000 (1) SCC 621] the passage which reads :
It is the duty of an appellate court to look into the
evidence adduced in the case and arrive at an
independent conclusion as to whether the said
evidence can be relied upon or not and even if it
can be relied upon, then whether the prosecution
can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable
doubt on the said evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_136">					(Page 625 C)

The passage is relevant to the duty of an appeal court.	 It is the duty of
an appeal court to look at the evidence afresh to see if the case against
the accused has been established by the prosecution beyond
reasonable doubt, uninfluenced by the decision of the trial court; in
other words, to look at it as if the presumption of the innocence of the
accused still applied.	The passage does not support the proposition
canvassed.
</p>
<p id="p_137">In Maru Ram Vs. Union of India and Ors. [1981 (1) SCC 107] it
was stated :
</p>
<p id="p_138">When a person is convicted in appeal, it
follows that the appellate Court has exercised its
power in the place of the original court and the
guilt, conviction and sentence must be substituted
for and shall have retroactive effect from the date
of judgment of the trial Court.	 The appellate
conviction must relate back to the date of the trial
Courts verdict and substitute it.
</p>
<p id="p_139">There is no question of the correctness of what is set out above but it
has no application to the issue before us.  What we are concerned with
is whether, on the date on which the second respondent was sworn in
as Chief Minister, she suffered from a disqualification by reason of the
convictions and sentences against her.
</p>
<p id="p_140">	In Dilip Kumar Sharma and Others Vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh [1976 (1) SCC 560], this Court was concerned with <a href="/doc/793437/" id="a_220">Section
303</a> of the Indian Penal Code, which provided :	Whoever being
under sentence of imprisonment for life, commits murder shall be
punished with death.  Sarkaria, J., in his concurring judgment, held,
on an interpretation of the section, that once it was established that, at
the time of committing the murder, the prisoner was under a sentence
of life imprisonment, the court had no discretion but to award the
sentence of death,  notwithstanding mitigating circumstances.  The
provision was, therefore, Draconion in its severity.  It was in these
circumstances that he held that the phrase being under sentence of
imprisonment for life had to be restricted to a sentence which was
final,	conclusive and ultimate so far as judicial remedies were
concerned for the other alternative would lead to unreasonable and
unjust results.	 The observations of the learned Judge are relevant to
the case before him; they do not have wider implications and do not
mean that all convictions by a trial court do not operate until affirmed
by the highest Court.
</p>
<p id="p_141">	Lastly, in this connection, our attention was drawn to the case of
Vidya Charan Shukla Vs. Purshottam Lal Kaushik [ 1981 (2) SCC
84].  The Court held that if a successful candidate was disqualified for
being chosen, at the date of his election or at any earlier stage of any
step in the election process, on account of his conviction and sentence
exceeding two years imprisonment, but his conviction and sentence
was set aside and he was acquitted on appeal before the
pronouncement of the judgment in the election petition pending
against him, his disqualification was retrospectively annulled and the
challenge to his election on the ground that he was so disqualified was
no longer sustainable.	This case dealt with an election petition and it
must be understood in that light.  What it laid down does not have a
bearing on the question before us: the construction of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_221">Article 164</a> was
not in issue.	 There can be no doubt that in a criminal case acquittal
in appeal takes effect retrospectively and wipes out the sentence
awarded by the lower court.  This implies that the stigma attached to
the conviction and the rigour of the sentence are completely
obliterated, but that does not mean that the fact of the conviction and
sentence by the lower court is obliterated until the conviction and
sentence are set aside by an appellate court.  The conviction and
sentence stand pending the decision in the appeal and for the purposes
of a provision such as <a href="/doc/1662686/" id="a_222">Section 8</a> of the Representation of the People
Act are determinative of the disqualifications provided for therein.
</p>
<p id="p_142">	Our conclusion, therefore, is that on the date on which the
second respondent was sworn in as Chief Minister she was
disqualified, by reason of her convictions under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_223">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a> and the sentences of imprisonment of not less than two
years, for becoming a member of the legislature under <a href="/doc/1858044/" id="a_224">Section 8(3)</a> of
the Representation of the People Act.
</p>
<p id="p_143">	It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that,
even so, the court could do nothing about it.	It was submitted that in
the case of a Chief Minister or Minister appointed under <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_225">Article
164(1)</a> read with (4) the people, who were the ultimate sovereign, had
expressed their will through their elected representatives. For the
period of  six months the locus penitentiae operated as an exception,
as a result of which, for that period, the peoples will prevailed in a
true parliamentary democracy, especially as no provision was made
for adjudicating  alleged disqualifications, like the holding of an office
of profit or a subsisting contract for the supply of goods or execution
of works.  In this area of constitutional governance, for the limited
period of six months, it was not open to the court to import
qualifications and disqualifications for a minister qua minister when
none existed in <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_226">Article 164(4).</a>	 The Governor, not being armed with
the machinery for adjudicating qualifications or disqualifications, for
example, on the existence of subsisting contracts or the holding of
offices of profit, and having no power to summon witnesses or to
administer an oath or to summon documents or to	 deliver a reasoned
judgment, the appointment made by him on the basis of the
conventions of the Constitution could not be challenged in quo
warranto proceedings so that an appointment that had been made
under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_227">Article 164</a>  could not be rendered one without the authority of
law. If it did so, the court would be entering the political thicket.
When qualifications and disqualifications were prescribed for a
candidate or a member of the legislature and a machinery was
provided for the adjudication thereof, the absence of the prescription
of any qualification for a Minister or Chief Minister  appointed under
<a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_228">Article 164(1)</a> read with (4) and for adjudication thereof  meant that
the Governor had to accept the will of the people in selecting the Chief
Minister or Minister, the only consideration being whether the
political party and its leader commanded a majority in the legislature
and could provide a stable government.	Once the electorate had given
its mandate to a political party and its leader to run the government of
a State for a term of  five years, in the absence of any express
provision in the Constitution to the contrary, the Governor was bound
to call the leader of that legislature party to form the government.
There was no express, unambiguous provision in the Constitution or in
the <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_229">Representation of the People Act</a> or any decision of this Court or a
High Court declaring that a person convicted of an offence and
sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than two years by
the trial court shall not be appointed Chief Minister during the
pendency of  his first appeal. In such a situation, the Governor could
not be expected to take a position of confrontation with the people of
the State who had voted the ruling party to power and plunge the State
into  turmoil.	In the present case, the Governor was entitled to
proceed on the basis that the appeals of the second respondent having
been directed, in October, 2000, to be heard within two months, it
would be open to the second respondent to have the appeals disposed
of within the time limit of six months and, in case of an acquittal, no
question of ineligibility to contest an election within the period of six
months would arise. If the Governor invited the leader of the party
which had a majority in the legislature to form a government, it would,
if the leader was a non legislator, thereafter not to be open to the court
in quo warranto proceedings to decide that the Chief Minister was
disqualified.  Otherwise,  this would mean that when the Governor had
invited, in accordance with conventions, the leader to be Chief
Minister, in the next second  the leader would have to vacate his office
by reason of the quo warranto.	The court would then be placing itself
in a position of prominence among the three organs of the State,  as a
result of which, instead of the House deciding whether or not to
remove such a person through a motion of no confidence, the court
would take over the function, contrary to the will of the legislature
which would mean the will of the people represented by the majority
in the legislature.   In then deciding that the Chief Minister should
demit office,  the court would	be entering the political thicket,
arrogating to itself a power never intended by the Constitution, the
exercise of which would result in instability in the governance of the
State.
</p>
<p id="p_144">We are, as we have said, not concerned here with the
correctness or otherwise of the action of the Governor in swearing the
second respondent in as Chief Minister in the exercise of the
Governors discretion.
</p>
<p id="p_145"> But submissions were made by learned counsel for the
respondents in respect of the Governors powers under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_230">Article 164</a>
which call  for comment.  The submissions were that the Governor,
exercising powers under <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_231">Article 164(1)</a> read with (4), was obliged to
appoint as Chief Minister whosoever the majority party in the
legislature nominated, regardless of whether or not the person
nominated was qualified to be a member of the legislature under
<a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_232">Article 173</a> or was disqualified in that behalf under  <a href="/doc/1735861/" id="a_233">Article 191</a>, and
the only manner in which a Chief Minister who was not qualified or
who was disqualified could be removed was by a vote of no-
confidence in the legislature or by the electorate at the next elections.
To a specific query, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that
the Governor was so obliged even when the person recommended
was, to the Governors knowledge, a non-citizen, under-age, a lunatic
or an undischarged insolvent,  and the only way in which a non-citizen
or under-age or	 lunatic or insolvent Chief Minister could be removed
was by a vote of no-confidence in the legislature or at the next
election.
</p>
<p id="p_146">	The nomination to appoint a person who is a non-citizen or
under-age or a lunatic or an insolvent as Chief Minister having been
made by the majority party in the legislature, it is hardly realistic to
expect the legislature to pass a no-confidence motion against the Chief
Minister; and the election would ordinarily come after the Chief
Minister had finished his term.
</p>
<p id="p_147">	To accept learned counsels submission is to invite disaster.  As
an example, the majority party in the legislature could recommend the
appointment of a citizen of a foreign country, who would not be a
member of the legislature and who would not be qualified to be a
member thereof under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_234">Article 173</a>, as Chief Minister under <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_235">Article
164(1)</a> read with (4) to the Governor; and the Governor would be
obliged to comply; the legislature would be unable to pass a no-
confidence motion against the foreigner Chief Minister because the
majority party would oppose it; and the foreigner Chief Minister
would be ensconced in office until the next election.  Such a
dangerous  such an absurd  interpretation of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_236">Article 164</a> has to be
rejected out of hand.  The Constitution prevails over the will of the
people as expressed through the majority party.	 The will of the people
as expressed through the majority party prevails only if it is in accord
with the Constitution.	The Governor is a functionary under the
Constitution and is sworn to preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution and the laws  (<a href="/doc/586056/" id="a_237">Article 159</a>).  The Governor cannot, in the
exercise of his discretion or otherwise, do anything that is contrary to
the Constitution and the laws.	It is another thing that by reason of the
protection the Governor enjoys under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_238">Article 361</a>, the exercise of the
Governors discretion cannot be questioned.  We are in no doubt at all
that if the Governor is asked by the majority party in the legislature to
appoint as Chief Minister a person who is not qualified to be a
member of the legislature or who is disqualified to be such, the
Governor must, having due regard to the Constitution and the laws, to
which he is subject, decline,  and the exercise of discretion by him in
this regard cannot be called in question.
</p>
<p id="p_148">	If perchance, for whatever reason, the Governor does appoint as
Chief Minister a person who is not qualified to be a member of the
legislature or who is disqualified to be such, the appointment is
contrary to the provisions of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_239">Article 164</a> of the Constitution, as we
have interpreted it, and the authority of the appointee to hold the
appointment can be challenged in quo warranto proceedings.  That the
Governor has made the appointment does not give the appointee any
higher right to hold the appointment.  If the appointment is contrary to
constitutional provisions it will be struck down.  The submission to the
contrary  unsupported by any authority	must be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_149">	The judgment of this Court in Shri Kumar Padma Prasad Vs.
Union of India and Others [1992(2) SCC 428] is a case on  point.  One
K.N. Srivastava was appointed a Judge of the Gauhati High Court by a
warrant of appointment signed by the President of India.  Before the
oath of his office could be administered to him, quo warranto
proceedings were taken against him in that High Court.	An interim
order was passed directing that the warrant of appointment should not
be given effect to until further orders.  A transfer petition was then
filed in this Court and was allowed.  This Court, on examination of the
record and the material that it allowed to be placed before it, held that
Srivastava was not qualified to be appointed a High Court Judge and
his  appointment was quashed.  This case goes to show that even when
the President, or the Governor, has appointed a person to a
constitutional office, the qualification of that person to hold that office
can be examined in quo warranto proceedings and the appointment
can be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_150">	It was submitted that we should not enter a political thicket by
answering the question before us.  The question before us relates to
the interpretation of the Constitution.	 It is the duty of this Court to
interpret the Constitution.  It must perform that duty regardless of the
fact that the answer to the question would have a political effect.  In
State of Rajasthan and Others Vs. Union of India and Others [1977(3)
SCC 592], it was said by Bhagwati, J. , But merely because a
question has a political complexion, that by itself is no ground why the
Court should shrink from performing its duty under the Constitution,
if it raises an issue of constitutional determination.	Every
constitutional question concerns the allocation and exercise of
governmental power and no constitutional question can, therefore, fail
to be political .  So long as a question arises whether
an authority under the Constitution has acted within the limits of its
power or exceeded it, it can certainly be decided by the Court.	 Indeed
it would be its constitutional obligation to do so.  It is necessary to
assert the clearest possible terms, particularly in the context of recent
history, that the Constitution is suprema lex, the paramount law of the
land and there is no department or branch of Government above or
beyond it.
</p>
<p id="p_151">	We are satisfied that in the appointment of the second
respondent as Chief Minister there has been a clear infringement of a
constitutional provision and that a writ of quo warranto must issue.
</p>
<p id="p_152">We are not impressed by the submissions that the writ petitions
for quo warranto filed in this Court are outside our jurisdiction
because no breach of fundamental rights has been pleaded therein; that
the appeal against the decision of the Madras High Court in the writ
petition for similar relief filed before it was correctly rejected because
the same issue was pending here; and that the transferred writ petition
for similar relief should, in the light of the dismissal of the writ
petitions filed in this Court, be sent back to the High Court for being
heard.	Breach of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_240">Article 14</a> is averred in at least the lead writ petition
filed in this Court (W.P.(C) No.242 of 2001).  The writ petition which
was dismissed by the High Court and against which order an appeal is
pending in this Court was filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_241">Article 226</a>, as was the
transferred writ petition.  This Court, therefore, has jurisdiction to
issue a writ of quo warranto.  We propose to pass the order in the lead
writ petition, and dispose of the other writ petitions, the appeal and the
transferred writ petition in the light thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_153">  We are not impressed by the submission that we should not
exercise our discretion to issue a writ of quo warranto because the
period of six months allowed by <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_242">Article 164(4)</a> to the second
respondent would expire in about two months from now and it was
possible that the second respondent might succeed in the criminal
appeals which she has filed.  We take the view that the appointment of
a person to the office of Chief Minister who is not qualified to hold it
should be struck down at the earliest.
</p>
<p id="p_154">We are aware that the finding that the second respondent could
not have been sworn in as Chief Minister and cannot continue to
function as such will have serious consequences.  Not only will it
mean that the State has had no validly appointed Chief Minister since
14th May, 2001, when the second respondent was sworn in, but also
that it has had no validly appointed Council of Ministers, for the
Council of Ministers was appointed on the recommendation of the
second respondent.  It would also mean that all acts of the
Government of Tamil Nadu since 14th May, 2001 would become
questionable.  To alleviate these consequences and in the interest of
the administration of the State and its people, who would have acted
on the premise that the appointments were legal and valid, we propose
to invoke the de facto doctrine and declare that all acts, otherwise
legal and valid, performed between 14th May, 2001 and today by the
second respondent as Chief Minister, by the members of the Council
of Ministers and by the Government of the State shall not be adversely
affected by reason only of the order that we now propose to pass.
</p>
<p id="p_155">We are of the view that a person who is convicted for a criminal
offence and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than
two years cannot be appointed the Chief Minister of a State under
<a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_243">Article 164(1)</a> read with (4) and cannot continue to function as such.
</p>
<p id="p_156"> We, accordingly, order and declare that the appointment of the
second respondent as Chief Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu on
14th May, 2001 was not legal and valid and that she cannot continue to
function as such.  The appointment of the second respondent as Chief
Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu is quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_157">All acts, otherwise legal and valid, performed between 14th
May, 2001 and today by the second respondent acting as Chief
Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu, by the members of the Council of
Ministers of that State and by the Government of that State shall not
be adversely effected by reason only of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_158">Writ Petition (C) No.242 of 2001 is made absolute in the
aforesaid terms.
</p>
<p id="p_159">In the light of this order, the other writ petitions, the appeal and
the transferred writ petition stand disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_160">No order as to costs.

<p id="p_165">	Leave granted in SLP © 11763/2001.
</p>
<p id="p_166">	   I have the advantage of going through the judgment prepared
by  Brother Bharucha, J.  I am in respectful agreement with the same.
While doing so, I propose to record  my views in addition, on a few
points only, in brief, since such points had been argued at some length
and with all vehemence.	 The points are also no doubt important.
</p>
<p id="p_167">	   Amongst other points, the learned counsel for the respondents
submitted that the appointment of  respondent No.2 as Chief Minister
by the Governor, could not be challenged, in view of the provisions
under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_244">Article 361</a> of the Constitution, providing that the Governor
shall not be answerable to any Court for the exercise and
performance of the  powers and duties of his office.  It was also
submitted that in appointing the Chief Minister, the Governor
exercised  his discretionary powers, therefore, his action is not
justiciable.	Yet another submission is that the Governor had only
implemented the decision of the majority party, in appointing the
respondent No.2 as a Chief Minister i.e. he had only given effect to
the will of the people.
</p>
<p id="p_168">  In so far  it relates	 to <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_245">Article 361</a> of the Constitution, that the
Governor shall not be answerable  to any Court for performance of
duties of his office  as Governor, it may, at the very outset, be
indicated that we are considering the prayer for issue of writ of Quo
Warranto against the respondent No.2, who according to the petitioner
suffers from disqualification to hold the public office of the Chief
Minister of a State. A writ of Quo Warranto is a writ which lies
against the person, who according to the relator is not entitled to hold
an office of  public nature and	 is only an usurper of the office.  It is
the person, against whom the writ of quo warranto is directed, who is
required to  show, by what authority that person is entitled to hold the
office.	 The  challenge can  be made on various grounds,  including on
the grounds that the possessor of the office does not fulfill the
required qualifications or suffers from any disqualification, which
debars the person to hold such office.	So as to have an idea about the
nature of action in a proceedings for writ of quo warranto and its
original form,	as it used to be, it would be beneficial to quote  from
Words and Phrases Permanent Edition, Volume 35A page 648.  It
reads  as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_169">	  The original common-law writ of quo
warranto was a civil writ at the suit of the crown,
and not a criminal prosecution.	 It was in the nature
of a writ of right by the King against one who
usurped or claimed franchises or liabilities, to
inquire by what right he claimed them.	This writ,
however, fell into disuse in England centuries ago,
and its place was supplied by an information in the
nature of a quo warranto, which in its origin was a
criminal method of prosecution, as well to punish
the usurper by a fine for the usurpation of the
franchise, as to oust him or seize it for the crown.
Long before our Revolution, however, it lost its
character as a criminal proceeding in everything
except form, and was applied to the mere purposes
of trying the civil right, seizing  the franchise, or
ousting the wrongful possessor, the fine being
nominal only; and such, without any special
legislation to that effect, has always been its
character in many of the states of the Union, and  it
is therefore a civil remedy only.  Ames v. State of
Kansas, 4 S.Ct.437, 442,111 U.S. 449,28 L.Ed.482;
People v. Dashaway Assn, 24 P.277,278,84
Cal.114.
</p>
<p id="p_170">		  In the same Volume of	 Words and  Phrases
Permanent Edition  at page 647	we find	 as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_171">The writ of quo warranto is not a
substitute for mandamus or injunction nor for an
appeal or writ of error, and is not to be used to
prevent an improper exercise of power lawfully
possessed, and its purpose is solely to prevent an
officer or corporation or persons purporting to act
as such from usurping a power which they do not
have.  State ex inf.McKittrick v. Murphy,
</p><p id="p_172">148.S.W.2d 527,529,530,347 Mo.484. (emphasis
supplied)

	Information in nature of quo warranto
does not command performance of official
functions by any officer to whom it may run, since
it is not directed to officer as such, but to person
holding office or exercising franchise, and not for
purpose of dictating or prescribing official duties,
but only to ascertain whether he is rightfully
entitled to exercise functions claimed.	 State ex inf.
Walsh v. Thatcher, 102 S.W.2d 937,938,340
Mo.865. (emphasis supplied)

     In Halsburys Laws of England Fourth Edition Reissue
Volume-I Para 265, Page 368 it is found as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_173"> 266. In general.  An information in the nature of a
quo warranto took the place of the absolete writ of
quo warranto which lay against a person who
claimed or usurped an office, franchise, or liberty, to
inquire by what authority he supported his claim, in
order what the right to the office or franchise might
be determined.	 (Emphasis supplied)

	Besides the above, many High Courts as well as this
Court have, taken the view that a writ of quo warranto lies
against a person, who is called upon to establish  his legal
entitlement to hold the office in question. Reference:
</p>
<p id="p_174">	AIR 1952 Trav. Cochin 66, (1944) 48 Cal.
</p><p id="p_175">W.N. 766, AIR 1977 Noc. 246, AIR 1952 Nag.
</p><p id="p_176">330,  AIR 1945 Cal.249 and AIR 1965 S.C. 491.
</p>

<p id="p_177"> In view of the legal position as  indicated above it would not be
necessary to implead the appointing authority as respondent in
the proceedings. In the case in hand, the  Governor need not be
made answerable to Court.  <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_246">Article 361</a> of the Constitution
however does not extend any protection or immunity,
vicariously, to	 holder of an office, which under the law, he is
not  entitled to hold.	On being called upon to establish valid
authority to hold a public office, if the  person  fails to do so, a
writ of quo warranto shall be directed against such person. It
shall  be no defence to say that the appointment was made by
the competent authority, who under the law is not answerable to
any Court for anything done in performance of duties of his
office.	 The question of fulfilling the legal requirements and
qualifications necessary to hold a public office would be
considered in the proceedings, independent of the fact as to who
made the appointment and the manner in which appointment
was made.  Therefore,  <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_247">Article 361</a> of the Constitution would be
no impediment in examining the question of entitlement of a
person, appointed by the Governor to hold a public  office, who
according to the petitioner/relator is usurper to the office.
</p>
<p id="p_178">	   The other   point which was pressed, with no less
vehemence was that in making the appointment of the Chief
Minister, the Governor acts in exercise of his discretionary
powers.	 In this connection, learned counsel for the respondents
referred to <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_248">Article 163</a> of the Constitution to	indicate that there
shall be a Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister to
aid and advise the Governor in exercise of his functions except
where, under the Constitution the Governor has to discharge his
functions in his discretion.  Thereafter, <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_249">Article 164</a> of the
Constitution has been referred to indicate that Chief Minister
shall be appointed by the Governor and the other Ministers
shall be appointed by the Governor on the advise of the Chief
Minister.  It is submitted that the Governor appoints the Chief
Minister at a time, when there is no Council of Ministers to aid
or advise him. The Governor makes the appointment in his own
discretion.  Learned counsel for the respondent No.2 submitted
that the party in majority by means of a resolution had	 chosen
respondent No.2 as their leader. Accordingly, the respondent
No.2 was appointed as  the Chief Minister.  It has been very
categorically submitted, without any ambiguity, that the
Governor is bound to appoint any person whosoever is chosen
by majority party, as the Chief Minister.  This argument cuts
against his  own submission made earlier that the Governor
appoints the Chief Minister in exercise of his discretionary
powers.	 If it is right, that the Governor is bound by the decision
of the majority party, the element of discretion of Governor, in
the matter,  disappears.  In the scheme of Constitutional
provisions the Governor is to act with the aid and advise of the
Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister.  He is
bound to act accordingly.  The other functions which the
Governor  performs in which aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers is not necessary, he acts   in his own  discretion. He is
not bound by decision/advice of any other agency.  It is no
doubt true that even in the written Constitution it is not possible
to provide  each and every detail.  Practices and conventions do
develop for certain matters.  This is how democracy becomes
workable.  It is also true that the choice of the majority party
regarding its leader for appointment as Chief Minister	is
normally accepted, and rightly.	 But the contention that in all
eventualities whatsoever the Governor is bound by the decision
of the majority party is not a correct proposition. The	 Governor
cannot be totally deprived of element of discretion in
performance of	duties of his office, if ever any such exigency
may so demand its exercise.  The argument about implementing
the will of the people in the context indicated above is
misconceived and misplaced.
