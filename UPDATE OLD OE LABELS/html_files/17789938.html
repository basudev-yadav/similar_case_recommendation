      Oral Judgement :
</p>
<p id="p_2">                         This writ petition challenges an order passed by the District
      Court at Pune on an application of the Respondent/plaintiff for withdrawal
      of its suit filed in respect of infringement of design as well as infringement
      of registered trademark and passing-off of goods with liberty to institute
      two separate suits, one for the alleged trademark infringement and passing
      off of goods, and the other for the alleged design infringement.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      2                  The plaintiff&#x27;s suit was a composite suit (i) for infringement of
      its registered trademark as well as passing-off of goods by the Petitioner/
      defendant as those of the plaintiff and (ii) for infringement of its registered
      design. The cause of action in respect of infringement of its trademark and
      passing-off of goods was clearly a separate cause of action from that of the
      defendant&#x27;s infringement of its registered design. These two separate and
      distinct causes of action were combined by the plaintiff. The defendant, in
      its written statement, took up a defence under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_2">Section 19</a> of the Designs



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                      1/7</span>

      Act, challenging the very registrability of the plaintiff&#x27;s design inter alia on
      account of want of novelty. After this defence was raised, the plaintiff
      applied for withdrawal of the suit with liberty to split up the causes of
      action in the suit and file separate suits in respect of infringement of
      trademark and infringement of design.
</p>

<p id="p_4">      3               The main opposition of the defendant to the impugned order
      permitting the plaintiff to withdraw its composite suit with liberty to file
      two separate suits, is that the trial court had lost seisin of the matter once a
      defence was raised under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_3">Section 19</a> of the Designs Act. It is submitted that
      upon such defence being raised, what the trial court has to do is simply
      transfer the suit to the jurisdictional High Court by virtue of sub-section (4)
      of    <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_4">Section    22</a>      of   the   Designs   Act.   Learned   counsel    for   the
      Petitioner/defendant relies on a judgment of Allahabad High Court in the
      case of <a href="/doc/188397546/" id="a_5">R.N. Gupta &amp; Co. Ltd. Jasola New Delhi vs. M/s. Action
      Construction Equipments Ltd. Dudhola1</a> in support of his case that the
      legislative intent behind Sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_6">Section 22</a> implies that
      moment a defence referred to therein is raised, the jurisdiction for deciding
      the suit vests with the jurisdictional High Court. Learned Counsel for the
      Petitioner also relies on the case of <a href="/doc/87429194/" id="a_7">Carlsberg Breweries A/S vs.               Som
      Distilleries and Breweries Ltd</a>.2 decided by a Full Bench of Delhi High Court
      in support of his submission that it is not permissible to split up the cause
      of action as proposed by the Respondent herein.

            &quot;22. Piracy of registered design.--

</pre><p id="p_6">            (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the second proviso
            to sub-section (2), where any ground on which the registration
            of a design may be cancelled under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_9">section 19</a> has been availed
            of as a ground of defence and sub-section (3) in any suit or
            other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), the suit or
            such other proceeding shall be transferred by the court, in
            which the suit or such other proceeding is pending, to the High
            Court for decision.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_7">      5            What this sub-section implies is that when a ground for
      cancellation of registration of the design under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_10">Section 19</a> has been availed
      of in defence to a suit complaining of piracy of a registered design, the suit
      has to be transferred to the High Court for decision. (Such transferred suit,
      in the case of a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, is
      required then to be heard and disposed of by Commercial Division of that
      court under Section 7 of Commercial Courts Act, 2015.) The sub-section
      does not imply that immediately upon a ground, on which registration of
      the suit design may be cancelled under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_11">Section 19</a>, being availed of as a
      ground of defence, the court hearing the infringement suit ceases to have
      jurisdiction in the suit. What it implies is that the court, before which the
      suit concerning piracy of the design has been brought, must not proceed to
      entertain the suit any further or decide it; it must transfer it to the High
      Court, once any defence under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_12">Section 19</a> is raised.
</p>

<p id="p_8">      6            In the present case, the suit initially brought before the District
      Court was a composite suit having two distinct causes of action, one for
      infringement of a registered trademark and passing-off of goods by the use
      of the same or a deceptively similar mark and the other for infringement of
      a registered design used for manufacture of the product, which bears the

      impugned mark. Had the plaintiff insisted on retaining the suit as a
      composite suit involving both causes of action, there is indeed nothing for
      the District Court to do except to transfer the suit to this court under Sub-
      section (4) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_13">Section 22</a>. What the plaintiff instead applied was for
      withdrawal of the suit. This is evidently having regard to the defence raised
      in the suit by the Petitioner herein, namely, a ground under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_14">Section 19</a>
      which called for cancellation of the plaintiff&#x27;s registered design. What the
      plaintiff proposed was to file two separate suits for these two separate
      causes of action and with a view to enable it to do so, it sought withdrawal
      of the composite suit. The District Court surely retained its seisin of the suit
      to the extent of such application for withdrawal. In other words, what the
      plaintiff proposed was not to go ahead with the hearing of the suit in any
      way but to withdraw it having regard to the defence raised by the
      defendant. It is preposterous to suggest that even such withdrawal cannot
      be permitted by the District Court and for such withdrawal, the plaintiff
      would have to be driven to taking his suit before the jurisdictional High
      Court and seek withdrawal from it and then file two separate suits
      involving two separate causes of action.

<p id="p_9">      7            The decision of Allahabad High Court in R.N. Gupta&#x27;s case was
      in altogether different circumstances. There, despite the defendant having
      raised a counter-claim for revocation of the plaintiff&#x27;s patent, on which the
      latter&#x27;s suit was resting, in the face of the proviso to <a href="/doc/831888/" id="a_15">Section 104</a> of the
      Patents Act (which is in pari materia with <a href="/doc/617193/" id="a_16">Section 22(4)</a> of the Designs
      Act), the trial court proceeded to hear the temporary injunction application
      of the plaintiff. It was under this circumstance and in this context that the
      High Court of Uttarakhand in M/s. Lambda Eastern Telecommunication vs.

      M/s. Acme Tele-Power Private Ltd. 3 made its observation, which was
      referred to by the Allahabad High Court in R.N. Gupta&#x27;s case. The
      observation is to the effect that once such counter claim is presented, the
      suit along with the counter claim cannot be heard any further by the trial
      court; it, along with the counter claim, has to be transferred to the High
      Court for hearing and decision. Despite having no authority to hear the suit
      and the counter claim, the trial court in that case proceeded to hear the
      temporary interim application of the plaintiff and that was not
      countenanced to by the High Court of Uttarakhand. The observations in
      M/s. Lambda Eastern Telecommunication (supra) have no application to
      the facts of the present case. In the present case, as we have noted above,
      upon the ground of <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_17">Section 19</a> being raised by the defendant as a ground
      of defence, the plaintiff applied for withdrawal of the suit and not for
      prosecuting the suit any further.
</p>

<p id="p_10">      8            The case of Carlsberg Breweries A/S (supra) decided by Delhi
      High Court also has no application to the facts of our case. That was a case,
      where the plaintiff had approached the court with a composite remedy of
      infringement and passing-off of goods by use of the offending design. What
      the court laid down in that case was that these two causes of action,
      namely, the cause of action of infringement of a registered design and the
      cause of passing-off of goods by use of the same or deceptively similar
      design do not have to be split; these causes of action arose out of the same
      subject matter and accordingly, under Order 2 Rule 3, the plaintiff offered
      to exercise his option to institute a composite suit. The court observed that
      the two causes of action, namely, the plaintiff&#x27;s claim for design
      infringement and his claim in the passing-off action were not disparate or

      dissimilar so that the court could not have tried them together in one suit.
      The court observed that once a transaction of sale is the same transaction,
      which would be in question in both causes of action, namely, infringement
      of a registered design and passing off of goods, and based on the same set
      of facts, common questions of law and fact arise in both causes of action,
      there was no basis for splitting up the two causes of action. Accordingly, the
      court answered the reference by holding that a composite suit joining these
      two causes of action was maintainable. That a composite suit for
      infringement of a registered design and passing-off of goods by use of the
      same or deceptively similar design is maintainable and the plaintiff is not
      expected to split up his suit into two separate suits is one thing, and the
      Petitioner&#x27;s argument here that the plaintiff would have to somehow
      maintain its composite action continuing to combine the separate causes of
      action of infringement of a registered trademark and passing-off of goods,
      on the one hand, and infringement of a registered design used for
      manufacture of the product, which bears the impugned mark, on the other,
      is quite another. The case of Carlsberg Breweries (supra) cannot be cited to
      support the latter proposition.
</p>

<p id="p_11">      9            The District Court has rightly allowed the plaintiff to withdraw
      its suit with liberty prayed for. The court has also considered the
      inconvenience caused to the defendant on account of disposal of the
      composite suit, with the prospect of having to face two separate suits, by
      ordering costs. Besides this brief inconvenience, which is ordered to be
      compensated, there is no prejudice suffered by the defendant by reason of
      the impugned order.
