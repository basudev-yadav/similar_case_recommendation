<p id="p_2">       The scope of <a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_1">section 8</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 


(Act, for short) arises for consideration in this appeal by special leave.

<p id="p_3">2.     Capstone   Investment   Co.   Pvt.   Ltd.   (second   respondent   herein,   for 


short   "Capstone")   and   Real   Value   Appliances   Pvt.   Ltd.   (respondent   No.3 


herein,   for   short   "RV   Appliances")   are   the   owners   of   flat   No.9A   and   9B 


respectively   situated   at   "Brighton",   Napien   Sea   Road,   Mumbai.   Capstone 


and RV Appliances had borrowed loans from SBI Home Finance Ltd., (the 


first   respondent   herein,   for   short   "SBI")   under   two   loan   agreements   dated 


3.12.1994 by securing the said two flats in favour of SBI.

<p id="p_4">3.     Under two leave and licence agreements dated 5.4.1996, Capstone and 


RV Appliances permitted the appellant to use their respective flats, for the 


term 1.9.1996 to 31.8.1999. Each licence agreement was signed, in addition 


to the licensor and licensee, by the other flat owner (that is RV Appliances in 


respect  of agreement relating  to 9A and Capstone  in respect  of agreement 


relating to 9B) and SBI as confirming parties 1 and 2.   
</p>




<p id="p_5">4.     On the same day (5.4.1996) a tripartite deposit agreement was entered 


among   RV   Appliances   and   Capstone   as   the   first   party,   appellant   as   the 


second   party   and   SBI   as   the   third   party.   Under   the   said   agreement,   the 


appellant paid a refundable security deposit of Rs.6.5 crores to Capstone and 


RV Appliances (at the rate of Rs.3.25 crores for each flat). Clause (E) of the 


said   agreement   confirmed   that   the   appellant   made   the   said   deposit   and 


Capstone and RV Appliances received the said deposit on the basis of the 


terms and conditions recorded in the two leave and licence agreements and 


the   deposit   agreement;   and   that   the   three   agreements   together   formed   a 


single   integral   transaction,   inseparable,   co-extensive   and   co-terminus   in 


character.  Out of the said deposit of Rs.6.5 crores, a sum of Rs.5.5 crores 


was directly paid to SBI on the instructions of Capstone and RV Appliances 


towards repayment of the loan taken by Capstone  and Real Value and the

balance   of   Rs.1   crore   accounted   in   the   manner   indicated   therein.   As   a 


consequence, the loan due by Capstone to SBI in regard to flat No.9A was 


cleared, but the loan taken by RV Appliances remained due and outstanding. 
</p>

<p id="p_6">Capstone however became a guarantor for repayment of the amount due by 


RV Appliances and flat No.9A was secured in favour of SBI and a charge 


was   created   in   the   shares   relating   to   flat   No.9A   belonging   to   Capstone   in 


favour of SBI, as security for repayment of the loan by R V Appliances. We 


extract below the relevant portion of para 5A of the agreement :

opted to continue the licence in respect of the two flats for a further period of 


two years beyond 31.8.1999, by paying an additional deposit of Rs.2 crores 


(at the rate of Rs.1 crore for each flat). Clause (11) enabled the appellant to

continue  to  use  and  occupy   the   flats  so  long  as   the  amounts  paid  by  it  as 


security deposit remained unpaid.
</p>



<p id="p_8">Clause (8) gave the option to the appellant to pay the amount due to the SBI

para 8 is extracted below:

and R V Appliances shall jointly and severally be liable to refund the deposit 


amount along with interest thereon from the date of expiry of the licence to 


date of actual payment 




Clause   (16)   of   the   deposit   agreement   provided   for   arbitration   and   is

</blockquote><p id="p_10">5.      In or about July 1997 a reference was made by RV Appliances to the 


Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR for short) under the 


<a href="/doc/438563/" id="a_3">Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act</a>, 1985 and in pursuance 


of it, flat 9B was taken over by the official liquidator.

<p id="p_11">6.      By   letter   dated   4.8.1999,   appellant   informed   Capstone   and   RV 


Appliances  that it was not interested  in exercising the option to renew the 


licences   on   expiry   of   the   leave   and   licence   agreements   on   31.8.1999   and 


called   upon   the   licensors   to   refund   the   security   deposit   of   Rs.6.5   crores, 


assuring that it would vacate and deliver up the licensed flats on receipt of 


the   deposit   amount.   The   appellant   informed   SBI   and   BIFR   about   it   by 


endorsing copies of the said letters  to them. As there was no confirmation 


from Capstone and RV Appliances that they would refund the sum of Rs.6.5 


crores,   the   appellant   wrote   a   further   letter   dated   26.8.1999   stating   that   it 


would continue to occupy the flats if the security deposit was not refunded.

<p id="p_12">7.           As the loan amount due by RV Appliances was not repaid, SBI filed a 


mortgage   suit   (Suit   No.6397/1999)   in   the   High   Court   of   Bombay   on 


28.10.1999 against Capstone (first defendant), appellant (second defendant),

</blockquote><p id="p_14">On   15.12.1999   the   appellant   filed   a   detailed   reply   to   the   said   notice   of 


motion. It inter alia contended that SBI had a contractual obligation towards 


the appellant as it had agreed for the continuance of appellants' occupation 


till refund of the deposit. Capstone also contested the application, denying 


the existence of any mortgage or charge over flat No.9A.
</p>



<p id="p_15">9.      The   appellant   however   did   not   file   its   written   statement   in   the   suit. 
</p>

<p id="p_16">The appellant claims that settlement talks were being held for some time but 


did not fructify into any settlement. Therefore, on 10.10.2001, the appellant 


took out a notice of motion praying that the parties to the suit be referred to 


arbitration as provided in clause 16 of the deposit agreement dated 5.4.1996 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                              8</span>



and consequently the suit be dismissed. The said application was resisted by 


the SBI. 
</p>




<p id="p_17">10.     A   learned   single   Judge   of   the   High   Court   by   impugned   order 


dated 7.3.2002 dismissed the application holding as follows:
</p>



<p id="p_18">(a)     Clause   16   of   the   deposit   agreement   (arbitration   agreement)   did   not 


cover the dispute which is the subject matter of the claim by SBI against its 


borrowers (Capstone and RV Appliances) and therefore, it was not open to 


the appellant to request the court to refer the parties to arbitration.
</p>



<p id="p_19">(b)     The detailed counter affidavit dated 15.12.1999 filed by the appellant, 


in   regard   to   the   notice   of   motion   for   temporary   injunction,   amounted   to 


submission   of   the   first   statement   on   the   substance   of   the   dispute,   before 


filing the application under <a href="/doc/1638056/" id="a_4">section 8</a> of the Act and therefore the appellant 


lost the right to seek reference to arbitration.
</p>



<p id="p_20">(c)     The   suit   was   filed   on   28.10.1999.   The   appellant   filed   the   counter 


affidavit  opposing  the  application  for  temporary  injunction  on  15.12.1999. 
</p>

<p id="p_21">The application under <a href="/doc/1638056/" id="a_5">section 8</a> of the Act was filed on 10.10.2001 nearly 20 


months thereafter, during which period the appellant had subjected itself to 


the   jurisdiction   of   the   High   Court.   In   view   of   the   inordinate   delay,   the 


appellant was not entitled to the relief under <a href="/doc/1638056/" id="a_6">section 8</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_22">The said order is challenged in this appeal by special leave. This court while 


granting leave on 28.8.2002 stayed the further proceedings in the suit. 
</p>




<p id="p_23">11.    The appellant contends that the parties to the suit were all parties to 


the deposit agreement containing the arbitration agreement. The claim of the 


SBI   was   for   enforcement   of   the   charge/mortgage   over   flat   No.9A   and 


realization of the sale proceeds therefrom, which was specifically mentioned 


as a dispute which was arbitrable. Having regard to the clear mandate under 


<a href="/doc/1638056/" id="a_7">section   8</a>   of   the   Act,   the   court   ought   to   have   referred   the   parties   to 


arbitration. SBI supported the order

Court held thus :

       that there is an arbitration agreement and the subject matter of the claim is 

       covered   by   the   agreement   and   the   plaintiff   or   the   person   who   has 

       approached the judicial authority for relief disputes the same, the judicial  

       authority, in the absence of any restriction in the Act, has necessarily to  

       decide whether, in fact, there is in existence a valid arbitration agreement  

       and whether the dispute that is sought to be raised before it is covered by  

       the   arbitration   clause.  It   is   difficult   to   contemplate   that   the   judicial 

       authority   has   also   to   act   mechanically   or   has   merely   to   see   the   original 

       arbitration agreement produced before it and mechanically refer the parties

application   under   <a href="/doc/1638056/" id="a_9">section   8</a>   stating   that   the   parties   should   be   referred   to

</p><p id="p_31">14.     In this case, there is no dispute that all the parties to the suit are parties 


to an agreement which contains the provision for settlement of disputes by 


arbitration.   Clause   (16)   which   provides   for   arbitration   provides   for 


settlement of the following disputes by arbitration : (a) disputes with respect 


to creation of charge over the shares and flats; (b) disputes with respect to 


enforcement of the charge over the shares and flats and realization of sale 


proceeds therefrom; (c) application of the sale proceeds towards discharge of 


liability of Capstone and RV Appliances  to the appellant;  and (e) disputes 


relating to exercise of right of the appellant to continue to occupy the flats 


until the entire dues as stated in clauses 9 and 10 of the deposit agreement 


are realised by the appellant.

till   the   entire   deposit   is   repaid,   are   all   matters   which   are   specifically 


mentioned in clause 16 as matters to be settled by arbitration. Therefore, the 


subject matter of the suit falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement.

substance   of   the   dispute',   if   by   filing   such   statement/application/affidavit, 


the defendant shows his intention to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the 


court and waive his right to seek reference to arbitration. But filing of a reply 


by a defendant, to an application for temporary injunction/attachment before 


judgment/appointment of  Receiver, cannot be considered as submission of a 


statement on the substance of the dispute, as that is done to avoid an interim

subjected himself to the jurisdiction of the court for adjudication of the main

application for temporary injunction and appointment of Receiver and that

and settlement by arbitration?  That is, whether the disputes, having regard 


to their nature, could be resolved by a private forum chosen by the parties 


(the   arbitral   tribunal)   or   whether   they   would   exclusively   fall   within   the 


domain of public fora (courts). (ii) Whether the disputes are covered by the  


arbitration   agreement?   That   is,   whether   the   disputes   are   enumerated   or 


described in the arbitration agreement as matters to be decided by arbitration 


or whether the disputes fall under the `excepted matters' excluded from the 


purview of the arbitration agreement. (iii) Whether the parties have referred  


the   disputes   to   arbitration?     That   is,   whether   the   disputes   fall   under   the 


scope of the submission to the arbitral tribunal, or whether they do not arise 


out of the statement of claim and the counter claim filed before the arbitral 


tribunal. A dispute, even if it is capable of being decided by arbitration and 


falling within the scope of arbitration agreement, will not be `arbitrable' if it 


is not enumerated in the joint list of disputes referred to arbitration, or in the 


absence   of     such   joint   list   of   disputes,   does   not   form   part   of   the   disputes

which are public fora constituted under the laws of the country. Every civil 


or commercial dispute, either contractual or non-contractual, which can be 


decided by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated and resolved 


by arbitration unless the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals is excluded either 


expressly or by necessary implication. Adjudication of certain categories of 


proceedings are reserved by the Legislature exclusively for public fora as a 


matter   of   public   policy.   Certain   other   categories   of   cases,   though   not 


expressly reserved for adjudication by a public fora (courts and Tribunals), 


may   by   necessary   implication   stand   excluded  from  the   purview   of  private 


fora. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is inarbitrable, the court where a

of   the   Act,   even   if   the   parties   might   have   agreed   upon   arbitration   as   the

which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes

decide the disputes.

<p id="p_48">23.     It may be noticed that the cases referred to above relate to actions  in  


rem.  A  right   in   rem  is   a   right   exercisable   against   the   world   at   large,   as 


contrasted   from   a  right   in   personam  which   is   an   interest   protected   solely 


against   specific   individuals.   Actions  in   personam  refer   to   actions 


determining the rights and interests of the parties themselves in the subject 


matter of the case, whereas actions  in rem  refer to actions determining the 


title to property and the rights of the parties, not merely among themselves 


but also against all persons at any time claiming an interest in that property.

<p id="p_49">Correspondingly,  judgment   in   personam  refers   to   a   judgment   against   a

Judgment in rem refers to a judgment that determines the status or condition 


of   property   which   operates   directly   on   the   property   itself.   (Vide   :  Black's 


Law Dictionary). Generally and traditionally all disputes relating to rights in  


personam  are   considered   to   be   amenable   to   arbitration;   and   all   disputes 


relating to rights in rem are required to be adjudicated by courts and public 


tribunals, being unsuited for private arbitration. This is not however a rigid 


or   inflexible   rule.   Disputes   relating   to   sub-ordinate   rights  in   personam 


arising from rights in rem have always been considered to be arbitrable.

       Second, the types of remedies which the arbitrator can award are limited 

       by considerations of public policy and by the fact that he is appointed by 

       the parties and not by the state. For example, he cannot impose a fine or a 

       term   of  imprisonment,   commit   a   person   for  contempt   or   issue   a   writ   of 

       subpoena; nor can he make an award which is binding on third parties or

       personam derived from the real rights may be ruled upon by arbitrators. 

       The   conventional   view   is   thus   that,   for   example,   rights   under   a   patent 

       licence   may   be  arbitrated,   but  the  validity  of  the   underlying   patent   may 

       not.....An arbitrator whose powers are derived from a   private agreement 

       between   A   and   B   plainly   has   no   jurisdiction   to   bind   anyone   else   by   a 

       decision on whether a patent is valid, for no-one else has mandated him to 

       make such a decision, and a decision which attempted to do so would be 

       useless."

</blockquote><p id="p_54">27.     An agreement to sell or an agreement to mortgage does not involve 


any transfer of right in rem but create only a personal obligation. Therefore 


if specific performance is sought either in regard to an agreement to sell or 


an   agreement   to   mortgage,   the   claim   for   specific   performance   will   be 


arbitrable. On the other hand, a mortgage is a transfer of a right  in rem. A 


mortgage   suit   for   sale   of   the   mortgaged   property   is   an   action  in   rem,  for 


enforcement   of   a   right  in   rem.   A   suit   on   mortgage   is   not   a   mere   suit   for 


money.  A   suit   for   enforcement   of  a   mortgage   being   the   enforcement   of  a 


right  in  rem,  will  have  to be  decided  by  courts  of law  and  not  by  arbitral 


tribunals. The scheme relating to adjudication of mortgage suits contained in 


Order   34   of   the   Code   of   Civil   Procedure,   replaces   some   of   the   repealed 


provisions of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_48">Transfer of Property Act</a>, 1882 relating to suits on mortgages

of the other provisions of that Act (<a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_53">section 92</a> to <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_54">94</a> and <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_55">96</a>). Order 34 of the 


Code does not relate  to execution of decrees, but provides  for preliminary 


and   final   decrees   to   satisfy   the   substantive   rights   of   mortgagees   with 


reference to their mortgage security. The provisions of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_56">Transfer of Property 


Act</a> read with Order 34 of the Code, relating to the procedure prescribed for 


adjudication of the mortgage suits, the rights of mortgagees and mortgagors, 


the   parties   to   a   mortgage   suit,   and   the   powers   of   a   court   adjudicating   a 


mortgage  suit,  make   it  clear  that  such  suits   are  intended  to  be  decided   by 


public fora (Courts) and therefore, impliedly barred from being referred to or 


decided by private fora (Arbitral Tribunals).   We may briefly refer to some 


of the provisions which lead us to such a conclusion. 
</p>

 

<p id="p_55">(i)     Rule   (1)   of   Order   34   provides   that   subject   to   the   provisions   of   the 


Code, all persons having an interest either in the mortgage security or in the 


right of redemption shall have to be joined as parties to any suit relating to 


mortgage, whether they are parties to the mortgage or not. The object of this 


rule is to avoid multiplicity of suits and enable all interested persons, to raise 


their   defences   or   claims,   so   that   they   could   also   be   taken   note   of,   while 


dealing with the claim in the mortgage suit and passing a preliminary decree. 
</p>

<p id="p_56">A person who has an interest in the mortgage security or right or redemption 


can therefore make an application for being impleaded in a mortgage suit, 


and   is   entitled   to   be   made   a   party.   But   if   a   mortgage   suit   is   referred   to 


arbitration,   a   person   who   is   not   a   party   to   the   arbitration   agreement,   but 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                 27</span>



having an interest in the mortgaged property or right of redemption, can not 


get himself impleaded as a party to the arbitration proceedings, nor get his 


claim dealt with in the arbitration proceedings relating to a dispute between 


the   parties   to   the   arbitration,   thereby   defeating   the   scheme   relating   to 


mortgages in the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_57">Transfer of Property Act</a> and the Code. It will also lead to 


multiplicity of proceedings with likelihood of divergent results.
</p>



<p id="p_57">(ii)     In passing a preliminary decree and final decree, the court adjudicates, 


adjusts and safeguards the interests not only of the mortgagor and mortgagee 


but also puisne/mesne mortgagees, persons entitled to equity of redemption, 


persons   having   an   interest   in   the   mortgaged   property,   auction   purchasers, 


persons in possession. An arbitral tribunal will not be able to do so.
</p>



<p id="p_58">(iii)    The   court   can  direct   that  an   account   be  taken   of  what   is   due   to   the 


mortgagee and declare the amounts due and direct that if the mortgagor pays 


into court, the amount so found due, on or before such date as the court may 


fix (within six months from the date on which the court confirms the account 


taken   or   from   the   date   on   which   the   court   declares   the   amount   due),   the 


petitioner   shall   deliver   the   documents   and   if   necessary   re-transfer   the 


property to the defendant; and further direct that if the mortgagor defaults in 


payment of such dues, then the mortgagee will be entitled to final decree for 


sale of the property or part thereof and pay into court the sale proceeds, and 


to   adjudge   the   subsequent   costs,   charges,   expenses   and   interest   and   direct 


that the balance be paid to mortgagor/defendant or other persons entitled to 


receive the same. An arbitral tribunal will not be able to do so.

<p id="p_59">(iv)     Where in a suit for sale (or in a suit for foreclosure in which sale is 


ordered),   subsequent   mortgagees   or   persons   deriving   title   from,   or 


subrogated   to   the   rights   of  any   such   mortgagees   are   joined   as   parties,   the 


court while making the preliminary decree for sale under Rule 4(1), could 


provide for adjudication of the respective rights and liabilities of the parties 


to   the  suit   in   a  manner   and  form  set   forth  in   Form  Nos.   9,  10,   and  11   of 


appendix `D' to the Code with such variations as the circumstances of the 


case   may   require.   In   a   suit   for   foreclosure   in   the   case   of   an   anomalous 


mortgage,   if   the   plaintiff   succeeds,   the   court   may,   at   the   instance   of   any 


party to the suit or any other party interested in the mortgage security or the  

right of redemption, pass a like decree in lieu of a decree for foreclosure, on 

such terms as it thinks fit. But an arbitral tribunal will not be able to do. 
</p>



<p id="p_60">(v)      The court has the power under Rule 4(2), on good cause being shown 


and upon terms to be fixed by it, from time to time, at any time before a final 


decree is passed, extend the time fixed for payment of the amount found or 


declared   due   or   the   amount   adjudged   due   in   respect   of   subsequent   costs, 


changes, expenses and interest, upon such terms as it deems fit. The Arbitral 


Tribunal will have no such power.
</p>




<p id="p_61">28.      A decree for sale of a mortgaged property as in the case of a decree 


for order of winding up, requires the court to protect the interests of persons 


other than the parties to the suit/petition and empowers the court to entertain 


and  adjudicate   upon  rights   and  liabilities  of  third  parties  (other   than  those 


who   are   parties   to   the   arbitration   agreement).   Therefore,   a   suit   for   sale, 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                 29</span>



foreclosure or redemption of a mortgaged property, should only be tried by a 


public forum, and not by an arbitral tribunal. Consequently, it follows that 


the court where the mortgage suit is pending, should not refer the parties to 


arbitration. 
</p>




<p id="p_62">29.     The appellant  contended that the suit ultimately raises the following 


core issues, which can be decided by a private forum: (i) Whether there is a 


valid mortgage or charge in favour of SBI? (ii) What is the amount due to 


SBI? and (iii) Whether SBI could seek eviction of appellant  from the flat, 


even if it is entitled to enforce the mortgage/charge? It was submitted  that 


merely  because  mortgage  suits involve passing of preliminary decrees and 


final decrees, they do not get excluded from arbitrable disputes. It is pointed 


out that the arbitral tribunals can also make interim awards deciding certain 


aspects of the disputes finally which can be equated to preliminary decrees 


granted by courts, and the final award made by the arbitrator, after detailed 


accounting   etc.   could   be   compared   to   the   final   decree   by   courts.   It   is 


therefore contended that there is no impediment for the parties to mortgage 


suits   being   referred   to   arbitration   under   <a href="/doc/1031695/" id="a_58">section   8</a>   of   the   Act.   If   the   three 


issues referred by the appellant are the only disputes, it may be possible to 


refer them to arbitration. But a mortgage suit is not only about determination 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                     30</span>



of the existence of the mortgage or determination of the amount due. It is 


about enforcement of the mortgage with reference to an immovable property 


and   adjudicating   upon   the   rights   and   obligations   of   several   classes   of 


persons (referred to in para 27 (ii) above), who have the right to participate 


in the proceedings relating to the enforcement of the mortgage, vis-`-vis the 


mortgagor   and   mortgagee.   Even   if   some   of   the   issues   or   questions   in   a 


mortgage   suit   (as   pointed   out   by   the   appellant)   are   arbitrable   or   could   be 


decided by a private forum, the issues in a mortgage suit cannot be divided.

        course is possible  under <a href="/doc/1031695/" id="a_60">Section  8</a> of the Act?  In our view, it  would  be 

        difficult to give an interpretation to <a href="/doc/1031695/" id="a_61">Section 8</a> under which bifurcation of 

        the cause of action that is to say the subject matter of the suit or in some

        totally new procedure not contemplated under the Act. If bifurcation of the 

        subject matter of a suit was contemplated, the legislature would have used 

        appropriate   language   to   permit   such   a   course.   Since   there   is   no   such
