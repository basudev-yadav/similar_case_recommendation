HEADNOTE:
     A	consignment   of  iron	 goods	was  booked  by	 the
respondent by  rail on	December 15,  1961. The	 due date of
delivery under	the contract  or usage	of the	railways was
December 25,  1961. As	the goods  were diverted,  they were
actually delivered  on July 21, 1962. The respondent filed a
suit for  damages alleging  negligence on  the part  of	 the
railway in  that, by  reason of	 diverting the	consignment,
there was inordinate delay in its delivery which resulted in
loss to	 it by	way of	interest on capital. The trial court
decreed the suit but in the matter of damages by way of loss
of interest  it gave  6% per annum instead of 12% claimed by
the respondent. The District Court dismissed the appellant's
appeal, and  the High  Court dismissed	the second appeal in
limine.
     On appeal	to this	 Court	it  was	 contended  for	 the
appellant that	(i) since  the cause  of action was based on
delayed delivery,  the case  was covered by the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_4">Railway Act</a>,
as amended in 1961, that the applicable section is<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_5"> s. 76</a> and
that since  the conditions  mentioned therein  had not	been
fulfilled, the respondent was not entitled to a decree; (ii)
that the  respondent could  claim for loss of profit or loss
of market  as the  same was  expressly barred by<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_6"> s. 78(d)</a> of
the new	 Act; and  (iii) that  the  respondent's  claim	 for
damages was  not actionable  in the absence of any agreement
providing interest  on capital	as a  measure of damages. It
was contended  for the	respondent that even if<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_7"> s. 76</a> barred
the remedy,  loss of profit or market resulting from delayed
delivery would	amount to "deterioration" contemplated by<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_8"> s.
76</a>.
     Dismissing the appeal to this Court,
^
     HELD: In  view of the finding of fact arrived at by the
courts below, the respondent is entitled to damages. [515B]
     1. (a)  The case  is covered  by the new Act and not by
the old	 Act as	 contended by the respondent. There could be
no question  of liability arising when the goods were booked
and the contract was entered into between the respondent and
the railways,  because, there  was no  presumption that	 the
contract would result in breach. [512B-C]
     In the instant case, the cause of action arose when the
consignment was	 delivered to  the respondent  on  July	 21,
1962, that  is, after  the new	Act  came  into	 force.	 The
reasonable transit  period having expired on January 1. 1962
the breach occurred after the new Act came into force.
     (b) <a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_9">Section  76</a> of the Act has a very limited scope: it
contemplates clearly  those  cases  which  fall	 within	 the
contingencies contemplated  by it. These contingencies refer
to certain  physical factors,  viz: actual and physical loss
destruction, damage  or deterioration of goods. Where due to
delay  on   the	 part  of  the	railway	 there	is  physical
deterioration or  diminishing of the value of the goods, the
plaintiff cannot  claim damages by way of loss of profits or
loss of	 market plus damages sustained by the actual loss or
deterioration of the goods. In such a case the plaintiff can
claim only  the actual loss in the value of the goods caused
by destruction,	 damage or  deterioration and  not  loss  of
profit. [512F-H]
     (c) The  word "deterioration"  is used  in its ordinary
parlance, so  as to  include within  its  ambit	 the  actual
physical act  of deterioration,	 namely, the  change for the
worse in the thing itself. [514E-F]

Messrs</a>. Sheobux	 Satyanarayan, A.I.R.  1963 Orissa  68,	 not
approved.
     (d)The   words    "loss,	destruction,	damage	  or
deterioration" occurring  in<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_12"> s.	 76</a>  must  be  read  ejuedem
generis to  indicate the  actual and physical loss or change
in the	goods contemplated  by that  section. In the instant
case, since there was no physical deterioration of the goods
at all	which were  delivered in the same condition in which
they were  booked, the	case of the respondent does not fall
within	the  four  corners  of	the  section.  Nor  can	 the
respondent take	 advantage of <a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_13"> s. 76</a>  relying  on  the	word
"deterioration" because of the finding of negligence entered
by the courts below. [514G]
     If<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_14"> s.  76</a> does  not apply	then<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_15"> s.	 78</a>  would  have  no
application because  that section starts with a non-obstante
clause. [513E-F]
     (2) <a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_16">Section  78(d)</a>, which	flows out of<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_17"> s. 76</a>, provides
that the railway administration shall not be responsible for
any  indirect  or  consequential  damages  or  for  loss  of
particular market.  It merely  incorporates the	 measure  of
damages as contemplated by<a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_18"> s. 73</a>. [513B]
     In the  instant case  as the respondent had not claimed
loss of market or remote damages the question of application
of<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_19"> s. 78(d)</a> did not arise.
     3(a) The case of the respondent is clearly taken out of
the ambit of<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_20"> ss. 76</a> and <a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_21">78</a>. Hence its suit for damages could
not be defeated on the ground that it was barred by<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_22"> s. 76</a> or
s. 78 of the Act. [515A-B]
     (b) It  is difficult  to accept  the contention  of the
appellant that,	 by virtue  of<a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_23"> ss.  72</a> and  <a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_24">73</a>, any contract
entered into  between the  parties and	the liability of the
railway was governed purely by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_25">Railway
Act</a> and	 not by	 the  terms  of	 the  contract	between	 the
parties. [510G]
     <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_26">The Indian	 Contract Act</a>  provides	 certain  elementary
conditions for	a binding  contract but does not provide any
particular  form  of  contract.	 The  fact  that  where	 the
Government is  a party to a contract, the particular form in
which the  contract is	to be executed has been provided for
by the Constitution, did not mean that the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_27">Contract Act</a> stand superseded by the Constitution or in this
case by	 the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_28">Railway  Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_29">Section 72</a> does nothing more than
provide for a particular form in which the contract is to be
executed and  it enjoins that such a form will be prescribed
by the	railway administration	and approved  by the Central
Government. [510H-511-A]
     (c)   <a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_30">Section   73</a>	  lays	 down	that   the   Railway
administration	shall	be   responsible   for	 the   loss,
destruction, damage, deterioration or non-delivery except in
certain cases  which amount  to vis major in which case also
the Act	 places responsibility on the railways if it did not
prove that  it had used reasonable foresight and care in the
carriage  of   goods.  The  section,  while  converting	 the
liability of  the railway  administration  from	 that  of  a
carrier	 to   that  of	 an  insurer,  has  imposed  heavier
responsibility on the railway administration. [511F-G]
     4(a) There	 is no question of<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_31"> s. 73</a> of the Contract Act
over-riding the	 provisions of	the <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_32">Interest  Act</a> because in
the instant  case the <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_33">Interest Act</a> has no application at all
inasmuch as  no interest  is claimed  by the  plaintiff; but
interest has  been  used  as  a	 measure  to  determine	 the
compensation which  the respondent  could seek	against	 the
appellant for  its negligence in causing inordinate delay in
the delivery  of the  goods. The respondent had only claimed
nominal damages	 for the loss because of the amount of money
locked up  for more  than six  months due  to late delivery.
[517B]
     (b) The courts below rightly found that the railway was
guilty of  gross negligence. As a common carrier the railway
is responsible	for breach of contract. There was absolutely
no reason  for the  railway to	divert the  consignment to a
place which did not fall on the route at all. [517D]
506
     (c) The  trial court  was fully  entitled to scale down
the amount of interest from 12% to 6%. [517F]

     5. The  present appeal  was concluded  by	findings  of
fact. But  on the  proved facts	 some clear questions of law
arose for  decision and,  therefore, this  was not a case in
which the  High Court  should have  dismissed the  appeal in
limine. [507F]

</p><p id="p_5">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     FAZAL ALI,	 J.-This is  a defendant's appeal by special
leave against  the judgment  and decree of the High Court of
Bombay dismissing  its second  appeal in limine by its order
dated August 24, 1967.
</p><p id="p_6">     The appeal	 raises important  and interesting questions
of law	relating  to  the  interpretation  of  some  of	 the
provisions of  the <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_37">Indian  Railways Act</a>	 pertaining  to	 the
liability of  the  Railways  for  breach  of  contract.	 The
plaintiff/respondent brought  a	 suit  for  recovery  of  an
amount of  Rs. 2,378.65	 nP being  the damages for breach of
contract  resulting  from  delayed  delivery  of  the  goods
consigned by the plaintiff through the defendant Railways to
be delivered  at  Poona.  The  plaintiff  which	 is  a	firm
carrying on  its business  dealing in  iron goods  booked  a
consignment with  the  defendant  on  December	15  1961  at
Bhillai to  be carried	to Poona and to be delivered therein
to the consignee safely and in good condition. The defendant
Railways accepted  the offer  under a  Railway Receipt dated
December 15,  1961. It	appears that there was some delay in
the delivery  of the goods at Poona and on enquiries made by
the plaintiff  it appeared  that till  May 9, 1962 the goods
had not	 been delivered	 at all.  Thereafter  the  plaintiff
served a  noted claim  and of  suit dated May 9, 1962 on the
Railway Administration. Soon after the service of the notice
the consignment was delivered on July 21, 1962. According to
the plaintiff  under  the  contract  or	 the  usage  of	 the
Railways the  normal period  of delivery was ten days and as
defendant had  committed an  inordinate delay  in delivering
the goods it was liable to pay damages to the plaintiff. The
plaintiff,  however,   calculated  the	damages	 by  way  of
interest at  the rate  of 12%  per annum  on the  locked  up
capital of  Rs. 27,332-44  which due  to rise  in prices has
swelled to  Rs. 35,476-27  nP. The plaintiff further alleged
that the  delay in  the delivery was due to gross negligence
of the defendant Railways which instead of sending the goods
direct from Bhillai to Poona
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">507</span>
diverted them  to Aurangabad where the consignment had to be
loaded in a meter-gauge train and then to a broad-gauge line
and it was only after the defendant received the notice from
the plaintiff  that it	expedited the delivery of the goods.
The defendant Railways contested the suit on the ground that
there was  no inordinate  delay, nor  there was any contract
that the  goods were  to be delivered within ten days. It is
also averred  that the plaintiff had led no evidence to show
that there  was any  loss of  profits or  rise in the market
price. The  defendant further alleged that the plaintiff was
not entitled  to claim	interest as damages. The Trial Court
accepted the plaintiff's case in toto and found-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  (1)  that there  was an  inordinate delay  in	 the
	       delivery	 of   the  goods  belonging  to	 the
	       plaintiff at Poona;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  (2)  that  the   goods  were	 first	diverted  to
	       Aurangabad, although  the route	from Bhillai
	       to Poona	 lay via  Nagpur and Aurangabad does
	       not fall on the route at all; and
	  (3)  that  the   defendant  was  guilty  of  gross
	       negligence and  was,  therefore,	 responsible
	       for loss	 for delay  or deviation in carrying
	       the goods.
</blockquote><p id="p_7">The Trial  Court, however,  found that	the  figure  of	 Rs.
27,332-44 the  original amount	which was  deposited by	 the
plaintiff in  the Bank	against the goods should be taken as
the basis  for calculation  of damages and after calculating
interest at  the rate  of 6%  per annum	 the  plaintiff	 was
awarded a sum of Rs. 1250/- including the notice charges and
passed a decree for this amount in favour of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_8">     The defendant  then filed an appeal before the District
Judge Poona  who upheld	 the finding  of the learned Munsiff
and dismissed  the appeal.  A second  appeal  taken  by	 the
defendant to  the High Court of Bombay was also dismissed in
limine, and hence this appeal by special leave.
</p><p id="p_9">     Normally it  would appear that the appeal was concluded
by findings  of fact  but we  find that	 on the proved facts
some clear questions of law arise for decision and therefore
this was  not a	 case in  which the  High Court	 should have
dismissed the appeal in limine.
</p><p id="p_10">     In support	 of the appeal the learned Solicitor-General
submitted three points before us:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  (1)that as the cause of action of the plaintiff is
     based on  the delayed  delivery which arose at the most
     on January	 1, 1962,  the	case  of  the  plaintiff  is
     covered by	 the provisions	 of the	 new <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_38">Railways Act</a> as
     amended by	 Act 39 of 1961, which is an exhaustive Code
     in itself providing a self-contained machinery in order
     to determine  the liability  of the Railways and as the
     conditions mentioned  in<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_39"> s. 76</a> of the Railways Act have
     not been fulfilled the plaintiff is not entitled to any
     decree;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  (2)that  at  any  rate  since	 the  plaintiff	 has
     claimed interest  as damages,  in the  absence  of	 any
     agreement	providing   for	 such	an   interest,	 the
     plaintiff's claim is not actionable at law; and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">508</span>
	  (3) that the plaintiff could not claim for loss of
     profit or	loss of	 market as  the	 same  is  expressly
     barred by<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_40"> s. 78(d)</a> of the new <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_41">Railways Act</a>.
</blockquote><p id="p_11">As an  alternative argument  it was  also pleaded  that	 the
plaintiff has  not averred  in his plaint that there was any
rise in	 the prices  because  the  goods  belonging  to	 the
plaintiff were	a controlled commodity and could not be sold
without a permit, Before claiming loss of profits it was the
bounden duty  of the  plaintiff to  allege that	 he had been
granted the permit to sell the goods.
</p><p id="p_12">     Mr. Phadke	 appearing for	the respondent	has repelled
the contentions	 of the appellant on the ground that the new
<a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_42">Railways Act</a>  does not	reduce or  diminish the liability of
the railway  administration for	 breach of  contract but  in
fact the  Act seeks  to increase  the liability. Secondly it
was submitted  that even  if the  case of the plaintiff does
not fall  within the  four corners  of	s.  76	of  the	 new
<a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_43">Railways Act</a>, the common law right of the plaintiff to claim
damages against	 the appellant	has not	 been barred  by the
Act. Lastly  it was  submitted that  the plaintiff  has	 not
claimed interest  on any  specified amount  of money but has
merely calculated  the same as a measure of damages which it
suffered due  to the breach of contract and gross negligence
on the	part of	 the Railways  which has  been found  by the
Courts below.  Finally it was contended that as the contract
was entered  into between  the parties on December 15, 1961,
when the  goods were  booked   at Bhillai, the liability for
damages arose  on that	day and	 the case  of the  plaintiff
would be  covered by  the provisions  of  the  <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_44">Railways	 Act</a>
before it was amended by Act 39 of 1961.
</p><p id="p_13">     In order  to  answer  the	contentions  raised  by	 the
parties it  may be  necessary for  us to  trace briefly	 the
history of  the circumstances  in which	 the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_45">Railways Act</a> of
1890 was  amended by  Act 39  of 1961.	We would, for short,
refer to  the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_46">Railways	Act</a> of 1890 as the "old Act" and the
Act as	amended by Act 39 of 1961 as the "new Act". It would
appear that under<a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_47"> s. 72</a> of the old Act the responsibility of
railway administration as a carrier of animals and goods was
clearly that  of a  bailee under<a href="/doc/1459661/" id="a_48"> ss. 151</a>, <a href="/doc/691369/" id="a_49">152</a> and <a href="/doc/1818621/" id="a_50">161</a> of the
Indian	Contract   Act.	 In   other   words,   the   railway
administration was  impressed with  the duty  to  carry	 the
goods with  the same  care and caution which a prudent owner
would apply  in the  case of  his own goods If there was any
violation or breach of the said care and caution expected of
the Railway  it would  have been  liable to damages. <a href="/doc/486566/" id="a_51">Section
72(1)</a> of the old Act ran thus:
</p><pre id="pre_2">	  "(1)	 The	responsibility	  of	a    railway
     administration   for    the   loss,    destruction	  or
</pre><p id="p_14">     deterioration of  animals or  goods  delivered  to	 the
     administration to	be carried by railway shall, subject
     to the  other provisions  of this	Act, be	 that  of  a
     bailee under  <a href="/doc/1730099/" id="a_52">sections 151</a>.  152 and  161 of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_53">Indian
     Contract Act</a>, 1872 (9 of 1872)."
</p><p id="p_15">It may be pertinent to note that sub-section (3) of<a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_54"> s. 72</a> of
the old	 Act expressly excluded the principles of the common
law of	England or in the Carriers Act of 1865 regarding the
responsibility of  common carriers. After our country became
free and the Railways entered the commercial field as one of
the important wings of the Government, there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">509</span>
appears to  be	a  public  demand  for	making	the  Railway
administration as  a public  body to  take upon	 itself more
onerous	 responsibilities  where  the  rights  of  the	free
citizens were involved. Under the British Government most of
the Railways were owned by private companies whose ownership
was to	be extinguished	 after lapse of a particular period.
Soon after  the freedom	 all the Railways were taken over by
the Central  Government and  run by  it. In  view of the new
problems facing	 the Government	 and the public demand for a
change in the law, the Government appears to have decided to
convert the  responsibility of	the railway  from that	of a
carrier to  that of  an insurer.  But before doing this, the
Government appointed  a Committee called the Railway Freight
Structure Enquiry Committee (1956-57) which recommended that
the responsibility  of	the  Railways  in  India  should  be
changed to that of a common carrier instead of a bailee. The
Committee which	 had been  asked to  examine  the  statutory
provisions dealing  with the  responsibility of	 railways as
common carriers	 was of	 the opinion  that the	public would
derive much satisfaction from a radical change from bailee's
responsibility to  that of  a common  carrier, and that this
change was  bound to tone up the administrative machinery of
the railways  in respect  of effective prevention of transit
losses. In view of the recommendations of the said Committee
the Government	introduced a  bill  in	the  Lok  Sabha	 for
amending some  of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_55">Railway Act</a> in order
to implement  those recommendations.  From a  perusal of the
debates of  the Lok  Sabha when	 this Bill was introduced it
would appear that the Deputy Minister of Railways explaining
the objectives of the Bill observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	  "Taking into	account all  aspects of the problem,
     it	 is   proposed	that   railways	 should	 assume	 the
     responsibility of a common carrier instead of that of a
     bailee. As	 bailees, the  railways are required to take
     as much  care  of	the  goods  entrusted  to  them	 for
     carriage as  a man	 of ordinary  prudence would,  under
     similar circumstances,  take of  his own  goods of	 the
     same bulk, quality and value.

including  sub-s.   (3)	 which	 expressly  prohibited	 the
principles of  the common law of England for determining the
liability of  the Railways  as common  carriers. Instead the
new<a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_58"> s.	72</a> laid	 down the form in which a contract was to be
executed between a consignor and the Railway and a risk note
was provided  for by clause (b). It may be necessary to note
an argument  put forward by the learned Solicitor-General on
this  point.   It  was	submitted  that	 by  virtue  of	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_59"> ss. 72</a>  and <a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_60">73</a>  of the  new Act	the  statute
superseded any contract entered into between the parties and
the liability  of the Railways was governed purely under the
provisions of  the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_61">Railways  Act</a> and  not under the terms of
contract which	may  have  been	 entered  into	between	 the
consignor and the Railway. We are, however, unable to accept
this argument.	It is  well settled  that while	 the  <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_62">Indian
Contract Act</a>  merely provides  certain elementary conditions
under which  the contract becomes binding on the parties, it
does not  provide any  particular form	or  condition  of  a
contract. It  is, therefore,  clear that  the parties to the
contract may  agree to	a particular form or condition or of
mode in	 which the contract is to be executed. In case where
the Government	enters into a contract with a person or vice
versa a	 particular form  in which  the contract  is  to  be
executed has  been provided for even by the Constitution and
the contract has to be in that form.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">511</span>
<p id="p_18">This does  not mean  that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_63">Contract Act</a>

in which  the contract	has to	be entered  into. <a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_65">Section 72</a>
therefore does nothing more or nothing less than provide for
a particular  form in  which the  contract is to be executed
and it	enjoins that  such a  form will be prescribed by the
railway	 administration	  and  approved	  by   the   Central
Government. The provisions of<a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_66"> s. 72</a> of the new Act run thus:

     delivered as may be required".
</blockquote><p id="p_19">It is not possible from the provisions of<a href="/doc/1543164/" id="a_67"> s. 72</a> to spell out
the principle  that the	 new Act  completely supersedes	 the
provisions of  the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_68">Contract  Act</a>  both	in  respect  of	 the
conditions and the liability. <a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_69">Section 73</a> of the new Act lays
down that  the railway	administration shall  be responsible
for the	 loss, destruction,  damage, deterioration  or	non-
delivery except	 in certain cases which amount to vis major.
But there  also the  proviso confers  responsibility on	 the
Railways for  loss etc.,  if the railway administration does
not prove  that it has used reasonable foresight and care in
the carriage of the goods.
</p><p id="p_20">     The Solicitor-General  contended that <a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_70"> s. 76</a> of the new
Act is	the provision which deals with delay in the delivery
and the	 plaintiff can succeed only if his case falls within
the four  corners of  the  section.  Before  answering	this
question, it may be necessary to dispose of a point on which
the counsel  for the parties have joined issue. According to
the Solicitor-General  the liability of the Railway would be
governed by  the new Act inasmuch as the cause of action has
arisen after  coming into  force of the new Act. Counsel for
the respondent,	 however, submits  that the  matter will  be
governed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">512</span>
the old	 Act because the liability of the Railway arose when
the goods  were booked	in December  1961. In  our  opinion,
there is a very short answer to this question. The plaintiff
has clearly  and categorically pleaded in paragraph-2 of the
plaint that  the cause	of action  arose at  Poona when	 the
complete consignment  was delivered to the plaintiff on July
21, 1962 i.e. after the new Act had already come into force.
Further more,  it is  also alleged  that the  reasonable and
normal transit	period expired	on January 1, 1962. In these
circumstances, therefore, according to the plaintiff itself,
the breach  occurred only  after the  new Act  had come into
force-whether it  was January  1, 1962	or thereafter. There
can be	no question  of the liability arising when the goods
were booked  and the  contract was  entered into between the
plaintiff and  the Railway,  because there is no presumption
that the  contract would  result in  breach.  The  plaintiff
would be entitled to damages only when there was a breach of
contract and  if the  said breach,  even  according  to	 the
plaintiff itself, occurred on January 1, 1962 or thereafter,
then it	 is manifest  that the	case would be covered by the
new Act and not by the old Act.
</p><p id="p_21">     The first	contention put	forward	 by  the  Solicitor-
General was  that the  case of	the plaintiff  does not fall
under any  of the contingencies contemplated by<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_71"> s. 76</a> of the
new Act. <a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_72">Section 76</a> runs thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "76. A railway administration shall be responsible
     for  loss,	 destruction,  damage  or  deterioration  of
     animals or	 goods proved  by the  owner  to  have	been
     caused by	delay or  detention in their carriage unless
     the railway  administration proves	 that the  delay  or
     detention arose without negligence or misconduct on the
     part of  the railway  administration or  of any  of its
     servants."
</blockquote><p id="p_22">It is  submitted  that	although  there	 was  delay  in	 the
delivery  of   the  goods   on	the   part  of	the  railway
administration, but  the  railway  administration  would  be
responsible only  if the plaintiff further proves that there
has been  loss, destruction,  damage or deterioration of the
goods by  virtue of the delay. It is true that the plaintiff
has  not   alleged  that   there  was	any  physical  loss,
destruction, damage or deterioration of the goods, but that,
in our	opinion, does  not put	the plaintiff  out of court.
<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_73">Section	 76</a>  appears  to  have	a  very	 limited  scope:  it
contemplates clearly  those  cases  which  fall	 within	 the
contingencies contemplated  by<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_74"> s.  76</a>.	These  contingencies
refer to certain physical factors, viz., actual and physical
loss, destruction,  damage or  deterioration of	 goods.	 For
instance, where	 the goods worth Rs. 10,000/- due to delayed
delivery have  sustained deterioration	as a result of which
their value has gone down to Rs. 5,000/- then once this fact
is proved  the railway	administration shall  be liable	 for
such a	loss or	 the value  of such deterioration. We are of
the opinion  that<a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_75"> s. 73</a> of the new Act, while converting the
liability of  the railway  administration  from	 that  of  a
carrier	 to   that  of	 an  insurer,  has  imposed  heavier
responsibility on the railway administration.
</p><p id="p_23">     The history  and the  object  with	 which	the  radical
provisions of  the new Act were introduced bear testimony to
change of the nature
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">513</span>
of the liability of the railway administration. But in order
to avoid  the payment  of double damages,<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_76"> ss. 76</a> and <a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_77">78</a> have
been inserted.	In other  words, where	due to	delay on the
part of	 the Railway  there  is	 physical  deterioration  or
diminishing of	the value of the goods, the plaintiff cannot
claim damages  by way  of loss	of profits or loss of market
plus damages  sustained by  the actual loss or deterioration
of the	goods. In  such a  case the plaintiff can claim only
the actual  loss  in  the  value  of  the  goods  caused  by
destruction, damage or deterioration and not loss of profit.
<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_78">Section 78(d)</a> which flows out of<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_79"> s. 76</a> clearly provides that
the railway  administration shall not be responsible for any
indirect or  consequential damages or for loss of particular
market. The  Solicitor-General, therefore, rightly contended
that in cases falling squarely within the four corners of<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_80"> s.
76</a> of  the new	Act,<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_81"> s.	 78(d)</a> will  apply. In fact<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_82"> s. 78(d)</a>
merely incorporates  the measure  of damages as contemplated
by<a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_83"> s. 73</a> itself. It is well settled that the liability of an
ordinary carrier  even in  the English	common law  does not
extend to  a damage  which is  indirect or  remote. Loss  of
profit or  loss of  a particular  market has  been held by a
number of decisions to be a remote damage and can be awarded
only if	 it is	proved that  the party	which is  guilty  of
committing the breach was aware or had knowledge that such a
loss would  be caused.	<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_84">Section 78(d)</a>, however, seeks to bar
the remedy  of this  kind of  damage. In  the instant  case,
however, as  the plaintiff  itself has	not claimed  loss of
market or  remote damages, the question of application of<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_85"> s.
78(d)</a> does  not arise.	Moreover, in the instant case, it is
conceded that  there was  no physical  deterioration of	 the
goods at  all which were delivered to the consignee at Poona
in the	same condition	as they	 were booked from Bhillai by
the plaintiff.	In these  circumstances,  the  case  of	 the
plaintiff does	not fall  within the  four corners of<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_86"> s. 76</a>,
nor does  it fulfil any of the categories mentioned therein.
If<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_87"> s.  76</a> does	not apply  to the facts of the present case,
then<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_88"> s.	 78</a> will  also have  no application,  because<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_89"> s.  78</a>
starts with  a non obstante clause "Notwithstanding anything
contained in  the foregoing  provisions of  this Chapter,  a
railway	 administration	  shall	 not  be  responsible".	 We,
therefore, agree with the learned counsel for the respondent
that under the new Act the liability of the Railway has been
increased so  as to take upon itself the responsibility of a
common carrier.
</p><p id="p_24">     Counsel for the respondent submitted that even if<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_90"> s. 76</a>
barred the  remedy of  the plaintiff,  the fact	 that due to
delay in delivery there was loss of profit or loss of market
would amount  to "deterioration	 as contemplated by<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_91"> s. 76</a> of
the new	 Act. In  support of  this contention,	the  learned
counsel relied	on a decision of the Allahabad High Court in
<a href="/doc/1524732/" id="a_92">G.I.P. Railway Co. &amp; others v. Jugul Kishore Mukat Lal</a> where
Sulaiman, Ag. C.J., as he then was, observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  "It is  clear to  us that  the meaning of the word
     "deterioration" in	<a href="/doc/127022/" id="a_93"> s. 161</a>	 which imposes the liability
     on the railway company must be the same as in risk-note
     form B which lays
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">514</span>
     down the  special conditions  under which	the  railway
     company is	 protected. In	both  these  "deterioration"
     resulting	from  a	 delay	in  tendering  the  good  is
     contemplated. x  x	 x  We	therefore  accept  the	view
     expressed by  Mukerji, J.,	 in the	 unreported case and
     hold that	the word  "deterioration" is  wide enough to
     include depreciation  in value  on account of a fall in
     the price of the goods."
</blockquote><p id="p_25">The same  view appears to have been taken by the Orissa High
Court in  <a href="/doc/1993975/" id="a_94">Union of  India  and	others	v.  Messrs</a>.  Sheobux
Satyanarayan where  Misra, J.,	as he  then was, observed as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	  "Though there was some difference of opinion as to
     the import	 of the word "deterioration" used in <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_95">section
     72</a> of the Indian Railways Act and in <a href="/doc/1818621/" id="a_96">section 161</a> of the
     Indian Contract  Act, the	position is now well settled
     that it is wide enough to include depreciation in value
     on account of a fall in the price of the goods."</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">     As against	 this a	 Division Bench	 of the	 Lahore High
Court in  R. I.	 Railway Co.  Ltd. v.  Diana Mal Gulab Singh
observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	  "The 'deterioration'	of a thing, whether it be in
     quality or	 in value,  implies in	ordinary parlance  a
     change for the worse in the thing itself. If a thing is
     worth less	 than it  was before only because the market
     rate has  gone down  it would be correct to say that it
     has  depreciated	in  value,   but  not  that  it	 has
     deteriorated."</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">     Having regard  to the  background and  the	 setting  in
which the  word "deterioration"	 occurs in <a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_97"> s. 76</a> of the new
Act it	seems to  us that  the parliament  intended that the
word should  be used  in the  ordinary	parlance  and  in  a
restricted sense  so as	 to include  within  its  ambit	 the
actual physical act of deterioration, i.e. the physical part
of it,	namely, the change for the worse in the thing itself
as very aptly put by Martineau, J., in the Lahore High Court
judgment referred  to above.  We must  seek to	draw a clear
distinction between  a physical deterioration of a thing and
depreciation in	 its value  according to market price. These
are two	 separate concepts  having separate ingredients. The
words  used  in	<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_98"> s.  76</a>	 of  the  new  Act,  namely,  "loss,
destruction,  damage  or  deterioration"  must	be  read  as
ejusdem generis	 so as	to indicate  the actual and physical
loss or	 change in the goods contemplated by<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_99"> s. 76</a>. In these
circumstances, therefore, with due respect, we are unable to
agree with  the somewhat  broad view  taken by the Allahabad
High Court  and followed  by the  Orissa High  Court in	 the
cases referred	to above.  We, on  the other hand, prefer to
adopt the  view taken  by the  Lahore High Court in the case
referred to  above. In	this view of the matter, it is clear
that the  word "deterioration" used in<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_100"> s. 76</a> referred to the
physical and  actual deterioration  of the  goods which	 has
admittedly  not	  taken	 place	in  the	 present  case.	 The
plaintiff cannot take advantage of<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_101"> s. 76</a> relying on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">515</span>
word "deterioration"  because of  the finding  of negligence
entered by  the Courts	below. The  case of the plaintiff is
clearly taken out of the ambit of<a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_102"> ss. 76</a> and <a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_103">78</a> and his suit
for damage  also cannot be defeated on the ground that it is
barred by <a href="/doc/1317075/" id="a_104"> s. 76</a> or<a href="/doc/1398114/" id="a_105"> s. 78</a> of the new Act. We are, therefore,
of the	opinion that  in view of the finding of fact arrived
by the Courts below the plaintiff is undoubtedly entitled to
damages
     This brings  us to	 the second contention raised by the
Solicitor  General,   namely,  that  the  plaintiff  is	 not
entitled to  interest as damages for breach of the contract.
It was	submitted that	what the  plaintiff has	 done is  to
calculate interest at the rate of 12% which has been reduced
to 6%  per annum  on the amount deposited by him in the Bank
which remained	locked up  for more  than six  months and to
claim the  same	 as  damages.  It  was	contended  that	 the
plaintiff plainly  could not  do so  in view of the <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_106">Interest
Act</a> under  which interest can only be charged before suit if
so stipulated  by the  parties to the contract. It is common
ground that  in the  present case  the contract	 between the
parties does  not provide  for	charging  any  interest	 for
breach	of  contract.  The  Solicitor-General  relied  on  a
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/823952/" id="a_107">Union of India v. Watkins Mayore &amp;
Company</a> where this Court observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	  "<a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_108">Under the Interest Act</a>, 1839, the Court may allow
     interest of  the plaintiff	 if the	 amount claimed is a
     sum certain  which is  payable at	a  certain  time  by
     virtue of a written instrument. But it is conceded that
     the amount	 claimed in  this case	is not a sum certain
     but compensation  for unliquidated amount. On behalf of
     the respondent  it was  submitted by Mr. Aggarwala that
     interest may  be awarded  under the  <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_109">Interest Act</a> which
     contains a provision that "interest shall be payable in
     all cases	in which it is now payable by law". But this
     provision only  applies to	 cases in which the Court of
     Equity exercises jurisdiction to allow interest.
</blockquote><p id="p_28">In the	above case  the plaintiff  had brought	a  suit	 for
damages claiming  a  particular	 quantified  amount  of	 Rs.
1,07,700/- as  compensation for	 storage of over 600 tons of
iron sheets  for a particular period. This quantified amount
included a  sum of  Rs. 2,974/2/- as interest on the various
sums claimed  by  the  plaintiff  as  compensation,  namely,
godown	rent,	chowkidar's  salary,  cartage  from  Railway
station to  godown etc.	 The High  Court, however, granted a
decree only  for Rs.  27,525/5/-  including  the  amount  of
interest claimed  by the  plaintiff. Thus this Court in that
case was  dealing with interest claimed by the plaintiff not
as a  yardstick for assessing damages but as pure and simple
interest on the quantified amount of compensation or damages
claimed by  the plaintiff. This Court held that the interest
to the	extent of  Rs. 2,974/2/- as claimed by the plaintiff
could not  be allowed  in the  absence of  there  being	 any
contract justifying  the charging  of  such  interest.	This
Court was  not at all concerned with a case like the present
one where  the plaintiff has merely claimed damages pure and
simple and in order to assess the same had applied the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">516</span>
yardstick of  charging interest	 at a particular rate on the
locked up  capital for	a period of more than six months. In
these circumstances,  therefore the  ratio of  the aforesaid
decision  in   Watkins	Mayore	&amp;  Company  (supra)  is	 not
applicable to the facts of the present case.
</p><p id="p_29">     Similarly in <a href="/doc/1477080/" id="a_110">Bengal Nagpur Railway Co. Ltd. v. Ruttanji
Ramji</a> which  was relied upon by this Court in Watkins Mayore
&amp; Company  (supra) the amount claimed by the plaintiff was a
specified amount  on the basis of which interest was charged
which had  the effect  of increasing the damages sought for.
That was  a case  of a contractor who had brought a suit for
recovery of  the amount	 due from  the Government Department
and had	 added interest	 to the	 total	claim  made  by	 the
plaintiff. The	Privy Council  pointed out that as there was
no stipulation	which authorized  the  plaintiff  to  charge
interest on  the quantified amount of damages, the plaintiff
was not	 entitled to any interest. Thus, in other words, the
ratio of  the decision	in Ruttanji  Ramji's case as also in
Watkins Mayore	&amp; Company  (supra) would  apply only to such
cases where  interest by  way  of  damages  is	claimed	 for
wrongful detention  of a  debt	or  where  the	interest  is
claimed on  a specified	 amount due  or claimed	 against any
debtor. The  principle adumbrated in the two cases mentioned
above will  not apply  to cases where the plaintiff does not
claim interest	on a  quantified amount	 or on	damages	 but
where  the   plaintiff	merely	 calculates  interest  as  a
yardstick or measure to assess the damages which he would be
entitled to.  In the  instant case  the	 Courts	 below	have
clearly found  that the plaintiff had deposited a sum of Rs.
27,332-44 in  the Bank	soon after  booking the	 consignment
with  the   railway  administration.  The  plaintiff  was  a
stockist and  as the  money in	the Bank remained idle for a
period of  more than  six months due to the delayed delivery
made by	 the Railway  on  account  of  its  negligence,	 the
plaintiff  merely  claimed  compensation  for  this  delayed
delivery on  the basis	that if the amount was not locked up
it would  have earned  some interest  which would yield some
profit to  the plaintiff.  Thus it is clear, therefore, that
in the	instant case  the plaintiff neither claimed interest
on any	quantified amount,  nor did  he claim  profit due to
loss of market.

Bench of  the Allahabad	 High Court,  while interpreting the
decision of the Privy Council referred to above, observed as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	  "We do  not consider	that this  case is authority
     for the  proposition that interest cannot be claimed by
     way of  damages for  breach of  a contract under<a href="/doc/1379524/" id="a_112"> s. 73</a>,
     <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_113">Contract Act</a>. All that was held in it was that interest
     cannot be	allowed	 by  way  of  damages  for  wrongful
     detention of  debt. *  * *	 The position  is  different
     where interest  is claimed	 as part  of the damages for
     breach of a contract.
</blockquote><p id="p_31">A similar view was taken by a Division Bench decision of the
Patna High  Court in  The Official  Receiver, Calcutta	High
Court and <a href="/doc/1691662/" id="a_114">another
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">517</span>
v. Baneshwar  Prasad Singh and another</a>. We find ourselves in
complete agreement  with the  principles laid  down in those
cases.
</p><p id="p_32">     For these	reasons, therefore,  we are  of the  opinion
that the  decision of this Court in Watkins Mayore &amp; Company
(supra) does  not appear  to be	 of any	 assistance  to	 the
appellant, so  far as  the facts  of the  present  case	 are
concerned. Thus	 it is clear that there is no question of<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_115"> s.
73</a> of  the Contract  Act overriding  the provisions  of	 the
<a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_116">Interest Act</a>,  because in  the instant case the <a href="/doc/910984/" id="a_117">Interest Act</a>
has no application at all inasmuch as no interest is claimed
by the	plaintiff at  all but  interest has  been used	as a
measure to  determine the  compensation which  the plaintiff
could seek  against the	 appellant  for	 its  negligence  in
causing inordinate  delay in  the delivery of the goods. The
contention raised  by the  learned Solicitor-General on this
point is, therefore, overruled.
</p><p id="p_33">     The plaintiff is not claiming the sum decreed by way of
interest but  he is  claiming the  damages calculated  on  a
particular  basis.  As	a  common  carrier  the	 Railway  is
undoubtedly responsible	 for  breach  of  contract.  In	 the
instant case  the Railway  Receipt shows that the goods were
booked to  be carried  from Bhillai to Poona which is on the
Nagpur	route.	There  was  absolutely	no  reason  nor	 any
occasion for  the Railway to divert the goods to a different
route and  for taking  the same to a different route and for
taking the  same to  Aurangabad which  did not	fall on	 the
route to  Poona at all. The Courts below, therefore, rightly
found that the Railway was guilty of gross negligence.
</p><p id="p_34">     The last  question submitted  by the  learned Solicitor
General was  that the  plaintiff was not entitled to loss of
profit or  loss of  market, because  the plaintiff  has	 not
pleaded anywhere  that he  had obtained	 any permit  for the
goods which,  were a controlled commodity and sustained loss
of market.  It is  true that  the plaintiff  has not pleaded
this fact,  but the  plaintiff has not at all prayed for any
damages on  the ground	of loss of market or loss of profit.
The plaintiff  has only claimed nominal damages for the loss
which occurred	to him	because of the amount of money which
he had	deposited in  the Bank	and was locked for more than
six months  due to the delayed delivery. The Trial Court has
already scaled	down the  amount from  Rs. 2,378-65  to	 Rs.
1,250/- and  we think  the Trial Court was fully entitled to
do so.
</p><p id="p_35">     In these  circumstances, therefore, all the contentions
raised by the Solicitor General fail and we find no merit in
this appeal which is accordingly dismissed with costs.
</p><pre id="pre_3">P.B.R.					   Appeal dismissed.
