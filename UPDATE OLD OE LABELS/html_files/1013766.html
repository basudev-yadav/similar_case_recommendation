JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
S.   RATNAVEL	PANDIAN,   J.-	The   salient	and   indeed
substantial legal question which looms for determination  in
this appeal may be formulated as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      Whether  a  Magistrate before  whom  a  person
	      arrested under subsection (1) of <a href="/doc/1109803/" id="a_1">Section 35</a> of
	      the  Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  of	1973
	      which is in pari materia with sub-section	 (1)
	      of <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_2">Section 104</a> of the Customs Act of 1962,  is
	      produced	under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1109803/" id="a_3">Section  35</a>
	      of  the Foreign Exchange Regulation  Act,	 has
	      jurisdiction  to authorise detention  of	that
	      person  under  <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_4">Section 167(2)</a> of the  Code  of
	      Criminal Procedure?
</blockquote><p id="p_2">2.   As	 a preclude to the judgment, we would like to  state
that  though  the  appellant in the present  case  has	been
arrested  under	 sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1109803/" id="a_5">Section  35</a>	 of  Foreign
Exchange  Regulation Act, 1973 (hereinafter referred  to  as
the  'FERA') and taken to the Magistrate  under	 sub-section
(2)  thereof, we while disposing the legal  questions  posed
for   determination,   are  inclined  to   deal	  with	 the
corresponding provisions under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_6">Customs Act</a> also for	 the
reasons	  (i)  that  the scheme for both the  FERA  and	 the
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_7">Customs	 Act</a> is more or less the same; (ii)  the  provisions
relating to the arrest and production of the arrestee before
the  Magistrate are identical; (iii) the arguments  by	both
the  parties have been advanced pertaining to provisions  of
both the Acts; and (iv)	 almost	 all  the  decisions   cited
relate to the provisions of both the Acts.
</p><p id="p_3">3.   There  is	a vertical cleavage of opinion	amongst	 the
various High Courts on	the above legal question  which	 has
come up for adjudication in the present appeal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">447</span>
<p id="p_4">4.   This  appeal, by special leave is directed against	 the
judgment  of  the High Court of Delhi dated  April  6,	1990
rendered  by a five-Judge Bench in Criminal Writ No. 316  of
1989 overruling the decision of the same High Court in <a href="/doc/282542/" id="a_8">Union
of  India v. O.P. Gupta</a>' rendered in Criminal Writ Nos.	 104
and 116 of 1984 by a three-Judge Bench reversing an  earlier
decision  in <a href="/doc/1599500/" id="a_9">Dalam Chand Baid v. Union of India2</a>  which	 was
decided	 by a Division Bench of the same High Court  holding
that a Magistrate has no power to remand a person accused of
an offence punishable under the <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_10">Foreign Exchange  Regulation
Act</a>,  1973 (hereinafter refer-red to as 'FERA') to  judicial
custody.
</p><p id="p_5">5.   Though  normally, it may not be necessary to  make	 any
reference about the constitution of a particular bench which
is  the prerogative of the Chief Justice of the	 High  Court
concerned,  yet	 regrettably  in this case,  it	 has  become
unavoidable to make reference concerning the constitution of
the  Bench  since  during the course  of  the  arguments,  a
diatribe,   though  not	 justifiable  was  made	 about	 the
formation  of the Bench, presided over by Charanjit  Talwar,
J.  who	 gave  a dissenting judgment in	 the  case  of	O.P.
Gupta'.
</p><p id="p_6">6.   In Gupta case' the Bench was presided over by Yogeshwar
Dayal,	J.  (as he then was) and two other  learned  Judges,
namely,	 Charanjit Talwar and Malik Sharief-Ud-Din,  JJ.  of
whom Charanjit Talwar, J. gave his dissenting judgment.
</p><p id="p_7">7.   When the decision of Gupta case' was holding the field,
Respondent I namely Deepak Mahajan was arrested on March 13,
1989  by the officers of the Enforcement Directorate for  an
offence	 punishable under the provisions of FERA  and  taken
before	the  Additional Chief Metropolitan  Magistrate,	 New
Delhi on the next date as per the mandate of sub-section (2)
of <a href="/doc/1109803/" id="a_11">Section 35</a> of the said Act.	An application under <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_12">Section
167(2)</a>	of  the	 Code  of  Criminal  Procedure	(hereinafter
referred  to  as 'the Code') was moved	by  the	 Enforcement
Officer	  seeking  petitioner's	 detention  under   judicial
custody	 commonly known in the legal parlance  as  'judicial
remand' on the ground that it was necessary to complete	 the
investigation.	 On  the  very	same  day,  the	  respondent
unsuccessfully	moved  the court for bail.   The  Magistrate
remanded  the  first  respondent  to  judicial	custody	 for
fourteen  days	and  subsequently  extended  the   detention
period.	 The first respondent challenged the jurisdiction of
the Magistrate in authorising the detention (remand) and the
subsequent   consecutive  extensions.	But  his  plea	 was
rejected on the basis of the decision in Gupta case'.	This
order of the Magistrate was impugned before the High  Court.
The Division Bench of the High Court comprising of Charanjit
Talwar,	 V.B.  Bansal, JJ. in the light of the	decision  of
this  Court  in	 Chaganti Satyanarayana v.  State  of  A.p.3
holding	 that  the powers of remand vested in  a  Magistrate
become exercisable only after an accused is produced

before him in terms of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_13">Section 167</a> of the
Code, referred the matter by its order dated March 12,	1980
to  a larger Bench opining that the law laid down  in  Gupta
case'	was   no  longer  a  good  law	 and   it   required
reconsideration.   The	learned Chief Justice  of  the	High
Court on such reference constituted a Full Bench  comprising
of  Charanjit Talwar, J.C. Jain and V.B. Bansal,  JJ.	This
three-Judge  Bench  after hearing the  matter  for  sometime
expressed  their  view	that the case should  be  heard	 and
decided	 by a five-Judge Bench since the judgment  in  Gupta
case'  was already decided by a three-Judge Bench.   It	 was
under	those  circumstances,  the  Bench  was	 constituted
comprising  of	Charanjit  Talwar,  Malik   Sliarief-Ud-Din,
Sunanda	 Bhandare, P.K. Bahri and R.L. Gupta, JJ.  Thus	 the
said case was heard by a five-Judge Bench.
</p><p id="p_8">8.   By majority (per Charanjit Talwar, Sunanda Bhandare and
P.K.  Bahri,  JJ.)  the decision in  Gupta  case'  has	been
overruled  though  Malik ShariefUd-Din and R.L.	 Gupta,	 JJ.
gave  their separate dissenting judgments.  The	 result	 was
that the dictum laid down in Gupta case' to the effect	that
there  is  " power available to a Magistrate  under  <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_14">Section
167(2)</a>	of the Code to commit to custody a  person  produced
before	him  by a Customs Officer under <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_15">Section 104</a>  of	 the
Customs	 Act", has been overruled.  However, the  conclusion
of  Gupta  case' that "<a href="/doc/848468/" id="a_16">Section 437</a> of the Code	of  Criminal
Procedure  does	 not  confer implied power of  remand  on  a
Magistrate" has been upheld.
</p><p id="p_9">9.   Consequent	 upon the above dictum by majority,  it	 has
been  held  in the present case that the Magistrate  has  no
power  to remand a person produced before him in  accordance
with Section 35(2) of FERA.
</p><p id="p_10">10.  In this connection, be it noted that the provisions  of
Section 35 of FERA [which corresponds to <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_17">Section 19-B</a> of the
old  FERA Act (VII of 1947)] and sub-sections (1) to (3)  of
<a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_18">Section 104</a> of the Customs Act are identical and they do not
explicitly  lay down the procedure as to how the  Magistrate
should deal with an arrestee, when brought before him either
by the Officer of the Enforcement Directorate or the Customs
Officer, as the case may be.
</p><p id="p_11">11.  For proper understanding and scrutiny of this rule, let
us  reproduce the relevant provisions of Section 35 of	FERA
and <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_19">Section 104</a> of the Customs Act.
</p><p id="p_12">"Section 35 of FERA

</p><p id="p_18">12.  Though  there is no specific provision in FERA as	sub-
section	 (4) of <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_25">Section 104</a> of the Customs Act,	 <a href="/doc/1168758/" id="a_26">Section  62</a>
speaks of non-cognizable offences and that section reads  as
follows:

	      thereunder which prohibits the doing of an act
	      without permission, no such complaint shall be
	      made unless the person accused of the  offence
	      has been given an opportunity of showing	that
	      he had such permission."
</blockquote><p id="p_19">14.  The  key questions that come up for  consideration	 are
whether	 a  Magistrate before whom a person  arrested  under
<a href="/doc/1177078/" id="a_35">Section	 35</a>  is taken can detain that arrestee	in  judicial
custody	 and if not, what the Magistrate is expected to	 do?
To answer those questions, we have to examine sub-section
(2) of Section 35 of FERA and sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_36">Section 104</a>
of the Customs Act which are in pari materia reading:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	      "Every  person arrested under sub-section	 (1)
	      shall, without unnecessary delay, be taken  to
	      a Magistrate."
</blockquote><p id="p_20">15.  Apart  from the power of arrest provided under  Section
35  of the FERA, <a href="/doc/731089/" id="a_37">Section 45</a> of that Act empowers any  police
officer	 not below the rank of a Sub-Inspector of Police  or
any  other  officer  of	 the  Central  Government  or  State
Government  authorised	by the Central	Government  in	this
behalf	to enter into any public place and search  and	also
arrest	without	 warrant  any person found  therein  who  is
reasonably suspected of having committed or of committing or
of being about to commit any contravention of the provisions
of  sub-section	 (1)  of  <a href="/doc/1045067/" id="a_38">Section 8</a>.  The  procedure  to  be
followed, after effecting such arrest is contemplated  under
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/731089/" id="a_39">Section 45</a> which states that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	      "Where  any  person  is  arrested	 under	sub-
	      section (1) by an officer other than a  police
	      officer,	  such	 officer   shall,    without
	      unnecessary  delay,  take or send	 the  person
	      arrested	  before   a	Magistrate    having
	      jurisdiction   in	 the  case  or	before	 the
	      officer-in-charge of a police station."
</blockquote><p id="p_21">In this context, a perplexed question arises as to what	 the
Magistrate  or	the  police officer has to do  in  case	 the
arrestee under Section 45(1) of FERA is taken or sent before
him?   <a href="/doc/1982368/" id="a_40">Section	46</a>  lays down the procedure  in	 respect  of
foreign	 exchange  or  any  other  goods  seized  by  police
officers.   Though  we are not very much concerned  in	this
case  with the procedure laid down in <a href="/doc/1982368/" id="a_41">Section 46</a>,  the	fact
remains that in the FERA, the police officers are given some
independent   authority	 to  act  in  exercise	of   certain
provisions  of	this  Act.  There is  no  provision  in	 the
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_42">Customs Act</a> similar to Sections 45 and 46
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">451</span>
of  the FERA.  However, <a href="/doc/1969318/" id="a_43">Section 151</a> of Customs Act  empowers
and  requires  certain specified officers  enumerated  under
clauses	 (a)  to (e) to assist officers of  Customs  in	 the
execution of the Act.  One of the officers enumerated  under
clause	(c) is 'officers of police'.  But this section	does
not empower police officers to exercise the powers conferred
upon  customs  officers	 by  and  under	 the  Act  but	only
authorises  and requires the police officers to	 assist	 the
customs officer in the exercise of their powers.
</p><p id="p_22">16.  The 'proper officer' referred to in various  provisions
of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_44">Customs Act</a>, who is to perform any function under the
said Act, means the officer of Customs who is assigned those
functions  by the Board or Collector of Customs	 as  defined
under  clause (34) of <a href="/doc/1168369/" id="a_45">Section 2</a> of Customs Act, but it	does
not  include  the officers of Police or any  other  officers
enumerated under <a href="/doc/1969318/" id="a_46">Section 151</a>.  Therefore the police officers
have  no independent role to play in exercise of the  powers
under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_47">Customs Act</a> as in Sections 45 and 46 of the FERA.
</p><p id="p_23">17.  For  the disposal of this appeal, we have to deal	with
the intendment and application of various provisions of	 the
FERA  particularly  <a href="/doc/1177078/" id="a_48">Sections  35</a>, <a href="/doc/731089/" id="a_49">45</a>,  <a href="/doc/1982368/" id="a_50">46</a>,  <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_51">Section  104</a>  of
Customs Act, Section 68 of the Gold Control Act and  various

<a href="/doc/727944/" id="a_53">Sections  4(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1982806/" id="a_54">41</a>, <a href="/doc/770959/" id="a_55">56</a>, <a href="/doc/537857/" id="a_56">57</a>, <a href="/doc/344610/" id="a_57">157(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_58">167(1)(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_59">436</a>, <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_60">437</a>	 and
the allied provisions, in the light of the principles of law
enunciated  by the judicial pronouncements of this Court  as
well  as  of  some High Courts.	 In fact,  in  the  impugned
judgment,  the	High  Court  also  has	examined  all  those
provisions  from various angles, but the question  would  be
whether the interpretation given and the conclusion  arrived
at by the majority of the court below can be sustained?
</p><p id="p_24">18.  Reverting	to the judgment under  challenge,  Charanjit
Talwar,	 J.  in	 his separate judgment	with  which  Sunanda
Bhandare and P.K. Bahri, JJ. agreed, has given the following
reasons for his conclusions.  Those being:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      (1)   Neither  an officer of  Enforcement	 nor
	      the Customs Officer within the meaning of	 the
	      provisions of FERA or <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_61">Customs Act</a> respectively
	      is  a  police officer, in charge of  a  police

	      Officer, as the case may be, cannot  authorise
	      the  detention of the persons so	produced  or
	      presented,  either to judicial custody  or  to

</blockquote><p id="p_25">19.  Ere  we  turn  to	the  legal  issues  raised  by	 the
respective  parties, it has become inevitably  necessary  to
first examine the issues on the legal principle and then  to
interpret  the construction of the language of the  statute,
deployed  both implicitly and explicitly with  reference  to
the  provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_73"> of the Code</a> and of the other allied  special
laws.
</p><p id="p_26">20.  Manifestly, the significant and axial issue that arises
in  this appeal for decision is pristinely a legal  question
which  we  have	 indicated  in the  proemial  part  of	this
judgment and which we have to examine in the backdrop of the
various	 provisions of the general procedural laws,  keeping
in mind of the dividing arguendo and the shades of divergent
judicial   opinions  of	 various  High	Courts	though	 the
controversy centres around a short point.
</p><p id="p_27">21.  In	 order	to resolve that controversy, it	 has  become
essential  to  focus  our attention on the  task  of  proper
application  of	 the  concerned	 law  by  ascertaining	 the
purposeful meaning of the language deployed, the spirit	 and
sense which the legislature has aimed and intended to convey
and  the conclusions to be drawn which are in the  tenor  of
the law though not within the letter of the law.
</p><p id="p_28">22.  In	 the background of the above principle of  statutory
interpretation,	 now  coming to and dealing with  the  legal
challenges, several vital queries have to be considered	 and
answered.  Those are:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	      (1)   Whether   the   jurisdiction   of	 the
	      Magistrate   to  authorise  detention  of	  an

	      judicial	custody or otherwise  under  <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_74">Section

	      ousted by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">	      453</span>
	      the  absence of any specific provision in	 the

	      Magistrate to authorise the detention' of	 the
	      arrestee under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_76"> the Code</a>?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	      (2)   When the jurisdiction of the  Magistrate
	      to   authorise  detention	 is  not   expressly
	      forbidden	  by   any   specific	exclusionary
	      provision	  and	when   such   exclusion	  of
	      jurisdiction  cannot  be	clearly	 implied  or
	      readily	 inferred,   does   the	   detention
	      authorised   by  the  Magistrate	 either	  to
	      judicial custody or otherwise become ab initio
	      void  and	 illegal and can the  Magistrate  be
	      said to have exceeded or abused his authority?
	      (3)   What is the procedure to be followed and
	      the order required to be passed	  by	 the
	      Magistrate  when a person arrested  under	 the
	      FERA or <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_77">Customs Act</a> is presented before him?</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">	      (4)   When  the  Officer	of  Enforcement	  or
	      Customs Officer is not inclined to release the
	      arrestee	on bail or otherwise  by  exercising
	      the power under sub-section (3) of Section  35
			    of	FERA or <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_78">Section 104</a> of the Customs Act,	 a
s
	      the  case	 may be, but produces  the  arrestee
	      before a Magistrate as mandated by sub-section
	      (2)  of the abovesaid provisions, will it	 not
	      be   a  legal  absurdity	to  say	  that	 the
	      Magistrate   should  forthwith  let   go	 the
	      arrestee	without ordering detention and	also
	      extension of further detention or remand? and
	      (5)   Whether  the  Magistrate  has  no  other
	      alternative  except to release  that  arrested
	      person, produced before him on bail or  direct
	      him  to be freed unconditionally	and  whether
	      the Magistrate is completely stripped off	 his
	      authority	 to  refuse  bail and  take  him  to
	      judicial custody?
</p><p id="p_30">The  above  questions  are  some  of  the  legal  challenges
canvassed before the Full Bench of the High Court, which  by
a majority opinion, has negatively answered.
</p><p id="p_31">23.  Keeping  in  view the cardinal principle  of  law	that
every law is designed to further the ends of justice but not
to frustrate on the mere technicalities, we shall deal	with
all those challenges in the background of the principles  of
statutory interpretations and of the purpose and the  spirit
of the concerned Acts as gathered from their intendment.
</p><p id="p_32">24.  The  concerned  relevant provisions of  the  Acts	with
which  we are concerned, no doubt, pose some  difficulty  in
resolving  the question with regard to the  jurisdiction  of
the   Magistrate   authorising	detention   and	  subsequent
extension of the same when the provisions of those Acts	 are
narrowly and literally interpreted.  Though the function  of
the courts is only to expound the law and not to  legislate,
nonetheless  the  legislature  cannot be  asked	 to  sit  to
resolve	 the  difficulties  in	the  implementation  of	 its
intention and the spirit of the law.  In such circumstances,
it is the duty of the court to mould or creatively interpret
the legislation by liberally interpreting the statute.
</p><p id="p_33">25.  In Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Tenth Edn. at

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">454</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">	      "Where  the  language  of a  statute,  in	 its

	      apparent purpose of the enactment, or to	some
	      inconvenience   or  absurdity,   hardship	  or
	      injustice,   presumably	not   intended,	   a

	      draftsman's unskilfulness or ignorance of	 the
	      law,  except  in a case of necessity,  or	 the
	      absolute intractability of the language used."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	      26.   In Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v.  Asher4
	      Denning, L.J. said:

thus : (SCC p. 285, para 148)
	      "Perhaps,	 with the passage of time, what	 may
	      be  described  as the extension  of  a  method
	      resembling   the	'arm-chair  rule'   in	 the
	      construction of wills, Judges can more frankly
	      step  into the shoes of the legislature  where
	      an enactment leaves its own intentions in much
	      too nebulous or uncertain a state."
</p><p id="p_35">					       (emphasis

</p><p id="p_36">	      28.   It	will be befitting, in this  context,
	      to recall the view expressed by Judge Frank in
	      Guiseppi v. Walling8 which read thus:
</p><p id="p_37">	      "The  necessary generality in the wordings  of
	      many  statutes, and ineptness of	drafting  in

	      as they can, to fill in the gaps, an  activity
	      which  no matter how one may label it,  is  in
	      part  legislative.  Thus the courts  in  their
	      way,  as	administrators perform the  task  of
	      supplementing   statutes.	  In  the  case	  of
	      courts,	we  call  it   'interpretation'	  or
	      'filling	 in  the  gaps';  in  the  case	  of
	      administrators  we  call	it  'delegation'  or
	      authority to supply the details."

India10</a> has stated thus: (SCR p. 89 : SCC p. 586, para 23)
	      "A bare mechanical interpretation of the words
	      'devoid  of  concept or purpose'	will  reduce
	      most  of	legislation to futility.   It  is  a

Inspector of Mines v. Ramjee11</a>: "To be literal in meaning is
to see the skin and miss the soul of the Regulation."
</p><p id="p_41">31.  True,  normally courts should be slow to pronounce	 the
legislature   to  have	been  mistaken	in  its	  constantly
manifested  opinion upon a matter resting wholly within	 its
will and take its plain ordinary grammatical meaning of	 the
words  of the enactment as affording the best guide, but  to
winch  up  the	legislative intent, it	is  permissible	 for
courts	to take into account of the ostensible	purpose	 and
object	and the real legislative intent.  Otherwise, a	bare
mechanical  interpretation of the words and  application  of
the  legislative  intent devoid of concept  of	purpose	 and
object will render the legislature inane.  In cases of	this
kind,  the  question is not what the words in  the  relevant
provision  mean	 but whether there are certain	grounds	 for
inferring   that   the	legislature  intended	to   exclude
jurisdiction of the courts from authorising the detention of
an  arrestee  whose arrest was effected on the	ground	that
there  is  reason to believe that the said person  has	been
guilty of an offence punishable under the provisions of FERA
or the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_84">Customs Act</a> which kind of offences seriously create a
dent  on  the economy of the nation and	 lead  to  hazardous
consequences.  Authorities, a few of which we have  referred
to   above,  show  that	 in  given  circumstances,   it	  is
permissible  for  courts to have functional  approaches	 and
look into the legislative intention and sometimes it may  be
even necessary to go behind the words and enactment and take
other  factors	into  consideration to give  effect  to	 the
legislative  intention and to the purpose and spirit of	 the
enactment  so that no absurdity or  practical  inconvenience
may  result and the legislative exercise and its  scope	 and
object may not become futile.
</p><p id="p_42">32.  In	 the light of the above exposition of the  principle
of  law,  we have no reason to believe and in  fact  do	 not
believe that the provisions of the

</p><p id="p_43">33.  Bearing in mind the above principles of  interpretation
and  the  legal proposition, we shall now approach  all	 the
challenges  canvassed  and examine the legal  issue  on	 the
principle of interpretation of law, more so with the aid  of
some  other  provisions	 of the procedural law	so  that  no
obscurity  or  absurdity may result in resolving  the  legal
intricacy posed for consideration in this case.
</p><p id="p_44">34.  To	 begin with, we shall examine the  primary  question
whether	 Section  35(2)	 of FERA or <a href="/doc/1982427/" id="a_86">Section  104(2)</a>  of	 the
Customs Act serves as a substitute to <a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_87">Section 167(1)</a> of	 the
Code.	To  say in other words, whether	 <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_88">Section  167(1)</a>  is
replaced  or substituted by the abovesaid provisions of	 two
special Acts.  The majority of the Judges in O.P. Gupta'  in
paragraph  37  had  posed  a  similar  question	 for   their
consideration  and answered that question in  the  following
words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	      "<a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_89">Section	 167(1)</a>	 of  the  Code	is   already
	      replaced by <a href="/doc/1982427/" id="a_90">Section 104(2)</a> of the Customs	 Act
	      and  <a href="/doc/582718/" id="a_91">Section  35(2)</a> of  the  Foreign  Exchange
	      Regulation  Act.	 What  is to be	 done  to  a
	      person   who   is	 so  produced	before	 the
	      Magistrate  is dealt with only  under  <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_92">Section
	      167(2)</a>  of  the  Code and	 not  under  <a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_93">Section
	      167(1)</a> of the Code."
</blockquote><p id="p_45">But  Talwar,  J. dissented from that  view  observing,	"the
power  to arrest a person coupled with the duty	 to  produce
him or present him before the Magistrate ipso facto does not
attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_94">Section 167</a> of the Code."
</p><p id="p_46">35.  The same learned Judge (Talwar, J.) in his judgment  in
Deepak	Mahajan	 which is impugned herein  again  considered
that  question	and reaffirmed his earlier  stand  rejecting
altogether  the	 contention that Section 35(2) of  FERA	 and
<a href="/doc/1982427/" id="a_95">Section 104(2)</a> of the Customs Act are substitutes to <a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_96">Section

mismatch of the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_97"> of the Code</a> and the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_98">Customs Act</a> and FERA, mainly on the ground that the pre-
requisite  conditions  required for  invocation	 of  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_99">Section
167(1)</a>	are  conspicuously absent in the provisions  of	 the
other two special Acts, those being: (1) <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_100">Section 167</a> of	 the
Code  specifically  refers  only to a  person  arrested	 and
detained  in  custody by a police  officer  on	well-founded
accusation   or	  information;	 (2)  there   must   be	  an
investigation  by a police officer as explained	 in  <a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_101">Section
167(1)</a>	of the Code; (3) the words 'officer-in-charge  of  a
police station or a police officer making the investigation,
if  he	is not below the rank of  Sub-Inspector'  cannot  be
substituted  by	 the words 'Customs Officer  or	 Officer  of
Enforcement'; (4) there is no question of transmission of  a
copy  of the entries in the diary as prescribed relating  to
the  case  in respect of the accused arrested  and  (5)	 the
person	arrested  by the Officer of Enforcement	 or  Customs
Officer is not an accused within the purview<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_102"> of the Code</a> and
that   the  officer  concerned	is  not	 investigating	 the
commission of an offence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">457</span>
triable	 by  a	Magistrate though they	have  been  given  a
limited	 power of the officer-in-charge of a police  station
"to grant or not to grant bail" and nothing more.
</p><p id="p_47">36.  The majority of the Judges in Deepak Mahajan have	gone
to  the	 extent	 of holding that <a href="/doc/708036/" id="a_103">Section 4(2)</a>  of  the	Code
cannot	come  in  aid  to  invoke  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_104">Section  167(2)</a>  even  on
interpretation	of the provisions of those two special	Acts
read with <a href="/doc/708036/" id="a_105">Section 4(2)</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_48">37.  We	 shall now examine the provisions of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_106">Section  167(1)</a>

shows  that  the  legislature  has  contemplated  that	 the
investigation  of the offence in case of a  person  arrested
without a warrant should be completed in the first  instance
within twenty-four hours and if the investigation cannot  be
completed  within  that	 period,  then	the  Magistrate	 can
authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as he
thinks fit for a term not exceeding fifteen days.

<a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_114">Section	 167</a>  of  the  Code  empowered	the  Magistrate	  to

a total period not exceeding sixty days and on the expiry of
the  said period of sixty days, the accused person shall  be

<a href="/doc/1889786/" id="a_115">Section 13(a)</a> of CrPC (Amendment) Act, 1978 w.e.f.  December
18, 1978 whereby the period of 60 days prescribed in general

modified as ninety days, where the investigation relates  to
an  offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life  or
imprisonment  for  a term of not less than  ten	 years,	 and
sixty  days,  where the investigation relates to  any  other

reasonable  cause  for	such extension	of  remand  was	 the
collection of sufficient evidence within the first period of
fifteen	 days  to raise a suspicion that the  accused  might
have  committed an offence and that it appeared likely	that
further evidence might be obtained by such a remand.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">458</span>
<p id="p_52">This extension of remand was for enabling the  investigating

satisfied  that adequate grounds exist for doing so, but  no
Magistrate can authorise the detention of the accused person

doubt is cleared by Explanation 1 of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_131">Section 167(2)</a>  stating
that  notwithstanding the expiry of the period specified  in
paragraph  (a), the accused shall be detained in custody  so
long  as he does not furnish bail.  We feel that it  is	 not

the expression person is arrested and detained in  custody".
The  word  'accused' occurring in the second  limb  of	sub-
section	 (1)  and in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_146">Section	 167</a>  refers
only that person "arrested and detained in custody".
</p><p id="p_59">46.  The  word	'arrest'  is derived from  the	French	word
'Arreter'  meaning  "to	 stop  or  stay"  and  signifies   a
restraint  of the person.  Lexicologically, the	 meaning  of
the word 'arrest' is given in various dictionaries depending
upon the circumstances in which the said expression is used.
One  of us, (S.	 Ratnavel Pandian, J. as he then  was  being
the  Judge of the High Court of Madras) in <a href="/doc/320371/" id="a_147">Roshan  Beevi  v.
Joint Secretary, Government of T.N</a>.17 had an occasion to  go
into  the  gamut of the meaning of the	word  'arrest'	with
reference  to  various textbooks and dictionaries,  the	 New
Encyclopaedia  Britannica,  Halsbury's Laws  of	 England,  A
Dictionary of Law by L.B. Curzon, Black's Law Dictionary and
Words  and  Phrases.  On the basis of the meaning  given  in
those text book sand lexicons, it has been held that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	      "[T]he word 'arrest' when used in its ordinary
	      and  natural sense, means the apprehension  or
	      restraint or the deprivation of one's personal
	      liberty.	 The question whether the person  is
	      under  arrest  or	 not,  depends	not  on	 the
	      legality of the arrest, but on whether he	 has
	      been  deprived of his personal liberty  to  go
	      where  he	 pleases.  When used  in  the  legal
	      sense in the procedure connected with criminal
	      offences,	 an  arrest consists in	 the  taking
	      into custody of another person under authority
	      empowered	 by law, for the purpose of  holding
	      or  detaining him to answer a criminal  charge
	      or of preventing the commission of a  criminal
	      offence.	The essential elements to constitute
	      an  arrest in the above sense are	 that  there
	      must   be	 an  intent  to	 arrest	 under	 the
	      authority,   accompanied	by  a	seizure	  or
	      detention of the person in the manner known to
	      law,  which  is so understood  by	 the  person
	      arrested."
</blockquote><p id="p_60">47.  There  are	 various sections in Chapter V of  the	Code
titled "Arrest of persons" of which <a href="/doc/1982806/" id="a_148">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1470344/" id="a_149">42</a>, <a href="/doc/1962770/" id="a_150">43</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/1161475/" id="a_151">44</a> empower different authorities and even private persons to
arrest	a person in given situation.  <a href="/doc/1982806/" id="a_152">Section 41</a> deals	with
the  power of a police officer to arrest any person  without
an order

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">460</span>
from  a Magistrate and without a warrant.  <a href="/doc/1470344/" id="a_153">Section 42</a>  deals
with the power of a police officer to arrest any person	 who
in  the	 presence of a police officer has committed  or	 has
been accused of committing a non-cognizable offence and	 who
refuses on demand "to give his name and residence or gives a
name  or residence which such officer has reason to  believe
to  be	false".	 <a href="/doc/1962770/" id="a_154">Section 43</a> empowers any private  person  to
arrest	any  person  who  in his  presence  commits  a	non-
cognizable offence, or any proclaimed offender.	 <a href="/doc/1161475/" id="a_155">Section  44</a>
states that when any offence is committed in the presence of
a Magistrate whether Executive or Judicial, within his local
jurisdiction,  he may himself arrest or order any person  to
arrest	the  offender  and  may	 thereupon  subject  to	 the
provisions  contained  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_156">  the Code</a> as to  bail	 commit	 the
offender to custody.
</p><p id="p_61">48.  Thus<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_157">  the	Code</a>  gives power of arrest not	 only  to  a
police	officer	 and  a Magistrate but	also  under  certain
circumstances  or  given  situations  to  private   persons.
Further, when an accused person appears before a  Magistrate
or  surrenders voluntarily, the Magistrate is  empowered  to
take  that  accused person into custody and  deal  with	 him
according to law.  Needless to emphasize that the arrest  of
a  person  is  a condition precedent  for  taking  him	into
judicial custody thereof.  To put it differently, the taking
of  the person into judicial custody is followed  after	 the
arrest	of  the	 person	 concerned  by	the  Magistrate	  on
appearance  or surrender.  It will be appropriate,  at	this
stage,	to note that in every arrest, there is	custody	 but
not  vice  versa  and  that both  the  words  'custody'	 and
'arrest'  are not synonymous terms.  Though 1  custody'	 may
amount	to an arrest in certain circumstances but not  under
all  circumstances.  If these two terms are  interpreted  as
synonymous,   it   is	nothing	 but   an   ultra   legalist
interpretation which if under all circumstances accepted and
adopted,  would	 lead to a startling  anomaly  resulting  in
serious consequences, vide Roshan Beevi17.
</p><p id="p_62">49.  While  interpreting the expression 'in custody'  within
the  meaning of <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_158">Section 439</a> CrPC, Krishna Iyer, J.  speaking
for the Bench in <a href="/doc/1920437/" id="a_159">Niranjan Singh v. Prabhakar	     Rajaram
Kharote18</a> observed that: (SCC p. 563, para 9)
	      "He  can	be in custody not  merely  when	 the
	      police  arrests  him, produces  him  before  a
	      Magistrate  and gets a remand to	judicial  or
	      other  custody.	He can be stated  to  be  in
	      judicial custody when he surrenders before the
	      court and submits to its directions."
</p><p id="p_63">50.  The next vital question, in this connection that  crops
up for consideration is as to whether the registration of  a
case  and the entries in the diary relating to that case  as
prescribed  by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_160">	the Code</a> are sine qua non for  a  Magistrate
taking into custody of a person when that person appears  or
surrenders  or is brought before the Magistrate and  whether
that  person should have assimilated the  characteristic  of
"an  accused of an offence" at that stage itself within	 the
meaning of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_161">Section 167</a> or subsection	 (1)
of <a href="/doc/848468/" id="a_162">Section 437</a> CrPC.
</p><p id="p_64">18 (1980) 2 SCC 559, 563: 1980 SCC (Cri) 508
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">461</span>
</p><p id="p_65">51.  This  question is in a way answered in  <a href="/doc/1308768/" id="a_163">Gurbaksh  Singh
Sibbia	v. State of Punjab19</a>.  While examining the scope  of
<a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_164">Section	 438</a>  of the Code in that  case,  Chandrachud,	C.J.
speaking for the Constitution Bench held that: (SCR p.	418:
SCC p. 590, para 37)
	      "The  filing of a first information report  is
	      not  a condition precedent to the exercise  of
	      the  powers under <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_165">Section 438</a>.  The  imminence
	      of  a  likely arrest founded on  a  reasonable
	      belief can be shown to exist even if an FIR is
	      not yet filed."
</p><p id="p_66">52.  The  dictum laid down in that case indicates  that	 the
registration of a case and the entries of the case diary are
not  necessary for entertaining an application for grant  of
anticipatory bail, but the mere imminence of a likely arrest
on a reasonable belief on an accusation of having  committed
a  nonbailable	offence, will be sufficient to	invoke	that
provision.
</p><p id="p_67">53.  In	 the  backdrop	of the	above  legal  position,	 the
conclusion  that  can be derived is that  a  Magistrate	 can
himself arrest or order any person to arrest any offender if
that  offender has committed an offence in his presence	 and
within	his  local  jurisdiction or  on	 his  appearance  or
surrender  or  is produced before him and take	that  person
(offender) into his custody subject to the bail	 provisions.
If a case is registered against an offender arrested by	 the
Magistrate and a follow-up investigation is initiated, or if
an  investigation has emanated qua the accusations  levelled
against	 the  person  appearing	 or  surrendering  or  being
brought	 before	 the  Magistrate,  the	Magistrate  can	  in
exercise  of the powers conferred on him by  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_166">Section  167(2)</a>
keep that offender or person under judicial custody in	case
the  Magistrate	 is not inclined to admit that	offender  or
person to bail.
</p><p id="p_68">54.  The  above deliberation leads to a derivation  that  to
invoke	<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_167">Section	 167(1)</a>,  it is not  an	 indispensable	pre-
requisite  condition that in all circumstances,	 the  arrest
should have been effected only by a police officer and	none
else  and that there must necessarily be records of  entries
of  a case diary.  Therefore, it necessarily follows that  a
mere production of an arrestee before a competent Magistrate
by  an authorised officer or an officer empowered to  arrest
(notwithstanding the fact that he is not a police officer in
its stricto sensu) on a reasonable belief that the  arrestee
"has  been  guilty  of	an  offence  punishable"  under	 the
provisions  of	the  special  Act  is  sufficient  for	 the
Magistrate to take that person into his custody on his being
satisfied  of the three preliminary conditions,	 namely	 (1)
the  arresting	officer	 is legally competent  to  make	 the
arrest;	 (2)  that  the particulars of the  offence  or	 the
accusation for which the person is arrested or other grounds
for such arrest do exist and are well-founded; and (3)	that
the provisions of the special Act in regard to the arrest of
the  persons  and the production of the arrestee  serve	 the
purpose of <a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_168">Section 167(1)</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_69">55.  In	 this  background,  it	has  become  obligatory	 and
imperative to settle the spinal issue as to whether  Section
35(2) of FERA and <a href="/doc/1982427/" id="a_169">Section 104(2)</a> of
19 (1980) 2 SCC 565: 1980 SCC (Cri) 465: (1980) 3 SCR 383
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">462</span>
the  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_170">Customs  Act</a> serve as a substitute	 of  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_171">Section  167(1)</a>
substantially  fulfilling  the	basic  conditions  contained
therein.
</p><p id="p_70">56.  No	 doubt,	 there is no investigation  by	any  officer
equivalent  or comparable to an officer-in-charge of  police
station	 or  a police officer in a proceeding under  any  of
these two special Acts as contemplated under Chapter XII  of
the  Code.   But  what <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_172">Section 167</a>  envisages  is  that	 the
arrestee is an accused or accused person against whom  there
is  well-founded  information  or  accusation  requiring  an
investigation.	 Firstly  the reason given in  the  impugned
judgment for holding that <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_173">Section 167(1)</a> is neither replaced
nor substituted by any provision of the special Acts is that
the arrestee by the authorised officer or empowered  officer
under the FERA or <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_174">Customs Act</a> respectively cannot be said to
be  'an accused' or 'accused person' which  expressions	 are
used  in  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_175">Section  167</a>	or 'accused  of	 an  offence'  which
expression is used in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_176">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution	 and
in  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_177">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_178">27</a> of the Evidence Act.  In	 support  of
this  reasoning,  some	decisions of this  Court  have	been
relied	upon about which we would deal at the later part  of
this judgment.
</p><p id="p_71">57.  We shall presently ponder over the true meaning of	 the
word/words  person',  'accused', 'accused  person',  "person
accused of an offence" and " person accused of any  offence"
used  in various provisions of the varied laws in  different
context	  and	scrutinise   as	  to   whether	 they	 are
interchangeable	 words and have the same connotation in	 and
under  all situations and circumstances which exercise	will
render much assistance in ascertaining the significance	 and
import	of  the	 words, 'persons',  'accused'  appearing  in
<a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_179">Section 167</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_72">58.  It is germane to note that though the word "person"  is

course,	 confined only to the mode of taking  and  recording

(about	 which	we  shall  deal	 with  presently)  and	 the
introduction  of the Explanation to <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_254">Section 273</a> of  the	 new
Code  as  well as the legislative intendment of	 some  other
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_255">  of the Code</a> to be mentioned hereafter  insinuate
in finding out the answer to the above query.
</p><p id="p_96">69.  It may be noted in <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_256">Section 436</a> of the old	Code  (1898)
which  corresponded to <a href="/doc/848468/" id="a_257">Section 437</a> of the Code of  1861	 and
<a href="/doc/1073786/" id="a_258">Section	 298</a>  of the Code of 1872, the	expression  'accused
person' alone was employed but subsequently, the  expression
was substituted by "person accused of an offence" by Section
117  of	 Act  XVIII of 1923.   This  legislative  change  by
substituting  the  new	expression  was	 made  in  order  to
supersede  a number of rulings rendered under the  old	Code
(<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_259">Section  437</a>) employing the words, ,accused  person'  which
held  the section applicable to proceedings  against  person
proceeded  under Chapter VIII also as "persons against	whom
there  is an accusation in the ordinary acceptation  of	 the
word".
</p><p id="p_97">70. In this connection, reference may be made to a  judgment
of the Madras High Court in which Justice Miller in Re	Kora
Ayyappa2O  held	 that persons ordered to give  security	 for
keeping	 peace	or to be of good behaviour are	not  persons
accused of an offence.
</p><p id="p_98">71. The present <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_260">Section 398</a> (power to order further inquiry)
of the new Code which corresponds to <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_261">Section 436</a> of the	 old
Code  are similar except for the substitution of  the  words
'Chief Judicial Magistrate' in place of the words  'District
Magistrate'.
</p><p id="p_99">72.  In other words, by the introduction of  the  expression
"person	  accused  of  an  offence"  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_262">Section  398</a>  is	made
inapplicable  to  the  security proceedings as	well  as  to
proceedings under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_263">Sections 133</a>, <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_264">144</a> and <a href="/doc/1405190/" id="a_265">145</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_100">73.  The  above	 legislative change  of	 the  expression  in
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_266">Section	 436</a> of the old Code serves as a guide in  adjudging
the distinction between the two expressions "accused person"
and "accused of an offence".
</p><p id="p_101">74.Let	us  now	 approach this aspect  of  the	matter	from
different angle with reference to the provisions of  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_267">Article

</p><p id="p_102">75. The prohibitive sweep of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_270">Article 20(3)</a> which imposes the

</p><p id="p_103">76. In explaining the intendment of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_271">Article 20(3</a>),  relating
to search and seizure of documents under <a href="/doc/525213/" id="a_272">Sections 94</a> and  <a href="/doc/1965142/" id="a_273">96</a>
of the old Code, an eight Judge Bench of this Court in	<a href="/doc/70398131/" id="a_274">M.P.
Sharma v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi21</a>	held
that one of the components for invoking sub-clause
20 (1910) It Cri LJ 251: 7 MLJ 104: 5 IC 809 (Mad)

(3) of <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_275">Article 20</a> should be that it is a right pertaining to
a person 'accused of an	 offence.'
</p><p id="p_104">77.   Having regard to the facts therein, it has been  held:
(SCR pp.  1086-87)
	      "The  cases with which we are  concerned	have
	      been  presented to us on the footing that	 the
	      persons against whom the search warrants	were
	      issued, were all of them persons against	whom
	      the  First Information Report was	 lodged	 and
	      who  were included in the category of  accused
	      therein  and that therefore they	are  persons
	      "accused of an offence" within the meaning  of
	      <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_276">Article 20(3)</a> and also that the documents	 for
	      whose  search the warrants were issued,  being
	      required	for investigation into	the  alleged
	      offences, such searches were for incriminating
	      material."
</p><p id="p_105">78.Thereafter,	a Constitution Bench of this Court  in	<a href="/doc/693505/" id="a_277">Raja
Narayanlal Bansilal v. Maneck Phiroz Mistry22</a> while  dealing
with  the import of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_278">Article 20(3)</a> with reference to  certain
provisions  of the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_279">Indian Companies Act</a> made  the  following
observation, relying on the decision in M.P. Sharma21:	(SCR
p. 438)
	      "Similarly,  for invoking	 the  constitutional
	      right    against	  testimonial	  compulsion
	      guaranteed under <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_280">Article 20(3)</a> it must  appear
	      that a formal accusation has been made against
	      the  party pleading the guarantee and that  it
	      relates to the commission of an offence  which
	      in   the	 normal	  course   may	 result	  in
	      prosecution.   Here  again the nature  of	 the
	      accusation   and	 its  probable	 sequel	  or
	      consequence are regarded as important."
In  the	 above	two judgments, both  the  Benches  have	 not
discussed  the distinction between the	expression  'accused
person' and 'person accused of any offence'.
</p><p id="p_106">79.  Subsequently,  an eleven-Judge Bench of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/1626264/" id="a_281">State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad23</a> went into the question
and  by majority concluded that an accused person cannot  be
said to have been compelled to be a witness against  himself
simply because he made a statement while in police  custody,
without anything more.
</p><p id="p_107">80.What is that 'anything more' required has been  explained
in the following words: (SCR p. 37)
	      "(6)  'To	 be  a	witness'  in  its   ordinary
	      grammatical sense means giving oral  testimony
	      in  Court.   Case-law  has  gone	beyond	this
	      strict	literal	  interpretation   of	 the
	      expression which may now bear a wider meaning,
	      namely,  bearing testimony in Court or out  of
	      Court  by	 a  person accused  of	an  offence,
	      orally or in writing.
</p><p id="p_108">	      (7) To bring the statement in question  within
	      the prohibition of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_282">Article     20(3</a>),	 the
	      person   accused	must  have  stood   in	 the

</p><p id="p_110">81.  The essence of the above decisions is that to  bring  a
person within the meaning of 'accused of any offence',	that
person must assimilate the character of an 'accused  person'
in the sense that he must be accused of any offence.
</p><p id="p_111">82.We think it is not necessary to interpret the expression,
"person	 accused  of any offence" as  appearing	 in  <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_284">Article

is found in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_285">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_286">27</a> of the Evidence Act.

<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_287">Article	 22</a> which speak of a 'person arrested' use only	 the
word 'person'.	<a href="/doc/1371971/" id="a_288">Article 22(2)</a> states that "every person	 who

the  purpose of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_320">Section 167</a>.  On the other hand, all   those
decisions are rendered only on the question of admissibility
or otherwise of the statement of a person arrested under the
provisions of the general Act or special Acts concerned	 and
recorded while in the custody of the arrester.
</p><p id="p_121">92.  A thorough and careful study of all the  provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_321">  of
the Code</a> manifestly discloses that the word 'accused' in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_322"> the
Code</a> denotes different meanings according to the context  in
which  it  is deployed; in that sometimes the said  word  is
employed  to  denote a person arrested, sometimes  a  person
against whom there is an accusation, but who is yet not	 put
on  trial and sometimes to denote a person on trial  and  so
on.
</p><p id="p_122">93.  It	 is  apposite,	in this context,  to  refer  to	 the
following passage found in Chapter 4 in the book titled
The Loom of Language :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	      "Words are not passive agents meaning the same
	      thing and carrying the same value at all times
	      and  in  all contexts.  They do  not  come  in
	      standard shapes and sizes like coins from	 the
	      mint,  nor do they go forth with a  decree  to
	      all  the	world that they shall mean  only  so
	      much,  no more and no less.  Through  its	 own
	      particular   personality,	 each  word  has   a
	      penumbra	of  meaning which no  draftsman	 can
	      entirely cut away.  It refuses to be used as a
	      mathematical symbol."
</blockquote><p id="p_123">94.  It	 may  not be out of place to mention  here  that  an
officer-in-charge of a police station who is empowered under
<a href="/doc/1379639/" id="a_323">Section 156</a> to investigate on an information received  under
<a href="/doc/996281/" id="a_324">Section	 154</a>  or  otherwise takes up  the  investigation  by
proceeding to the spot "for the discovery and arrest of	 the
offender when he has reason to suspect the commission of  an
offence" as contemplated under <a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_325">Section 157</a> of the Code.	  At
that stage, the investigating officer does not suddenly jump
to   a	 conclusion  that  the	person	against	  whom	 the
investigation  has commenced has committed an offence.	 But
he   can  arrive  at  such  a  conclusion  only	  when	 the
investigation consummates to a finality on the collection of
evidence  eliminating  all suspicion  and  establishing	 the
commission  of	the  offence.	In  case  the  investigating
officer arrives at a conclusion that no offence is made	 out
he forwards his final report to that effect.
</p><p id="p_124">95.The	view of majority in the impugned judgment  that	 the
person	arrested under the FERA or <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_326">Customs Act</a>	cannot	fall
within	the  meaning  of the  word  'accused'  for  invoking
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_327">Section	 167</a>  solely based on the decisions of	this  Court,
namely Ramesh Chandra Mehta26 as well as <a href="/doc/387476/" id="a_328">Illias v. Collector
of  Customs,  Madras31</a> is not logically concluded  for	more
than one reason
</p><p id="p_125">96. Firstly, almost all the decisions of this Court  holding
that "a person arrested by an Enforcement Officer or Customs
Officer, as the case may be, is not a 'person accused of  an
offence'  "  have  been	 rendered only	in  the	 context  of
examining the question of admissibility or otherwise of	 the
statement of a person arrested under those special Acts	 but
not with reference
31  AIR 1970 SC 1065: (1969) 2 SCR 613
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">470</span>
to  authorising the detention of an arrestee  under  <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_329">Section
167</a> of the Code by a Magistrate and so the dictum laid	down
in those decisions is clearly distinguishable;
</p><p id="p_126">97.   Secondly,	 in  the  teeth	 of  the  newly	  introduced
explanation  to	 <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_330">Section 273</a> of 1973 Code it is	 made  clear
that  the word 'accused' includes a person against whom	 any
proceeding   under  Chapter  VIII  of  the  Code  has	been
commenced.  Thus the explanation gives a clear clue that  in
given  situation  the  word 'person'  can  be  construed  as
'accused' or 'accused person'.
</p><p id="p_127">98.  Thirdly,  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_331">  the Code</a> different expressions  are	used
under  various provisions to denote a person involving in  a
criminal   proceeding	such  as  I   offender',   'person',
'accused',   'accused  person',	 "accused  of  an   offence"
depending on the nature of the proceeding.
</p><p id="p_128">99.  Fourthly, the very legislative change made	 in  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_332">Section
436</a> of the old Code corresponding to <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_333">Section 398</a> of the	 new
Code substituting the words It person accused of an offence"
in  the place of "accused person" as originally stood  makes
it clear that in the procedural code, these two	 expressions
cannot	always	denote the same meaning or be  construed  as
synonymous  or interchangeable and this	 legislative  change
indicates  that	 the Legislature in its wisdom	intended  to
make  a clear distinction between these expressions for	 the
reasons mentioned supra.
</p><p id="p_129">100.  Fifthly,	if the expression 'accused  person'  and  "a
person	accused of an offence" are to be held  denoting	 the
same   meaning	 and  interchangeable  at  all	 times	 and
situations, it will become fallacious and pernicious in	 the
implementation of the procedural law<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_334"> of the Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_130">101. Sixthly, in interpreting a statute in its true  spirit,
the  right  direction should be to give a full	and  literal
meaning to the language aiming ever to show fidelity to	 the
meaningful  purpose  of	 the statute and never	to  make  it
sterile	  and	impotent   by  giving	a   strict   literal
interpretation	putting	 blinkers  for	judicial   approach;
because such interpretation will run counter to the
legislative    intent.
</p><p id="p_131">102. From  the	foregoing discussion, it is clear  that	 the
word 'accused' or accused     person'  is  used	 only  in  a
generic sense in <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_335">Section 167(1)</a> and (2) denoting  the'person'
whose  liberty	is actually restrained on his  arrest  by  a
competent  authority on well-founded information  or  formal
accusation  or	indictment.  Therefore, the  word  'accused'
limited to the scope of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_336">Section 167(1)</a> and (2)	particularly
in  the	 light	of Explanation to <a href="/doc/1151812/" id="a_337">Section 273</a>  of  the	Code
includes 'any person arrested'.	 The inevitable	 consequence
that  follows is that "any person is arrested" occurring  in
the  first limb of <a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_338">Section 167(1)</a> of the Code  takes  within
its  ambit "every person arrested" under Section 35 of	FERA
or  <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_339">Section 104</a> of the Customs Act also as the case  may  be
and the 'person arrested' can be detained by the  Magistrate
in  exercise of his power under <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_340">Section 167(2)</a> of the  Code.
In other words, the 'person arrested' under FERA or  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_341">Customs
Act</a> is assimilated with the characteristics of an  'accused'
within the range of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_342">Section 167(1)</a> and as such liable to  be
detained under <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_343">Section 167(2)</a> by a Magistrate when  produced
before him.

Court and Gujarat High Court is the logical and correct view
and we approve the same for the reasons we have given in the
preceding  part	 of  this  judgment.   We,  indeed,  see  no
imponderability	 in  construing Section 35(2)  of  FERA	 and
<a href="/doc/1982427/" id="a_375">Section	 104(2)</a>	 of  Customs Act that  the  said  provisions
replace	 <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_376">Section  167(1)</a> and serve as a	 substitute  thereof
substantially  satisfying all the required basic  conditions
contained therein and that consequent upon such	 replacement
of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_377">Section 167</a>, the arrested person under
those special Acts would be an accused person to be detained
by  the Magistrate under subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_378">Section 167</a>.	  In
passing,  it  may  be stated that  there  is  no  expression
'police	 officer'  deployed in <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_379">Section 167(1)</a>  nor  does  it
appear	in  any part of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_380">Section 167(2)</a>.	 The  authority	 for
detaining  a person as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_381">Section 167(2)</a>  is
in aid of investigation to be carried on by any	 prosecuting
agency who is invested with the power of investigation.
</p><p id="p_137">107. We next proceed to consider the second question whether
the  authorised or empowered officer under FERA	 or  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_382">Customs

outlined  under	 Chapter XII of the Code  and  conducts	 any

except the one in <a href="/doc/1361495/" id="a_388">H.N. Rishbud v. State of Delhi36</a>.  In that

"[U]nder<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_389">  the Code</a> investigation consists generally  of	 the
following   steps:   (1)  Proceeding  to   the	 spot,	 (2)

Collection  of	evidence relating to the commission  of	 the

for  the investigation and to be produced at the trial,	 and
(5)  Formation of the opinion as to whether on the  material

</p><p id="p_141">109.  No  doubt,  it  is true that there  are  a  series  of
decisions holding the view that an Officer of Enforcement or
a  Customs  Officer  is not a  police  officer	though	such
officers  are  vested with the powers of  arrest  and  other
analogous  powers.  Vide Ramesh Chandra v. State  of  W.B.26
and <a href="/doc/387476/" id="a_391">Illias v. Collector of Customs</a>, MadraS31.  In the  above
decisions, this Court has held that the above officers under
the special Acts are not vested with the powers of a  police
officer qua investigation of an offence under Chapter XII of
the  Code  including  the power to forward  a  report  under
<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_392">Section 173</a> of the Code.  See also <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_393">State of Punjab v. Barkat

Sub-section  (1)  of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_396">Section 167</a> speaks of the arrest  by  a

Section 35(1) of FERA and <a href="/doc/276692/" id="a_397">Section 104(1)</a> of the Customs	 Act

</p><p id="p_144">111. Neither  the Police Act, 1861 (Act V of 1861)  nor	 any
other  statute	defines	 the  expression  'police  officer'.
Shortly	 stated,  the  main duties of  the  police  are	 the
prevention,  detention and investigation of crimes.  As	 the
powers	and  duties  of the State  have	 increased  and	 are
increasing  manifold,  various Acts  dealing  with  Customs,
Excise,	 Forest,  Taxes	 etc. have come	 to  be	 passed	 and
consequently the prevention, detention and investigation  of
offences  as  prescribed under those Acts have	come  to  be
entrusted   to	 officers   with   different   nomenclatures
appropriate  to	 the subject with reference  to	 which	they
function.   However, as stated supra, though the  powers  of
customs officers and enforcement officers are not  identical
to  those  of police officers qua  the	investigation  under
Chapter XII of the Code yet the officers under the FERA	 and
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_398">Customs	 Act</a> are vested with certain powers similar  to	 the
powers of police officers.
</p><p id="p_145">112. The expression 'diary' referred to in <a href="/doc/1912686/" id="a_399">Section 167(1)</a> of
the  Code is the special diary mentioned in  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_400">Section  167(2)</a>
which  should  contain	full and  unabridged  statements  of
persons examined by the police so as to give the Magistrates
on a perusal of the said diary, a satisfactory and  complete
source	of  information	 which would enable  him  to  decide
whether	 or  not the accused person should  be	detained  in
custody	  but  it  is  different  from	the  general   diary
maintained under <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_401">Section 44</a> of the Police Act.
</p><p id="p_146">113. Though an authorised officer of Enforcement or  Customs
is  not undertaking an investigation as	 contemplated  under
Chapter	 XII  of the Code, yet those officers  are  enjoying
some   analogous   powers   such   as	arrest,	   seizures,
interrogation etc.  Besides, a statutory duty is enjoined on
them  to inform the arrestee of the grounds for such  arrest
as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_402">Article 22(1)</a> of the Constitution	 and
<a href="/doc/1848903/" id="a_403">Section 50</a> of the Code.	 Therefore, they have necessarily to
make  records of their statutory functions showing the	name
of  the	 informant, as well as the name of  the	 person	 who
violated  any other provision<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_404"> of the Code</a> and who  has	been
guilty	of  an offence punishable under the Act,  nature  of
information received by them, time of the arrest, seizure of
the contraband if any and the statements recorded during the
course of the detection of the offence/offences.

there  are  various <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_405">Central Act</a>s  containing  provisions  of
prevention  of	offences  enumerated therein  and  also	 for
enforcement  of the said provisions.  Certain provisions  of
the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_406">Central Act</a>s which we would like to give below by way of
illustration in a tabular form showing the powers vested and
the  duties  cast on the officers concerned will  show	that
those officers enjoy certain powers during the course of any
investigation  or  inquiry or proceeding under	the  special
Acts   concerned   though  not	in  strict   sense   of	  an
investigation under Chapter XII of the Code as undertaken by

vested	on  various authorities as given in  the  table	 are
equipollent  as being enjoyed by a police officer under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_412">	 the
Code</a>  and exercised during investigation under	Chapter	 XII
because	 the investigation is nothing but an observation  or
inquiry into the allegations, circumstances or relationships
in  order  to obtain factual information  and  make  certain
whether or not a violation of any law has been committed.
</p><p id="p_152">116.  It should not be lost sight of the fact that a  police
officer	 making an investigation of an offence	representing
the  State files a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_413">Section 173</a> of the Code	 and
becomes the complainant whereas the prosecuting agency under
the  special  Acts files a complaint as a  complainant	i.e.
under  <a href="/doc/1727850/" id="a_414">Section 61(ii)</a> in the case of FERA and under  <a href="/doc/983013/" id="a_415">Section
137</a>  of	 the Customs Act.  To say  differently,	 the  police
officer	 after	consummation of the  investigation  files  a
report	under  <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_416">Section	173</a>  of	 the  Code  upon  which	 the
Magistrate  may take cognizance of any offence disclosed  in
the  report under <a href="/doc/867855/" id="a_417">Section 190(1)(b)</a> of the Code whereas	 the
empowered  or authorised officer of the special Acts has  to
file  only  a complaint of facts  constituting	any  offence
under the provisions of the Act on the receipt of which	 the
Magistrate  may	 take cognizance of the said  offence  under
<a href="/doc/545340/" id="a_418">Section	 190(1)(a)</a> of the Code.	 After taking cognizance  of
the offence either upon a police report or upon receiving  a
complaint  of facts, the Magistrate has to proceed with	 the
case as per the procedure prescribed under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_419"> the Code</a> or under
the special procedure, if any, prescribed under the  special
Acts.  Therefore, the word 'investigation' cannot be limited
only to police investigation but on the other hand, the said
word is with wider connotation and flexible so as to include
the  investigation carried on by any agency whether he be  a
police	officer	 or  empowered or authorised  officer  or  a
person	not being a police officer under the direction of  a
Magistrate to make an investigation vested with the power of
investigation.
</p><p id="p_153">117.  It may be recalled, in this connection,  that  <a href="/doc/636167/" id="a_420">Section
202(1)</a>	of  the	 Code falling under  Chapter  XV  under	 the
caption	 "Complaints  to  Magistrates"	envisages  that	 any
Magistrate on receipt of a complaint of an offence of  which
he  is authorised to take cognizance or which has been	made
over  to  him under <a href="/doc/414294/" id="a_421">Section 192</a> of the Code  can  direct  an
investigation  to  be made by a police officer or  'by	such
other  person as he thinks fit'.  As regards the  conferment
of  power  on such person, sub-section (3)  of	<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_422">Section	 202</a>
reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	      "If an investigation under sub-section (1)  is
	      made  by a person not being a police  officer,
	      he  shall have for that investigation all	 the
	      powers conferred by this Code on an officer in
	      charge of a police station except the power to
	      arrest without warrant."
</blockquote><p id="p_154">The expression "all the powers conferred by this Code on  an
officer-incharge  of  a	 police station"  will	include	 the
powers	conferred on the police officer under  the  relevant
provisions of Chapter XII also.

<p id="p_155">118.  M.P.  Thakkar, C.J. of the Gujarat High Court  (as  he

Inspector of Customs v. Mohmed Akhtar34</a> while examining	 the

	      fall  under the definition of  'investigation'
	      insofar  as the inclusive part  is  concerned.
	      But then it being an inclusive definition	 the
	      ordinary	 connotation   of   the	  expression
	      'investigation'  cannot  be  overlooked.	  An
	      'investigation' means search for material	 and
	      facts  in order to find out whether or not  an
	      offence  has  been  committed.   It  does	 not
	      matter  whether  it  is  made  by	 the  police
	      officer  or a customs officer who	 intends  to
	      lodge a complaint."

</p><p id="p_157">119. The word 'investigation' though is not shown in any one
of  the sections of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_426">Customs Act</a>, certain powers  enjoyed
by the police officer during the investigation are vested on
the  specified officer of customs as indicated in the  table
given above.  However, in the FERA the word  'investigation'
is  used in various provisions, namely <a href="/doc/1446209/" id="a_427">Sections 34</a>, <a href="/doc/473169/" id="a_428">36</a>,	 <a href="/doc/777615/" id="a_429">37</a>,

</p><p id="p_158">120. From the above discussion it cannot be said that either

</p><p id="p_170">130. The Select Committee expressed its view on the proposed
amendment as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	      "The Committee are of the view that an Officer
	      of Customs arresting a person under the clause
	      should have the power to release the  arrested
	      person  on  bail or otherwise similar  to	 the
	      power conferred on the officer in charge of  a
	      police  station  under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_480"> the  Code</a>	of  Criminal
	      Procedure, 1898 so as to obviate the necessity
	      of detaining an arrested person till he can be
	      taken to a Magistrate.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">	      The  Committee feel that sub-clause (3)  being
	      merely  a repetition of the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_481"> of	 the
	      Criminal	 Procedure  Code</a>,  1898	 should	  be
	      omitted."
</blockquote><p id="p_171">The view of the Committee expressed above can be taken as  a
guide in understanding the import of Section 35 of FERA.
</p><p id="p_172">131. The submission that as there is no investigation within
the  terms<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_482"> of the Code</a> in the field of FERA or <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_483">Customs	Act</a>,
<a href="/doc/708036/" id="a_484">Section 4(2)</a> of the Code can have no part to play, has to be
rejected for the reasons given by us while disposing of	 the
contention   "What  investigation  means  and  is"  in	 the
preceding part of this judgment.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">480</span>
<p id="p_173">132. For  the  aforementioned  reasons,	 we  hold  that	 the
operation  of  <a href="/doc/708036/" id="a_485">Section	4(2)</a> of	 the  Code  is	straightaway
attracted to the area of investigation, inquiry and trial of
the  offences under the special laws including the FERA	 and
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_486">Customs Act</a> and consequently <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_487">Section 167</a> of the Code can  be
made  applicable during the investigation or inquiry  of  an
offence under the special Acts also inasmuch as there is  no
specific provision contrary to that excluding the  operation
of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_488">Section 167</a>.
</p><p id="p_174">133. Though  much  argument was advanced on  the  expression
"otherwise  dealt with", we think it is not necessary to  go
deep into the matter except saying that the said  expression
is  very  wide and all comprehensive.  Vide  Bhim  Singh  v.
State of U. P. 42 and Delhi Admn. v. Ram Singh43.
</p><p id="p_175">134. There are a series of decisions of various High Courts,
of  course  with  some exception, taking  the  view  that  a
Magistrate  before whom a person arrested by  the  competent
authority  under  the FERA or <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_489">Customs Act</a> is  produced,	 can
authorise detention in exercise of his powers under  Section
</p><p id="p_176">167.  Otherwise the mandatory direction under the  provision
of  Section 35(2) of FERA or <a href="/doc/1982427/" id="a_490">Section 104(2)</a> of	the  Customs
Act,  to  take every person arrested before  the  Magistrate
without unnecessary delay when the arrestee was not released
on  bail under sub-section (3) of those special	 Acts,	will
become	purposeless  and  meaningless and to  say  that	 the
courts	even in the event of refusal of bail have no  choice
but  to set the person arrested at liberty by folding  their
hands as a helpless spectator in the face of what is  termed
as  "legislative casus omissus" or legal flaw or lacuna,  it
will become utterly illogical and absurd.
</p><p id="p_177">135. We	 are in total agreement with the above view  of	 the
various	 High  Courts for the discussion  made	already	 and
conclusions arrived at thereto.
</p><p id="p_178">136.	  In  the result, we hold that sub-sections (1)	 and
(2)  of <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_491">Section 167</a> are squarely applicable with  regard  to
the production and detention of a person arrested under	 the
provisions of Section 35 of FERA and <a href="/doc/1771476/" id="a_492">Section 104</a> of  Customs
Act  and that the Magistrate has jurisdiction under  <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_493">Section
167(2)</a>	to authorise detention of a person arrested  by	 any
authorised  officer of the Enforcement under FERA and  taken
to the Magistrate in compliance of Section 35(2) of FERA.
</p><p id="p_179">137.	  In  the result, the impugned judgment of the	Full
Bench (five Judges) of the High Court holding the view	that
the  law  laid	down in O.P. Gupta'  "regarding	 the  powers
available  to a Magistrate under <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_494">Section 167(2)</a> of the	Code
of  Criminal Procedure to commit to custody a  person  taken
before	him  by	 the Customs Officer is	 incorrect"  is	 set
aside.	 The law enunciated in O.P. Gupta' by a	 three-Judge
Bench  is the correct law and accordingly the said  decision
is upheld.
</p><p id="p_180">138. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
