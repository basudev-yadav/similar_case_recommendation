ACT:
<a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_1">Opium Act</a> (10 of 1878) as modified by the Opium Madhya	Bha-
rat <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_2">Amendment Act</a> 1955-Use of 'shall' in s. 11 of the Madhya
Bharat	Act-Truck found carrying opium-Confication of  truck
whether obligatory under section.



HEADNOTE:
H  took	 a truck on hire from the respondent  company.	 The
truck was found to contain contraband opium and H was  tried
for  offences  under<a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_3"> ss. 9A</a> and <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_4">9B</a> of the Opium Act  (10  of
1878) as modified by the Opium (Madhya Bharat Amendment) Act
1955.	The company made an application for the	 release  of
the  truck  but	 the magistrate while acquitting  H  on	 the
ground that he had no knowledge that the truck was  carrying
opium,	confiscated  the  truck under<a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_5"> s. 11</a>  of	 the  Madhya
Bharat	Act.   He  took the view that the use  of  the	word
'shall' in that section gave him no option but to confiscate
the  truck.  The Sessions Judge took the same view  but	 the
High  Court held that the word 'shall in the context of	 the
section	 was  not mandatory and in the circumtances  of	 the
case the truck should not have been confiscated.  The  State
appealed to this by special, leave.
 HELD:- The word 'shall' is not always mandatory; it depends
upon  the  context in which the word occurs  and  the  other
circumstances [475H]
Three  considerations  are  relevant in	 construing <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_6"> s.	 11</a>.
First it would be unjust to confiscate the truck of a person
if  he has no knowledge whatsoever that the track was  being
used  for transporting the opium.  Secondly it is a  penal'.
statute and it should if possible be construed in such a way
that  a person who has not committed or abetted any  offence
should	 not  be  visited  with	 a  penalty.   Thirdly,	  if
confiscation  was obligatory under the section, the  section
may  have  to  be struck down as  imposing  an	unreasonable
restrictions under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_7">Art. 19</a> of the Constitution. [476 A-D]
<a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_8">Section	 11</a> of the Madhya Bharat Act is not therefore to  be
construed as obligatory and it is for the court to  consider
in  each case whether the articles in which  the  contraband
opium is found or is being transported should be confiscated
or  not having regard to all the circumstances of the  case.

<p id="p_4">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Sikri,	J. This appeal by special leave is directed  against
the  judgment  of  the Madhya Pradesh  High  Court  (Gwalior
Bench)	in  a Criminal Revision filed by M/s.	Azad  Bharat
Finance Company, one of the respondents in this appeal.	 The
revision arose out of the following facts.  On May 3,  1961,
truck  No.  M.P.E.  1548, while it was parked  at  the	bus-
station, Guna, was searched by the Excise Sub-Inspector	 and
he found contraband opium weighing about three seers in	 it.
Five   persons	were  challaned	 for  the  alleged   illegal
possession of contraband opium and for its transport,  under
ss.  9A and 9B of the Opitum Act (1 of 1878) as modified  by
the  Opium (Madhya Bharat Amendment) Act, 1955,	 hereinafter
referred to as the <a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_10">Madhya Bharat Act</a>.  Harbhajan Singh,	 one
of   the  accused,  is	alleged	 to  have  absconded,	and,
therefore, he was tried separately later on.  The Additional
District  Magistrate,  Guna,  convicted	 three	persons	 and
acquitted one person.  Regarding the truck, he ordered	that
the  final orders regarding the disposal of the truck  would
be passed later, on the conclusion of the trial of Harbhajan
Singh.	 It may be Mentioned that Harbhajan Singh had  taken
this truck. under a hire-purchase agreement from  M/s.	Azad
Bharat	Finance	 Co. and he Was not present in or  near	 the
truck  when the contraband opium was taken possession of  by
the Excise Officer.
</p><p id="p_5">On  May 28, 1962, M/s.	Azad Bharat Finance Co,	 applied  in
the  Court  of	Shri  M. C. Bohre, in  which  the  trial  of
Harbhajan Singh was going on. for the release of the  truck.
On September 7. 1962.  Harbhajan Singh was acquitted by	 the
Magistrate  but he ordered that the truck be confiscated  to
the State.  The Magistrate was of the opinion that<a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_11"> s. 11</a>  of
the  Madhya  Bharat Act showed ,Clearly that  the  truck  in
which  the  opium  was carried had to be  forfeited  in	 all
circumstances.	He observed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "By the use of the word "shall" this Court was
	      ,compelled  that the truck be seized,  may  be
	      there  was the hand of the owner in it or	 not
	      and  neither there is any provision  that	 the
	      truck  owner had the knowledge or not  of	 the
	      opium being carried."
</blockquote><p id="p_6">Both Harbhajan Singh and M/s.  Azad Bharat Finance Co. filed
revisions in the Court of the Sessions Judge.  The  Sessions
Judge  also  held  that the word "shall"  in <a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_12"> s.  11(d)</a>	 was
mandatory and not directory.  He observed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "Though  it is correct that the truck was	 not
	      used for carrying opium with the knowledge  or
	      connivance of the owner but <a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_13">section 11</a> (d)  as
	      applicable   in  this  state  does  not	give
	      discretion  to the Court in not  ordering	 the
	      confiscation   of	 the  conveyance  used	 for
	      carrying contraband opium."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">475</span>
<p id="p_7">M/s.   Azad Bharat Finance Co. filed a revision in the	High
Court.	The High Court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "The word "shall" occurring in Sec. 11 of	 the
	      M.P. Opium Act means "may" and that it confers
	      discretion  on  the court	 to  confiscate	 the
	      conveyance   provided   it  belongs   to	 the
	      offender.	  But where it is not so,  and,	 the
	      owner of the truck has neither authorised	 the
	      offender to transport opium, nor is there	 any
	      reason to believe that the owner knew that his
	      vehicle was likely to be used for transporting
	      contraband opium, the conveyance should not be
	      confiscated   because  confiscation  in	such
	      circumstances would be tantamount to punishing
	      one,  who has not committed any offence  under
	      the <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_14">Opium Act</a>."
</blockquote><p id="p_8">The learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. Shroff,  contends
that  the Opium (Madhya Bharat Amendment) Act, 1955  (15  of
1955)  which  amended  the  <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_15">Opium  Act</a>,	 1878,	deliberately
employed  a  different	phraseology with  the  intention  of
making	it obligatory on a Court to confiscate a vehicle  in
which contraband opium had been transported.  He points	 out
that  in the <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_16">Opium Act</a>, 1878, in<a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_17"> s. 11</a>, the. relevant  words
Ate as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      " S. 11 Confiscation of opium.-In any case  in
	      which  an	 offence under <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_18">section	9</a>  has	been
	      committed,-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      The  vessels, packages and covering  in  which
	      any  opium liable to confiscation	 under	this
	      section  is found, and the other contents	 (if
	      any)  of the vessel or package in	 which	such
	      opium  may be concealed, and the	animals	 and
	      conveyances   used  in  carrying	 it,   shall
	      likewise be liable to confiscation."
</blockquote><p id="p_9">He  stresses  the  words  "liable  to  confiscation"   which
according  to  him and certain authorities  clearly  give  a
discretion to the Court whether to confiscate the vehicle or
not.   In  the	Madhya	Bharat	Amendment  Act	the  section
providing for confiscation is as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "S. 11. In any case in which an offence  under
	      <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_19">Sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_20">9A</a>, <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_21">9B</a>, <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_22">9C</a>, <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_23">9D</a>, <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_24">9E</a>, <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_25">9F</a> and <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_26">9G</a>	 has
	      been  committed, the property detailed  herein
			    below shall be confiscated:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      (d)the receptacles, packages and	coverings
	      in  which	 any opium  liable  to	confiscation
	      under  this  Section is found, and  the  other
	      contents (if any) of the receptacle or package
	      in which such opium may be concealed, and	 the
	      animals, carts, vessels, rafts and conveyances
	      used in carrying it."
</blockquote><p id="p_10">In our opinion, the High Court was correct in reading<a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_27"> s.  11</a>
of  the Madhya Bharat Act as permissive and not	 obligatory.
It is well-settled that the use of the word "shall" does not
always
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">476</span>
mean  that  the	 enactment is obligatory  or  mandatory,  it
depends	 upon the context in which the word  "shall"  occurs
and  the  other	 circumstances.	  Three	 considerations	 are
relevant  in construing<a href="/doc/936713/" id="a_28"> s. 1</a> <a href="/doc/936713/" id="a_29">1</a>. First, it is not  denied  by
Mr.  Shroff that it would be unjust to confiscate the  truck
of a person if he has no knowledge whatsoever that the truck
was  being  used for transporting opium.  Suppose  a  person
steals a truck and then uses it for transporting  contraband
opium.	According to Mr. Shroff, the truck would have to  be
confiscated.  It is well recognised that if a statute  leads
to   absurdity,	 hardship  or  injustice,   presumably	 not
intended,  a construction may be put upon it which  modifies
the  meaning  of the words, and even the  structure  of	 the
sentence. (<a href="/doc/245892/" id="a_30">Vide Tirath Singh v. Bachittar Singh</a>)(1).
Secondly, it is a penal statute and it should, if  possible,
be  construed  in  such	 a way that a  person  who  has	 not
committed or abetted any offence should not be visited	with
a penalty.
</p><p id="p_11">Thirdly,  if the meaning suggested by Mr. Shroff  is  given,
s.11 (d) of the <a href="/doc/653405/" id="a_31">Madhya Bharat Act</a> may have to be struck down
as  imposing unreasonable restrictions under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_32">Art. 19</a> of	 the
Constitution.  Bearing all these considerations in mind,  we
consider  that	s.  II	of the	Madhya	Bharat	Act  is	 not
obligatory and it is for the Court to consider in each	case
whether	 the vehicle in which the contraband opium is  found
or is being transported should be confiscated or not, having
regard to all the circumstances of the case'.
Mr.   Shroff   then   contends	that  if   the	 matter	  is
discretionary. the High Court should not have interfered  in
the discretion exercised by the learned Sessions Judge.	 But
apart  from  the  question that this point  was	 not  raised
before the High Court, both the Magistrate and the  Sessions
Judge  ordered confiscation of the truck on the ground	that
they had no option in the matter.
</p><p id="p_12">Mr.  Shroff  then raises the point that	 M/s.	Azad  Bharat
Finance	 Co.  was  a third party in the	 case  and  was	 not
entitled   to	apply  for  setting  aside  the	  order	  of
confiscation or request for the, return of the truck.	This
point  was not raised before the High Court and,  therefore,
cannot be allowed to be raised at this stage.
In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
