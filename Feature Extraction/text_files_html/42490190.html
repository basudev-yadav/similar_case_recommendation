<p id="p_1">1.     Appellant - the defendant in the suit, assails the order dated July
23, 2014, allowing the application filed by the respondent - plaintiff under
Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure granting an
interim injunction against the appellant restraining the appellant from
using the mark 'D'DAAZS' or any other mark deceptively similar to that
of the respondent - plaintiff's trade mark 'HAAGEN-DAZS' in relation to
ice cream.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     The respondent - plaintiff company has been incorporated under the
laws of Delaware, USA and claims to be marketing, over a hundred
consumer brands (processed food and ice cream), in over a hundred

 countries across the globe. The respondent - plaintiff company claims to
be manufacturing desserts such as ice-creams and frozen yogurts under
the trademark 'HAAGEN DAZS' which according to it is an arbitrary
word having no dictionary meaning. 'HAAGEN DAZS' has been made
available in India only since the year 2007, however, the respondent -
plaintiff obtained registration for the mark 'HAAGEN DAZS' in India in
respect of ice cream, ices, sherbet, sorbet and frozen confections in class
30 with effect from January 21, 1993 and for food products in classes 29,
30 and 42 on January 01, 2008.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     The appellant - defendant on the other hand, has been
manufacturing ice-creams and frozen desserts under the name 'D'DAAZ'
since the year 2009. It is the case of the appellant that the word
'D'DAAZ' is derived from the name of Late Dwarka Das, who was the
father of one of the founder directors of the company. It is stated that the
appellant - defendant has been supplying ice-creams across South India.
</p><p id="p_4">4.     Since the present lis essentially hinges upon the conflict of
trademarks propounded by the rival litigants, it would be incumbent upon
us to juxtapose the same for the purpose of assessing whether prima-facie
there exists a reasonable possibility of confusion to arise in the minds of
the consumers.

<p id="p_5">     Trademark of Respondent-Plaintiff   Trademark of Appellant-Defendant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                               Page 2 of 26</span>
</p><p id="p_6"> 5.     It is the case of the appellant - defendant that the respondent -
plaintiff enjoys protection for its mark 'HAAGEN DAZS' as an
indivisible whole and not for the individual elements constituting the
same. Reliance has been placed on the principle of 'anti-dissection'
consistently applied by the Courts since time immemorial while dealing
with cases of trademark infringement. It has been further submitted that
even if the constituting elements of the mark are considered, 'HAAGEN'
forms the dominant part of the respondent-plaintiff's trademark and any
potential similarity with the non-dominant element 'DAZS' in a
trademark would not amount to infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     Per contra, the respondent - plaintiff has contended that 'DAZS'
cannot be construed as a non-dominant element of their trademark and
must be accorded sufficient prominence to warrant protection. In this
regard it has been highlighted that the application for registration for the
mark 'DAZS' separately has also been filed on October 22, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.     Since we are exercising an appellate jurisdiction over the decision
of a learned Single Judge of this Court, who has exercised his judicial
discretion and granted injunction in favour of the plaintiff, it may be
pertinent to set out the parameters for interference in such matters.

celebrated decision reported as 1261 F.2d 759 Frisch‟s Restaurant, Inc v.

bear in mind while deciding the plea of injunction in cases of trademark
infringement. It was observed as under:-

</blockquote><p id="p_10">9.     Before embarking on a detailed discussion of the submissions
advanced at the bar, it would be apposite to take notice of the salutary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                            Page 4 of 26</span>
 purpose and sublime philosophy which underscores the laws affording
protection of trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.    A successful brand name is created by generating a high level of
brand awareness and forming distinctive brand images. Brand image
refers to the role of brand names and other aspects of a brand's trade dress
as cues that retrieve or signal product attributes, benefits, affect or overall
quality. In this sense, the brand itself is not a memory target but a cue that
might facilitate recall or inference of previously learned brand
associations. A paramount factor influencing a consumer's choice of
brand is his memory of previous exposures of the brand. Distinctive brand
names and packaging are highly conducive to mental associations and
serve as pathways to facilitate a much more accurate recall by a
consumer. It enables finer retrieval of the experience. Studies reveal that
extrinsic brand cues might actually enhance the memorability of prior
experiences with specific brands, thereby facilitating accurate quality
discrimination and improving consumer welfare. Thus, the development
of such brand value in the form of a mark containing names, patterns, etc.
which would often be a direct reflection of an enterprise's goodwill and
market reputation was accorded protection in the form of their registration
as trademark. A similar mark causes a slow decline in the accuracy of a
consumer‟s memory-based judgments and therefore, the Trademarks Act
seeks to put a check on such practises. It also assumes significance that
the learning process of a consumer is the result of a consumption
experience which is sequential as opposed to simultaneous. There may be
vast spells between consumption which may naturally give impetus to
confusion. Confusion of very satisfactory consumption experiences with
less satisfying experience may lead to a reduction in repeated purchase

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                               Page 5 of 26</span>
 and dilution of brand equity. [Luke Warlopet. Al, 'Distinctive Brand
Cues     and     Memory    for    Product    Consumption       Experiences',
International Journal of Research in Marketing 22 (2005) 27-44].
</p><p id="p_12">11.    Even when all or most brands are present at the point of choice (e.g.
at a supermarket) consumers still retrieve information from memory and
only notice specific brands, as evidenced by the short amount of time
taken to choose brands despite wide ranges on offer. Therefore the issue
of retrieval of brand name information from memory is still relevant in
that context [Jenni Romaniuk and Byron Sharp, 'Conceptualizing and
measuring brand salience', Marketing Theory Articles Volume 4(4),
Pages 327-342].
</p><p id="p_13">12.    At this juncture it would be beneficial to refer to the observations of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in its decision
reported as 494 F.3d 730 <a href="/doc/635307/" id="a_1">Groeneveld Transport Efficiency Inc v. Lubecore
International Inc. It</a> was observed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "Trademark law's likelihood-of-confusion requirement, in
       contrast, is designed to promote informational integrity in the
       marketplace. By ensuring that consumers are not confused
       about what they are buying, trademark law allows them to
       allocate their capital efficiently to the brands that they find
       most deserving. This, in turn, incentivizes manufacturers to
       create robust brand recognition by consistently offering good
       products and good services, which results in more consumer
       satisfaction. That is the virtuous cycle envisioned by trademark
       law, including its trade-dress branch. As stated in <a href="/doc/1357560/" id="a_2">Qualitex Co.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       In principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying
       a source-identifying mark, reduces the customer's costs of
       shopping and making purchasing decisions, for it quickly and
       easily assures a potential customer that this item - the item with
       this mark - is made by the same producer as other similarly
       marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. At
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                              Page 6 of 26</span>
        the same time, the law helps assure a producer that it (and not
       an imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-
       related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law
       thereby encourages the production of quality products, and
       simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior
       products by capitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to
       evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale. It is the source-
       distinguishing ability of a mark . . . that permits it to serve these
       basic purposes.

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       Such an incentive structure would of course be disrupted if a
       manufacturer's hard-won brand recognition were open to
       appropriation by other manufacturers who confused consumers
       into believing that the two brands are affiliated or are one and
       the same. If manufacturers' qualitative efforts were subject to
       such skimming off, they would have less incentive to improve
       their offerings and build a robust brand in the first place.

       So trademark law, like the law of unfair competition of which it
       is a part, focuses not on copying per se but on confusion:
       The law of unfair competition has its roots in the common-law
       tort of deceit: its general concern is with protecting consumers
       from confusion as to source. While that concern may result in
       the creation of 'quasi-property rights' in communicative
       symbols, the focus is on the protection of consumers, not the
       protection of producers as an incentive to product innovation.
       Judge Hand captured the distinction well in Crescent Tool Co.
       v. Kilborn &amp; Bishop Co., 247 F. 299, 301 (2d Cir. 1917), where
       he wrote: "The plaintiff has the right not to lose his customers
       through false representations that those are his wares which in
       fact are not, but he may not monopolize any design or pattern,
       however trifling. The defendant, on the other hand, may copy
       plaintiffs goods slavishly down to the minutest detail: but he
       may not represent himself as the plaintiff in their
       sale."[Emphasis Supplied]

</blockquote><p id="p_14"> 13.    Even the Supreme Court in its judgment reported as (2002) 3 SCC
65 Laxmikant v. Patel v. Chetan Bhai Shah &amp; Anr, observed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "10. A person may sell his goods or deliver his services such as
       in case of a profession under a trading name or style. With the
       lapse of time such business or services associated with a person
       acquire a reputation or goodwill which becomes a property
       which is protected by courts. A competitor initiating sale of
       goods or services in the same name or by imitating that name
       results in injury to the business of one who has the property in
       that name. The law does not permit any one to carry on his
       business in such a way as would persuade the customers or
       clients in believing that the goods or services belonging to
       someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does not
       matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or
       otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play
       are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of business.
       Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to adopt a name in
       connection with his business or services which already belongs
       to someone else it results in confusion and has propensity of
       diverting the customers and clients of someone else to himself
       and thereby resulting in injury."[Emphasis Supplied]

</blockquote><p id="p_15">14.    Adverting ourselves to the case under consideration, we find that
the mark of the respondent - plaintiff 'HAAGEN DAZS' is what may be
termed as a 'Composite Mark' i.e. made up of more than one element.
</p><p id="p_16">15.    Analysis of composite marks in the cases of trademark infringement
pose peculiar problems and has led the Courts to develop the rules of
'anti-dissection' and identification of 'dominant mark'.
</p><p id="p_17">                       The Rule of Anti-Dissection
</p><p id="p_18">16.    This rule mandates that the Courts whilst dealing with cases of
trademark infringement involving composite marks, must consider the
composite marks in their entirety as an indivisible whole rather than
truncating or dissecting them into its component parts and make
comparison with the corresponding parts of arrival mark to determine the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                             Page 8 of 26</span>
 likelihood of confusion. The raison d'être underscoring the said principle
is that the commercial impression of a composite trademark on an
ordinary prospective buyer is created by the mark as a whole and not by
its component parts [994 F.2d 1359, 1362 (9th Cir. 1993) Fruit of the
loom, Inc. v. Girouard; 174 F. Supp. 2d 718, 725 (M.D. Tenn. 2001)
Autozone, Inc. v. Tandy Corporation].
</p><p id="p_19">17.    The Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit in its decision reported
as 393 F.3d 1238 (Fed. Cir. 2004) Shen Mfg. Co. v. The Ritz Hotel, had
the occasion to apply the principle of 'anti-dissection'. The appellant
owned and operated hotels under the trademarks 'RITZ PARIS' and
'HOTEL RITZ'. He also operated under the trademark 'PUTTING ON
THE RITZ' for shower curtains. The respondent owned the trademark
'RITZ' and had also been using it in connection with the sale of kitchen
textiles, towels, potholders, etc. The respondent opposed the appellant's
application for the registration of the trademarks 'PUTTING ON THE
RITZ'. The Court applied the anti-dissection rule and held that the mark
must be viewed in its entirety. It observed that the rule ensures that the
mark is evaluated in the same way as a prospective buyer i.e. the
commercial impression of the mark as a whole needs to be considered. It
held that the trademark 'PUTTING ON THE RITZ' when evaluated as a
whole, conveyed an image of 'comfort, sophistication and wealth‟ which
was completely different from the commercial impression that
respondent's mark gave, which is that of cooking or manual labour.
</p><p id="p_20">18.    Similarly in the decision reported as 994 F.2d 1359, 1362 (9th Cir.
1993) Fruit of the Loom Inc. v. Girouard, the Court repelled the claim of
infringement by applying the principle of 'anti-dissection'. The plaintiff
operated under the trademark 'FRUIT OF THE LOOM', whereas the
defendant operated under the trade name 'FRUIT FLOPS' and 'FRUIT
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                            Page 9 of 26</span>
 CUPS'. Both parties were in the business of manufacturing and selling
garments. The plaintiff brought a suit of infringement of trademark
against the defendant. The Court compared the 'FRUIT OF THE LOOM'
mark to 'FRUIT FLOPS' and 'FRUIT CUPS' mark and found the marks
to be dissimilar. The Court observed that the purchasers view the 'FRUIT
OF THE LOOM' mark as a whole rather than as dissected parts. It was
further held that it is the combination of the terms in its entirety that
constitute plaintiff‟s distinctive mark.
</p><p id="p_21">                   The Identification of 'Dominant Mark'
</p><p id="p_22">19.    Though it bears no reiteration that while a mark is to be considered
in entirety, yet it is permissible to accord more or less importance or
'dominance' to a particular portion or element of a mark in cases of
composite marks. Thus, a particular element of a composite mark which
enjoys greater prominence vis-à-vis other constituent elements, may be
termed as a 'dominant mark'.
</p><p id="p_23">20.    At this juncture it would be apposite to refer to a recent decision of
this Court reported as 211(2014) DLT 296 <a href="/doc/102042281/" id="a_3">Stiefel Laborataries v. Ajanta
Pharma Ltd. The</a> Court whilst expounding upon the principle of 'anti-
dissection' cited with approval the views of the eminent author on the
subject comprised in his authoritative treatise -McCarthy on Trademarks
and Unfair Competition. It was observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "41. The anti-dissection rule which is under these
       circumstances required to be applied in India is really based
       upon nature of customer. It has been rightly set out in
       McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition about the
       said rule particularly in Para 23.15 which is reproduced
       hereunder:

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       23.15 Comparing Marks: Differences v. Similarities

       [1] The Anti-Dissection Rule
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                             Page 10 of 26</span>
        [a] Compare composites as a Whole: Conflicting composite
       marks are to be compared by looking at them as a whole, rather
       than breaking the marks up into their component parts for
       comparison. This is the "anti dissection" rule. The rationale for
       the rule is that the commercial impression of a composite
       trademark on an ordinary prospective buyer is created by the
       mark as a whole, not by its component parts. However, it is not
       a violation of the anti-dissection rule to view the component
       parts of conflicting composite marks as a preliminary step on
       the way to an ultimate determination of probable customer
       reaction to the conflicting composites as a whole. Thus,
       conflicting marks must be compared in their entireties. A mark
       should not be dissected or split up into its component parts and
       each part then compared with corresponding parts of the
       conflicting mark to determine the likelihood of confusion. It is
       the impression that the mark as a whole creates on the average
       reasonably prudent buyer and not the parts thereof, that is
       important. As the Supreme Court observed: "The commercial
       impression of a trademark is derived from it as a whole, not
       from its elements separated and considered in detail. For this
       reason it should be considered in its entirety." The anti-
       dissection rule is based upon a common sense observation of
       customer behavior: the typical shopper does not retain all of
       the individual details of a composite mark in his or her mind,
       but retains only an overall, general impression created by the
       composite as a whole. It is the overall impression created by
       the mark from the ordinary shopper's cursory observation in
       the marketplace that will or will not lead to a likelihood of
       confusion, not the impression created from a meticulous
       comparison as expressed in carefully weighed analysis in legal
       briefs. In litigation over the alleged similarity of marks, the
       owner will emphasize the similarities and the alleged infringer
       will emphasize the differences. The point is that the two marks
       should not be examined with a microscope to find the
       differences, for this is not the way the average purchaser views
       the marks. To the average buyer, the points of similarity are
       more important that minor points of difference. A court should
       not engage in "technical gymnastics" in an attempt to find some
       minor differences between conflicting marks.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">       The rationale of the anti-dissection rule is based upon this
       assumption: "An average purchaser does not retain all the
       details of a mark, but rather the mental impression of the mark
       creates in its totality. It has been held to be a violation of the
       anti-dissection rule to focus upon the "prominent" feature of a
       mark and decide likely confusion solely upon that feature,
       ignoring all other elements of the mark. Similarly, it is
       improper to find that one portion of a composite mark has no

       only that which remains."[Emphasis Supplied]

</blockquote><p id="p_24">21.    The view of the author makes it scintillatingly clear, beyond pale of
doubt, that the principle of 'anti dissection' does not impose an absolute
embargo upon the consideration of the constituent elements of a
composite mark. The said elements may be viewed as a preliminary step
on the way to an ultimate determination of probable customer reaction to
the conflicting composites as a whole. Thus, the principle of 'anti-
dissection' and identification of 'dominant mark' are not antithetical to
one another and if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said principles
rather compliment each other.
</p><p id="p_25">22.    We may refer to the decision of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit reported as 380 F.3d 1340 Re Chatam Int‟l, Inc,
wherein the Court enunciated the interplay between the principle of 'anti
dissection' and identification of 'dominant mark'. The Court, while
ascertaining whether the mark 'JOSE GASPAR GOLD' was similar to the
registered mark 'GASPAR'S ALE', held that 'GASPAR' was clearly the
dominant element in the two marks and resembled the relevant mark
enough to cause a likelihood of confusion, to cause a mistake or to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                             Page 12 of 26</span>
 deceive. Relevant would it be to note that the defendant in the said case
urged that the approach of splitting of the marks was in violation of the
anti-dissection rule. The said contention was repelled by the Court and it
was pertinently observed that there was no violation of anti-dissection rule
because the marks were any way examined in entirety, and each
individual term in the marks were given more or less weightage
depending on the overall impression it appeared to create. The Court was
of the view that both marks convey the commercial impression that a
name, GASPAR, is the source of related alcoholic beverages, tequila or
ale. In other words, the commercial significance of ALE in the registered
mark 'GASPAR'S ALE' and JOSE and GOLD in appellant's mark
'JOSE'S GASPAR GOLD' assumed less significance in the opinion of
the Court.
</p><p id="p_26">23.    It is also settled that while a trademark is supposed to be looked at
in entirety, yet the consideration of a trademark as a whole does not
condone infringement where less than the entire trademark is
appropriated. It is therefore not improper to identify elements or features
of the marks that are more or less important for purpose of analysis in
cases of composite marks.
</p><p id="p_27">24.    In this regard we may fortify our conclusion by take note of the
decision reported as 405 F.Supp. 530 (1975) Eaton Allen Corp. v. Paco
Impressions Corp. The facts of the said case reveal that the plaintiff
manufactured coated paper under the registered trademark 'Super-Ko-
Rec-Type'. The defendant manufactured and advertised a similar product
under the mark 'Super Type' and 'Super Type-7'.The defendant
contended that the only similarity between the said marks was use of the
words 'Super' and 'Type', terms which were neither significant parts of
the plaintiff's registered trademark nor protectable as a matter of law. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                             Page 13 of 26</span>
 court held that the consideration of a trademark as a whole does not
preclude infringement where less than the entire trademark is
appropriated.
</p><p id="p_28">25.    Therefore, the submission of the appellant-defendant predicated
upon the principle of 'anti-dissection' that action for infringement would
not lie since use of the word 'D'DAAZS' does not result in complete
appropriation of the respondent-plaintiff's mark 'HAAGEN DAZS',
which is to be viewed as an indivisible whole, is liable to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_29">26.    Dominant features are significant because they attract attention and
consumers are more likely to remember and rely on them for purposes of
identification of the product. Usually, the dominant portion of a mark is
that which has the greater strength or carries more weight. Descriptive or
generic components, having little or no source identifying significance,
are generally less significant in the analysis. However, words that are
arbitrary and distinct possess greater strength and are thus accorded
greater protection.[174 F. Supp. 2d 718, 725 (M.D. Tenn. 2001) Autozone,
Inc. v. Tandy Corporation]
</p><p id="p_30">27.    It would be pertinent to recollect that in the present case, the mark of
the respondent-plaintiff-'HAAGEN DAZS', is a unique combination of
Danish-sounding words, which have no recognised meaning whatsoever in
any language or etymology. Evidently, the owner of the mark coined these
arbitrary words in order to make its brand name sound original or unique.
</p><p id="p_31">28.    This Court, in its judgment reported as 2010 (44) PTC 293(<a href="/doc/147470112/" id="a_4">Del)
Kirorimal Kashiram Marketing and Agencies Pvt. Ltd. v. Shree Sita
Chawal Udyog Mill</a> recognised the principle that arbitrarily chosen
expressions carry greater protection.         The plaintiff prayed for an
injunction restraining the defendant from using the trademark 'Golden
Deer', which was claimed to be deceptively similar to 'Double Deer', the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                               Page 14 of 26</span>
 registered trademark of the plaintiff. The Court held that the expression
'Deer' was arbitrarily adopted by the appellant with respect to its product
rice. A deer has no connection or co-relation with the product namely rice.
Such arbitrary adoption of a word/mark with respect to a product, with
which it has no co-relation, is entitled to a very high degree of protection.
</p><p id="p_32">29.    Furthermore, we would be failing to notice that there exists a high
degree of phonetic similarity between the mark of respondent-plaintiff
'DAZS' and mark of the appellant-defendant 'D'DAAZS'.
</p><p id="p_33">30.    Phonetic similarity constitutes an important index of whether a
mark bears a deceptive or misleading similarity to another.

<a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_5">Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. observed that it
was not correct in law to hold that the principle of phonetic similarity has
to be jettisoned when the manner in which competing words are written is
different.

</blockquote><p id="p_37">34.    A Division Bench of this Court in the decision reported as (40) PTC
417 (Del.) (<a href="/doc/34031579/" id="a_7">DB) Amar Singh Chawal Wala v. Shree Vardhman Rice &amp;
Genl</a>. Mills recognised the relevance of phonetic similarity between the
constituent elements comprised in the competing marks. The plaintiff was
engaged in selling rice under the registered trademarks 'Golden Qilla' and
'Lal Qilla'. The defendant, who was also selling the same product, was
operating under the trademark 'Hara Qilla', against which the plaintiff
sought injunction. The Court held that the essential feature of the mark is
the word 'QILLA', whether it is spelt as QILLA or KILLA, or even
written in a different style or colour combination. It was further observed
that for a customer who would seek to purchase the QILLA brand rice,
both the names would sound phonetically similar. The Court held that
since the trademark QILLA was being utilised for the same commodity
i.e. rice, there existed every possibility of there being confusion created in
the mind of the purchaser of rice that the product being sold by the
defendant was in fact a product that had emanated from or had been
manufactured by the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_38">35.    The appellant - defendant has strenuously urged that the element
'HAAGEN' alone forms the dominant/essential part of the respondent-
plaintiff's registered trademark 'HAAGEN DAZS' and not 'DAZS'. We
may however note that the attention of this Court was not drawn to any
material that would lend credence to the said submission advanced at the
bar. There is nothing on record to support the conclusion that the word

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                               Page 16 of 26</span>
 'HAAGEN' has enjoyed greater prominence or primacy vis-à-vis the other
elements of the mark in the eyes of the consumers at large or the
manufacturer himself and can thus be treated as the dominant element of the
respondent-plaintiff's registered trademark. Prima facie, it appears that both
the elements constituting the mark of the respondent-plaintiff ['HAAGEN'
and 'DAZS'] are equally dominant and are liable to be accorded sufficient
protection under the legal framework. The submission is thus liable to be
rejected.
</p><p id="p_39">36.    We may highlight that even on earlier occasions judicial forums
seisin of such disputes have held both the elements occurring in a composite
trademark to be dominant. At this juncture, it would be apposite to refer to
the judgment dated November 23, 2010 passed by the Court of Justice of
the European Union (8th Chamber) in Case NoC-204/10P Enercon v.
Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and
Designs) (OHIM)
</p><p id="p_40">37.    The factual contours of the said case may be succinctly noted in
order to appreciate the findings arrived at by the Court. The respondent
board had denied the registration of appellant's mark 'ENERCON' on the
opposition made by the proprietor of the registered trademark
'TRANSFORMERS ENERGON'. The appellant challenged the said
rejection on the ground that word 'ENERGON' was not a dominant part
of the registered trademark and therefore negated any likelihood of
confusion. The Court rejected the plea of the appellant and observed that
both    the elements of the opposer‟s           registered   trademark i.e.
„transformers‟ and „energon‟ were equally distinctive and dominant. The
Court added that assessment of the similarity between two marks means
more than taking just one component of a composite trade mark and
comparing it with another mark; on the contrary, the comparison must be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                              Page 17 of 26</span>
 made by examining each of the marks in question as a whole, which does
not mean that the overall impression conveyed to the relevant public by a
composite trade mark may not, in certain circumstances, be dominated by
one or more of its components.
</p><p id="p_41">38.    Significantly, in the decision reported as 809 F. Supp. 816
Universal Motor Oils Co. v. Amoco Oil Co., it has been held that where
the common portion in both the concerned marks is relatively strong or
dominant, there is a higher probability of likelihood of confusion.
</p><p id="p_42">39.    It is also a settled proposition of law that where products are
virtually identical, as they are in the present case, 'the degree of similarity
in the marks necessary to support a finding of infringement is less than in
the case of dissimilar, non-competing products.‟ [Eaton Allen
Corp.(Supra)]
</p><p id="p_43">40.    Before drawing curtains, a word also needs to be spoken about the
effect of the difference in price of the two products. The appellant -
defendant has vehemently urged that its products are priced at a
substantially lower amount than the product of the respondent - plaintiff. It
has been submitted that though the products are similar i.e. frozen desserts,
however they cater to entirely distinct class/strata of consumers.         It is
contended that the consumers of the product marketed by the respondent -
plaintiff are sophisticated owing their capacity to afford such expensive ice-
creams and this would obviate any likelihood of confusion with the
appellant - defendant's mark.
</p><p id="p_44">41.    We do not find merit in this submission. It would be pertinent to note
that the product in question i.e. frozen desserts/ice-creams is of such nature
that it is consumed by people of all age group and strata, transcending all
barriers. Experience suggests that ice-cream is cherished by people
belonging to all age-group, especially children. As highlighted previously,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">FAO (OS) No.389/2014                                               Page 18 of 26</span>
 Justice Parker has regarded the 'nature and kind of customer who would be
likely to buy the goods' as a relevant consideration in the celebrated 'Rules
of Comparison' propounded by him. It cannot be realistically expected that
children; who constitute a substantial chunk of consumers, would be in a
position to distinguish between the two products by taking into account
niceties such as price difference. Doubtless, in assessing cases of trademark
infringement and ascertaining the likelihood of confusion, the effect of
difference in price between the two products may perhaps be more profound
where products such as- premium alcohol, luxury cars, exclusive perfumes
etc. are involved since the prospective consumers in such cases are generally
expected to be endowed with a greater sense of maturity and a keen eye
against deception.

Genesis Infratech Pvt. Ltd</a>. this Court repelled the defence of 'price-
difference' adduced by the defendant. The plaintiff was engaged in real
estate business under the trademark 'IREO SKYON' whereas the defendant
who was also dealing in the same line of business was operating under the
trademark 'Genesis SKYON'. A suit was filed by the plaintiff against the
defendant for infringement of trademark. It was contended on behalf of the
defendant that the cost of the property being sold by the plaintiff is much
higher than the cost of property being dealt by him and thus there exists no
likelihood of confusion. The Court rejected the said contention and held that
the defendant had slavishly copied the mark of the plaintiff and cannot be
permitted to continue to use a deceptively similar trademark. In order to
fortify its conclusion the Court cited with approval the decision reported as
2011 (45) PTC 329 (<a href="/doc/124576547/" id="a_9">Del) Aman Resorts Limited v. Mr. Deepak Narula &amp;
Anr. In</a> the said case the plaintiff was engaged in operating hotels, resorts
and luxury villas under the trade name 'AMAN' and had brought a suit for

 permanent injunction restraining the defendant from using the mark
'AMAN' in respect of the services offered by him. The defendants argued
that the goods and services provided by them were offered at significantly
cheaper rates, so there would be no probability of deception of the public.
The Court did not accept the said contention and significantly observed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "Where a rival or junior mark prices his goods or services at
       significantly cheaper rates than the plaintiff, there is likelihood of
       reputation loss. There is perhaps a ring of truth in the
       defendant's argument, when it says that its room rates are a
       fraction of what the plaintiff charges. Yet, the Court cannot be
       unmindful of the fact that in an Internet driven era, the consumer
       may be led to the defendant's site. There can be cases of
       confusion. While that may not happen, with some discerning
       customers, the possibility cannot be ruled out."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">43.    Reliance may also be placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court
reported as (1996) 5 SCC 714 <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_10">N.R. Dongre &amp; Ors v. Whirlpool Corporation
&amp; Anr. The</a> plaintiff, who was the prior user of the mark 'WHIRLPOOL'
which enjoyed a trans-border reputation, had instituted a suit for passing off
action to restrain the defendant from manufacturing, selling, advertising or
in any way using the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' or any other trade mark
deceptively or confusingly similar to the trade mark of 'WHIRLPOOL' in
respect of their goods. The defendants submitted that the washing machines
produced by them costs less than l/3rd the price of the washing machine
marketed by the plaintiff; and the full description affixed on the washing
machine leaves no room for any confusion in the mind of the buyer. It was
held that where a rival, operating in the same trade name as the plaintiff's,
prices his goods or services at significantly cheaper rates than the plaintiff,
there is likelihood of irreparable injury to the plaintiffs' reputation and
goodwill.

<p id="p_47"> 44.    It may also be observed that even the 'sophisticated consumers' are
not immune from confusion under all circumstances and the said fact would
not lend a complete defence to infringement.

Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf, a Corporation Vs. Steinway &amp; Sons,
it was held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       Plaintiff argues that purchaser will not be confused because of
       the degree of their sophistication and the price (B &amp; L Sales
       Associates Vs. H. Daroff &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, 421 F.2d at 354). It
       is true that deliberate buyers of expensive pianos are not as
       vulnerable to confusion as to products as hasty buyers of
       inexpensive merchandise at a newsstand or drug store
       [Callmann, Unfair Competition Trademarks and Monopolies, (3d
       ed. 1971)]. The sophistication of buyers, however, does not
       always assure the absence of confusion [Communications
       Satellite Corp. Vs. Comcet, Inc., 429 F.2d at 1252]. It is the
       subliminal confusion apparent in the record as to the
       relationship, past and present, between the corporate entities and
       the products that can transcend the competence of even the most
       sophisticated consumer. Misled into an initial interest, a potential
       Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive
       Grotrian - Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a
       Steinway. Deception and confusion thus work to appropriate
       defendant's good will. This confusion, or mistaken beliefs as to
       the companies' interrelationships, can destroy the value of the
       trademark which is intended to point to only one company
       [American Drill Busing Co. v. Rockwell Mfg. Co., 342 F.2d
       1922, 52 CCPA 1173 (1965)]. Thus, the mere fact that
       purchasers may be sophisticated or discriminating is not
       sufficient to preclude the likelihood of confusion. "Being skilled
       in their own art does not necessarily preclude their mistaking one
       trademark for another when the marks are as similar as those
       here in issue, and cover merchandise in the same general field"

</blockquote><p id="p_52">49.    Since time immemorial the Supreme Court has consistently
sounded a note of caution that the competing marks have to be compared
keeping in mind an unwary purchaser of average intelligence and
imperfect recollection. [AIR 1963 SC 449 <a href="/doc/368264/" id="a_12">Amritdhara Pharmacy v.
Satyadeo Gupta</a>]

</p><p id="p_53"> 50.     Consumers of any product do not deliberately memorize marks.
They only retain a general, indefinite, vague, or even hazy impression of a
mark and so may be confused upon encountering a similar mark.
Consumers may equate a new mark or experience with one that they have
long experienced without making an effort to ascertain whether or not
they are the same marks. The consideration therefore is whether one mark
may trigger a confused recollection of another mark. Thus, if the marks
give the same general impression confusion is likely to occur.
</p><p id="p_54">51.     With a view to further foster our understanding of the concept of
similarity and likelihood of confusion arising in trademark jurisprudence,
we may profitably take cue from the analogous principle of 'observability'
which is applied in the context of copyright laws.
</p><p id="p_55">52.     The 'ordinary observer' test is applied to determine if two works are
substantially similar. The Court will look to the response of an 'average lay
observer‟ to ascertain whether a copyright holder's original expression is
identifiable in the allegedly infringing work 274 F.2d 487 (2nd Cir. 1960)
Peter Pan Fabrics Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp. Since it is employed to
determine qualitative and quantitative similarity in visual copyright work,
the said test can also be usefully applied in the domain of trademark law as
well.
</p><p id="p_56">53.     The Courts have reiterated that the test for substantial similarity
involves viewing the product in question through the eyes of the layman. A
layman is not expected to have the same 'hair-splitting' skills as an expert.
A punctilious analysis is not necessary. A layman is presumed to have the
cognition and experiences of a reasonable man. Therefore, if a reasonable
observer is likely to get confused between the two products then a copyright
violation is said to take place.

<p id="p_57"> 54.    Transposing the said principles in the context of trademark
infringement, one may venture to assess similarity and likelihood of
confusion between rival marks on the touchstone of the impression gathered
by a reasonable observer, who is a layman as opposed to a connoisseur.
</p><p id="p_58">55.    The contention raised by the appellant - defendant that in view of the
marked difference in the style of packaging, a prima facie case of
infringement is not made out cannot be countenanced in light of the clear
judicial pronouncements rendered by the Supreme Court.

<a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_13">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical
Laboratories</a>, pertinently observed:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on
       the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the
       vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in
       relation to those goods if the essential features of the trade mark
       of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that
       the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or
       on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked
       differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that
       of the registered proprietor of the make would be
       immaterial."[Emphasis Supplied]

reported as AIR 1986 SC 137 <a href="/doc/103561/" id="a_14">American Home Products v. Mac

</p><p id="p_61">58.    Therefore, in light of the extensive reasons as highlighted above, we
are of the considered view that no interference is called for with the
