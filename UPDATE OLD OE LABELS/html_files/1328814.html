HEADNOTE:
    The appellant is a company having its registered  office
at  Ahmednagar	in Maharashtra. It carries  on	business  as
manufacturers  of Ayurvedic preparations  including  "Asvas"
and  "Aristhas".  At  the material time	 the  appellant	 was
manufacturing and selling an Ayurvedic product,	 "Ashvagand-
harist"	 which is a medicinal preparation  containing  self-
generated  alcohol  but	 not capable of	 being	consumed  as
ordinary alcoholic beverages.
    Medicinal  and Toilet Preparations (Excise	Duties)	 Act
1955  came into force on 1.4.1957. The schedule to the	said
Act  contained	two items specifying "medicinal	 and  toilet
preparations  containing  alcohol"  which  are	prepared  by
distillation  or to which alcohol has been added  and  which
are capable of being consumed as ordinary "alcoholic  bever-
age"  and "medicinal and toilet preparations  not  otherwise
specified  containing alcohol" as the commodities  excisable
under the provisions of the Act. The said  "Ashvagandharist"
was treated and accepted by the Excise Authorities as  being
exempt	from the payment of excise duty upon the  basis	 and
footing that the same was an Ayurvedic preparation  contain-
ing  self-generated alcohol which was not capable  of  being
consumed as ordinary alcoholic beverage and which fell under
item  2(i) of the schedule in respect of which, the rate  of
excise duty prescribed in the schedule was "Nil".
130
    <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_5">The Act</a> was amended by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_6">Amendment Act</a> 19 of 1961  whereby
concept of "patent and proprietary" medicine was  introduced
in the schedule. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_7">The Amendment Act</a>, by an Explanation intro-
duced in the schedule the definition of "patent and proprie-
tary" medicine contained in the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_8">Drugs Act</a> 1940. Despite	 the
said  amendment	 in  the schedule  the	appellants'  product
continued to be treated as exempt from the liability to	 pay
excise	duty  on the ground that it was covered	 under	item
2(i) of the schedule which item was re-numbered as item 3(i)
of the schedule. Thereafter by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_9">section 18</a> of the Finance Act
1962, the Act was further amended by substitution of  Expla-
nation	I to the schedule of the Act. By the  said  explana-
tion,  a "patent and proprietary" medicine was defined as  a
medicinal preparation of the description and the type speci-
fied  in  the Explanation. The said  Explanation  was  given
retrospective  effect from April 23, 1962. In  pursuance  of
the said Explanation I brought by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_10">Finance Act</a>,  Director
of  Prohibition	 and Central Excise, Govt.  of	Maharashtra,
Bombay	issued	a circular dated May 31, 1962,	which  inter
alia  directed	that the medicinal  preparations  containing
self-generated alcohol but not capable of being consumed  as
alcoholic  beverage were to be treated as  products  falling
under Item No. I and not Item 3 of the schedule. As a result
of that circular, the Respondents levied excise duty on	 the
appellants'  product  amounting	 to  Rs.2,  18,282.16p.	 and
realized the same from the appellant. The appellant paid the
amount "under protest".
    With  a  view  to recover the  aforesaid  amount,  which
according  to the appellant, was illegally recovered by	 the
Respondents, the appellant filed a suit, being special	suit
No.  23	 of 1965 in the Court of Civil Judge  Sr.  Division,
Ahmednagar.
    The	 Civil Judge by his order dated 27.3.69 decreed	 the
appellantplaintiff's suit with interest at 6% per annum from
the date of the suit till realisation.
    The	 Respondents appealed to the High Court against	 the
Order  of  the Civil Judge and the High	 Court	allowed	 the
appeal, reversed the Judgment and decree passed by the Civil
Judge and dismissed the appellant's suit. Hence this  appeal
by the plaintiff-appellant by special leave.
Allowing the appeal, this Court,
     HELD: From Explanation I of the Schedule of the Act  as
substituted  by	 Act 5 of 1964 it is clear  that  patent  or
proprietary medicine
131
means any medicinal preparation which is not specified in  a
monograph  in a Pharmacopoeia, Formulary or  other  publica-
tions  notified in this behalf by the Central Government  in
the Official Gazette. [144C]
    To be a patent medicine one would be required to have  a
patent.	 A patented article means an article in	 respect  of
which a patent is in force, [144D]
    A  patent  medicine will, therefore,  mean	medicine  in
respect of which a patent is in force. [144E]
    Patent  means  a grant of some  privilege  property,  or
authority, made by the Government or sovereign of a  country
to one or more individuals. A proprietor is one who has	 the
legal right or exclusive title to anything. It is synonymous
with  owner. A person entitled to a trade mark or  a  design
under  the Acts for the registration or patenting  of  trade
mark  or design is called a proprietor of the trade mark  or
design. [144E-F]
    A Schedule in an Act of Parliament is a mere question of
drafting. It is the legislative intent that is material.  An
Explanation to the Schedule amounts to an Explanation in the
Act itself. [147F]
    The Schedule may be used in construing provisions in the
body of the Act. It is as much an Act of the Legislature  as
the Act itself and it must be read together with the Act for
all  purposes of construction. Expressions in  the  Schedule
cannot	control or prevail against express enactment and  in
case  of  any  inconsistency between the  schedule  and	 the
enactment,  the enactment is to prevail and if any  part  of
the  schedule cannot be made to correspond it must yield  to
the Act. [147H; 148A-B]
    An	explanation is different in nature form	 a  proviso,
for a proviso excepts, excludes or restricts while an expla-
nation explains or clarifies. Such explanation or clarifica-
tion may be in respect of matters whose meaning is  implicit
and not explicit in the main section itself. [149F]

    Ex praecedentibus et consequentibus optima fit interpre-
tatio.	The  best interpretation is made from  the  context.
Injustum  est  nisi tota lege inspecta, de una	aliqua	ejus
particula proposita judicare Vel respondere. It is unjust to
decide or respond as to any particular part of a law without
examining  the whole of the law. Interpretare et  concordare
leges ligibus, est optimus interpretendi modus. To interpret
and  in	 such a way as to harmonize laws with laws,  is	 the
best mode of interpretation. [151G-H]
    Jura  eodem modo distituentur quo  constitutuntur.	Laws
are  abrogated by the same means (authority) by	 which	they
are made. [152A]
    Every  word	 in a Statute is to be given  a	 meaning.  A
construction  which would leave without effect any  part  of
the  language of a statute will normally be rejected.  Every
clause of a statute is to be construed with reference to the
context	 and other clauses of the Act so as to make, as	 far
as  possible, a consistent enactment of the  whole  statute.
[152B]
    A  specific provision to include Ayurvedic	preparations
containing  self-generated alcohol which are not capable  of
being  consumed as ordinary alcoholic beverages	 was  neces-
sary.  That having not been done by the Explanation  itself,
it  was not permissible to include it by the  Circular.	 The
Explanation  I	could  not have been in	 conflict  with	 the
provisions  of the Act and the Circular could not have	been
in  conflict with the Explanation, the Schedule,  the  Rules
and the Act. [152E-F]
    The	 Court	set aside the order of the  High  Court	 and
restored that of the Civil Judge decreeing the suit. [152G]

</p><p id="p_4">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
    SAIKIA,  J- This plaintiff's appeal by special leave  is
from the Appellate Judgment and Decree of the High Court  of
Judicature at Bombay reversing those of the trial court	 and
dismissing plaintiff's special suit.
</p><p id="p_5">    The appellant is a Limited Company registered under	 the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_18">Companies Act</a> having its registered office situate at Ahmed-
nagar within the State of Maharashtra. The appellant carries
on  business,  inter  alia, as	manufacturers  of  Ayurvedic
preparations  including "Asavas", "Aristhas". At  all  times
material to this appeal, the appellant was manufacturing and
selling an Ayurvedic product called "Ashvagandhaarist" which
is a medicinal preparation containing self-generated alcohol
but  not  capable of being consumed  as	 ordinary  alcoholic
beverage.
</p><p id="p_6">Under  the provisions of the Medicinal and  Toilet  Prepara-
tions  . <a href="/doc/1900507/" id="a_19">(Excise Duties) Act</a>, 1955, hereinafter referred  to
as  "the  Act", which came into force on  1st  April,  1957,
excise	duties were levied on medicinal and toilet  prepara-
tions  specified  in the Schedule to  the  Act,	 hereinafter
referred to as "the Schedule". <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_20">The Act</a>, as originally  stood
in  1955,  inter alia, contained two items in  the  Schedule
respectively  specifying "medicinal and toilet	preparations
containing alcohol which are prepared by distillation or  to
which alcohol has been added and which are capable of  being
consumed as ordinary "alcoholic beverage" and "medicinal and
toilet	preparations  not  otherwise  specified	  containing
alcohol",  being the commodities excisable under the  provi-
sions  of the Act. The said "Ashvagandhaarist"	was  treated
and accepted by the Excise Authorities as being exempt	from
the payment of any excise duty upon the basis and the  foot-
ing  that the same was an Ayurvedic  preparation  containing
self-generated	alcohol which was not capable of being	con-
sumed  as ordinary alcoholic beverage, and which fell  under
item  2(i) Of the Schedule in respect of which the  rate  of
excise duty postulated in the Schedule was "Nil".
</p><p id="p_7">     <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_21">The  Act</a> was amended by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_22">Amendment Act</a> 19  of  1961.
The amendment, inter alia, introduced the concept of "patent
and pro-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">134</span>
<p id="p_8">prietary  medicine"  in	 the Schedule.	The  amendment	Act,
however,  by an Explanation, introduced in the Schedule	 the
definition  of	the "patent and proprietary  medicine"	con-
tained	in the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_23">Drugs Act</a>, 1940. Even after the	introduction
of  the	 said amendment, the appellant's  aforesaid  product
continued to be treated as exempt from the liability to	 pay
any excise duty on the self-same ground, namely, that it was
covered under item 2(i) of the Schedule which item 2(i)	 was
renumbered  as item 3(i) of the Schedule as amended  by	 the
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_24">Amendment Act</a> of 1961.
</p><p id="p_9">    By	<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_25">Section	 18</a> of the Finance Act, 1962,  the  Act	 was
further	 amended by substitution of an Explanation No. 1  to
the  Schedule  of the Act. By virtue of and under  the	said
Explanation,  a patent and proprietary medicine was  defined
as  a medicinal preparation of the description and the	type
specified  in  the Explanation. The  Explanation  which	 was
brought in by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_26">Finance Act</a> was given retrospective effect
from April 23, 1962.
</p><p id="p_10">    In	purported pursuance of the said	 Explanation  and/or
upon  the basis thereof, a circular dated May 31,  1962	 was
issued	by  the	 then Director of  Prohibition	and  Central
Excise, Government of Maharashtra, Bombay which, inter alia,
directed  that the medicinal preparations  containing  self-
generated  alcohol  but	 not capable of	 being	consumed  as
alcoholic  beverage were to be treated as  products  falling
under  item  1 and not item 3 of  the  Schedule.  consequent
thereupon,  the	 respondents levied and recovered  from	 the
appellant diverse sums aggregating to Rs.2, 18,282.16  being
the alleged amount of the excise duty payable in respect  of
the product "Ashvagandharist". The amounts were paid by	 the
appellant "under protest".
</p><p id="p_11">    With a view to enforcing their rights in respect thereof
and/or recovering the said amount illegally recovered by the
respondents,  on July 14, 1965, the appellant filed a  suit,
being  Special	Suit No. 23 of 1965 in the  Court  of  Civil
Judge, Senior Division, Ahmednagar.
</p><p id="p_12">    On March 4, 1966, the respondent No. 4 filed its written
statement and similarly on the 4th April, 1966 the  respond-
ent  Nos.  1 to 3 filed written statements. In	the  written
statements, filed on behalf of the respondents it was, inter
alia,  contended that the said product of the appellant	 was
"the  unrestricted ayurvedic preparations"  manufactured  by
the plaintiff (appellant) labelled and marked by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">135</span>
plaintiff (appellant) under their brand name and trade mark.
This, therefore, fell within the scope of patent or proprie-
tary  medicine as given in Explanation 1 below the  Schedule
annexed	 to  the  Act, as inserted from April  23,  1962  by
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_27">Finance Act</a> (No. 2) 1962.
</p><p id="p_13">    By	his  Judgment and Decree dated March 27,  1969,	 the
learned	 Civil Judge was pleased to decree  the	 appellant's
suit  for Rs.2,22,582.07 together with future interest at  6
per  cent per annum from the date of the suit till  realisa-
tion.
</p><p id="p_14">    Aggrieved  by  the Judgment and Order  dated  March	 27,
1969,  the respondents (being the defendants  therein)	pre-
ferred an appeal to the High Court of Judicature at  Bombay,
which  was registered as First Appeal No. 586 of  1969.	 The
said  appeal  was heard by the High  Court  alongwith  other
appeals being First Appeals Nos. 136 of 1968 and 93 of	1970
as  also suits being Suit Nos. 230 of 1965 and 319 of  1965.
The appeals and the suits were heard together having  regard
to  the	 common questions of law involved  therein.  By	 its
judgment and decree the High Court was pleased to allow	 the
said first appeal of the respondents, reversing the judgment
and decree of the Trial Court and to dismiss the appellant's
special suit. Hence this appeal by special leave.
    Mr. S.K. Dholakia, the learned counsel for the appellant
submits, inter alia, that the findings of the High Court are
repugnant  to the relevant provisions of the Act and/or	 the
rules  framed thereunder and/or the scheme, intendments	 and
purposes  thereof.  It	is contended  that  the	 appellant's
product "Ashvagandhaarist" fell squarely within item 3(i) of
the  Schedule and as such wholly exempt from the payment  of
excise	duty;  that in view of the  admitted  position	that
until 1962 "Ashvagandhaarist" was exempt from the payment of
excise duty as being a commodity falling under item No. 2(i)
of  the Schedule, simply by reason of the Explanation  which
was introduced in the Act by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_28">Finance Act</a> of 1962, as the
explanation  could  never  be considered to be	or,  in	 any
event, in the scheme of the provision of the Act, was not  a
substantive provision of the Act and the explanation was not
intended  to and it did not seek to disturb the	 enumeration
of  the categories or the respective fields assigned to	 the
various items of the schedule in existence prior thereto. It
is  submitted  that  item 3 of the amended  Schedule  was  a
specific item and enumerated categories of Ayurvedic medici-
nal  preparations  covered thereby and that  being  so,	 all
commodities  answering	description  set  out  therein	fell
within the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">136</span>
ambit thereof and was excluded from the purview of the other
items  contained in the said schedule and that	the  express
language  of item 3(i), namely, of  "Ayurvedic	preparations
containing self-generated alcohol which were not capable  of
being consumed as ordinary alcoholic beverages" were exempt-
ed  and that the appellant's product "Ashvagandhaarist"	 was
admittedly and obviously an Ayurvedic preparation containing
self-generated	alcohol which was not capable of being	con-
sumed  as ordinary alcoholic beverage and as such  it  could
not be made excisable on the ground that it fell within	 any
other  item  of the schedule but  it  constituted  residuary
clause of the schedule in so far as the medicinal and toilet
preparations  containing  alcohol  were	 concerned.  Counsel
further	 submits that the expression "not  otherwise  speci-
fied"  occurring in item 3 of the schedule did not  restrict
the scope of the enumerated categories under item 3 but	 was
merely	a  marginal note showing that the said	item  3	 was
residuary item and comprised of three sub-groups of commodi-
ties specified therein; and that item No. 1 was not a speci-
fied item. Mr. Dholakia further submits that the interpreta-
tion that "ashvagandhaarist" fell within item No. 1 rendered
the provisions of item No. 3 wholly nugatory inasmuch as  if
an  Ayurvedic preparation containing self-generated  alcohol
but incapable of being used as ordinary alcoholic  beverage,
is  treated  as	 failing  under item 1	there  would  be  no
Ayurvedic  medicine which would factually fail under item  3
of the schedule and that the Explanation newly introduced by
the  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_29">Finance Act</a>, 1962 could not add to, amend or  alter  or
vary the classification of the goods existing prior  thereto
as  covered by the various items of the said  schedule;	 nor
could it otherwise nullify or add to, amend or alter or vary
the substantive provisions of the schedule and it could	 not
be  considered to be a substantive provision of the Act	 nor
could  it be allowed to abrogate the substantive  provisions
of  the Act. In other words, the submission is that in	view
of  the	 fact that the product of the appellant	 was  exempt
from payment of duty because the duty against item No.	3(i)
in  the amended Schedule of 1961 was mentioned to  be  'nil'
the  High Court ought to have held that the said  legal	 and
factual	 position could not be transformed to the  detriment
of  the	 appellant by shifting the said commodity  from	 the
field covered by item 3(i) to that covered by item 1 of	 the
Act merely on the basis of the Explanation which was  intro-
duced  by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_30">Finance Act</a> of 1962. Counsel argues that	this
was more so because "ashvagandhaarist" was not a name within
the  contemplation of the explanation but was merely  a	 de-
scriptive appellation of the medicine manufactured and	sold
by the appellant and it being a standard preparation accord-
ing to the Ayurvedic system could be manufactured by any one
conversant with the said system, and it did
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">137</span>
not have a brand name in the hands of the appellant and	 the
High  Court's  interpretation that a mere description  is  a
name  is inconsistent with the scheme of the  definition  of
"patent and proprietary medicines" in the Explanation.	This
was  the reason, it is argued, why Asavas and Aristhas	were
expressly  made non-dutiable after 25.9.6,4.  by  subsequent
amendment by the Government.
</p><p id="p_15">     Mr.  A.K.	Ganguli, learned counsel appearing  for	 the
respondents,  demurring, submits that there can be no  doubt
that "Asavas" and "Aristhas" fall under item 1 of the sched-
ule  to the Act as substituted by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_31">Finance Act</a> 2 of 1962	 and
hence  taxable at 10% ad valorem; and those being  Ayurvedic
preparations are specified preparations and they could never
fail  under  item  3 or any part thereof  which	 deals	with
medicinal  preparations not otherwise  specified  containing
alcohol. Item 1, Mr. Ganguli submits, specifically describes
that  medicinal and toilet preparation which  has  alcoholic
contents  and  which alcohol comes to be  present  in  those
medicines by use of one of the two methods described in that
item. First of such methods contemplates alcohol contents in
the  medicine  which  is prepared by  distillation  and	 the
second	method is addition of alcohol to the  medicine.	 The
medicinal preparation which is prepared by distillation	 and
which  contains alcohol and other medicinal preparations  to
which alcohol is added fall in category I and such medicines
would  cover  medicinal	 preparations  belonging  either  to
Allopathic  or	Ayurvedic system or I any  other  system  of
medicines.  For every system of medicines,  counsel  argues,
item No. 1 is not general item but it is a specific item  in
the sense it covers only those medicines which are  prepared
by  distillation  and contain alcohol and  others  to  which
alcohol has been added. According to counsel, such medicines
belonging  to any system whether indigenous or	foreign	 are
covered by item 1 and would be taxable as per that item	 and
the  disputed goods are undoubtedly  medicinal	preparations
and  they are also patent and proprietary medicines in	view
of  the Explanation 1 and these Ayurvedic  preparations	 are
medicinal preparations being patent or proprietary medicines
containing  alcohol which are not capable of being  consumed
as alcoholic beverages and as such they squarely fall  under
item 1 of the Schedule, and the main Act and the Explanation
is a self-contained provision which eliminates the reference
either to <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_32">Drugs Act</a> or to the Rules made under the Act;	 and
one  has  to read only the provision of the  Schedule  as  a
whole  including  the Explanation, and their  meaning  being
simple and plain, they must be given their full effect.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">138</span>
<p id="p_16">    To appreciate the rival contentions we can appropriately
refer to the provisions and the Schedule of the Act and	 the
legislative  changes thereof. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_33">The Act</a> was meant	 to  provide
for  the levy and collection of duty of excise on  medicinal
and  toilet preparations containing alcohol,  opium,  Indian
hemp  or other narcotic drug or narcotic. The  statement  of
objects	 and  reasons  as notified in Gazette  of  India  of

been classified into three groups, namely, Ayurvedic  prepa-

others.	 These three divisions were not drugs as defined  in

had  not been subjected to duty while the other two  catego-

alcoholic  beverages' were dutiable at the rate of Rupees  3

Ext., page 106, said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	       "Consequent  on the decision to adopt  metric
	      units from the 1st April, 1961, in the sale of
	      alcohol and collection of duty thereon, it  is
	      proposed	to provide for the levy and  collec-
	      tion  of excise duty on medicinal	 and  toilet
	      preparations in terms of metric units.
	      ............................................
		       Under  existing	item  2(ii)  of	 the
	      Schedule	to the Act,  Ayurvedic	preparations
	      containing  self-generated alcohol  which	 are
	      capable of being consumed as ordinary alcohol-
	      ic beverages are subjected to duty at the rate
	      of Rs.3 per gallon. However, by virtue of	 the
	      provision	 contained in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_49">section 19(2)(xix)</a>  of
	      the Act, read with Rule 8 of the Medicinal and

	      1956,  the rate of duty with respect  to	such
	      preparations has been reduced to Rs. 1.75	 per
	      gallon  with effect from the  10th  September,
	      1960,  and  it is this reduced rate  that	 is,
	      proposed	to be expressed in terms  of  metric
	      units in the Bill."</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">    It	would  thus be clear that the main purpose  was	 the
levy  and collection of excise duty on medicinal and  toilet
preparations in terms of metric unit. while there was refer-
ence to them existing item 2(ii) of the Schedule of the Act,
namely, Ayurvedic preparations containing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">142</span>
self-generated alcohol which were capable of being  consumed
as ordinary alcoholic beverages the duty whereof was reduced
to  Rs. 1.75 per gallon from Rs.3 per gallon, there  was  no
mention that item No. 2(i) of the Schedule, namely, Ayurved-
ic preparations containing self-generated alcohol which were
not  capable of being consumed as ordinary alcoholic  bever-
ages  was  subjected  to tax. The statement  of	 object	 and
reasons was silent about item No. 2(i).
</p><p id="p_33">    In	the  amended Schedule we find that item	 1  for	 the
first time mentioned medicinal preparations being patent  or
proprietary medicines, containing alcohol and which are	 not
capable	 of being consumed as ordinary	alcoholic  beverages
and the earlier item No. 1 has been re-numbered as item	 No.
2 and the earlier item No. 2(i), (ii) and (iii) remained  as
they were as 3(i), 3(ii) and 3(iii). As regards levy of duty
item  2(i)  of the old Schedule was kept duty free  in	item
3(i) of the Schedule. Thus, there has been no fresh charging
of duty on what was 2(i) and is now 3(i) under which catego-
ry  the appellant's product 'ashvagandhaarist' was  exempted
from  duty before the amendment of the Schedule.  There	 is,
therefore,  no	doubt that item 1 &amp; 2(i)  remained  mutually
exclusive or in other words, they would not be	overlapping.
Item 1 in the amended Schedule deals with medicinal prepara-
tions being patent or proprietary medicines and not  medici-
nal preparations 'not otherwise specified.'
    The Explanation I says that patent or proprietary  medi-
cines has the same meaning as in clause (h) of <a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_50">Section 3</a>  of
the  Drugs Act, 1940. The High Court has found that  re-num-
bered definition 3(h) was earlier 3(d) and read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "3(d) 'Patent or proprietary medicine' means a
	      drug  which is a remedy or  prescription	pre-
	      pared  for internal or external use  of  human
	      beings  or animals, and which is not  for	 the
	      time being recognised by the Permanent Commis-
	      sion  on	Biological  Standardisation  of	 the
	      World  Health  Organisation or in	 the  latest
	      edition  of the British Pharmacopoeia  or	 the
	      British  Pharmaceutical  Codex  or  any  other
	      Pharmacopoeia authorised in this behalf by the
	      Central Government after consultation with the
	      Board."
</blockquote><p id="p_34">Thus, patent or proprietary medicines meant a drug which was
defined in the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_51">Drugs Act</a> and not in the Act. The High  Court
rightly held that Ayurvedic medicine was not a drug at	all.
The  definition	 of  drug expressly excluded  them.  So	 the
definition of patent or proprietary medicine
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">143</span>
was  exclusive	of Ayurvedic medicinal	preparations,  those
being  excluded from the definition of drug. The  definition
of patent and proprietary medicines till then did not  apply
to  Ayurvedic preparations. This position  continued  indeed
till  the amendment of <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_52">Drugs Act</a> by the Drugs and  <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_53">Cosmetics
(Amendment)  Act</a>, 1964. Several amendments were effected  by
that  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_54">Amendment	 Act</a> of 1964. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_55">Section 33A</a> and Chapter  IV  A
were  inserted. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_56">Section 33A</a> said that Chapter IV was not  to
apply to Ayurvedic (including Siddha) or Unani drugs.  "Save
as otherwise provided in this Act, nothing contained in this
Chapter shall apply to Ayurvedic (including Siddha) or Unani
drugs".	 Chapter IVA made.provisions relating  to  Ayurvedic
(including Siddha) and Unani drugs. This shows that prior to
this amendment of 1964 Ayurvedic preparations were expressly
not drugs under the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_57">Drugs Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_35">    The	 Drugs	and  <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_58">Cosmetics Act</a> in  the  amendment  First
Schedule after the amendment Act of 1964 included  Ayurvedic
(including  Siddha)  and Unani system drugs  prepared  under
<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_59">Section	 3(a)</a>  which  contains	the  definition:  "Ayurvedic
(including  Siddha)  or Unani drugs includes  all  medicines
intended  for  internal or external use of human  beings  or
animals and all substances intended to be used for or in the
diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in
human beings and animals, mentioned and process and manufac-
ture  exclusively in accordance with the formula  prescribed
in the authoritative book on Ayurvedic (Siddha) Unani system
of medicines specified in the first schedule." This  defini-
tion  was also inserted by Drugs and  <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_60">Cosmetics	 (Amendment)
Act</a>,  1964  (13 of 1964) <a href="/doc/1380624/" id="a_61">Section 2(a)(i)</a>  with	effect	from
15.9.1964.
</p><p id="p_36">    The same exclusion remained in the related <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_62">Central Act</a>s.
For  example, the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_63">Drugs Control Act</a>, 1950 (Act 26  of  1950)
replaced the Drugs Control Ordinance, 1949 (6 of 1949) which
was  promulgated on 3.10. 1949 in order to ensure that	cer-
tain essential imported drugs and medicines were sold in the
reasonable  price  in the  Chief  Commissioner's  provinces.
Similar	 ordinances  were issued by all the  provinces.	 The
necessity  for continuing price control of  these  essential
drugs continued. That was an Act to provide for the  control
of  sale, supply and distribution of drugs. Drug  meant	 any
drug  as  defined in clause (b) of <a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_64">Section 3</a> of	 Drugs	Act,
1940, in respect of which a declaration had been made  under
<a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_65">Section 3</a> which defined drug. It may be noted that Pharmaco-
poeia  authorised  for the purpose of <a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_66">Section  3(h)</a>  of	 the
Drugs Act, 1940, were: The Indian Pharmacopoeia, the Pharma-
copoeia of the United States, the National formulary of	 the
United States, the International Pharmacopoeia and the State
Pharmacopoeia
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">144</span>
of  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, vide  S.O.	 701
Gazette of India, 1961, Pt. II,<a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_67"> S. 3(ii)</a>, p. 725. There	 was
thus  no Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia prescribed for the  purpose
of that Act. Pharmacopoeia is a book containing the list  of
drugs  with directions for use. The fact that  no  Ayurvedic
Pharmacopoeia  had  been notified at the relevant  time	 was
because	 Ayurvedic preparations were not drugs for the	pur-
pose  of  <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_68">Drugs Act</a> and, for that matter, of  Medicinal	 and
Toilet	Preparations  (Excise Duties) Act, at  the  relevant
time.  It  could  be for this reason that  in  the  original
Schedule  the expression medicinal and	toilet	preparations
'not  otherwise specified' was used and	 Ayurvedic  prepara-
tions of different categories were put under item 2. In	 the
Schedule as amended by the 1962 Act, this expression contin-
ued in item 3, The same definition of 'drug' also  continued
in the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_69">Drugs Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_37">    From  the  Explanation I of the Schedule of the  Act  as
substituted by Act 5 of 1964 also it is clear that patent or
proprietary  medicine means any medicinal preparation  which
is  not specified in a monograph in a Pharmacopoeia,  Formu-
lary  or other publications notified in this behalf  by	 the
Central Government in the Official Gazette.
    To be a patent medicine one would be required to have  a
patent.	 A patented article means an article in	 respect  of
which a patent is in force. "Patent" means a patent  granted
under  the Indian Patent and <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_70">Designs Act</a>, 1911, and now	 the
<a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_71">Patent	Act</a>, 1970. A patent medicine will,  therefore,	mean
medicine in respect of which a patent is in force. "Proprie-
tary"  means of a proprietor, that is,	holding	 proprietary
rights. Patent means a grant of some privilege, property, or
authority, made by the Government or sovereign of a  country
to one or more individuals. A proprietor is one who has	 the
legal right or exclusive title to anything. It is synonymous
with  owner. A person entitled to a trade mark or  a  design
under  the acts for the registration or patenting  of  trade
mark  or design is called a proprietor of the trade mark  or
design.	 Under	the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_72">Merchandise Marks	 Act</a>,  1958,
"trade mark" means:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "(i)  in	relation to Chapter  X	(other	than

trade-mark  means  a  trade-mark which is  actually  on	 the
register.

1962 with retrospective effect from 23rd April, 1962.
    The Director of Prohibition and Excise, for	 Maharashtra
State,	Bombay, thereafter issued the circular	dated  31.5.
1962  (Ext.  44).  It said that the  patent  or	 proprietary
medicines as defined in clause (d) of<a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_76"> s. 3</a> of the Drugs	 Act
of 1940 (23 of 1940) and falling under items No. 1 and No. 4
of  the Act as substituted by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_77">Amendment Act</a>, 1961  were,
prior to 23rd April, 1962, subject to levy of duty at 10 per
cent ad
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">146</span>
valorem by virtue of the Explanation I below the Schedule to
the  Act which has now been deleted from 23rd  April,  1962.
According  to  new  definition of  'Patent  and	 Proprietary
Medicines'  as	given in the new Explanation as	 amended  by
Finance (No. 2) Act, 1962 medicinal preparations  containing
alcohol,  opium,  Indian  hemp or other	 narcotic  drugs  or
narcotic  falling  under item 3(i), 3(iii) and 3(v)  of	 the
said Schedule, were with effect from 23rd April, 1962 liable
to  duty  not under the said items but under item No.  1  or
item  No. 4 of the said Schedule at 10 per cent ad  valorem,
if  such preparations are "patent or proprietary  medicines"
as defined in the Explanation. Excise duty on all 'patent or
proprietary  medicinal preparations' (Alopathic,  Ayurvedic,
Unani  and  Homoeopathic preparations)	containing  alcohol,
opium, Indian hemp or other narcotic drug or narcotic, which
fall within the purview of the new definition of 'patent  or
proprietary  medicines'	 given in  the	Explanation,  should
therefore, be recovered at the rate of 10 per cent ad  valo-
rem from the holders of the licences granted under the	said
Act and the rules thereunder in accordance with the instruc-
tions contained in their Circular No. DQ 64-31/61 dated 22nd
July,  1961. A note received from the Government  of  India,
explaining  the	 scope of the new definition of	 'patent  or
proprietary  medicines'	 was also enclosed  along  with	 the
circular.
</p><p id="p_41">    It	is in evidence in the instant case that two  bottles
containing Asavas were produced in the Court as Exhibit 42/1
and  Exhibit 42/2. Both the bottles contained the same	kind
of Asavas. The ingredients of the two were the same and	 the
preparation  of the two was also the same. When	 the  Asavas
were  sold  during the period beginning from June,  1962  to
February,  1964,  no excise duty was levied because  on	 the
label  there  was no trade mark of  patent  and	 proprietary
right printed. If the Asavas were sold in the bottle  having
a  label with no trade mark as at Exhibit 42/1, no duty	 was
recovered from the plaintiff. These Asavas were supplied  to
Employees'  State Insurance as per their tender without	 the
trade  mark  on the label to see that  the  plaintiffcompany
were not taxed the excise duty which would have been charged
had  they put the patent mark on the label. But in order  to
fight  for  blemish of cheating, the  plaintiff	 thought  it
necessary to have the trade mark on such bottles without any
difference.  As soon as the goods were sought to be sold  in
the  above manner the excise duty was levied and was  sought
to  be recovered from the plaintiff's fund. No	excise	duty
was  recovered after February, 1964 even though Asavas	were
sold  with  their trade mark. It is also  in  evidence	that
there  were two sub-groups in the group of Asavas and  Aris-
thas  known as 'restricted' and	 'unrestricted'.  Restricted
means preparations which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">147</span>
could  be  used	 as alcoholic beverages. In  this  case	 the
period from 26.7.62 to 29.2.64 is alone material inasmuch as
by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_78">Finance Act</a> of 1964 with reference to item No. 1, the
Ayurvedic  and	Unani  medicines  containing  self-generated
alcohol	 and  which were not capable of	 being	consumed  as
ordinary alcoholic beverages were exempted from the levy  of
excise	duty. In other words, the position prior to  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_79">Finance
Act</a>  of	 1962  was continued and  thereafter  the  medicinal
preparations, namely, Asavas and Aristhas ceased to be taxed
from 1964.
</p><p id="p_42">    It	would be noted that the Explanation itself  did	 not
specifically  mention  "Allopathic,  Ayurvedic,	 Unani	 and
Homoeopathic  preparations"  as was done in  the  Director's
Circular. On a comparison of the earlier Explanation and the
substituted  Explanation  one  would  notice  that   earlier
"patent	 and  proprietary medicines" meant a  drug.  In	 the
substituted Explanation it means any medicinal	preparation.
However, it can not be lost sight of that the words "medici-
nal  preparation" as continued to be defined in<a href="/doc/182359/" id="a_80"> s.  2(g)</a>  of
the Act "includes all drugs which are a remedy or  prescrip-
tion  prepared for internal or external use of human  beings
or animals and all substances intended to be used for or  in
treatment,  mitigation	or prevention of diseases  in  human
beings	or animals." We have already noticed that the  <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_81">Drugs
Act</a>  continued	to exclude Ayurvedic preparations  till	 its
amendment in 1964. It has been stated that even after amend-
ment  of the Schedule after 1961 amendment  the	 appellant's
product was exempted from duty, till the Director's Circular
disturbed the position.
</p><p id="p_43">    This brings us to the question of interpretation of	 the
Act  and the Schedule with the Explanation. in view  of	 the
submission that the Explanation could not have rendered item
3(i)  of  the Schedule redundant. Was there  any  change  of
intention of the Legislature in this regard?
</p><p id="p_44">    A Schedule in an Act of Parliament is a mere question of
drafting. It is the legislative intent that is material.  An
Explanation to the Schedule amounts to an Explanation in the
Act itself. As we read in Halsbury's Laws of England,  Third
Edition, Vol. 36, para 551: "To simplify the presentation of
statutes, it is the practice for their subject matter to  be
divided, where appropriate, between sections and  schedules,
the former setting out matters of principle, and introducing
the latter, and the latter containing all matters of detail.
This is purely a matter of arrangement, and a schedule is as
much a part of the statute, and as much an enactment, as  is
the section by which it is introduced." The schedule may  be
used in construing provisions in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">148</span>
body of the Act. It is as much an act of Legislature as	 the
Act itself and it must be read together with the Act for all
purposes of construction. Expressions in the Schedule cannot
control or prevail against the express enactment and in case
of any inconsistency between the schedule and the  enactment
the enactment is to prevail and if any part of the  schedule
cannot be made to correspond it must yield to the Act.	Lord
Sterndale, in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Gittus, [1920]
1 K.B. 563 said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "It  seems to me there are two  principles  of
	      rules  of	 interpretation which  ought  to  be
	      applied  to the combination of Act and  Sched-
	      ule.  <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_82">If the Act</a> says that the Schedule is  to
	      be used for a certain purpose and the  heading
	      of the part of the Schedule in question  shows
	      that it is prima facie at any rate devoted  to
	      that  purpose, then you must read the Act	 and
	      the  Schedule  as	 though	 the  Schedule	were
	      operating	 for  the purpose, and	if  you	 can
	      satisfy  the language of the  section  without
	      extending it beyond that purpose you ought  to
	      do it. But if in spite of that you find in the
	      language of the Schedule words and terms	that
	      go clearly outside that purpose, then you must
	      give effect to them and you must not  consider
	      them as limited by the heading of that part of
	      the Schedule or by the purpose mentioned in
	      the Act for which the Schedule is prima  facie
	      to  be used. You cannot refuse to give  effect
	      to clear words simply because prima facie they
	      seem  to	be  limited by the  heading  of	 the
	      Schedule and the definition of the purpose  of
	      the Schedule contained in the Act."</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">     The  above	 observation was not disapproved  in  appeal
(1921)	2 A.C. 81. However, the basic principle is  that  in
case  of  a  conflict between the body of the  Act  and	 the
Schedule, the former prevails. In the instant case we do not
find any such conflict.

v.  Bank  of Bihar</a>, AIR 1967 SC 389: (1967) 1 SCR  848,	 may

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">149</span>
unless	it is to be inferred from the language used. It	 was

1961  SC  3 15: (1961) 1 SCR 902, that the  explanation	 was
meant to explain the Article and must be interpreted accord-

Govind	Mahajan	 v. State of Maharashtra</a>, AIR  1977  SC	 915
(928): (1977) 2 SCR 790, that mere description of a  certain
provision, such as "Explanation" is not decisive of its true
meaning. It is true that the orthodox function of an  expla-
nation	is  to explain the meaning and effect  of  the	main
provision to which it is an explanation and to clear up	 any
doubt or ambiguity in it, but ultimately it is the intention
of  the	 legislature which is paramount and mere  use  of  a
label  cannot  control or deflect such intention.  <a href="/doc/424874/" id="a_88">State  of
Bombay	v. United Motors</a>, (supra) laid down that the  inter-
pretation must obviously depend upon the words used therein,
but  this must be borne in mind that when the  provision  is
capable of two interpretations, that should be adopted which
fits the description. An explanation is different in  nature
from a proviso for a proviso excepts, excludes or  restricts
while an explanation explains or clarifies. Such explanation
or clarification may be in respect of matters whose  meaning
is implicit and not explicit in the main section itself.  <a href="/doc/174910953/" id="a_89">In
Hiralal	 Ratanlal v. State of U.P</a>., [1973] 1 SCC 216  (225),
it was ruled that if on a true reading of an Explanation  it
appears	 that it has widened the scope of the main  section,
effect	be given to legislative intent	notwithstanding	 the
fact that the Legislature named that provision as an  Expla-
nation.	 In  all these matters courts have to find  out	 the
true intention of the Legislature. In D.G. Mahajan v.  State
of Maharashtra, (supra) xx this Court said that	 legislature
has  different	ways of expressing itself and  in  the	last
analysis the words used alone are repository of	 legislative
intent	and  that if necessary an Explanation must  be	con-
strued	according  to its plain language and 'not on  any  a
priori consideration'.
</p><p id="p_47">    Applying the above principles we do not find any differ-
ence between the Schedule and the Explanation I; the  latter
has not amended the Schedule by either deleting item 3(i) or
by adding or including Ayurvedic preparations in item 1.  No
change of legislative intent is indicated.
    In the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties)
Rules,	1956  Section C Medicinal and  Toilet  preparations,
Allopathic   preparations,  Homoeopathic  preparations	 and
Ayurvedic preparations are dealt with separately. So far  as
Ayurvedic preparations are concerned,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">150</span>
Rule 64 dealing with types of preparations said: "Asavas and
Aristhas  are the principal types of Ayurvedic	preparations
in  which alcoholic content is self-generated and not  added
as  such." Rule 65 on Pharmacopoeia for	 Ayurvedic  prepara-
tions  said: "Until a standard Ayurvedic  pharmacopoeia	 has
been  evolved by the Central Government, the  pharmacopoeias
that are in vogue in the various States shall be  recognised
as  standard Ayurvedic pharmacopoeias." Rule  66  classified
the  preparations  containing  self-generated  alcohol	 for
purposes of levy of duty. It said: "No duty shall be  levied
on Ayurvedic preparations containing self-generated  alcohol
in  which  the alcohol content does not exceed 2  per  cent.
Where  the percentage of proof spirit is in excess of 2	 per
cent, duty will be leviable under item 2(ii) or 2(i) of	 the
Schedule to Act the according as the preparations are  capa-
ble  of	 being consumed as ordinary  alcoholic	beverage  or
not." Thus Ayurvedic preparations containing  self-generated
alcohol	 which	are not capable of being used  as  alcoholic
beverages fall under original 2(i) and now 3(i).
    The above Rules, which have not been shown to have	been
amended	 clearly  say  that where the  percentage  of  proof
spirit is in excess of 2% the preparation would be  dutiable
under  item 2 which became item No. 3 in the amended  Sched-
ule. This Rule is consistent with the Schedule but is wholly
inconsistent with the Director's circular.
    Mr.	 Ganguli relies on (1971) 2 SCR 590: (1971) 1 SCC  4
Baidyanath  Ayurved Bhawan Pvt. Ltd. v. The  Excise  Commis-
sioner	of  U.P., The question there was  whether  medicinal
preparation  containing tincture, spirit etc. was  dutiable.
The tincture and spirit in their turn contained alcohol.  It
was  contended that alcohol was not directly added  but	 was
component of the tincture or spirit. It was, however conced-
ed  that  the preparations were medicinal  preparations	 and
that tincture was a component of that preparation and  alco-
hol was a component of tincture. Therefore, this Court	held
that it was difficult to see how it could be urged that	 the
preparation  did  not contain alcohol. All  that  the  plain
language of the provision required was that the	 preparation
should	contain	 alcohol.  The	question  whether  Ayurvedic
preparation  was a drug to be included in the definition  of
medicinal preparation was not involved. Whether	 self-gener-
ated  alcohol  was to be treated differently  was  also	 not
there.
</p><p id="p_48">    <a href="/doc/434484/" id="a_90">In Mohanlal Maganlal Bhavsar v. Union of India</a>. [1986] 1
SCC 122 it was held that before a medicinal preparation	 can
fall under Item
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">151</span>
1 of the Schedule three conditions are required to be satis-
fied:  (A) the preparation must be a patent  or	 proprietary
medicine;  (2) it must contain alcohol; and (3) it must	 not
be capable of being consumed as an ordinary alcoholic bever-
age.  The fact that ointments and liniments  were  medicinal
preparations containing alcohol in semi-liquid form did	 not
make any difference. However it was not in dispute that	 the
articles were medicinal preparations for the purposes of the
Act and that they were patent and proprietary medicines.  In
the instant case the question is whether Ayurvedic  prepara-
tions,	in view of the definition of medicinal	preparations
in the Act, could be regarded as drugs and could be dutiable
under Item 3 and not Item 1. <a href="/doc/850597/" id="a_91">In Commissioner of Sales Tax v.
The Modi Sugar Mills Ltd</a>., [1961] 2 SCR 189 it was held that
a taxing statute must be interpreted in the light of what is
clearly expressed therein and nothing can be implied nor can
provisions be imported into them so as to supply an  assumed
deficiency. In Baidyanath Ayurved Bhawan (supra) this  Court
quoted the observation of Rowlatt, J. in Cape Brandy  Syndi-
cate  v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, [1921] 1  K.B.  64
that  "in  a taxing Act one has to look at what	 is  clearly
said.  There  is  no room for any intendment.  There  is  no
equity	about  a  tax. There is no presumption	as  to	tax.
Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One	 can
only look fairly at the language used." The question in	 the
instant	 case, however, is whether the	appellant's  product
being  an  Ayurvedic preparation could be a drug  for  being
included in the definition of medicinal preparation for	 the
purpose	 of  the Act. This question was not  raised  in	 the
above cases.
</p><p id="p_49">    As	Mr. Dholakia points out, the Circular  would  render
item 3(i) of the Schedule wholly redundant. It has been	 the
consistent policy of legislature to exempt item 3(i) hither-
to  2(i),  from	 duty. The legislature has not	in  any	 way
changed	 it. The Explanation has not in any way altered	 the
classification in the Schedule. The substituted	 Explanation
no doubt stressed on patents and trade marks. But it has not
expressly  envisaged  in  item	I,  patented  trade   marked
Ayurvedic preparations contrary to the classification in the
Schedule.  Ex  praecedentibus et consequentibus	 optima	 fit
interpretatio.	The  best interpretation is  made  from	 the
context. Injustum est nisi tota lege inspecta, de una aliqua
ejus  particula	 proposita judicare Vel	 respondere.  It  is
unjust	to decide or respond as to any particular part of  a
law without examining the whole of the law. Interpretare  et
concordare  leges legibus, est optimus interpretendi  modus.
To  interpret  and in such a way as to harmonize  laws	with
laws,  is  the best mode of interpretation. In	the  instant
case  the  Director's Circular is not in harmony  with	item
3(i) or with the classifi-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">152</span>
<p id="p_50">cation	of  Ayurvedic preparations in separate	item  3.  It
would  not  be in conformity with  definition  of  medicinal
preparation' in<a href="/doc/182359/" id="a_92"> s. 2(g)</a> of the Act. Jura eodern modo dislit-
uentur	quo constitutuntur. Laws are abrogated by  the	same
means  (authority)  by which they are made.  The  Director's
Circular  is  not shown to have been a	piece  of  delegated
legislation. The Explanation on its tenor does not amend the
Schedule. No part of a Statute is to be taken as superfluous
or  redundant.	Every  word in a Statute is to	be  given  a
meaning. A construction which would leave without effect any
part of the language of a statute will normally be rejected.
Every clause of a statute is to be construed with  reference
to  the context and other clauses of the Act so as to  make,
as  far	 as possible, a consistent enactment  of  the  whole
Statute.
</p><p id="p_51">    The High Court accepted the submission that it  provided
a selfcontained definition of 'patent and proprietary  medi-
cines'	for  the  purpose of the main Act  and	severed	 the
connection  between the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_93">Drugs Act</a>  as	 was
contemplated in earlier Explanation I, and consequently	 one
need not look to the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_94">Drugs Act</a> at all for its interpretation
and the Schedule was thence to be interpreted as it  existed
along with that self-containing definition in Explanation I.
In  doing  so,	the position that  "Patent  and	 Proprietary
medicines"  means  "any medicinal  preparation"	 which	very
"Medicinal  preparation"  includes  all drugs  which  are  a
remedy	or  prescription etc. as defined in<a href="/doc/182359/" id="a_95"> s. 2(g)</a>  of	 the
Act. So a reference to the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_96">Drugs Act</a> was still necessary. No
doubt this is an inclusive definition. To enlarge its  deno-
tation	a specific provision to include	 Ayurvedic  prepara-
tions containing selfgenerated alcohol which are not capable
of being consumed as ordinary alcoholic beverages was neces-
sary.  That having not been done by the Explanation  itself,
it  was not permissible to include it by the  Circular.	 The
Explanation  I	could  not have been in	 conflict  with	 the
provisions  of the Act and the Circular could not have	been
in  conflict with the Explanation, the Schedule,  the  Rules
and the Act.

the High Court and restore those of the Civil Judge  decree-
ing the suit. We leave the parties to bear their own costs.
