M.K. MUKHERJEE, J.
</p><p id="p_6">     Special  leave   granted.	Heard  the  learned  counsel
appearing for the parties.
</p><p id="p_7">     These two	appeals have  been heard  together  as	they
arise out  of one  and the  same incident.  Facts leading to
these appeals and relevant for their disposal are as under :
</p><p id="p_8">     On July  29, 1988, Mrs. Rupan Deol Bajaj, an Officer of
the Indian  Administrative Service  (I.A.S) belonging to the
Punjab Cadre  and then	working as  the	 Special  Secretary,
Finance, lodged	 a complaint  with the	Inspector General of
Police, Chandigarh  Union Territory  alleging commission  of
offences under	<a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_1">Sections 341</a>,  <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_2">342</a>, <a href="/doc/1672685/" id="a_3">352</a>, <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_4">354</a>, and <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_5">509</a> of the
Indian Penal  Code ("<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>" for short) by Mr. K.P.S. Gill, the
Director General  of Police,  Punjab on	 July 18,  1988 at a
dinner	party.	 Treating  that	  complaint  as	  the  First
Information Report  (FIR)  a  case  was	 registered  by	 the
Central	 Police	  Station,   Sector   17,   Chandigarh	 and
investigation was taken up. Thereafter on November 22, 1988,
her husband  Mr. B.R. Bajaj, who also happens to be a senior
I.A.S. officer	of the	Punjab Cadre,  lodged a complaint in
the Court  of the  Chief Judicial  Magistrate for  the	same
offences, alleging,  inter alia, that Mr. Gill being a high-
ranking Police	Officer the  Chandigarh Police	had  neither
arrested him  in connection  with the case registered by the
Police on  his wife's  complaint nor conducted investigation
in a  fair and	impartial manner  and apprehending  that the
Police would conclude the investigation by treating the case
as untraced  he was  filing the complaint. On receipt of the
complaint the  Chief Judicial Magistrate transferred it to a
Judicial Magistrate  for disposal and the latter, in view of
the fact that an investigation by the Police was in progress
in relation  to the  same offences, called for a report from
the Investigating  Officer in accordance with <a href="/doc/788422/" id="a_7">Section 210</a> of
Code of	 Criminal Procedure  ("<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a>." for  short). In	 the
meantime -  on December	 16, 1988  to be  precise - Mr. Gill
moved the  High Court by filing a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section 482</a>
Cr. P.C.  for quashing the F.I.R. and the complaint. On that
petition  an   interim	order	was   passed   staying	 the
investigation into  the F.I.R. lodged by Mrs. Bajaj, but not
the proceedings	 initiated on  the complaint  of Mr.  Bajaj.
Resultantly, the  learned Judicial Magistrate proceeded with
the complaint  case and	 examined the  complainant  and	 the
witnesses produced  by him.  Thereafter, Mr.  Bajaj moved an
application before  the learned Magistrate for summoning Mr.
Y.S. Ratra,  an I.A.S.	Officer of  the Government of Punjab
and Mr.	 J.F. Rebeiro, Adviser to the Governor of Punjab for
being examined	as witnesses on his behalf and for producing
certain documents,  which was  allowed. Instead of appearing
personally, the above two Officers sought for exemption from
appearance; and	 the District  Attorney, after producing the
documents, filed  an application  claiming  privilege  under
<a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_10">Sections 123</a>/<a href="/doc/1958937/" id="a_11">124</a> of the Evidence Act in respect of them. The
learned Magistrate  rejected the  prayer of  the  above	 two
officers  and	also  rejected,	  after	 going	through	 the
documents, the claim of privilege, being of the opinion that
the documents  did not	concern the  affairs of	 the  State.
Assailing the  order of the learned Magistrate rejecting the
claim of  privilege, the  State of  Punjab filed  a Criminal
Revision Petition which was allowed by the High Court by its
Order dated  January 24, 1989. The petition earlier filed by
Mr. Gill  under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_12">Section	 482</a> Cr.  P.C. came  up for  hearing
before the  High Court	thereafter and	was allowed  by	 its
order dated  May 29,  1989  and	 both  the  F.I.R.  and	 the
complaint were	quashed. The  above two	 orders of  the High
Court are  under challenge  in these appeals at the instance
of Mr.	and Mrs.  Bajaj. Of the two appeals we first proceed
to consider the merits of the one preferred against quashing
of the	F.I.R. and  the complaint (arising out of SLP (Crl.)
No. 2358  of 1989)  for, in  case it fails, the other appeal
{arising out  of SLP  (Crl.)  No.  1361	 of  1989}  would  ,
necessarily, be infructuous.
</p><p id="p_9">     On perusal	 of the	 impugned judgment  we find that the
following reasons  weighed with	 the High  Court in quashing
the F.I.R.:-
</p><p id="p_10">(i)  the  allegations  made  therein  do  not  disclose	 any
cognizable offence;
</p><p id="p_11">(ii) the  nature of  harm allegedly caused to Mrs. Bajaj did
not entitle  her to  complain about  the  same	in  view  of
<a href="/doc/62835/" id="a_13">Section 95</a> IPC;
</p><p id="p_12">(iii) the allegations are unnatural and improbable;
</p><p id="p_13">(iv) the Investigating Officer did not apply his mind to the
allegations made in the F.I.R., for had he done so, he would
have found that there was no reason to suspect commission of
a cognizable  offence, which  was the  `sine  qua  non'	 for
starting an investigation under <a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_14">Section 157</a> Cr. P.C.; and
</p><p id="p_14">(v) there  was unreasonable and unexplained delay of 11 days
in lodging the F.I.R.
</p><p id="p_15">     As regards	 the complaint	of Mr. Bajaj, the High Court
observed that  the allegations	were almost  identical	with
some improvements made therein.
</p><p id="p_16">     Mrs. Indira  Jaisingh, the learned counsel appearing in
support of  the appeals	 strongly  criticised  the  impugned
judgment and  contended that in exercise of its powers under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_15">Section 482</a>  Cr.  P.C.,	 the  High  Court  should  not	have
interferred with  the statutory	 powers	 of  the  police  to
investigate into  cognizable offences and quashed the F.I.R.
specially  when	  the  allegations   made  in	the   F.I.R.
unmistakably constituted  offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">  the  Indian  Penal
Code</a> and  that this  unjustifiable interference was in clear
violation of  the principles  laid down	 by this  Court in a
number of  decisions. She next contended that the finding of
the High  Court that  the allegations  made  in	 the  F.I.R.
attracted the  provisions of  <a href="/doc/62835/" id="a_17">Section 95</a>  IPC  was  patently
wrong as in a case where the modesty of a woman is involved,
the said  section cannot have any manner of application. She
next contended	that the  story given  out in the F.I.R. was
neither improbable  nor unreliable as the High Court thought
of. As	regards	 the  delay  in	 lodging  the  F.I.R.,	Mrs.
Jaisingh submitted  that a  satisfactory explanation for the
delay had  been given  in the F.I.R. itself. This apart, she
submitted, the	delay of 11 days in lodging an F.I.R., could
not, by	 any stretch  of imagination,  be made	a ground for
quashing it.  She lastly  submitted that  the High Court was
wholly	unjustified   in  taking  exception  to	 the  police
officer's  registering	 the  F.I.R.   and  initiating	 the
investigation  for,  once  it  was  found  that	 the  F.I.R.
disclosed  cognizable	offence,  it   was   the   statutory
obligation of  the police  to  investigate  into  the  same.
According to  Mrs. Jaisingh.  the High Court committed grave
injustice and  illegality by  quashing the  F.I.R.  and	 the
complaint.
</p><p id="p_17">     Mr. Tulsi,	 the learned  Additional Solicitor  General,
appearing for  Mr. Gill on the other hand submitted that the
impugned judgment  of the  High Court  was a well considered
and well  reasoned one so far as it held that the F.I.R. did
not disclose  any cognizable  offence, that  the allegations
made therein  being  trivial  attracted	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/62835/" id="a_18">Section 95</a> IPC and that the allegations were improbable. He,
however, in  fairness, conceded	 that the  last two  reasons
canvassed by the High Court to quash the F.I.R. could not be
sustained.
</p><p id="p_18">     The question  under  what	circumstances  and  in	what
categories of  cases the High Court can quash an F.I.R. or a
complaint in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of	 India or  under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_20">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. has had
been engaging  the attention of this Court for long. Indeed,
the learned counsel for the parties invited our attention to
some of those decisions. We need not, however, refer to them
as in  State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335
this Court considered its earlier decisions, including those
referred to  by the  learned counsel, and answered the above
question as under:
</p><p id="p_19">	  In	the	backdrop    of	  the
     interpretation of	the various  relevant
     provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21"> of the Code</a> under Chapter XIV
     and of  the principles of law enunciated
     by this  Court in	a series of decisions
     relating  to   the	  exercise   of	  the
     extraordinary power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> or
     the inherent powers under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_23">Section 482</a> of
     the Code  which we have extracted and of
     cases by  way  of	illustration  wherein
     such  power  process  of  any  court  or
     otherwise to  secure the  lay  down  any
     precise,	  clearly     defined	  and
     sufficiently channelised  and inflexible
     guidelines or rigid formulae and to give
     an exhaustive  list of  myriad kinds  of
     cases  wherein   such  power  should  be
     exercised.</p>
<p id="p_20">     (1)  Where the  allegations made  in the
     first   information    report   or	  the
     complaint, even  if they  are  taken  at
     their face	 value and  accepted in their
     entirety do  not prima  facie constitute
     any offence  or make  out a case against
     the accused.
</p><p id="p_21">     (2)  Where the  allegations in the first
     information report	 and other materials,
     if any,  accompanying  the	 FIR  do  not
     disclose	 a     cognizable    offence,
     justifying an  investigation  by  police
     officers under  <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_24">Section  156(1)</a>  of  the
     Code  except   under  an	order  of   a
     Magistrate within the purview of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_25">Section
     155</a> (2)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26"> of the Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_22">     (3)  Where	     the       uncontroverted
     allegations made in the FIR or complaint
     and the evidence collected in support of
     the same  do not disclose the commission
     of any  offence  and  make	 out  a	 case
     against the accused.
</p><p id="p_23">     (4)  Where, the  allegations in  the FIR
     do not  constitute a  cognizable offence
     but  constitute  only  a  non-cognizable
     offence, no  investigation is  permitted
     by a  police officer without an order of
     a	Magistrate   as	 contemplated	under
     <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_27">Section 155</a> (2)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28"> of the Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_24">     (5)  Where the  allegations made  in the
     FIR  or  complaint	 are  so  absurd  and
     inherently improbable  on the  basis  of
     which no prudent person can ever reach a
     just conclusion that there is sufficient
     ground  for   proceeding	against	  the
     accused.
</p><p id="p_25">     (6)  Where there is an express legal bar
     engrafted in  any of  the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29">  of
     the Code</a>  or the  concerned  Act  (under
     which   a	  criminal   proceeding	   is
     instituted)  to   the  institution	  and
     continuance of  the  proceedings  and/or
     where there  is a	specific provision in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30">
     the Code</a> or the concerned Act, providing
     efficacious redress for the grievance of
     the aggrieved party.</p>
<p id="p_26">     (7)  Where	 a   criminal  proceeding  is
     manifestly	 attended   with  mala	 fide
     and/or   where    the   proceeding	   is
     maliciously instituted  with an ulterior
     motive for	 wreaking  vengeance  on  the
     accused and with a view to spite him due
     to private and personal grudge.
</p><p id="p_27">	  We also  give a  note of caution to
     the effect	 that the power of quashing a
     criminal proceeding  should be exercised
     very sparingly  and with  circumspection
     and that too i the rarest of rare cases;
</p><p id="p_28">     that the  court will not be justified in
     embarking upon  an	 enquiry  as  to  the
     reliability or  genuineness or otherwise
     of the  allegations made  in the  FIR or
     the complaint and that the extraordinary
     or inherent  powers  do  not  confer  an
     arbitrary jurisdiction  on the  court to
     act according to its whim or caprice."
</p><p id="p_29">			  (emphasis supplied)
     In the  context of	 the reasons given by the High Court
for quashing the F.I.R. and the complaint and the respective
stands of  the learned	counsel for  the parties in relation
thereto, we  have to  ascertain whether	 the case  presented
before us  comes under	categories (1),	 (3) and  (5) above.
Besides, it  raises the	 applicability of  <a href="/doc/62835/" id="a_31">Section  95</a>	IPC.
Since the  answers to  the above  three questions have to be
found out  from the  F.I.R. itself  we need to look into the
contents thereof.
</p><p id="p_30">     It is  first stated therein that in the evening of July
18, 1988  Mrs. Bajaj  accompanied by her husband had gone to
the residence  of Shri S.L. Kapur, a colleague of theirs, in
response to  an invitation  for dinner. Reaching there at or
about 9	 P.M. they found 20/25 couples present including Mr.
Gill, who  had come  without his wife, and some other senior
Government officers  (named in	the F.I.R.).  The party	 had
been arranged  in the  lawn at	the back of the house and as
per tradition  in Indian  homes,  the  ladies  were  sitting
segregated in  a large	semi-circle  and  the  gentlemen  in
another large semi-circle with the groups facing each other.
With the  above preface	 comes Mrs.  Bajaj's account  of the
incident in question, which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "Around 10.00  P.M. Dr. P.N. Chutani and
     Shri K.P.S.  Gill walked  across to  the
     circle of	the ladies  and	 joined	 them
     occupying the  only  two  vacant  chairs
     available, almost	on opposite  sides of
     the semi-circle. Shri K.P.S. Gill took a
     vacant chair  about 5 to 6 chairs to the
     left of where I was sitting. Slowly, all
     the ladies sitting to the right and left
     of him,  got up, and started leaving and
     going into	 the house.  I was talking to
     Mrs. Bijlani  and	Mrs.  K.P.  Bhandari,
     sitting on my right, and did not notice,
     or come  to know, that those ladies were
     getting up	 and  vacating	their  chairs
     because he had misbehaved with them.
     Shri K.P.S.  Gill called out to me where
     I was sitting and said, "Mrs. Bajaj come
     and sit  here, I  want to	talk  to  you
     about something." I got up from my chair
     to go  and sit  next to  him. When I was
     about to  sit down,  he suddenly  pulled
     the cane  chair on	 which I was going to
     sit close	to his chair and touching his
     chair. I  felt a little surprised. I put
     the chair back at its original place and
     about to sit down again when he repeated
     his action	 pulling the  chair close  to
     his chair. I realised that something was
     very wrong	 and without  sitting down  I
     immediately left  and went	 back and sat
     in my  original place  between the other
     ladies.   Mrs.    Bijlani,	  Mrs.	 K.P.
     Bhandari, Mrs.  Paramjit Singh  and Mrs.
     Shukla Mahajan  were occupying  seats on
     my right  and Mrs.	 Nehra was sitting to
     the left of me at that time.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     After about  10 minutes Shri K.P.S. Gill
     got up  from his seat and came and stood
     straight but so close that his legs were
     about four inches from my knees. He made
     an action	with the  crook of his finger
     asking me	to stand  and said,  "You get
     up. You  come along with me." I strongly
     objected to  his behaviour and told him,
     "Mr. Gill How dare you! You are behaving
     in an  obnoxious manner,  go  away	 from
     here". Whereupon  he repeated  his words
     like a  command and  said, "You  get up!
     Get up  immediately and  come along with
     me." I  looked to	the other ladies, all
     the   ladies    looked    shocked	  and
     speechless.  I   felt  apprehensive  and
     frightened, as he had blocked my way and
     I could not get up from my chair without
     my	 body	touching  his  body.  I	 then
     immediately drew  my chair	 back about a
     foot and  half and	 quickly got  up  and
     turned to	get out of the circle through
     the  space	  between   mine   and	 Mrs.
     Bijlani's chair. Whereupon he slapped me
     on the  posterior. This  was done in the
     full presence of the ladies, and guests.</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">     Mrs. Bajaj	 has then detailed her immediate reaction to
the incident  followed by  the steps she took to apprise the
Chief  Secretary,  the	Adviser	 to  the  Governor  and	 the
Governor of  Punjab  of	 the  incident.	 She  concluded	 her
narration with the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     "Ordinarily, my  complaint to  a  Police
     Officer (Shri J.F. Ribeiro) is enough to
     be considered  as an FIR and he had duly
     apprised the  Governor, Punjab,  and the
     Administrator of  the Chandigarh,	Union
     Territory,	 at  the  earliest  occasion.
     Since I  understand that  the matter has
     not  yet	percolated  down   from	  the
     Governor to  lead to  the registration a
     case, I  am formally  lodging an  F.I.R.
     with the  authorities of  the Chandigarh
     Administration lest there is any problem
     about jurisdiction of the Police Officer
     later."</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">     Sequentially summarised  the statements and allegations
as contained  in the  earlier quoted three paragraphs of the
F.I.R. would read thus:
</p><p id="p_33">(i)  Around 10	P.M. Dr. CHutani and Shri Gill walked across
to and set in the ladies' circle;
</p><p id="p_34">(ii) Mrs. Bajaj,  who was  then talking	 to Mrs. Bijlani and
Mrs. Bhandari,	was requested  by Mr.  Gill to	come and sit
near him as he wanted to talk to her about something;
</p><p id="p_35">(iii)	  Responding to	 his such  request when	 Mrs.  Bajaj
went to	 sit in a chair next to him Mr. Gill suddenly pulled
that chair close to his chair;
</p><p id="p_36">(iv) Felling a bit surprised, when she put that chair at its
original place	and was	 about to  sit down,  Mr. Gill again
pulled his chair closer;
</p><p id="p_37">(v)  Realising something  was wrong she immediately left the
place and went back to sit with the ladies;
</p><p id="p_38">(vi) After about  10 minutes  Shri Gill	 came and  stood  in
front of  her so  close that his legs were about 4" from her
knees;
</p><p id="p_39">(vii)	  He then  by an action with the crook of his finger
asked her to "get up immediately" and come along with him;
</p><p id="p_40">(viii)	  When she  strongly objected  to his  behaviour and
asked him  to go  away from  there he  repeated his  earlier
command which shocked the ladies present there;
</p><p id="p_41">(ix) Being apprehensive	 and frightened	 she tried  to leave
the place but could not as he had blocked her way;
</p><p id="p_42">(x)  Finding no	 other alternative  when she  drew her chair
back and  turned backwards,  he slapped her on the posterior
in the full presence of the ladies and guests.
</p><p id="p_43">     Coming now	 to the	 moot point  as to whether the above
allegations constitute	any or all of the offences for which
the case  was registered,  we first  turn to <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_32">Section 354</a> and
<a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_33">509</a> IPC,  both of  which relate	 to modesty  of woman. These
Sections read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "354.     Whoever	 assaults   or	 uses
     criminal force  to any  woman, intending
     to outrage	 or knowing  it to  be likely
     that  he	will  thereby	outrage	  her
     modesty,	shall	 be   punished	 with
     imprisonment of either description for a
     term which	 may extend  to two years, or
     with fine, or with both."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "509.     Whoever, intending  to  insult
     the modesty  of any  woman,  utters  any
     word, makes  any sound  or	 gesture,  or
     exhibits any object, intending that such
     word or  sound shall  be heard,  or that
     such gesture or object shall be seen, by
     such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy
     of such  woman, shall  be punished	 with
     simple imprisonment for a term which may
     extend to	one year,  or with  fine,  or
     with both."</blockquote>
<p id="p_44">     Since the	word `modesty'	has not	 been defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34"> the
Indian Penal Code</a> we may profitably look into its dictionary
meaning. According  to	Shorter	 Oxford	 English  Dictionary
(Third Edition)	 modesty is  the quality of being modest and
in relation  to woman means "womanly propriety of behaviour;
scrupulous chastity  of thought,  speech and  conduct".	 The
word `modest'  in relation  to woman is defined in the above
dictionary as  "decorous in  manner and conduct; not forward
or  lewd;  shamefast".	Webster's  Third  New  International
Dictionary  of	the  English  language	defines	 modesty  as
"freedom from  coarseness, indelicacy or indecency; a regard
for propriety  in dress,  speech or  conduct". In the Oxford
English	 Dictionary  (1933  Ed)	 the  meaning  of  the	word
`modesty' is  given  as	 "womanly  propriety  of  behaviour;
scrupulous chastity  of thought,  speech and conduct (in man
or  woman);  reserve  or  sense	 of  shame  proceeding	from
instinctive aversion to impure or coarse suggestions".
</p><p id="p_45">     <a href="/doc/960519/" id="a_35">In State  of Punjab  vs. Major Singh</a> (AIR 1967 Sc 63) a
question arose	whether a  female child	 of seven and a half
months could  be said  to be  possessed of  `modesty'  which
could be outraged. In answering the above question Mudholkar
J., who	 along with Bachawat J. spoke for the majority, held
that when  any act  done to or in the presence of a woman is
clearly suggestive of sex according to the common notions of
mankind that  must fall	 within the  mischief of <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_36">Section 354</a>
IPC. Needless  to  say,	 the  `common  notions	of  mankind'
referred to  by the  learned Judge  have  to  be  gauged  by
contemporary societal  standards. The  other  learned  Judge
(Bachawat J.) observed that the essence of a woman's modesty
is her sex and from her very birth she possesses the modesty
which is the attribute of her sex. From the above dictionary
meaning of  `modesty' and  the interpretation  given to that
word by	 this Court in Major Singh's case (supra) it appears
to us  that  the  ultimate  test  for  ascertaining  whether
modesty has  been outraged is, is the action of the offender
such as	 could be  perceived as	 one  which  is	 capable  of
shocking the  sense of	decency of  a woman.  When the above
test is	 applied in  the present  case, keeping	 in view the
total fact situation, it cannot but be held that the alleged
act of	Mr. Gill  in slapping  Mrs. Bajaj  on her  posterior
amounted to  `outraging of  her modesty' for it was not only
an affront  to the normal sense of feminine decency but also
an affront  to the  dignity of the lady - "sexual overtones"
or not, notwithstanding.
</p><p id="p_46">     It was  however strenuously  urged by  Mr. Tulsi,	that
even if	 it was	 assumed that  Mr.  Gill  had  outraged	 the
modesty of Mrs. Bajaj still no offence under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_37">Section 354</a> IPC
could be  said to  have been  committed by him for the other
ingredient of the offence, namely, that he intended to do so
was totally lacking. He urged that the culpable intention of
the offender in committing the act is the crux of the matter
and not the consequences thereof. To buttress his contention
he invited  our attention  to the following passage from the
judgment of  this Court	 in <a href="/doc/1275754/" id="a_38">Hitendra Vishnu Thakur vs. State
of Maharashtra</a>	(1994) 4  SCC 602: (one of us, namely Anand,
J. was a party)
     "Thus  the	  true	ambit  and  scope  of
     <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_39">Section 3</a>	(1)  is	 that  no  conviction
     under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_40">Section  3</a>  (1)  of	TADA  can  be
     recorded unless  the evidence led by the
     prosecution establishes that the offence
     was  committed  with  the	intention  as
     envisaged by  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_41">Section 3</a>  (1) by means of
     the weapons  etc. as  enumerated in  the
     section  and   was	 committed  with  the
     motive  as	  postulated  by   the	 said
     section. Even at the cost of repetition,
     we may  say that  where it	 is only  the
     consequence of  the criminal  act of  an
     accused that  terror, fear	 or panic  is
     caused, but  the crime was not committed
     with  the	 intention  as	envisaged  by
     <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_42">Section 3</a>	(1) to	achieve the objective
     as envisaged  by the section, an accused
     should not	 be convicted  for an offence
     under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_43">Section  3</a> (1)  of TADA.  To bring
     home a charge under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_44">Section 3</a> (1) of the
     Act, the  terror or  panic etc.  must be
     actually intended with a view to achieve
     the result	 as envisasged	by  the	 said
     section and  not be merely an incidental
     fall  out	 or  a	 consequence  of  the
     criminal activity.	 Every crime, being a
     revolt  against  the  society,  involves
     some violent  activity which  results in
     some degree  of panic  or	creates	 some
     fear  or  terror  in  the	people	or  a
     section thereof,  but unless  the panic,
     fear or  terror  was  intended  and  was
     sought  to	  achieve   either   of	  the
     objectives as  envisaged  in  <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_45">Section  3</a>
     (1), the  offence would not fall stricto
     sensu under TADA."
</p><p id="p_47">     It	 is   undoubtedly  correct   that  if  intention  or
knowledge is  one of  the ingredients of any offence, it has
got to	be proved  like other  ingredients for	convicting a
person. But,  it is also equally true that those ingredients
being states  of mind  may not	be proved by direct evidence
and may have to be inferred from the attending circumstances
of a  given case. Since, however, in the instant case we are
only at the incipient stage we have to ascertain, only prima
facie, whether	Mr. Gill  by  slapping	Mrs.  Bajaj  on	 her
posterior, in  the background  detailed by  her in  the FIR,
intended to  outrage or	 knew it  to be likely that he would
thereby outrage	 her modesty,  which is one of the essential
ingredients of <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_46">Section 354</a> IPC. The sequence of events which
we have detailed earlier indicates that the slapping was the
finale	to   the  earlier   overtures  of  Mr.	Gill,  which
considered together,  persuade us  to hold  that he  had the
requisite culpable intention. Even if we had presumed he had
no such intention he must be attributed with such knowledge,
as the alleged act was committed by him in the presence of a
gathering comprising the elite of the society - as the names
and designations  of the  people given	in the FIR indicate.
While on  this point  we may  also  mention  that  there  is
nothing in  the FIR  to indicate,  even remotely,  that	 the
indecent act  was committed  by Mr. Gill, accidentally or by
mistake or it was a slip. For the reasons aforesaid, it must
also be	 said that,  - apart  from the offence under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_47">Section
354</a> IPC - an offence under <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_48">Section 509</a> IPC has been made out
on the	allegations contained  in the  FIR as the words used
and gestures  made by  Mr. Gill	 were intended to insult the
modesty of Mrs. Bajaj.
</p><p id="p_48">     That brings  us to	 the other  offences, namely,  under
<a href="/doc/1672685/" id="a_49">Sections 352</a>,  <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_50">341</a>, <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_51">342</a> IPC. We need not however take notice
of the	offence under  <a href="/doc/1672685/" id="a_52">Section 352</a> IPC for the offence under
<a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_53">Section 354</a>  IPC includes  the ingredients of the former. In
other words,  <a href="/doc/1672685/" id="a_54">Section 352</a> IPC constitutes a minor offence in
relation to  the  other.  Regarding  the  offence  of  wrong
confinement punishable	under <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_55">Section  342</a> IPC	there is not
any iota  of material  in the FIR; and so far as the offence
under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_56">Section  341</a> IPC	is concerned,  the  only  allegation
relating to the same is that Mr. Gill stood in front of Mrs.
Bajaj in  such a  manner that she had to move backward. From
such act  alone	 it  cannot  be	 said  that  he	 `wrongfully
restrained' her	 within the  meaning of	 <a href="/doc/278610/" id="a_57">Section 339</a>  IPC to
make him liable under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_58">Section 341</a> IPC.
</p><p id="p_49">     Now that we have found that the allegations made in the
FIR, prima  facie, disclose  offences under  <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_59">Section 354</a> and
<a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_60">509</a> IPC,  we may  advert to  the applicability of <a href="/doc/62835/" id="a_61">Section 95</a>
IPC thereto. The Section reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     "Nothing is an offence by reason that it
     causes, or that it is intended to cause,
     or that  it is  known to  be  likely  to
     cause, any	 harm, if  that	 harm  is  so
     slight that  no person of ordinary sense
     and temper would complain of such harm".</blockquote>
<p id="p_50">     In dealing	 with the above Section in <a href="/doc/1879362/" id="a_62">Veeda Menezes vs.
Yusuf Khan</a>  (AIR 1966  SC 1773)	 a three Judge Bench of this
Court observed that the object of framing the Section was to
exclude from  the operation<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_63">  of the  Indian Penal Code</a> those
cases which  from the  imperfection  of	 language  may	fall
within the  letter of  the law but are not within its spirit
and are	 considered, and for the most part dealt with by the
courts, as innocent. In other words, the Section is intended
to prevent  penalisation of negligible wrongs or of offences
of trivial  character. In interpreting the expression `harm'
appearing in  the Section  this Court  said that  it is wide
enough to  include physical  injury as also injurious mental
reaction. As  regards the  applicability of the Section in a
given case, this Court observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     "Whether an  act  which  amounts  to  an
     offence  is  trivial  would  undoubtedly
     depend upon  the nature  of the  injury,
     the  position   of	 the   parties,	  the
     knowledge or  intention with  which  the
     offending act is done, and other related
     circumstances. There  can be no absolute
     standard or  degree of harm which may be
     regarded as  so slight  that a person of
     ordinary  sense  and  temper  would  not
     complain  of  the	harm.  It  cannot  be
     judged solely by the measure of physical
     or other injury the act causes".</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">     (emphasis supplied)
     Viewed in	the light  of the above principles we are of
the opinion that <a href="/doc/62835/" id="a_64">Section 95</a> IPC has no manner of application
to the	allegations made in the F.I.R. On perusal of the FIR
we have	 found that  Mr. Gill,	the top most official of the
State Police,  indecently behaved  with Mrs. Bajaj, a Senior
lady IAS Officer, in the presence of a gentry and inspite of
her raising objections continued with his such behaviour. If
we are	to hold,  on the  face of such allegations that, the
ignominy and  trauma to	 which she  was subjected  to was so
slight that  Mrs. Bajaj,  as a	person of ordinary sense and
temper, would  not complain about the same, sagacity will be
the first  casualty. In	 that view of the matter we need not
delve into  the contention  of Mrs.  JaiSingh, -  much	less
decide -  that <a href="/doc/62835/" id="a_65">Section	95</a> IPC	cannot have  any  manner  of
application to	an offence  relating to	 modesty of woman as
under no circumstances can it be trivial.
</p><p id="p_52">     In recording  its third reason for quashing the FIR the
High Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     "In the  present case there were 48 more
     persons present;  24  ladies  and	equal
     number  of	 gentlemen.  It	 sounds	 both
     unnatural and  unconscionable  that  the
     petitioner (Mr.  Gill) would  attempt or
     dare  to  outrage	the  modesty  of  the
     author of	the First  Information Report
     in	 their	 very  presence	  inside  the
     residential    house     of    Financial
     Commissioner (Home)."</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">     We are  constrained to  say that  in making  the  above
observations the  High Court  has flagrantly  disregarded  -
unwittingly we	presume -  the settled principle of law that
at the	stage of quashing an FIR or complaint the High Court
is not	justified in  embarking upon  an enquiry  as to	 the
probability, reliability  or genuineness  of the allegations
made therein.  Of course  as has  been pointed out in Bhajan
Lal's case  (supra) an	F.I.R. or a complaint may be quashed
if the allegations made therein are so absurd and inherently
improbable that	 no prudent  person can	 ever reach  a	just
conclusion that	 there is  sufficient ground  for proceeding
against the accused but the High Court has not recorded such
a finding,  obviously because  on the allegations in the FIR
it was	not possible  to do so. For the reasons aforesaid we
must hold that the High Court has committed a gross error of
law in	quashing the  FIR and the complaint. Accordingly, we
set aside  the impugned	 judgment and  dismiss the  petition
filed by  Mr. Gill  in the  High  Court	 under	<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_66">Section	 482</a>
Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_54">     The  consequential	 direction  that  is  to  ordinarily
follow from  the above	order is  mandates to  the police to
investigate into  the FIR and to the learned Magistrate, who
was in	seining of the complaint case, to proceed with it in
accordance with	 <a href="/doc/788422/" id="a_67">Section 210</a>  Cr. P.C. but then we find from
the records  placed before  us by  Mr. Sanghi,	the  learned
counsel appearing  for the  Chandigarh Administration,	that
before the  High Court	was moved  by Mr.  Gill through	 his
petition under	<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_68">Section 482</a>  Cr.P.C. and  the interim  order
staying investigation  of the  case registered on the F.I.R.
was  passed   thereon,	the   police   had   completed	 the
investigation and  sent the  papers relating  thereto to the
Legal Rememberancer-cum-Director  of Prosecution  (`LR'	 for
short) for  his opinion.  After his opinion was received the
investigating officer  prepared the  `police (final) report'
on November  22, 1988  and forwarded  it, through the Senior
Superintendent of  Police, Chandigarh Administration (S.S.P)
on November  28, 1988 to the `Ilaka' Magistrate stating that
the evidence  on record did not substantiate the accusations
of the	complainant (Mrs. Bajaj). The learned Magistrate, in
his turn,  accepted the	 report	 on  December  9,  1989	 and
ordered that  the case	be filed with accused as `untraced'.
In the	context of  the fact that the High Court had, in the
meantime quashed  the F.I.R.  the  above  order	 was  wholly
unnecessary and	 redundant but, now that we have revived the
F.I.R. and  the complaint  it also revives. That necessarily
means, that  if we allow the above order to stand one course
left open  to us  is, in  view of  our earlier	findings, to
direct the  Magistrate to  proceed  with  the  complaint  in
accordance with	 the provisions	 of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_69">Section 210</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_70">Cr.P.C</a>.,
but having  regard to  the police  report and  the manner in
which it was dealt with and ultimately accepted, we consider
it necessary to set aside the order treating the police case
as "untraced".
</p><p id="p_55">     From the  records we  find that  while  forwarding	 the
police papers  to the  `Ilaka' Magistrate  on  November	 28,
1988, the  S.S.P. recommended  that the	 case might be filed
`as untraced'  as requested by the local police in the final
report. The papers however, do not appear to have been dealt
with till  July 17,  1989 when the Chief Judicial Magistrate
entertained an application filed by Mrs. Bajaj in connection
therewith wherein  she stated that in Criminal Miscellaneous
Petition No.  9041-M of	 1988 (registered  on  the  petition
filed by  Mr. Gill  under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_71">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.) the State had
filed an  affidavit averring  that the	police had submitted
its report  under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_72">Section  173</a>	Cr.P.C.	 and  prayed  for  a
direction upon	the prosecution	 to intimate the date of the
filing of  the report and give her an opportunity to inspect
the same.  Interestingly and  surprisingly enough, the Chief
Judicial Magistrate  was none  other than  the L.R.  who had
earlier given  the  opinion  that  the	accusations  of	 the
complainant (Mrs.  Bajaj) were	not substantiated  from	 the
evidence collected during investigation. Indeed, it is under
the influence  of the  above opinion  that the police report
was submitted  as would	 be evident  from the  report itself
wherein	 the  Investigating  Officer  has  stated  "all	 the
statements of  witnesses were  sent to	the L.R.  who,	vide
letter No. LD-88/7163 dated 21.11.88, found that evidence on
record	do   not  substantiate	 the  accusations   of	 the
complainant" (as  translated into  english). It is difficult
to believe  that the  learned Chief  Judicial Magistrate was
not aware  of the  fact that  he had  himself opined that no
case for  going to  the trial  was made out against Mr. Gill
and therefore,	it was	expected that  in  the	interest  of
justice and  fair play	he would  have declined to deal with
the case  in his  capacity as the Chief Judicial Magistrate.
Instead of  so doing, he passed an order on that application
on July	 19, 1989  directing issuance  of notice.  This	 was
followed by  another order  dated July	22, 1989  whereby he
directed that  the application	be listed  on August 8, 1989
awaiting report.  On the  date so  fixed he  passed his next
order which  indicates that  the report was received on that
day and placed on record. It is not understood, which report
the learned  Magistrate was  referring to for if it is to be
read in	 the context of the prayer made by Mrs. Bajaj in her
application dated  July 17,  1989 it  would necessarily mean
the `police  report' but  as already  noticed, the affidavit
filed by  the State  in the High Court and the prayer of the
Senior Superintendent  of the Police dated November 28, 1988
clearly indicate  that it  had been  sent to  the Court much
earlier. It  can, therefore,  be legitimately  inferred that
the formal  order regarding the receipt of the police report
was belatedly  made on August 8, 1989. Be that as it may, it
appears that even thereafter the same learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate continued  to deal with the matter till September
16, 1989 when he made the following order:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     "The matter  concerning <a href="/doc/306833/" id="a_73">State vs. K.P.S.
     Gill</a> was  being dealt  with by me when I
     was   Legal   Remembrancer,   Chandigarh
     Administration, Chandigarh. Accordingly,
     the papers	 produced by  the prosecution
     alongwith	all   other  relevant  papers
     pending in	 this court  are entrusted to
     the  Court	  of  Sh.  A.K.	 Suri,	JMIC,
     Chandigarh, for  further proceedings  in
     accordance with law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  Sh. A.S.  Chahal, advocate,  who is
     appearing on  behalf of  Mrs. Rupan Deol
     Bajaj, complainant	 has been directed to
     appear before  that court	on  18.9.1989
     for further  proceedings. Papers be sent
     to that court immediately".</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">     It passes our comprehension as to how an Officer (L.R.)
who had	 given the  opinion to	submit a  police  report  in
favour of Mr. Gill could entertain the request of the police
for  accepting	 the  same  while  acting  in  his  judicial
capacity. More	surprising and	disquieting is the fact that
he continued  to deal  with the matter till he realised that
it would  not be  appropriate on his part to go any further.
We need	 not, however,	dilate on  this aspect of the matter
any further  for in  any case  the order  of the  transferee
Magistrate on the police report cannot be sustained inasmuch
as he has not given any reason whatsoever for its acceptance
though, it  appears, the parties were heard on that question
for days  together, obviously  to comply  with the  law laid
down by	 this Court  in <a href="/doc/1303576/" id="a_74">Bhagwant  Singh vs.  Commissioner of
Police</a> AIR 1985 SC 1285.
</p><p id="p_57">     <a href="/doc/49832/" id="a_75">In Abhinandan  Jha vs.  Dinesh Mishra</a> (AIR 1968 SC 117)
the question  arose whether  a Magistrate  to whom  a report
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_76">Section  173</a> (1)	Cr. P.C.  had been  submitted to the
effect that  no case  had been made out against the accused,
could direct  the police  to  file  a  charge-sheet  on	 his
disagreeing with that report. In answering the question this
Court first  observed that  the use  of the  words `may take
cognizance of any offence' in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_77">Section 190</a>
Cr.P.C. imports	 the exercise  of `judicial  discretion' and
the Magistrate	who receives  the report  under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_78">Section	 173</a>
Cr.P.C. will have to consider the said report and judicially
take a	decision whether  or not  to take  cognizance of the
offence. The  Court then  held, in  answering  the  question
posed before  it, that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to
direct the  police to  submit a charge-sheet but it was open
to the	Magistrate to  agree or	 disagree  with	 the  police
report. If  he agreed with the report that there was no case
made out  for issuing process to the accused he might accept
the report  and close  the proceedings.	 If he	came to	 the
conclusion that further investigation was necessary he might
make an	 order to  that effect	under <a href="/doc/288317/" id="a_79">Section 156(3)</a>. It was
further held  that if  ultimately the  Magistrate was of the
opinion	 that  the  facts  set	out  in	 the  police  report
constituted an	offence he  could take	cognizance  thereof,
notwithstanding contrary  opinion of the police expressed in
the report.
</p><p id="p_58">     Since at the time of taking cognizance the Court has to
exercise its judicial discretion it necessarily follows that
if in  a given	case - as the present one - the complainant,
as the	person aggrieved raises objections to the acceptance
of a police report which recommends discharge of the accused
and seeks  to satisfy  the Court  that	a  case	 for  taking
cognizance was	made  out,  but	 the  Court  overrules	such
objections, it	is  just  and  desirable  that	the  reasons
therefor  be  recorded.	 Necessity  to	give  reasons  which
disclose proper	 appreciation of the issues before the Court
needs no  emphasis. Reasons  introduce clarity	and minimise
changes	 of   arbitrariness.  That  necessarily	 means	that
recording of  reasons will  not be  necessary when the Court
accepts such  police  report  without  any  demur  from	 the
complainant. As	 the order  of the learned Magistrate in the
instant case  does not	contain any  reason whatsoever, even
though it  was passed  after hearing  the objections  of the
complainant it	has got to be set aside and we do hereby set
it aside.  Consequent thereupon, two course are left open to
us; to	direct the  learned Magistrate	to hear	 the parties
afresh on  the question	 of acceptance	of the police report
and pass a reasoned order or to decide for ourselves whether
it is a fit case for taking cognizance under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_80">Section 190</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_59">(b) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_81">Cr.P.C</a>.  Keeping in	 view the  fact	 that  the  case  is
pending for  the last  seven years  only  on  the  threshold
question we  do not  wish to  take the former course as that
would only delay the matter further. Instead thereof we have
carefully  looked   into   the	 police	  report   and	 its
accompaniments keeping in view the following observations of
this Court  in <a href="/doc/230938/" id="a_82">H.S.  Bains vs.	State</a> AIR 1980 SC 1883, with
which we respectfully agree:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     "The Magistrate  is  not  bound  by  the
     conclusions arrived  at  by  the  police
     even  as	he  is	 not  bound   by  the
     conclusions   arrived    at    by	  the
     complainant  in   a  complaint.   If   a
     complainant states the relevant facts in
     his  complaint   and  alleges  that  the
     accused is	 guilty of  an offence	under
     <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_83">Section  307</a>   Indian  Penal   Code  the
     Magistrate	  is   not   bound   by	  the
     conclusion of  the complainant.  He  may
     think that the facts disclose an offence
     under<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_84"> S.  324</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_85">I.P.C</a>.  only and  he  may
     take  cognizance  of  an  offence	under
     <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_86">Section  324</a>  instead  of	<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_87">Section	 307</a>.
     Similarly if  a police  report  mentions
     that half	a dozen	 persons examined  by
     them claim	 to be	eye  witnesses	to  a
     murder but	 that for various reasons the
     witnesses could  not  be  believed,  the
     Magistrate is  not bound  to accept  the
     opinion  of  the  police  regarding  the
     credibility of  the  witnesses.  He  may
     prefer to	ignore the conclusions of the
     police regarding  the credibility of the
     witnesses and  take  cognizance  of  the
     offence. If  he does  so, it would be on
     the  basis	 of  the  statements  of  the
     witnesses	as  revealed  by  the  police
     report."</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">			  (emphasis supplied)
     Our such exercise persuades us to hold that the opinion
of the	Investigating Officer that the allegations contained
in the	F.I.R. were  not substantiated	by the statements of
witnesses recorded  during investigation is not a proper one
for we	find that  there are sufficient materials for taking
cognizance of the offences under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_88">Sections 354</a> and <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_89">509</a> I.P.C.
We, however,  refrain from  detailing  or  discussing  those
statements and	the nature and extent of their corroboration
of the	F.I.R. lest  they create  any unconscious impression
upon the  trial Court,	which has  to ultimately decide upon
their truthfulness,  falsity  or  reliability,	after  those
statements are	translated into	 evidence during  trial. For
the self  same reasons	we do  not  wish  to  refer  to	 the
arguments canvassed by Mr. Sanghi, in support of the opinion
expressed in  the police  (final) report  and our reasons in
disagreement thereto.
</p><p id="p_61">     On the conclusions as above we direct the learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate,  Chandigarh to take cognizance upon the
police report  in respect of the offences under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_90">Sections 354</a>
and <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_91">509</a> IPC and try the case himself in accordance with law.
We make	 it abundantly	clear that  the	 learned  Magistrate
shall  not   in	 any   way  be	influenced  by	any  of	 the
observations made by us relating to the facts of the case as
our task was confined to the question whether a `prima facie
case' to  go to	 the trial  was made  out or not whereas the
learned Magistrate  will have  to dispose of the case solely
on the basis of the evidence to be adduced during the trial.
Since both  the offences  under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_92">Sections 354</a> and <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_93">509</a> IPC are
tribal	in  accordance	with<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_94">  Chapter  XX  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code</a>	we direct  the learned Magistrate to dispose
of the case, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within
a period  of six  months from  the date	 of communication of
this  order.  In  view	of  our	 above	directions  and	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_95">Section 210</a>  (2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_96">Cr.P.C</a>.	 the complaint	case
instituted by Mr. Bajaj for the self same offences loses its
independent existence  thereby rendering  the  other  appeal
which arose  out of  that case,	 redundant, though we are of
the opinion,  prima facie,  that the  claim of privilege, on
the basis  of the  affidavit of the Chief Secretary, was not
sustainable.
</p><p id="p_62">     In the result the appeal No. 1183/95 arising out of SLP
(Crl.) No.2358	of 1989	 filed by  Mr.	and  Mrs.  Bajaj  is
allowed and  the other	appeal No.1184/95 arising out of SLP
(Crl.) No.1361 of 1989 is dismissed as infructuous.
</p><p id="p_63">     Before we	part with  this judgment  we wish to mention
that in	 the course  of his arguments, Mr. Sanghi, suggested
that the  matter may  be given	a quietus if Mr. GIll was to
express regret	for his	 alleged  misbehaviour.	 That  is  a
matter for  the parties	 to consider  for  the	offences  in
question are compoundable with the permission of the Court.
