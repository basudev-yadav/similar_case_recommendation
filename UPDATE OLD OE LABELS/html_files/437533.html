                  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 249 OF 2004



Shakson Belthissor                                               .... Appellant


                                    Versus

State of Kerala &amp; Anr.                                        .... Respondents



                                JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">Dr. Mukundakam Sharma, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 28.10.2002

   passed by the Kerala High Court rejecting the petition filed by the

   appellant herein praying for quashing of the first information report (for

   short `the FIR') and the charge sheet filed against him.


</p><p id="p_4">2. The Respondent No. 2 (Valsa) got married with the appellant on

   23.10.1997. Even otherwise they are related to each other, the Respondent
  No. 2 being the daughter of the appellant's maternal uncle and paternal

  aunt. Incidentally, the aforesaid marriage was the second marriage of

  Respondent No. 2 as she was earlier married to one Mr. Varghese, who

  died in the year 1995. Through the said marriage the Respondent No. 2

  has two sons. However, it was the first marriage of the appellant. Out of

  the wedlock between the appellant and Respondent No. 2, there is no

  issue.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3. The appellant was working at the relevant time at Saudi Arabia. The

  appellant got married to Respondent No. 2 when he came on leave for four

  months.    However, after the marriage there appears to be some dispute

  between the parties. On 21.04.2002, Respondent No. 2 filed an FIR in the

  Kottayam Police Station, District Kollam, Kerala alleging that the

  appellant married her when he came on leave for 4 months and that after

  the marriage he stayed in the house of the complainant - wife and that

  after expiry of the period of leave, her husband - the appellant returned to

  the Gulf. It was also alleged by Respondent No. 2 in the said FIR that

  thereafter, for 2-3 months, the appellant used to send money for the

  expenses in the house, talked to her over phone and also sent letters from

  Saudi Arabia and also behaved with her very affectionately. It was also

  alleged that the parents of Respondent No. 2 at the time of marriage had

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>
  given Rs. 5 lakhs and that the said money was utilized by the family of the

  appellant for purchasing a house at Nediyazhikam and also a property at

  Mukkam where they are residing. It was also alleged that thereafter they

  started spreading wrong information regarding the conduct of the

  Respondent No. 2 in the locality and also misled the appellant about her.

  On believing his family members, the appellant also stopped sending

  money from Saudi Arabia for her expenses and also stopped sending

  letters to her. It was also alleged by the Respondent No. 2 in the said FIR

  that when she called him on telephone, the appellant behaved without

  affection towards her and disconnected the phone due to which she

  became mentally weak. It was also alleged that subsequently whenever

  the appellant came on leave, he never used to come to the house of

  Respondent No. 2 and stayed in the house of his younger brother and when

  Respondent No. 2 herself went to that house, she was turned out from that

  house. It was also alleged that due to such treatment meted out to her, she

  has been suffering both mentally and physically.


</p><p id="p_7">4. On the basis of the said FIR a criminal case was registered and on

  completion of the investigation made by the police, a charge sheet was

  submitted by the police alleging, inter alia, that in the investigation it is

  established that it is only the appellant, who has committed the offence. It

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>
  was also stated in the said charge sheet that investigation as per <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Section

  498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code (in short "the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>") is being continued

  after dropping the provision of <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">Section 34</a> IPC since it was revealed that

  no offence was committed by any of the family members of the appellant

  under <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> IPC. It was also stated in the charge sheet that since the

  appellant has been in Gulf, arrest could not be made and therefore police

  requested the court to issue a warrant of arrest for production of the

  accused-appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5. Both the FIR and the charge sheet, which were submitted by the police,

  became the bone of contention so far as the appellant is concerned, and

  therefore, he filed a Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 9376 of 2002 under

  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_5">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code (in short "the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">CrPC</a>) before

  the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam praying for quashing of both the

  FIR as also the charge sheet on the ground that no case for prosecution

  under <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_7">Section 498</a> A IPC is made out against him. The High Court,

  however, without issuing any notice on the said petition rejected the

  petition holding that by no stretch of imagination it can be said that the

  FIR and the charge sheet do not disclose the commission of the offence

  alleged against the appellant.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>
</p><p id="p_11">6. Being aggrieved by the said order passed by the learned Single Judge of

   the High Court, the present appeal was filed on which notice was issued

   and further proceedings before the trial court were stayed by this Court.


</p><p id="p_12">7. Now, the appeal is listed before us for hearing and we heard the learned

   counsels appearing for the parties.         In order to fairly appreciate the

   contents of the submissions made by the counsel appearing for the parties,

   it is necessary to extract relevant portion of the FIR and the charge sheet.


</p><p id="p_13">8. The relevant part of the FIR is as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "......On last 23rd October, 1997, Shakson Belthissor of
             Nediyazhikam House, Mukkam, Mayyanad married me
             at the Iyyathu Church at Kollam in accordance with the
             religious rites and custom. Husband is called by the
             name Raju. Husband has been working in Saudi Arabia
             as Business Executive. He married me at the time when
             he came on leave for 4 months. After the marriage, after
             wedded life had been in my house. On expiry of the
             period of leave, husband returned to Gulf. Thereafter, for
             2-3 months, it was used to send money for the expenses
             in the house, to talk over phone, to send letters and to
             behave with very affection towards me. At the time of the
             marriage, my parents had given Rs. 5 lakhs as dowry.</blockquote><p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">             Using that amount with the consent of husband, Jose
             Major (younger brother of husband), wife Jessilet Manoj,
             their mother Jain Franco purchased Nediyazhikam house
             and property at Mukkam and resided therein. Thereafter,
             they spread in the locality unnecessary matters regarding
             me and informed husband and misled him. Husband,
             who believed their words, later stopped sending money
             for my expenses or sending letters. When I called him
             over phone, he would behave without affection towards

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>
me and cut off the phone. Due to this behaviour from the
part of husband and the aforesaid relatives, I was
mentally weakened. While being so, husband came back
on leave. Without coming to my house, went to the
house of the younger brother. Learning about it, I went
to there. Then, the younger brother, wife and wife's
mother closed the door of the house after sending me out.
From that event and onwards, I had been suffering from
physical and mental torturing..."
</p>
<p id="p_16">Relevant part of the charge sheet is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_17">"... While leading family life in Vivek Bhawan having
number 11 in Ward VII along the west side of the
Panchayath Road going from Cheriyil Pullichira Post
Office Junction towards Devalakuzhi and other places,
the accused spent off some amount from the Rs 5 lakhs
which had been given as dowry at the time of marriage
and after buying property with the balance amount he left
for Gulf, and thereafter without giving for the
maintenance of the witness No. 1 or looking after the
family affairs, the witness No. 1 was tortured through
letters and over phone and when he came on leave, he
spread unnecessary matter about the witness No. 1 and
tortured mentally and thus committed the offence under
the above provision - regarding."
</p>
<p id="p_18">Report

".....On getting it revealed during the investigation of the
case that only the accused No. 1 has committed the
offence, report has been submitted before the Court for
reducing the number from 2 to 4 regarding the
identification of the full name and address of the accused
No. 1.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      Report has been submitted before the Court
regarding continuation of the investigation as per <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_8">Section

<p id="p_20">                  Since the accused in this case has been in Gulf,

           pleased to issue warrant to arrest and produce the
           accused."
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">9. The scope and power of quashing a first information report and charge

  sheet under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_11">Section 482</a> of the CrPC is well settled. The said power is

  exercised by the court to prevent abuse of the process of law and court but

  such a power could be exercised only when the complaint filed by the

  complainant or the charge sheet filed by the police did not disclose any

  offence or when the said complaint is found to be frivolous, vexatious or

  oppressive. A number of decisions have been rendered by this Court on the

  aforesaid issue wherein the law relating to quashing of a complaint has

  been succinctly laid down.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">10.<a href="/doc/56823/" id="a_12">In Nagawwa v. Veeranna Shivalingappa Konjalgi</a>, (1976) 3 SCC 736, it

  was held that the Magistrate while issuing process against the accused

  should satisfy himself as to whether the allegations made in the complaint,

  if proved, would ultimately end in the conviction of the accused. It was

  held that the order of Magistrate for issuing process against the accused

  could be quashed under the following circumstances: (SCC p. 741, para 5)



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     7</span>

             statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same
             taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the
             accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential
             ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused;
             (2) Where the allegations made in the complaint are patently
             absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can
             ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for
             proceeding against the accused;
</p><p id="p_25">             (3) Where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in issuing
             process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on
             no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or
             inadmissible; and
             (4) Where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects,
             such as, want of sanction, or absence of a complaint by legally
             competent authority and the like."
</p>
<p id="p_26">11.   In the case of <a href="/doc/506850/" id="a_13">Drugs Inspector v. Dr. B.K. Krishna</a> [1981 (2) SCC

454] it was held by this Court that in a quashing proceeding, the High Court

has to see whether the allegations made in the complaint petition, if proved,

make out a prima facie offence and that the accused has prima facie

committed the offence. In the said decision this Court refused the prayer for

quashing of the complaint on the ground that there were sufficient allegations

in the complaint to make out a case that the accused persons were responsible

for the management and conduct of the firm and, therefore, the extent of their

liability could be and should be established during trial.


</p><p id="p_27">12.   <a href="/doc/1860679/" id="a_14">In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Ram Kishan Rohtagi</a> [1983

clear case was made out against all the respondents (accused persons), the

High Court ought not to have quashed the proceedings on the ground that the

complaint did not disclose any offence. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi

(supra), this Court observed as follows in para 8:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "8. Another important consideration which is to be kept in mind
            is as to when the High Court acting under the provisions of
            <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_15">Section 482</a> should exercise the inherent power insofar as
            quashing of criminal proceedings are concerned. This matter was
            gone into in greater detail in <a href="/doc/56823/" id="a_16">Smt Nagawwa v. Veeranna
            Shivalingappa Konjalgi</a>, (1976) 3 SCC 736 where the scope of

            while laying down the guidelines and the grounds on which
            proceedings could be quashed this Court observed as follows:
            [SCC para 5, p. 741 : SCC (Cri) pp. 511-12]
            Thus it may be safely held that in the following cases an order of

<p id="p_29">13.    <a href="/doc/1033637/" id="a_19">In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal</a>, 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335, a

question came up for consideration as to whether quashing of the FIR filed

against the respondent Bhajan Lal for the offences under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_20">Sections 161</a> and

<a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_21">165</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_22">Section 5(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act was proper

and legal. Reversing the order passed by the High Court, this Court

explained the circumstances under which such power could be exercised.

Apart from reiterating the earlier norms laid down by this Court, it was

further explained that such power could be exercised where the allegations

made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on

the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that

there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. It observed as

           court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not
           be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and

      Thus, in such circumstances, the issue of malafice becomes irrelevant.


</p><p id="p_36">15.   The above decision was followed by this Court in Pepsi Foods Ltd.

and Anr. Vs. Special Judicial Magistrate and Others [1998 (5) SCC 749].

In paragraph 28 of the said judgment this Court held thus :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            "28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious
            matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a matter of
            course. It is not that the complainant has to bring only two
            witnesses to support his allegations in the complaint to have the
            criminal law set into motion. The order of the Magistrate
            summoning the accused must reflect that he has applied his mind
            to the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto. He has to
            examine the nature of allegations made in the complaint and the
            evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof and
            would that be sufficient for the complainant to succeed in
            bringing charge home to the accused. It is not that the Magistrate
            is a silent spectator at the time of recording of preliminary
            evidence before summoning of the accused. The Magistrate has
            to carefully scrutinise the evidence brought on record and may
            even himself put questions to the complainant and his witnesses
            to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the allegations or
            otherwise and then examine if any offence is prima facie
            committed by all or any of the accused."

[2002 (1) SCC 241] that every breach of trust may not result in a penal

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            "8. Before examining respective contentions on their relative
            merits, we think it is appropriate to notice the legal position.
            Every breach of trust may not result in a penal offence of
            criminal breach of trust unless there is evidence of a mental act
            of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of breach of trust involves
            a civil wrong in respect of which the person wronged may seek
            his redress for damages in a civil court but a breach of trust with
            mens rea gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            9. The ingredients in order to constitute a criminal breach of trust
            are: (i) entrusting a person with property or with any dominion
            over property, (ii) that person entrusted (a) dishonestly
            misappropriating or converting that property to his own use; or

            discharge of such trust.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            10. The ingredients of an offence of cheating are: (i) there should

            any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall

            intentionally induced to do or omit to do anything which he
            would not do or omit if he were not so deceived; and (iii) in
            cases covered by (ii)(b), the act of omission should be one which

            <a href="/doc/853800/" id="a_33">Hridaya Ranjan Prasad Verma v. State of Bihar</a>, (2000) 4 SCC
            168 on facts of that case, has expressed thus: (SCC p. 177, para
</p><p id="p_40">            15)

</p><p id="p_41">            15. In determining the question it has to be kept in mind that the
            distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of
            cheating is a fine one. It depends upon the intention of the
            accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by his
            subsequent conduct but for this subsequent conduct is not the
            sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal
            prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention
            is shown right at the beginning of the transaction, that is the time


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                      13</span>
          when the offence is said to have been committed. Therefore it is
          the intention which is the gist of the offence. To hold a person
          guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent
          or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From
          his mere failure to keep up promise subsequently such a culpable
          intention right at the beginning, that is, when he made the
          promise cannot be presumed."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">          (i) A complaint can be quashed where the allegations made in
          the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and
          accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute any
          offence or make out the case alleged against the accused.
          For this purpose, the complaint has to be examined as a whole,
          but without examining the merits of the allegations. Neither a
          detailed inquiry nor a meticulous analysis of the material nor an
          assessment of the reliability or genuineness of the allegations in
          the complaint, is warranted while examining prayer for quashing
          of a complaint.</blockquote><p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">          (ii) A complaint may also be quashed where it is a clear abuse of
          the process of the court, as when the criminal proceeding is

          found to have been initiated with mala fides/malice for wreaking
          vengeance or to cause harm, or where the allegations are absurd
          and inherently improbable.
</p><p id="p_46">          (iii) The power to quash shall not, however, be used to stifle or
          scuttle a legitimate prosecution. The power should be used
          sparingly and with abundant caution.
</p><p id="p_47">          (iv) The complaint is not required to verbatim reproduce the
          legal ingredients of the offence alleged. If the necessary factual
          foundation is laid in the complaint, merely on the ground that a
          few ingredients have not been stated in detail, the proceedings
          should not be quashed. Quashing of the complaint is warranted
          only where the complaint is so bereft of even the basic facts
          which are absolutely necessary for making out the offence.
</p><p id="p_48">          (v) A given set of facts may make out: (a) purely a civil wrong;
          or (b) purely a criminal offence; or (c) a civil wrong as also a
          criminal offence. A commercial transaction or a contractual
          dispute, apart from furnishing a cause of action for seeking
          remedy in civil law, may also involve a criminal offence. As the
          nature and scope of a civil proceeding are different from a
          criminal proceeding, the mere fact that the complaint relates to a
          commercial transaction or breach of contract, for which a civil
          remedy is available or has been availed, is not by itself a ground
          to quash the criminal proceedings. The test is whether the
          allegations in the complaint disclose a criminal offence or not."

            would not interfere with a genuine complaint keeping in view
            the purport and object for which the provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_43">Sections 482</a>

            by Parliament but would not hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction
            in appropriate cases. One of the paramount duties of the superior
            courts is to see that a person who is apparently innocent is not
            subjected to persecution and humiliation on the basis of a false
            and wholly untenable complaint."

<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_48">Section 498A</a> IPC is made out or not is an issue, which is required to be

answered in this appeal. <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_49">Section 498A</a> of the IPC reads as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">            Explanation-For the purpose of this section, "cruelty"
            means-

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">            (a) Any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is
            likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause
            grave injury or danger to life, limb or health whether

            person related to her meet such demand".
</blockquote>


<p id="p_58">21.   In the light of the aforesaid language used in the Section, the provision

would be applicable only to such a case where the husband or the relative of

the husband of a woman subjects the said woman to cruelty.           When the

ingredients of the aforesaid Section are present in a particular case, in that

event the person concerned against whom the offence is alleged would be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                     17</span>
tried in accordance with law in a trial instituted against him and if found guilty

the accused would be punished with imprisonment for a term which may

extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The said section contains

an explanation, which defines "cruelty" as understood under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_50">Section 498A</a>

IPC.   In order to understand the meaning of the expression `cruelty' as

envisaged under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_51">Section 498A</a>, there must be such a conduct on the part of the

husband or relatives of the husband of woman which is of such a nature as to

cause the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life,

limb or health whether mental or physical of the woman.


</p><p id="p_59">22.    When we examine the facts of the present case particularly the FIR and

the charge sheet we find that there is no such allegation either in the FIR or in

the charge sheet making out a prima facie case as narrated under explanation

</p><p id="p_60">(a). There is no allegation that there is any such conduct on the part of the

appellant which could be said to be amounting to cruelty of such a nature as is

likely to cause the Respondent No. 2 to commit suicide or to cause any injury

to her life. The ingredient to constitute an offence under explanation (a) of

<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_52">Section 498A</a> IPC are not at all mentioned either in FIR or in charge sheet and

in absence thereof, no case is made out. Therefore, explanation (a) as found

in <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_53">Section 498A</a> IPC is clearly not attracted in the present case.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       18</span>
</p><p id="p_61">23.   We, therefore, now proceed to examine as to whether the case would

fall under explanation (b) of <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_54">Section 498A</a> of IPC constituting cruelty of the

nature as mentioned in explanation (b). In order to constitute cruelty under

the said provision there has to be harassment of the woman with a view to

coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any

property or valuable security or a case is to be made out to the effect that there

is a failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. When

the allegation made in the FIR and charge sheet is examined in the present

case in the light of the aforesaid provision, we find that no prima facie case

even under the aforesaid provision is made out to attract a case of cruelty.


</p><p id="p_62">24.   The marriage between the appellant and Respondent No. 2 was

performed on 23.10.1997 when it is alleged that Rs. 5 lakhs was given by the

parents of Respondent No. 2 to the family of appellant as dowry. The FIR

was filed in the month of April, 2002 and in the said FIR there is no allegation

that subsequent thereto any harassment was made by the appellant with a view

to coercing her or any person related to Respondent No. 2 to meet any

unlawful demand or any property.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">25.   In that view of the matter neither explanation (a) nor explanation (b) of

<a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_55">Section 498</a> A of IPC is attracted in the present case. It is crystal clear that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                       19</span>
neither in the FIR nor in the charge sheet there is any ingredient of <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_56">Section

498A</a> IPC, which could prima facie constitute a case of cruelty as defined in

that Section.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">26.   It is thus established that on a reading of the FIR as also the charge

sheet filed against the appellant no case under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_57">Section 498A</a> is made out on

the face of the record, and therefore, both the FIR as also the charge sheet are

liable to be quashed in exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_58">Section 482</a> of the CrPC.

Clearly, the High Court failed to appreciate the facts in proper perspective,

and therefore, committed an error on the face of the record.

against the appellant under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_59">Section 498A</a> of the IPC.
