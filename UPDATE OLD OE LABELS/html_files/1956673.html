</p><p id="p_7">3.    Appellant No.1 is a partner of a partnership firm known as M/s.

Premionics (hereinafter referred to as `the firm' for the sake of brevity).

Appellant No.2 is an employee of the said firm.


</p><p id="p_8">      Respondent No.2, the complainant is also a partnership firm. On or

about 18.10.1997, it placed an order on the firm to manufacture and install a

machine to purify and desalt the dyes of a particular quality and quantity

with the firm. The total manufacturing cost of the said machine worked out

to be at Rs.17,96,488/- including excise duty and other incidental charges.

Second respondent paid a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- to the firm as advance and

part payment of the said consideration. There has been a change in the

specifications of the said machine purported to be on the request of the

second respondent in terms whereof two extra modules thereto were

provided. A revised offer was made. The said machine, although was to be

manufactured and supplied within a period of three months, the same was

not complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">4.    A partner of the second respondent along with its technical engineer

visited the site of the firm. Allegedly, it was found that the said machine

did not conform to the specifications contained in the order placed with the

firm. It refused to take the delivery thereof. To the said effect, the second
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>

respondent, by a letter dated 7.4.1998 called upon the firm to return the

amount of advance, stating :

             sure that this dye has got a molecular wt. around

             that your R.O. Machine should work for this dye
             only and you have manufactured for another. This

<p id="p_12">5.    Second respondent by another letter dated 9.7.1999 called upon the

firm to refund the said amount together with interest thereon, stating :

             Rs. 58,050         Interest of 1998-99
             Rs.3,80,550

            immediately."



</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      The firm, by its letter dated 14.7.1999, responded to the said letter of

the Second respondent as under :
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            "We are in receipt of your letter No.KPH/31/99-
            2000 dated 9.7.1999 and are surprised to note your
            content therein. As per your order we have
            manufactured the system and you had inspected
            the system also. We have been reminding you to
            take delivery of the system but no action had been
            taken from your end so far. We have blocked
            material worth more than fourteen lakhs for the
            last so many months."

6.    Thereafter, a criminal complaint was filed.<p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">      The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate took cognizance of the offences

against the appellants under <a href="/doc/1791573/" id="a_2">Section 417</a>, <a href="/doc/1099980/" id="a_3">420</a> read with <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_4">Section 114</a> of the

Indian Penal Code. Summons were issued.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">      Appellants filed an application for quashing of the said proceedings

before the Gujarat High Court which by reason of the impugned judgment

has been dismissed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     5</span><p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">7.    Mr. Dayan Krishnan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

appellant, would submit :
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">1.    The allegations made in the complaint petition even if given face

      value and taken to be correct in its entirety do not disclose an offence

      under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_5">Section 420</a> of the Indian Penal Code.


</p><p id="p_21">2.    A breach of contract simpliciter does not constitute an offence under

      <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_6">Section 420</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">3.    There is no averment in the complaint petition to the effect that the

      appellant has an intention to cheat at the time of entering into the

      contract.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">8.    Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondent No.2, on the other hand, would urge :


(1)   The firm manufactured a machine different from the one for which

      order was placed which was found out on inspection of the site of the

      firm.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
(2)   Although a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- was paid by way of advance, the

      said amount has not been returned which manifests dishonest

      intention on the part of the firm.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span><p id="p_27">

(3)   In any event, the High Court has rightly refused to exercise its

      jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_7">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

      which can be resorted to only in rarest of rare cases.


</p><p id="p_28">9.    We have been taken through the complaint petition in its entirety.

Indisputably, the parties entered into a contract in terms whereof the firm

was to manufacture a machine to purify and desalt the dyes of a particular

quality and quantity. The specifications for the machine were changed.

First appellant issued a letter dated 20.2.1998 to the complainant, stating :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             "Further to our letter No.P:G:971:97 dated 2.2.98
             and subsequent visit of our Mr. Sunil Rao. Please
             find enclosed herewith our revised offer for your
             reference. You may note that we are giving two
             module extra free of charge in the system so that
             the total number of modules becomes 105 no's
             instead of the committed 103 no's. We are also
             enclosing herewith the detailed assembly drawing
             for your reference. Since the system is totally skid
             mounted the system can be installed on a leveled
             platform.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             I am sure this will fulfill your pre-dispatch
             requirement. In case you need any additional
             details kindly let us know so that we can provide
             the same."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_29">10.   Inspection of the machine was admittedly made on 6.4.1998. During

the period 18.10.1997 (when the order was placed) and 6.4.1998, no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    7</span>

allegation was made in regard to any false design or bad intention on the

part of the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">      The complainant-respondent No.2 in letters dated 7.4.1998 and

9.7.1999 did not also make any allegation in regard to existence of a

dishonest intention on the part of the appellants herein when the contract

was entered into.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">      Ordinarily, we would not have referred to the correspondences passed

between the parties but, indisputably, the said correspondences have been

referred to in the complaint petition itself. Even before us, a contention had

been raised by Mr. Jain that the appellants' letter dated 7.4.1998 was not

replied to.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">11.   <a href="/doc/1306824/" id="a_8">Section 415</a> of the Indian Penal Code defines cheating as under :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">              "<a href="/doc/1306824/" id="a_9">Section        415</a>.--Cheating--Whoever,         by
              deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly
              induces the person so deceived to deliver any
              property to any person, or to consent that any
              person shall retain any property, or intentionally
              induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do
              anything which he would not do or omit if he were
              not so deceived, and which act or omission causes
              or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person
              in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to
              `cheat'."</blockquote><p id="p_36">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      8</span>

</p><p id="p_37">        An offence of cheating cannot be said to have been made out unless

the following ingredients are satisfied :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">              "i)    deception of a person either by making a
                     false or misleading representation or by
                     other action or omission;
</blockquote><p id="p_38">(ii)    fraudulently or dishonestly inducing any person to
        deliver any property; or
</p><p id="p_39">(iii)   To consent that any person shall retain any property and
        finally intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to
        do anything which he would not do or omit."
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">12.     For the purpose of constituting an offence of cheating, the

complainant is required to show that the accused had fraudulent or

dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation. Even

in a case where allegations are made in regard to failure on the part of the

accused to keep his promise, in absence of a culpable intention at the time

of making initial promise being absent, no offence under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_10">Section 420</a> of the

Indian Penal Code can be said to have been made out.


</p><p id="p_42">13.     No exception can be taken to the submission of Mr. Jain that it is not

necessary to reproduce the wordings of a penal provision in the complaint

petition, but, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the facts disclosing

the ingredients of the offence must be averred.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    9</span>

</p><p id="p_43">      There cannot, furthermore, be any doubt that only because civil law

can be taken recourse to would not necessarily mean that criminal

proceedings should be barred as has been opined by this Court in <a href="/doc/1684706/" id="a_11">Pratibha

Rani v. Suraj Kumar &amp; Anr</a>. [(1985) 2 SCC 370].


</p><p id="p_44">      We are, however, not concerned in a case of this nature where the

allegations were clear, specific and unambiguous and, therefore, the

complainant should have been given a chance to prove her case as has been

noticed by the High Court in the said judgment. This Court therein also,

while laying down the law that the High Court would have no jurisdiction to

examine the correctness of the allegations, opined :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            "In case no offence is committed on the allegation
            and the ingredients of <a href="/doc/1249173/" id="a_12">Section 405</a> and <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_13">406</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>
            are not made out, the High Court would be
            justified in quashing the proceedings."</blockquote><p id="p_45">



</p><p id="p_46">      Reliance has also been placed by Mr. Jain on <a href="/doc/1335621/" id="a_15">Rajesh Bajaj v. State

NCT of Delhi &amp; Ors</a>. [(1999) 3 SCC 259], wherein Thomas, J. opined :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">            "10. It may be that the facts narrated in the present
            complaint would as well reveal a commercial
            transaction or money transaction. But that is
            hardly a reason for holding that the offence of
            cheating would elude from such a transaction. In
            fact, many a cheatings were committed in the
            course of commercial and also money transactions.

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">             One of the illustrations set out under <a href="/doc/1306824/" id="a_16">Section 415</a>
             of the Indian Penal Code (Illustration f) is worthy
             of notice now :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                   `(f) A intentionally deceives Z into a
                   belief that A means to repay any money that
                   Z may lend to him and thereby dishonestly
                   induces Z to lend him money, A not
                   intending to repay it. A cheats'."

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      Similar observations have also been made by the same learned Judge

in <a href="/doc/418835/" id="a_17">Trisuns Chemical Industry v. Rajesh Agarwal &amp; Ors</a>. [(1999) 8 SCC 686]

in the following terms :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">             "9. We are unable to appreciate the reasoning that
             the provision incorporated in the agreement for
             referring the disputes to arbitration is an effective
             substitute for a criminal prosecution when the
             disputed act is an offence. Arbitration is a remedy
             for affording reliefs to the party affected by breach
             of the agreement but the arbitrator cannot conduct
             a trial of any act which amounted to an offence
             albeit the same act may be connected with the
             discharge of any function under the agreement.
             Hence, those are not good reasons for the High
             Court to axe down the complaint at the threshold
             itself. The investigating agency should have had
             the freedom to go into the whole gamut of the
             allegations and to reach a conclusion of its own.
             Pre-emption of such investigation would be
             justified only in very extreme cases as indicated in

             genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made
             in the FIR or the complaint and that the

      The High Court, although noticed some of the principles laid down in

Bhajan Lal (supra), failed to assign any reason as to why in a case of this

nature the provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_28">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

should not be applied and how the allegations made in the complaint

petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety, make

out an offence.

nature and an offence of cheating. Although breach of contract per se

would not come in the way of initiation of a criminal proceeding, there

cannot be any doubt whatsoever that in absence of the averments made in

the complaint petition wherefrom the ingredients of an offence can be found

out, the court should not hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_29">Section

<a href="/doc/1306824/" id="a_30">Section 415</a> of the Indian Penal Code is existence of an intention of making

initial promise or existence thereof from the very beginning of formation of

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">               "40. It is settled law, by a catena of decisions, that
               for establishing the offence of cheating, the
               complainant is required to show that the accused
               had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of
               making promise or representation. From his
               making failure to keep promise subsequently, such
               a culpable intention right at the beginning that is at
               the time when the promise was made cannot be
               presumed. It is seen from the records that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                       15</span>

exemption      certificate contained      necessary
conditions which were required to be complied
with after importation of the machine. Since the
GCS could not comply with it, therefore, it rightly
paid the necessary duties without taking advantage
of the exemption certificate. The conduct of the
GCS clearly indicates that there was no fraudulent
or dishonest intention of either the GCS or the
appellants in their capacities as office-bearers
right at the time of making application for
exemption. As there was absence of dishonest and
fraudulent intention, the question of committing
offence under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_33">Section 420</a> of the Indian Penal
Code does not arise. We have read the charge-
</blockquote><p id="p_64">sheet as a whole. There is no allegation in the first
information report or the charge-sheet indicating
expressly or impliedly any intentional deception or
fraudulent/dishonest intention on the part of the
appellants right from the time of making the
promise or misrepresentation. Nothing has been
said on what those misrepresentations were and
how the Ministry of Health was duped and what
were the roles played by the appellants in the
alleged offence. The appellants, in our view, could
not be attributed any mens rea of evasion of
customs duty or cheating the Government of India
as the Cancer Society is a non-profit organisation
and, therefore, the allegations against the
appellants levelled by the prosecution are
unsustainable. The Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme
certificate along with Duncan and Sushila Rani
judgments clearly absolve the appellants herein
from all charges and allegations under any other
law once the duty so demanded has been paid and
the alleged offence has been compounded. It is
also settled law that once a civil case has been
compromised and the alleged offence has been
compounded, to continue the criminal proceedings
thereafter would be an abuse of the judicial
process.

             The date when such statements were allegedly
             made by the appellant had not been disclosed by
             the witnesses of the complainant. It is really
             absurd to opine that any such statement would be
             made by the appellant before all of them at the

            Assuming that such a statement had been made,
            the same, in our opinion, does not exhibit that
            there had been any intention on the part of the
            appellant herein to commit an offence under

            respondent is a resident of the district of Rampur.
            Cheques were admittedly issued by the appellant
            at his place. There is nothing on record to show
            that any part of the cause of action arose within
            the jurisdiction of the court concerned. Even if
            such statements had been made, the same
            admittedly have been made only at the place where

<p id="p_69">18.   A matter which essentially involves dispute of a civil nature should

not be allowed to be the subject matter of a criminal offence, the latter being

not a shortcut of executing a decree which is non-existent. The Superior

Courts, with a view to maintain purity in the administration of justice,

should not allow abuse of the process of court. It has a duty in terms of

whereupon strong reliance has been placed by Mr. Jain. This Court, therein

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">              "11. As noted above, the powers possessed by the
              High Court under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_42">Section 482</a> of the Code are
              very wide and the very plenitude of the power
              requires great caution in its exercise. Court must
              be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this
              power is based on sound principles. The inherent
              power should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate
              prosecution. The High Court being the highest
              court of a State should normally refrain from
              giving a prima facie decision in a case where the
              entire facts are incomplete and hazy, more so,
              when the evidence has not been collected and
              produced before the Court and the issues involved,
              whether factual or legal, are of magnitude and
              cannot be seen in their true perspective without
              sufficient material. Of course, no hard-and-fast
              rule can be laid down in regard to cases in which
              the High Court will exercise its extraordinary
              jurisdiction of quashing the proceedings at any
              stage. (<a href="/doc/1830927/" id="a_43">See Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary</a> and
              <a href="/doc/1152219/" id="a_44">Raghubir Saran (Dr) v. State of Bihar</a>) It would
              not be proper for the High Court to analyse the
              case of the complainant in the light of all
              probabilities in order to determine whether a
              conviction would be sustainable and on such

            premises, arrive at a conclusion that the
            proceedings are to be quashed. It would be
            erroneous to assess the material before it and
            conclude that the complaint cannot be proceeded
            with. In proceedings instituted on complaint,
            exercise of the inherent powers to quash the
            proceedings is called for only in a case where the
            complaint does not disclose any offence or is
            frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If the
            allegations set out in the complaint do not
            constitute the offence of which cognizance has
            been taken by the Magistrate, it is open to the
            High Court to quash the same in exercise of the
            inherent powers under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_45">Section 482</a> of the Code. It
            is not, however, necessary that there should be
            meticulous analysis of the case before the trial to
            find out whether the case would end in conviction
            or acquittal. The complaint has to be read as a
            whole. If it appears that on consideration of the
            allegations in the light of the statement made on
            oath of the complainant that the ingredients of the
            offence or offences are disclosed and there is no
            material to show that the complaint is mala fide,
            frivolous or vexatious, in that event there would
            be no justification for interference by the High
            Court. When an information is lodged at the police
            station and an offence is registered, then the mala
            fides of the informant would be of secondary
            importance. It is the material collected during the
            investigation and evidence led in the court which
            decide the fate of the accused person. The
            allegations of mala fides against the informant are
            of no consequence and cannot by itself be the
            basis for quashing the proceedings."
