HEADNOTE:
When  an enactment is challenged on the ground of  violation
of fundamental rights it is necessary to ascertain its	true
nature and character, i.e., its subject matter, the area  in
which it is intended to operate, its purport and intent.  In
order  to do so it is legitimate to take into  consideration
all the factors such as the history of the legislation,	 the
purpose	  thereof,   the   surrounding	 circumstances	 and
conditions,  the  mischief intended to	be  suppressed,	 the
remedy	proposed by the legislature and the true reason	 for
the remedy.  Initially, there is a presumption in favour  of
the constitutionality of an enactment.

On examining the history of the legislation, the surrounding
circumstances  and the scheme of the Act it was	 clear	that
the  object of the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1929849/" id="a_11">Magic  Remedies  (Objectionable
Advertisement)	Act</a>,  1954,  was  the  prevention  of  self-
medication  and	 self-treatment by  prohibiting	 instruments
which  may be used to advocate the same or which  tended  to
spread the evil.  Its object was not merely the stopping  of
advertisements offending against morality and decency.
Advertisement  is  no doubt a form of speech, but  its	true
character  is reflected by the object for the  promotion  of
which  it is employed.	It is only when an advertisement  is
concerned  with the expression or propagation of ideas	that
it  can	 be  said to relate to freedom of  speech.   But  it
cannot be said that the right
672
to   publish   and  distribute	 commercial   advertisements
advertising  an individual's personal business is a part  of
the  freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution.	 The
provisions  of	the  Act  which	 prohibited   advertisements
commending the efficacy, value	 and   importance   in	 the
treatment  of  particular  diseases  of	 certain  drugs	 and
medicines did not fall under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_12">Art.	     19(1)(a)</a> of the
Constitution.	The  scope and object of the  Act  its	true
nature and character was not interference with the right  of
freedom	 of  speech but it dealt with  trade  and  business.

The definition of " advertisement " which included labels on
cartons and bottles and instructions inside cartons was	 not
too  wide  in  view  of	 the object  of	 the  Act.   If	 the
definition  was not so broad and inclusive it  would  defeat
the  very  purpose  for	 which the  Act	 was  brought  into'
existence.  The use of the word " suggest " in<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_16"> s. 3</a> did	 not
support	 the  contention that the restraint placed  by	that
section	 was disproportionate.	The provisions Of <a href="/doc/244576/" id="a_17"> S.  14(c)</a>
and  r. 6 which allowed the prohibited advertisements to  be
sent confidentially by post to a registered medical  practi-
tioner, to a wholesale or retail chemist, to a hospital or a
laboratory  only  when	the  words "  for-the  use  only  of
registered   medical  practitioners  or	 a  hospital  or   a
laboratory  "  had been inscribed on the  outside  of  every
packet containing the advertisement did not impose excessive
restraint.  The provisions of the Act were in the  interests
of the general public and placed reasonable restrictions  on
the trade and business of the petitioners and were saved  by

The  words " or any other disease or condition which may  be
specified  in the rules made under this Act " in cl. (d)  Of
S.  3 which empowered the Central Government to add  to	 the
diseases  falling  within  the mischief Of <a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_21"> s.	3</a>  conferred
uncanalised and uncontrolled power on the executive and were
ultra vires.  The legislature had established no criteria or
standards  and had not prescribed any principle on  which  a
particular  disease or condition was to be specified.  As  a
consequence  the  Schedule to the rules	 also  become  ultra
vires.	But the striking down of the impugned words did	 not
affect	the validity of the rest of cl. (d) or of the  other
clauses of<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_22"> S. 3</a> as these words were severable.

The first part of<a href="/doc/1618073/" id="a_23"> s. 8</a> which empowered any person authorised
by  the State Government in this behalf to seize and  detain
any document, article or thing which such person had  reason
to  believe  contained any  advertisement  contravening	 the
provisions of the Act imposed an unreasonable restriction on
the   fundamental   rights  of	the  petitioners   and	 was
unconstitutional.  This portion of<a href="/doc/1618073/" id="a_24"> s. 8</a> went far beyond	 the
purpose for which the Act was enacted and failed to  provide
proper safeguards in regard to the exercise of the power  of
seizure	  and  detention  as  had  been	 provided   by	 the
legislature in other statutes.	If this portion was  excised
from  the  section the remaining portion would	be  unintel-

by
KAPUR, J.-These petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_29">Art. 32</a> of the	Constitution
raise the question of the constitutionality of the Drug	 and
<a href="/doc/1929849/" id="a_30">Magic  Remedies	 (Objectionable Advertisement) Act</a>  (XXI  of
1954) hereinafter referred to as the Act.  As the  petitions
raise  a  common question of law they  may  conveniently  be
disposed of by one judgment.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">86</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">674</span>
<p id="p_6">The  allegation of the petitioners was that various  actions
had  been taken against them by the respond  which  violated
their fundamental rights under	 <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_31">Art.  19(1)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_32">19(1)(f)</a>
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_33">&amp; (g).</a>	They also challenged   the Act because it contrvened
the provisions of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_34">Art. 14</a>  and Arts. 21 and 31.
<a href="/doc/1929849/" id="a_35">The  Act</a> passed on April 30, 1954, came into force on  April
1, 1955, along with the rules made thereunder.	As  provided
in its preamble it was
"<a href="/doc/1929849/" id="a_36">An  Act</a>  to control the advertisement of drugs	 in  certain
cases, to prohibit the advertisement for certain purposes of
remedies  alleged to possess magic qualities and to  provide
for matters connected therewith."
</p><p id="p_7">The petitioners in Writ Petition No. 81 of 1959, the Hamdard
Dawakhana  (Wakf) and another, alleged that soon  after	 the
Act  came  into	 force they experienced	 difficulty  in	 the
matter	 of  publicity	for  their  products   and   various
objections were raised by the authorities in regard to their
advertisements.	 On December 4, 1958, the Drugs	 Controller,
Delhi,	intimated to the petitioners that the provisions  of
s. 3 of the Act had been contravened by them and called upon
them  to  recall  their products sent to  Bombay  and  other
States.	 As a result of this, correspondence ensued  between
the  petitioners and the authorities.  On December 4,  1958,
the Drugs Controller, Delhi State, stopped the sale of forty
of  their products set out in the  petition.   Subsequently,
objection   was	 taken	by  the	 Drugs	Controller  to	 the
advertisements	 in  regard  to	 other	 drugs.	   Similarly
objections  were  taken by the Drugs  Controllers  of  other
States to various advertisements in regard to medicines	 and
drugs prepared by the petitioners.  They submitted that	 the
various advertisements which had been objected to were	pre-
pared in accordance with the Unani system and the drugs bore
Unani  nomenclature which had been recognised in  the  whole
world  for several centuries past.  <a href="/doc/1929849/" id="a_37">The Act</a> is	assailed  on
the  ground  of	 discrimination	 under	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_38">Art.  14</a>,  excessive
delegation  and	 infringement of the right  of	free  speech
under  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_39">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> and their right to carry on  trade	 and
business under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">     675</span>
<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_40">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_41">&amp; (g).</a> Objection is also taken under Arts.  21
and 31. The petitioners therefore prayed for  a	 declaration
that the Act and the Rules made there under were ultra vires
and  void as violative of Part III of the  Constitution	 and
for  the issuing of a writ of Mandamus and  Prohibition	 and
for  quashing the proceedings and the notices issued by	 the
various authorities-the respondents.
</p><p id="p_8">In their counter affidavit the respondents submitted   that
the  method  and  manner of advertisement of  drugs  by	 the
petitioners and others clearly indicated the necessity	  of
having an Act like the impugned Act and its	    rigorous
enforcement. The allegations in regard to discrimination and
impairment of fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_42">Art. 19(1)(a</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_43">), (f)</a>  &amp;
</p><p id="p_9">(g) and any infringement of Arts. 21 and 31 were denied	 and
it was stated :-
</p><p id="p_10">"  The restriction is about the advertisement to the  people
in  general. I say that the main object and purpose  of	 the
Act is to prevent people from self medicating with regard to
various	 serious  diseases. Self-medication  in	 respect  of
diseases  of  serious nature mentioned in the  Act  and	 the
Rules  has  a  deleterious  effect  on	the  health  of	 the
community  and	is likely to affect the	 well-being  of	 the
people. Having thus found that some medicines have  tendency
to  induce people to resort to self-medication by reason  of
elated	advertisements,	 it  was thought  necessary  in	 the
interest  of  public  health  that the	puffing	 up  of	 the
advertisements	is  put	 to a complete check  and  that	 the
manufacturers are compelled to route their products  through
recognised   sources   so  that	 the   products	  of   these
manufacturer  could  be	 put to valid and  proper  test	 and
consideration by expert agencies."
</p><p id="p_11">It  was	 also  pleaded that the advertisements	were  of  an
objectionable  character and taking into  consideration	 the
mode and method of advertising conducted by the	 petitioners
the  implementation of the provisions of the  impugned	 Act
was  justified.	 Along	with  their  counter-affidavit	 the
respondents have placed on record Ext.-A, which is a copy of
the literature which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">676</span>
accompanied one of the various medicines put on sale by	 the
petitioners and/or was stated on the cartons in	  which	 the
medicine was contained.	 In their affidavit in rejoinder the
petitioners reiterated that Unani and	Ayurvedic    systems
had been discriminated against; that self-medication had  no
deleterious  effect on the health of the community;  on	 the
contrary it-
</p><p id="p_12">"  is likely to affect the well-being of the people, in	 the
context	 of effective household and domestic remedies  based
on  local  herbs  popularly known to them  in  rural  areas.
Self-medication	 has  its  permission  (?)  limits  even  in
America and Canada where unlicensed itinerant vendors  serve
the people effectively."
</p><p id="p_13">For  the petitioners in all the petitions Mr. Munshi  raised
four points:
</p><p id="p_14">(1)  Advertisement is a vehicle by means of which freedom of
speech	guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_44">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> is exercised and	 the
restrictions which are imposed by the Act are such that they
are not covered by cl. (2) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_45">Art. 19 ;</a>
</p><p id="p_15">(2)<a href="/doc/1929849/" id="a_46">That	 Act</a>, the Rules made thereunder and the schedule  in
the rules impose arbitrary and excessive restrictions on the
rights guaranteed to the petitioners by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_47">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_48">&amp; (g);
(3)</a>  <a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_49">Section   3</a>   of  the  Act	 surrenders   unguided	 and
uncanalised  power to the executive to add to  the  diseases
enumerated in<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_50"> s. 3</a>;
</p><p id="p_16">(4)  Power  of	confiscation  under <a href="/doc/1618073/" id="a_51"> s.	 8</a>  of	the  Act  is
violative of the rights under Arts. 21 and 31 of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_17">In  Petitions  Nos. 62 and 63 of 1939 which  relate  to	 two
branches  of  Sadhana  Ausadhalaya at  Poona  and  Allahabad
respectively,  Mr.  N.	C.  Chatterjee,	 after	giving	 the
peculiar  facts	 of those petitions and the  fact  that	 the
petitioners'  Poona branch was raided without a	 warrant,  a
number	of medicines had been seized, and a complaint  filed
against the petitioners in that petition, submitted that <a href="/doc/343239/" id="a_52"> s.
3(b)</a>  of  the Act was meant to strike down  abnormal  sexual
activities,   that  advertisements  in	that   case   merely
mentioned  the names of the diseases and suggested the	drug
for the treatment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">677</span>
of  those  diseases,  that the prohibition  of	such  adver-
tisements   was	  an  unreasonable  restriction	  on   their
fundamental right; that there was nothing indecent in saying
that their medicine was a cure for a particular disease	 and
that  the  Act	was  an undue  interference  with  cure	 and
treatment of diseases.
</p><p id="p_18">We  now	 proceed to consider the vitality of  the  arguments
raised	on  behalf  of	the  petitioners.   Firstly  it	 was
submitted  that	 the  restriction on  advertisements  was  a
direct	 abridgement  of  the  right  of  free	speech	 and
advertisements	could not be brought out of  the  guaranteed
freedom	 under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_53">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> because no dividing line  could
be  drawn  and freedom of speech could not be  curtailed  by
making	it  subject  to any  other  activity.	The  learned
Solicitor-General  on the otherhand, contended that  it	 was
necessary to examine the pith and substance of the  impugned
Act  and if it was properly considered it could not be	said
to  have  in  any way curtailed, abridged  or  impaired	 the
rights	guaranteed to the petitioners under  Art,  19(1)(a).
He also contended that the prohibited advertisements did not
fall  within the connotation of " freedom of speech  ".	 The
doctrine  of pith and substance,, submitted Mr. Munshi,	 was
created	 for  the  purpose of  determining  the	 legislative
competence of a legislature to enact a law and he sought  to
get  support from the following observation  of	 Venkatarama
Aiyar, J., in <a href="/doc/1057797/" id="a_54">A. S. Krishna v. State of Madras</a> (1) :-
"...... and the Privy Council had time and again to pass  on
the  constitutionality	of  laws made by  the  Dominion	 and
Provincial legislatures.  It was in this situation that	 the
Privy  Council	evolved	 the  doctrine,	 that  for  deciding
whether an impugned legislation was intra vires regard	must
be had to its pith and substance.  "
</p><p id="p_19">Though the doctrine of ' pith and substance' was evolved  to
determine the constitutionality of an enactment in reference
to the legislative competence of a legislature	particularly
under  a federal constitution with a distributive system  of
powers	it  has been used in other contexts in	some  cases,
e.g., in connection
(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 399,406,410.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">678</span>
<p id="p_20">with the determination of the constitutionality of  statutes
restricting    the    rights	to    carry    on    certain
activities and the consequent infringement of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_55">Art.  19(1)(g)
:</a>  by Mahajan, C.J., in <a href="/doc/1029264/" id="a_56">Cooverjee B. Bharucha v. The  Excise
Commissioner  &amp; The Chief Commissioner of Ajmer</a> (1)  in	 the
case of Excise Regulation of 1915  regulating  the   import,
export,	 transport,  manufacture,  sale	 and  possession  of
intoxicating  drugs and liquor and imposing duties  thereon;
by Das, C.J., in <a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_57">State of Bombay v. R. M. D.  Chamarbughwala</a>
(2)  in connection with a statute which was held not  to  be
interference with trade, commerce or intercourse as such but
to save it from anti-social activities.
</p><p id="p_21">It  is unnecessary to decide in the present case whether  in
its   scope   it  extends  to  the  determination   of	 the
constitutionality  of  an enactment with  reference  to	 the
various	  sub-clauses  of  cl.	(1)of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_58">Art.  19.</a>    A	more
appropriate  approach  to the question is, in  our  opinion,
contained  in the dictum of Mahajan, J. (as he then was)  in
<a href="/doc/1466885/" id="a_59">M/s.   Dwarka  Prasad  Laxmi Narain v. The  State  of  Uttar
Pradesh</a>	 (3).	There  he held that "  in  order  to  decide
whether a particular legislative measure contravenes any  of
the  provisions	 of  Part  III of  the	Constitution  it  is
necessary  to examine with some strictness the substance  of
the legislation in order to decide what the legislature	 has
really	done.  Of course the legislature cannot bypass	such
constitutional prohibition by employing indirect methods and
therefore  the	Court  has  to	look  behind  the  form	 and
appearance to discover the true character and nature of	 the
legislation.  "
</p><p id="p_22">Therefore,  when the constitutionality of an  enactment	 is-
,challenged  on	 the  ground  of violation  of	any  of	 the
articles in Part 111 of the Constitution, the  ascertainment

State recommending to the Central and Provincial Governments
to take immediate measures to control the indiscriminate use
of medical drugs and for standardisation of the	 preparation
and for the sale of such drugs.	 In August 1930, in response
to  the	 public opinion on the subject and in  pursuance  of
that resolution the Government of India appointed the  Drugs
Enquiry	 Committee with Sir R. N. Chopra as its Chairman  to
enquire into the extent of the quality and strength of drugs
imported,  manufactured	 or sold in India and  to  recommend
steps for controlling such imports, manufacture and sale  in
the  interest of the public.  This Committee made  a  report
pointing  out  the  necessity  of  exercising  control	over
import,

<p id="p_30">manufacture and sale of patent and proprietary medicines  in
the interest of the safety of the public and public  health.
The  report  pointed out in paragraph 256-259 how  in  other
countries  control  was exercised and  restrictive  laws  to
achieve that end had been     enacted.	 In the Appendix  to
this  Report  was  given a list of a number  of	 samples  of
advertisements	of patent and proprietary medicines  dealing
with cures of all kinds of diseases.
</p><p id="p_31">(2)  As	 a result of the Chopra Committee Report the  `Drugs
act, was passed in 1940.
</p><p id="p_32">(3)In  1948  <a href="/doc/549550/" id="a_66">The  Pharmacy Act</a> was passed  to  regulate	 the
provisions of pharmacy.	 As a result of these two enactments
the  State  Governments	 were given  the  responsibility  of
controlling the manufacture of drugs and pharmaceuticals and
their  sales  through qualified personnel  and	the  Central
Government  was	 given the control on quality of  drugs	 and
pharmaceuticals imported into the country.
(4)The Chopra Committee Report dealt with the popularity  of
the patent and proprietary medicines in the following words:
 "The	pride  of  place  must	be  accorded  to   ingenious
propaganda  clever  and attractive  dissemination  of  their
supposed virtues and wide and alluring advertisements.	 The
credulity  and	gullibility of the masses,  especially	when
'certain  cures' are assured in utterly hopeless cases,	 can
well  be imagined.  Perusal of the advertisements of  cures'
produces a great effect on patients who have tried treatment
by medical men without success.	 Such patients resort to any
and every drug that comes in their way.	 In an infinitesimal
small  number of cases spontaneous cures are also  effected.
Widest	publicity  is given to these  and  the	preparations
become	invested with miraculous virtues.  The	reassurances
of cure, the force of argument advanced to guarantee it	 and
the  certificates of persons said to have been	cured  which
are  all set out in advertisements make a  deep	 impression,
especially  on those with weak nerves.	The love of  mystery
and   secrecy	inherent  in  human  nature,   the   natural
disinclination and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">681</span>
shyness	 to  disclose details of  one's	 illness  especially
those involving moral turpitude, the peculiar temperament of
the  people  who,  high	 and  low,  rich  and  poor,  demand
'something  in a bottle' for the treatment of every  ailment
and  poverty  of  the people who cannot afford	to  pay	 the
doctor's  bills	 or the high prices  current  for  dispensed
medicines,' have all been enlarged upon as tending to  self-
diagnosis  and	self-medication by  patent  and	 proprietary
medicines."
</p><p id="p_33">(5)Evidence was led before the Chopra Committee	 deprecating
the  increasing sale of proprietary  medicines	particularly
those  with  secret formulae as such drugs  were  positively
harmful	 and  were a serious and increasing  menace.   There
were advertisements and pamphlets issued in connection	with
these  medicines  which	 showed	 fraudulent  practices	 and
extravagant claims for these medicines.
</p><p id="p_34">(6)The	 Chopra	  Committee   Report   had   also   made   a
recommendation	 for  a	 strict	 measure  of  control	over
proprietary medicines.
</p><p id="p_35">(7)  The  Bhatia  Committee  was set up in  pursuance  to  a
resolution  No.	 CI-1(12)/52 dated February  14,  1953,	 and
between March 1953, and end of that year it examined a large
number of witnesses in different towns of India some of whom
represented  chemists  and  druggists,	some  were   leading
medical	 practitioners	and some were  State  Ministers	 for
Health.	  The  Bhatia Committee issued	a  Questionnaire  to
various organisations and witnesses.  It contained questions
in regard to advertisement of drugs and therefore one of the
objects	 of  this  Committee which was	inaugurated  by	 the
Health Minister on March 12, 1953, was amongst other  things
to look into the control to be exercised over  objectionable
and unethical advertisements.
</p><p id="p_36">(8)  There   were   a	large	number	 of    objectionable
advertisements	in the Press in regard to  patent  medicines
which were after the Act came into force pointed out by	 the
Press Commission Report but it cannot be said that this fact
was unknown to Parliament as this Committee also examined  a
number of witnesses.

<p id="p_37">(9)  The  Indian Medical Association had suggested  to	this
Press	 Committee    which   was    presided	 over	  by
the   late   Mr.  Justice  Rajadhyaksha	  the	barring	  of
advertisements of medicines which claim to cure or alleviate
any of the following diseases:
</p><p id="p_38">Cancer,	  Bright's  disease, Cataract,	Diabetes,  Epilepsy,
Glaucoma, Locomotor ataxia, Paralysis, Tuberculosis.
(10)  In  the  United Kingdom, advertisements  of  drugs  or
treatment for these diseases are governed by the Cancer	 Act
of  1939  and  the Pharmacy and Medi.  cines  Act  of  1941.
(Advertisement	 relating  to  the  treatment  of   venereal
diseases are governed by the Venereal Diseases Act of 1917).
(11) Wyndham  E.B.  Lloyd  in his book '  Hundred  years  of
medicine'  published  in 1936 wrote  about  the	 outstanding
evils  which  arise  from the use  of  secret  remedies	 and
nostrums.   It	also  drew  attention  to  the	dangers	  of
advertisements	in  regard  to them  and  what	the  British
Medical Association had said about them.
</p><p id="p_39">(12)The	 British Medical Association had in a book  entitled
'Secret	 Remedies  What	 they  cost  and  contain'   exposed
ruthlessly  the	 harmful  effects  of  such  remedies.	 The
council	 on  Pharmacy  and  Chemistry  of  American  Medical
Association  had  also	given its  opinion  on	the  harmful
effects of indiscriminate self-medication by the public	 and
the  grave  danger which ensued from  such  misdirected	 and
inadequate   treatment,	  and  the  failure   to   recognise
seriousness of the disease only when it was too late.
It  is not necessary to refer to the recommendations of	 the
Bhatia Committee or the Press Enquiry Committee because they
were published in June and July 1954 respectively.
In  England as far back as 1889, an Act called the  Indecent
Advertisements	Act (52 and 53 Viet.  Ch. 18) was passed  to
suppress  indecent  advertisements in  which  advertisements
relating to syphilis, gonorrhoea, nervous debility or  other
complaints   or	 infirmity  arising  from  intercourse	 was
prohibited.  In 1917 the Venereal Diseases Act (7 and 8 Geo.
V  Ch. 21) was passed in England.  This placed	restrictions
on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">683</span>
advertisements relating to treatment for venereal  diseases.
In  1941, The Pharmacy and <a href="/doc/1423048/" id="a_67">Medicine Act</a>, 1941 (4 and 5	Geo.
VI  Ch.	 42)  was passed which corres-	  ponds	 in material
particulars  to	 the impugned Act.  It cannot be  said	that
there  was  no material before Parliament on  the  basis  of
which it proceeded to enact the impugned legislation.	This
material   shows  the  bistory	of  the	  legislation,	 the
ascertained evil intended to be cured and the  circumstances
in  which  the enactment was passed.  <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_68">In  Shri	Ram  Krishna
Dalmia	v.  Shri  Justice S. R. Tendolkar</a>  (1),	 Das,  C.J.,
observed :-
</p><p id="p_40">"  that	 in  order  to	sustain	 the  presumption  of	con-
stitutionality the court may take into consideration matters
of common knowledge, the history of the times and may assume
every state of facts which can be conceived existing at	 the
time  of legislation;"
</p><p id="p_41">Thus it is open to the court for the  purpose of determining
the  constitutionality	of the Act to take all	these  facts
into  consideration  and in the present case  we  find	that
there  was the evil of self-medication, which both  in	this
country	 and in other countries, the medical profession	 and
those, who were conversant with its dangers, had brought  to
the  notice  of the people at large and	 the  Government  in
particular.   They  had also warned against the	 dangers  of
self-medication	  and  of  the	consequences  of   unethical
advertisement	 relating    to	   proprietary	   medicines
particularising those diseases which were more likely to  be
affected by the evil.  There is reason, therefore, for us to
assume	that the state of facts existed at the time  of	 the
legislation which necessitated the Act.	 These facts we have
already set out and it is not necessary to reiterate them.
With  this  background	in view we proceed  to	examine	 the
provisions of the Act and ascertain the predominant purpose,
true intent, scope and the object of the Act.  The  preamble
shows  that  the  object  of the  Act  was  to	control	 the
advertisement of drugs in certain cases, i.e., diseases	 and
to  prohibit advertisements relating to remedies  pretending
to  have  magic	 qualities and	provide	 for  other  matters
connected therewith,
(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 279, 297.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">684</span>
<p id="p_42">The title of the Act also shows that it is directed  against
objectionable	   advertisements.	 The	  definition
section (s. 2) in cl. (a) defines advertisements and in	 cl.
</p><p id="p_43">(b) drugs which include (i) medicines for use of       human
beings	and animals, (ii) substances for use  of  diagnosis,
treatment  or  prevention of diseases in  human	 beings	 and
animals,  (iii) articles other than food which-	 affect	 the
organic functions of the body of human beings or animals and
</p><p id="p_44">(iv)  articles	intended  for  use as  a  component  of	 any
medicine  etc., cl. (c) defines magic remedies to include  a
talisman,  mantra, kavacha and other charms and (d)  relates
to  the	 publication  of any advertisement and	(e)  what  a
venereal  disease is.  <a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_69">Section 3</a> prohibits advertisement  of
drugs  for treatment of diseases and disorders.	 Clause	 (a)
of <a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_70"> s. 3</a> deals with procurement of miscarriage in women	 for
prevention  of	conception;  cl.  (b)  with  maintenance  or
improvement of capacity of human beings for sexual pleasure;
cl.  (c)  with	diagnosis and cure  of	venereal  and  other
diseases.   <a href="/doc/1735771/" id="a_71">Section  4</a> prohibits  misleading  advertisements
relating   to	drugs.	 <a href="/doc/1475495/" id="a_72">Section   5</a>   similarly   prohibits
advertisements	of magic remedies efficacious  for  purposes
specified  in<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_73"> s. 3</a>. <a href="/doc/320993/" id="a_74">Section 6</a> prohibits the import into	 and
export from India of certain advertisement.  <a href="/doc/49765/" id="a_75">Section 14</a> is a
saving	clause	which  excludes	 registered   practitioners,
treatises  or books,, advertisements sent confidentially  to
medical	 practitioners,	 wholesale or  retail  chemists	 for
distribution  among registered medical practitioners  or  to
hospitals or laboratories.  It also excludes  advertisements
printed	 or  published by Government or	 with  the  previous
sanction of the Government.  <a href="/doc/1001167/" id="a_76">Section 15</a> gives the Government
the power to grant exemptions from the application of<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_77"> ss. 3</a>,
<a href="/doc/1735771/" id="a_78">4</a>, <a href="/doc/1475495/" id="a_79">5</a> and <a href="/doc/320993/" id="a_80">6</a> in certain cases.
</p><p id="p_45">As  already  stated  when an enactment is  impugned  on	 the
ground that it is ultra vires and unconstitutional what	 has
to  be ascertained is the true character of the	 legislation
and, for that purpose regard must be had to the enactment as
a  whole, to its objects, purpose and true intention and  to
the  scope  and effect of its provisions or  what  they	 are
directed  against  and what they aim at (<a href="/doc/1057797/" id="a_81">A.  S.	 Krishna  v.
State of Madras</a> (1)).  Thus

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">685</span>
<p id="p_46">examined  it cannot be said that the object of the  Act	 was
merely to put a curb on advertisements which offend  against
decency	 or  morality  but the object  truly,  and  properly
understood  is	to prevent self-medication or  treatment  by
prohibiting  instruments which may be used to  advocate	 the
same  or  which tend to spread the evil.  No doubt in <a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_82"> s.  3</a>
diseases are expressly mentioned which have relation to	 sex
and  disorders	peculiar to women but taken as	a  whole  it
cannot	be said that the object of the Act was to deal	only
with  matters which relate to indecency or immorality.	 The
name  and the preamble are indicative of the  purpose  being
the control of all advertisements relating to drugs and	 the
use of the word animals in cl. (b) of the definition section
negatives  the object being merely to curb the	emphasis  on
sex  and  indecency.  <a href="/doc/1735771/" id="a_83">Section 4</a> further	 suggests  that	 the
legislature  was  trying to stop  misleading  advertisements
relating  to  drugs.  <a href="/doc/1475495/" id="a_84">Section 5</a> also tends  to	support	 the
object	 being	prohibition  of	 advertisements	  suggesting
remedies  for all kinds of diseases.  <a href="/doc/320993/" id="a_85">Section 6</a> also  points
in  the same direction, i.e., to stop advertisements  as  to
drugs.	 <a href="/doc/49765/" id="a_86">Sections  14</a> and <a href="/doc/1001167/" id="a_87">15</a> are a clearer  indication	that
there  should  be no advertisements for	 drugs	for  certain
diseases in order that the general public may not be  misled
into using them for ailments which they may imagine they are
suffering  from and which they might believe to	 be  curable
thereby.   That	 this is so is shown by the fact  that	such
advertisements	 can  be  sent	to  medical   practitioners,
hospitals  and	laboratories.  The exclusion  of  Government
advertisements and the power to give exemption all point  to
the objective being the stopping of advertisements of  drugs
for  the  object  above-mentioned and  not  merely  to	stop
advertisements offending against morality and decency.
Mr.  Munshi's argument was that<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_88"> s. 3</a> was the key to the	 Act
and that the object and direct effect of the Act was to stop
advertisements	and thereby impair the right of free  speech
by directly putting a prohibition on advertisement.  If	 the
contention of Mr. Munshi were accepted then the	 restriction
to  be	valid, must fall within cl. (2) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_89">Art.	 19</a>  of	 the
Constitution.  In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">686</span>
other  words  it  must have  relationship  with	 decency  or
morality  because  the	other restrictions  of	that  clause
have no application.  If on the other hand the submission of
the learned Solicitor-General is accepted    then the matter
would  fall under sub-cls. (f) and (g) and  the	 restriction
under  <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_90">Art.  19(6).</a>  The object of the Act as shown  by	 the
scheme	of  the Act and as stated in the  affidavit  of	 Mr.
Merchant  is  the prevention of	 self-medication  and  self-
treatment  and a curb on such advertisements is a  means  to
achieve that end.  Objection was taken that the preamble  in
the Act does not indicate the object to be the prevention of
treatment  of diseases otherwise than by  qualified  medical
practitioners  as  the English Venereal	 Diseases  Act	1917
does.	In this Court in many cases affidavits were  allowed
to be given to show the reasons for the enactment of a	law,
the circumstances in which it was conceived and the evils it
was  to cure. This was done in the case of <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_91">Shri Ram  Krishna
Dalmia	v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar</a> (1).  Similarly,  in
<a href="/doc/1949862/" id="a_92">Kathi Raning v. The State of Saurashtra</a> (2 ) and in Kavalap-
para  Kottarathil  Kochunni  v.	 The  State  of	 Madras	 (3)
affidavits  were allowed to be filed setting out  in  detail
the circumstances which led to the passing of the respective
enactments.
</p><p id="p_47">In support of his argument that any limitation of his  right
to advertise his goods was an infringement of his freedom of
speech because advertisement was a part of that freedom	 Mr.
Munshi	relied upon Alma Lovell v. City of Griffin (4).	  In
that  case  the objection was taken  to the  validity  of  a
municipal  ordinance prohibiting the distribution without  a
permit of circulars, handbooks, advertising or literature of
any  kind  on the ground that such  ordinance  violated	 the
first and the 14th amendment by abridging the freedom of the
Press  and it was held that such prohibition was invalid  at
its  face  as infringing the constitutional freedom  of	 the
Press and constitutional guarantee of such freedom  embraced
pamphlets  and	leaflets.  The actual  violation  which	 was
complained of in that case consisted of the

<p id="p_51">distribution  without the required permission  of  pamphlets
and  magazines	in  the nature of  religious  tracts.  Chief
Justice Hughes, said :-
</p><p id="p_52">"   The	  ordinance  in	 its  broad  sweep   prohibits	 the
distribution   of  "circulars,	handbooks,  advertising	  or
literature	of  any	 kind."	 It  manifestly	 applies  to
pamphlets, magazines and periodicals."
</p><p id="p_53">No  doubt  the	word  advertisement was	 used  both  in	 the
ordinance  as  well as in the opinion by the  learned  Chief
Justice but the case actually related to the distribution of
pamphlets  and magazines. Mr. Munshi also relied on  <a href="/doc/1157189/" id="a_93">Express
Newspapers (Private) Ltd. v. The, Union of India</a> (1),  where
the cases dealing with freedom of  speech were discussed  by
Bhagwati, J., but the question of advertisements as such did
not arise in that case.
</p><p id="p_54">An  advertisement is no doubt a form of speech but its	true
character is reflected by the object for the promotion	  of
which it is employed. It assumes the attributes and elements
of  the activity under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_94">Art. 19(1)</a> which it seeks to  aid  by
bringing  it to the notice of the public. When it takes	 the
form  of a commercial advertisement which has an element  of
trade  or commerce it no longer falls within the concept  of
freedom of speech for the object is not propagation of ideas-
social,	 political or economic or furtherance of  literature
or  human  thought  ;  but  as	in  the	 present  case	 the
commendation  of  the  efficacy,  value	 and  importance  in
treatment  of  particular  diseases  by	 certain  drugs	 and
medicines.  In	such  a case, advertisement  is	 a  part  of
business even though as described by Mr. Munshi its creative
part,  and it was being used for the purpose  of  furthering
the business of the petitioners and had no relationship with
what  may be called the essential concept of the freedom  of
speech.	  It  cannot be said that the right to	publish	 and
distribute   commercial	  advertisements   advertising	  an
individual's  personal	business  is a part  of	 freedom  of
speech	 guaranteed  by	 the  Constitution.   In  Lewis	  J.
Valentine  v. F. J. Chrestensen (2).  It was held  that	 the
constitutional right of free speech is not infringed by
(1) (1959) S.C.R. 12,123-133.
</p><p id="p_55">(2) 86 Law.  Ed. 1262.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">688</span>
<p id="p_56">prohibiting  the distribution in city streets  of  handbills
bearing on one side a protest against action taken by public
officials and on the other advertising matter.	  The object
of  affixing of the protest to the  advertising	 circularwas
the   evasion  of  the	prohibition  of	 a  city   ordinance
forbidding   the  distribution	in  the	 city	streets	  of
commercial  and	 business advertising  matter.	Mr.  Justice
Roberts, delivering the opinion of the court said:-
"  This	 court has unequivocally held that the	streets	 are
proper	 places	  for  the  exercise  of  the	freedom	  of
communicating  information  and	 disseminating	opinion	 and
that, though the states and municipalities may appropriately
regulate the privilege in the public interest, they may	 not
unduly	burden or proscribe its employment in  these  public
thoroughfares.	 We are equally clear that the	Constitution
imposes	 no such restraint on government as respects  purely
commercial   advertising......	 If   the   respondent	 was
attempting  to use the streets of New York  by	distributing
commercial   advertising,  the	prohibition  of	  the	Code
provisions was lawfully invoked against such conduct."
It  cannot be said therefore that every advertisement  is  a
matter	dealing	 with freedom of speech nor can it  be	said
that it is an expression of ideas.  In every case one has to
see  what  is  the  nature of  the  advertisement  and	what
activity falling under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_95">Art. 19(1)</a> it seeks to further.	 The
advertisements	in  the instant case relate to	commerce  or
trade  and not to propagating of ideas; and  advertising  of
prohibited drugs or commodities of which the sale is not  in
the  interest of the general public cannot be speech  within
the  meaning of freedom of speech and would not fall  within
<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_96">Art.  19(1)(a).</a>	 The main purpose and true intent  and	aim,
object and scope of the Act is to prevent self-medication or
self-treatment	 and   for   that   purpose   advertisements
commending certain drugs and medicines have been prohibited.
Can  it	 be  said  that	 this  is  an  abridgement  of	 the
petitioners'  right  of free speech.  In our opinion  it  is
not.   Just  as in Chamarbaughwalla's ease (1) it  was	said
that activities undertaken and

<p id="p_57">carried, on with a view to earning profits e.g. the business
of  betting  and gambling will not be protected	 as  falling
within	the  guaranteed right of carrying    on	 business or
trade, so it cannot be said that an advertisement commending
drugs  and  substances	as  appropriate	 cure  for   certain
diseases  is an exercise of the right of freedom of  speech.
Das,  C.J., in <a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_97">State Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaughwala</a>'s	 (1)
case said at, page 920:
</p><p id="p_58">"We  have no doubt that there are certain  activities  which
can under no circumstances be regarded as trade or  business
or  commerce  although the usual forms and  instruments	 are
employed  therein.   To exclude those  activities  from	 the
meaning	 of those words is not to cut down their meaning  at
all  but  to  say only that they are  not  within  the	true
meaning of those words."
</p><p id="p_59">One has only to substitute for the words "trade or  business
or  commerce" the phrase "freedom of speech" to see  how  it
applies to the present case.  Freedom of speech goes to	 the
heart  of the natural right of an  organised  freedom-loving
society to "impart and acquire information about that common
interest".  If any limitation is placed which results in the
society being deprived of such right then no doubt it  would
fall within the guaranteed freedom under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_98">Art. 19(1)(a).</a>	 But
if all it does is that it deprives a trader from  commending
his  wares it would not fall within that term.	In  John  W.
Rast v. Van Deman &amp; Lewis Company (2), Mr. Justice  McKenna,
dealing with advertisements said:-
</p><p id="p_60">"Advertising   is  merely  identification  and	 description
apprising of quality and place.	 It has no other object than
to  draw  attention  to	 the article  to  be  sold  and	 the
acquisition  of the article to be sold constitutes the	only
inducement   to	 its  purchase."
</p><p id="p_61">As   we	 have  said  above  advertisement  takes  the	same
attributes as the object it seeks to promote or bring to the
notice	of  the public to be used by it.   Examples  can  be
multiplied which would show that advertisement dealing	with
trade and business has relation

with  the item "business or trade" and not with "freedom  of
speech".   Thus	 advertisements sought to be banned  do	 not
fall  under  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_99">Art. 19(1)(a).</a>
</p><p id="p_63">It   was  also	contended  that	 the   prohibition   against
advertisements	of the petitioners was a direct	 abridgement
of the right of freedom of speech and Alice Lee Grosjean  v.
The American Press Co. (1) was relied upon.  That was a case
in  which a tax was levied based on gross receipts  for	 the
privilege   of	 engaging   in	the   business	 of   public
advertisements	in  newspapers,	 magazines  etc.  having   a
specified  circulation	and it was there held  that  such  a
statute abridged the freedom of the press because its effect
was  not  merely to reduce revenue but it  had	tendency  to
curtail circulation. - This subject was discussed in Express
Newspapers' case (2) at pages 128 to 133 where the  question
was  whether  the Wage Board Act specifying  the  wages	 and
conditions  of service of the working journalists  and	thus
imposing  certain  financial  burden on	 the  press  was  an
interference  with  the	 right	of  freedom  of	 Press	 and
Bhagwati, J., said at page 135:-
</p><p id="p_64">" Unless these were the direct or inevitable consequences of
the  measures enacted in the impugned Act, it would  not  be
possible  to  strike  down the legislation  as	having	that
effect	and operation.	A possible eventuality of this	type
would  Dot necessarily be the consequence which could be  in
the  contemplation  of	the  legislature  while	 enacting  a
measure	 of  this  type	 for  the  benefit  of	the  workmen
concerned."
</p><p id="p_65">In considering the constitutionality of a statute the  Court
has regard to substance and not to mere matters of form	 and

affected by the Act do not fall within the words freedom  of

<p id="p_69">but  it	 deals with trade or business; and (3) there  is  no

<a href="/doc/1157189/" id="a_102">Express Newspapers (Private) Ltd. v. The Union of India</a>(2).
It   is	 not  the  form	 or  incidental	 infringement	that
determines the constitutionality of a, statute in  reference
to the rights guaranteed in <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_103">Art. 19(1</a>), but the reality	 and
substance.  <a href="/doc/1929849/" id="a_104">The Act</a> read as a whole does not merely prohibit
advertisements	relating  to drugs and	medicines  connected
with  diseases	expressly mentioned in<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_105"> s. 3</a> of the  Act	 but
they  cover  all advertisements which are  objectionable  or
unethical  and are used to promote self-medication or  self-
treatment.  This is the content of the Act.  Viewed in	this
way, it does not select any of the elements or attributes of
freedom	 of  speech  falling within  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_106">Art.  19(1)(a)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_70">It was next argued that assuming that the matter was  within
clauses	 (f)  &amp;	 (g)  of  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_107">Art.	19(1</a>),	the  restraint	 was
disproportionate  to  the  purpose of the  Act,	 the  object
sought	to be achieved and the evil sought to  be  remedied.
It  was	 further argued that it could not be said  that	 the
restrictions imposed by the Act were in the interest of	 the
general public.	 The basis of this argument was (1) the very
wide  definition of the word 'advertisement'in<a href="/doc/558601/" id="a_108"> s. 2(a)</a>;	 (2)
the  use of the word 'suggest' in<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_109"> s. 3</a>; (3) the	 uncanalised
delegated  power  to add diseases to the schedule;  (4)	 the
existence of<a href="/doc/244576/" id="a_110"> s. 14(c)</a> read with rule 6 of the Rules and	 (5)
the  procedural	 part  in  s.8 of the  Act;  all  of  which,
according  to  counsel,	 showed	 that  it  was	beyond'	 all
allowable limits of restraint under cl. 6 of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_111">Art. 19.</a>
'Advertisement' in the Act, it was argued, included not only
advertisements in newspapers and periodicals and other forms
of   publication   but	also  on.   cartons,   bottles	 and
instructions  inside a carton.	Without this latter kind  of
advertisement, it was submitted, the user would be unable to
know  what the medicine was, what it was to be used for	 and
how ? If the purpose

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">692</span>
<p id="p_72">of  the	 Act  is  to  prevent  objectionable  and  unethical
advertisements	in order to discourage self  medication	 and
self treatment it cannot be said that the definition is	 too
wide keeping in view the object and the purpose	  of the Act
which have been set out above.	It is these  evils which the
Act seeks to cure and if the definition of   the   word	   '
advertisment  '	 was  not so broad and	inclusive  it  would
defeat	the very purpose for which the Act was brought	into
existence.
</p><p id="p_73">The argument that the word 'suggest' is something subjective
is,  in our 'opinion, also not well-founded.  'Suggest'	 has
many  shades  of  meaning  and	in  the	 context  it   means
commendatory publication.  It connotes a direct approach and
its  use in<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_112"> s. 3</a> does not support the contention.  that	 the
restraint  is  disproportionate.   In another  part  of	 the
judgment we shall discuss the constitutionality of the power
of delegation reasonableness of the range of diseases  added
in  the schedule and it is unnecessary to go over  the	same
field here.
</p><p id="p_74">Then  we  come	to <a href="/doc/244576/" id="a_113"> s. 14(c)</a>  and  r.  6,  i.e.,  prohibited
advertisement  is  to be sent confidentially by	 post  to  a
registered medical practitioner or to a wholesale and retail
chemist or a hospital and laboratory and the following words
have  to  be  inscribed	 on  the  outside  of  every  packet
containing  the advertisement, i.e., " for the use  only  of
registered   medical  practitioners  or	 a  hospital  or   a
laboratory  ".	If  the	 purpose  is  to  discourage   self-
medication  and	 encourage treatment by	 properly  qualified
medical	 practitioners	then  such  a  regulatory  provision
cannot be considered an excessive restraint.  The mere	fact
that in the corresponding <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_114">English Act</a> certain other  persons
are  also  mentioned  and that such  advertisements  can  be
published   in	certain	 medical  journals  and	  scientific
treatises is not a ground for holding the restriction to  be
disproportionate.  It is not a proper method of judging	 the
reasonableness of the restrictions to compare every  section
of  the Act with the corresponding <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_115">English Act</a> and  then  to
hold  it  unreasonable	merely	because	 the   corresponding
section of the two Acts are different.	The evil may be	 the
same but the circumstances and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">     693</span>
conditions  in the two countries in regard to journals	 may
be  different and there are bound to be differences   in the
degree	of restrictiveness in the operativeportions  of	 the
two Acts. The policy behind the Act is that	  medication
should be on the advice of qualified medical  practitioners.
Merely	because	 the legislature thought that it  would	 not
exclude	 advertisements in medical journals of	the  country
would  not  be	indicative  of	the  disproportion  of	 the
restraint.
</p><p id="p_75">Objection was then taken to the procedural part in<a href="/doc/1618073/" id="a_116"> s. 8</a>	 and
it  was submitted that the power seizure and  detention	 was
unfettered and and  there is no proper procedure  laid	down<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_117">
Criminal  Procedure Code</a> or the <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_118">Drugs Act</a> are no  rules	 and
safeguards  in	regard warrants or entry  into	premises  as
there  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_119">Code  of</a>	 Criminal Procedure or	the  <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_120">Drugs  Act</a>.  In
another	 part  of  the	judgment we  shall  deal  with	this
question and it is not necessary to do so here.
 It was next contended that the Act was not in the  interest
of  the	 general  public as it could not be  said  that	 the
mention	 of the names of diseases or instructions as to	 the
use  of particular medicines for those diseases was  not  in
the  interest  of  the general	public.	 Besides,  it  would
prevent	 the  medicines being brought to the notice  of	 the
practising  medical practitioners or distributing  agencies.
It  would  also	 prevent  a  properly  worded  advertisement
suggesting  cure of diseases to people who for the  sake  of
prestige and other understandably valid reasons do not	like
to  confide to any person the nature of their  diseases	 and
that it would prevent medical relief in a country where such
relief	is notoriously inadequate. We have already  set	 out
the purpose and scope of the Act, the conditions in which it
was passed and the evils it seeks to cure. If the object  is
to prevent self-medication or self--treatment, as it appears
to be then these are exactly  the    evils    which	such
advertisements would subserve if a piece of legislation like
the Act did not exist. It has not   been  shown	  that	 the
restrictions laid down in the Act   are	  in   any    manner
disproportionate to the object sought to be attained by	 the
Act nor has it been of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">694</span>
shown  that  the restrictions are  outside  the	 permissible
limits.
</p><p id="p_76">Mr.   Chatterjee  in  dealing  with  this  point  drew	 our
attention  to  the test of reasonablenses as  laid  down  in
<a href="/doc/1217564/" id="a_121">Chintaman  Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (1)  where  it
was  said by Mahajan, J. (as he then was) at pages  762	 and
763:-
</p><p id="p_77">" The question for decision is whether the statute under the
guise of protecting public interests arbitrarily  interferes
with   private	 business  and	imposes	  unreasonable	 and
unnecessarily	 restrictive   regulations    upon    lawful
occupation; in other words' whether the total prohibition of
carrying on the business of manufacture of bidis within	 the
agricultural  season amounts to a reasonable restriction  on
the fundamental rights mentioned in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_122">article 19(1)(g)</a> of	 the
Constitution.  "
</p><p id="p_78">It  has	 not been shown in the present case that  under	 the
guise  of  protecting public interest  the  Act	 arbitrarily
interferes  with  private business or  imposes	unreasonable
restrictions.	If  the	 true intention of the	Act  is,  as
indeed	 it   is,  to  stop  objectionable   and   unethical
advertisements	 for  the  purpose  of	discouraging   self-
medication no question of unreasonable restrictions  arises.
Mr. Chatterjee also relied upon the observation of Bose, J.,
in <a href="/doc/1880952/" id="a_123">Dwarka Das Srinivas of Bombay v. The Sholapur Spinning  &amp;
Weaving	 Company  Limited</a> (2) where the learned	 Judge	said
that   "  the  provisions  in  the   Constitution   touching
fundamental  rights must be construed broadly and  liberally
in favour of those on whom the rights have been conferred ".
With  this statement we are in accord.	 The  interpretation
should	be  such  as  to  subserve  the	 protection  of	 the
fundamental  rights  of the citizen but that is	 subject  to
limitations  set  out in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_124">Art. 19</a> itself which  are  for	 the
general	 welfare of all ,citizens taken as a whole  and	 are
therefore  for	the  interest of the  general  public.	 Mr.
Chatterjee   further  contended	 that  the   restraint	 was
excessive  because the prohibition of a mere mention of	 the
name  of  a disease and the suggestion of a  cure  for	that
could
(1) [1950] S.C.R. 739.
</p><p id="p_79">(2) [1954] S.C. R. 674, 733.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">695</span>
<p id="p_80">not be a reasonable restriction. As submitted by the learned
Solicitor-General  the objection is not to the names but  to
the advertisements commending certain  medicines as a  cure
for the same and this is what the Act  is  endeavouring	 to
eliminate. In our opinion it cannot   be  said	 that	the
restrictions either excessiveor disproportionate or are not
in the interest of the	general public.
</p><p id="p_81">The third point raised by Mr. Munshi was that thewords	'or
any other disease or condition which maybe specified in
the rules made under this Act' in cl.(d) of<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_125"> s. 3</a> of the	 Act
are  delegated legislation and do not lay down	any  certain
criteria or proper standards,and  surrender  unguided	and
uncanalised power to theexecutive to add to diseases in the
schedule. Thelearned Solicitor-General in reply	 supported
theschedule  as a case of conditional legislation and  not
the  exercise of delegated legislative power and he  further
contended that even if it was held to be thelatter  it	was
within	the  limits recognised by  judicial  decisions.	 The
distinction  between conditional legislation  and  delegated
legislation is this that in the former the delegate's  power
is  that of determining when a legislative declared rule  of
conduct shallbecome  effective; Hampton &amp; Co. v. U.S.  (1)
and thelatter  involves delegation of rule  making  power
which  constitutionally	 may  be  exercised  by	 the  admin-
istrative agent. This means that the legislature having laid
down  the broad principles of its policy in the	 legislation
can   then  leave  the	details	 to  be	 supplied   by	 the
administrative	authority.  In	other  words  by   delegated
legislation  the  delegate  completes  the  legislation	  by
supplying  details  within  the	 limits	 prescribed  by	 the
statute and in the case of conditionallegislation      the
power  of  legislation	is  exercised  by  the	 legislature
conditionally  leaving	to  the discretion  of	an  external
authority  the time and manner -of carrying its	 legislation
into  effect as also the determination of the area to  which
it is to extend; (The Queen v. Burah	(2 ); Russell v. The
Queen  (3); King-Emperor v. (1) 276 U.S. 394.  (2) (1878)  3
App.  Cas. 889. (1882) 7 App.  Cas. 829, 835.

<p id="p_82">Benoarilal  Sarma  (1);	 <a href="/doc/1519712/" id="a_126">Sardar	 Indar	Singh  v.  State  of
Rajasthan</a>  (2). ) Thus when the delegate is given the  power
of  making  rules and regulations in order to  fill  in	 the
details	 to  carry  out and subserve  the  purposes  of	 the
legislation  the  manner in which the  requirements  of	 the
statute	 are to be met and the rights therein created to  be
enjoyed	 it  is an exercise of delegated  legislation.	 But
when   the  legislation	 is  complete  in  itself  and	 the
legislature  has itself made the law and the  only  function
left  to the delegate is to apply the law to an area  or  to
determine the time and manner of carrying it into effect, it
is  conditional legislation.  To put it in the	language  of
another American case:
</p><p id="p_83">" To assert that a law is less than a law because it is made
to  depend  upon  a  future  event or  act  is	to  rob	 the
legislature  of	 the  power to act  wisely  for	 the  public
welfare	 whenever  a law is passed relating to	a  state  of
affairs	  not  yet  developed,	or  to	things	future	 and
impossible to fully know.  "
</p><p id="p_84">The proper distinction there pointed out was this:
"  The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a	law,
but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine	some
fact or state of things upon which the law makes or  intends
to  make its own action depend.	 There are many things	upon
which  wise and useful legislation must depend which  cannot
be  known  to the law making power, and	 must  therefore  be
subject	 of  enquiry and determination outside the  hall  of
legislatures
(In  Lockes  Appeal 72 Pa. 491 ; Field v. Clark	 143  U.  S.
</p><p id="p_85">649.)
But  the  discretion  should  not be  so  wide	that  it  is
impossible  to	discern its limits.  There must	 instead  be
definite   boundaries  within  which  the  powers   of	 the
administrative authority are exercisable.  Delegation should
be not be so indefinite as to amount to an abdication of the
legislative  function-Schwartz American Administrative	Law,
page 21.
</p><p id="p_86">In  an Australian case relied upon by the learned  Solicitor
General	 the prohibition by proclamation of
(1) (1944) L.R.	 72 I.A. 57, (2) [1957] S.C.R. 604,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">      697</span>
goods  under <a href="/doc/1966051/" id="a_127"> s.  52</a>  of  the  Customs	Act  1901  was	held
to  be	conditional  legislation:  Baxter  v.  Ah  Way	 (1)
According to that case the legislature has to project	 its
mind into the future and provide as far as     possible	 for
all contingencies likely to arise in the application of	 the
law,  but  as  it  is  not  possible  to   provide  for	 all
contingencies  specifically for all cases,, the	 legislature
resorts	 to  conditional  legislation  leaving	it  to	some
specified  authority to determine in what circumstances	 the
law should become operative or to what its operation  should
be extended, or the particular class of persons or goods -to
which  it should be applied: Baxter's case (1) at pp. 637  &amp;
</p><p id="p_87">638.
Broadly	 speaking these are the distinguishing	features  of
the   two   forms  of  delegation  and	 these	 are   their
characteristics.  The question is in which compartment	does
the power given in the Act fall.
</p><p id="p_88">The power given to the authority under that provision (S. 3)
of the Act is contained in cl. (d) in the following words:-
S.3 " Subject to the provisions of this Act, no person shall
take  any  part	 in the	 publication  of  any  advertisement

prevention  of any venereal disease or any other disease  or
condition  which may be specified in rules made	 under	this
Act."
</p><p id="p_90">And  power to make rules is laid down in<a href="/doc/384017/" id="a_128"> s. 16</a> which  is  as
follows:-
</p><p id="p_91">S.   16	 (1) "The Central Government may by notification  in
the  official  gazette	make  rules  for  carrying  out	 the
purposes of this Act.
</p><p id="p_92">(2)  In	 particular and without prejudice to the  generality
of  the	 foregoing  power, such	 rules	may

or things referred to in cl. (c) of sub-s. (1)	  of <a href="/doc/49765/" id="a_130"> s.  14</a>
may be sent confidentially."
</p><p id="p_96">For  the petitioner it was argued that<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_131"> s. 3(d)</a> is  delegated
legislation  and  not conditional legislation as  the  power
delegated therein is only to specify conditions and diseases
in the rules.
</p><p id="p_97">The  interdiction under the Act is applicable to  conditions
and  diseases set out in the various clauses of<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_132"> s. 3</a> and  to
those  that  may  under	 the last  part	 of  clause  (d)  be
specified  in the rules made under<a href="/doc/384017/" id="a_133"> s. 16</a>.  The	first  'sub-
section	 of is. 16 authorises the making of rules  to  carry
out  the purposes of the Act and cl. (a) of sub-section	 (2)
of that section specifically authorises the specification of
diseases or conditions to which the provisions of<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_134"> s. 3</a> shall
apply.	 It is the first sub-section of<a href="/doc/384017/" id="a_135"> s. 16</a> which  confers
the  general \rule making power, i.e., it delegates  to	 the
administrative	authority  the	power  to  frame  rules	 and
regulations  to subserve the object and purpose of the	Act.
Clause (a) of the second sub-section is merely	illustrative
of the power given under the first sub-section; King Emperor
v. Sibnath Banerji (1).	 Therefore, sub-s. 2(a) also has the
same object as sub-s. (1), i.e, to carry out the purposes of
the  Act.   Consequently,  when the  rule  making  authority
specifies  conditions  and  diseases  in  the  schedule	  it
exercises  the same delegated authority as it does  when  it
exercises powers under sub-s. (1) and makes other rules	 and
therefore  it  is delegated legislation.  The  question	 for
decision  then is, is the delegation constitutional in	that
the  administrative authority has been supplied with  proper
guidance.   In	our  view  the	words  impugned	 are  vague.
Parliament has established no criteria, no standards and has
not  prescribed any principle on which a particular  disease
or condition is to be specified in the Schedule.  It is	 not
stated	what  facts or circumstances are to  be	 taken	into

The power of specifying diseases and conditions as given  in
s.   3(d)  must	 therefore  be	held  to  be  going   beyond
permissible boundaries

<p id="p_98">of  valid delegation. As a consequence the Schedule   in the
rules  must be struck down. But that would not	affect	such
conditions and diseases which properly	fall within the
four clauses of<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_136"> s. 3</a> excluding the portion of	cl.    (d)
which has been declared to be unconstitutional. In the	view
we have taken it is unnecessary to	consider      the
applicability of Baxter v. Ah Way (1).
</p><p id="p_99">We  are	 of the opinion therefore that the words  "  or	 any
other  disease	or condition which may be specified  in	 the
rules	made  under  this  Act	"  confer  uncanalised	 and
uncontrolled power to- the Executive and are therefore ultra
vires.	But their being taken out' of cl. (d) of<a href="/doc/358950/" id="a_137"> s.  3</a>	does
not  affect the constitutionality of the rest of the  clause
or  section as they are severable; <a href="/doc/725224/" id="a_138">R. M. D.  Chamarbaughwala
v. The Union of India</a> (2).
</p><p id="p_100">The  constitutionality of<a href="/doc/1618073/" id="a_139"> s. 8</a> of the Act was challenged  on
the  ground  that it violated the petitioners'	right  under
Arts. 21 and 31. That section when quoted runs as follows:
"  Any	person authorised by the State	Government  in	this
behalf	may,  at any time, seize............and	 detain	 any
document,  article or thing which such person has reason  to
believe' contains any advertisement which contravenes any of
the  provisions	 of  this  Act and  the	 court	trying	such
contravention  may  direct that such document (includingall
copies	thereof) article or thing shall be forfeited to	 the
Government".It	was pointed out by Mr. Munshi that  there
was nolimitation  placed  on, no rules	and  regulations
made for and no safeguards provided in regard to the  powers
of a person authorised in that behalf by Government to seize
and  detain any document, article or anything which  in	 the
opinion of such person contains	    any	     advertisement
contravening any of theprovisions of the Act. It was  also
submitted that in the  corresponding <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_140">English Act</a> of  1939,
in <a href="/doc/1443488/" id="a_141"> s. 10</a> there are proper safeguards provided in regard  to
the exercise of the power of seizure etc. The first part  of
s. 8 of the Act dealing with seizure and detention  received
slender support from the Solicitor-General. It may

<p id="p_101">be, he contended, that having regard to the purpose	 and
object	 of   the  Act	the  Indian  legislature   did	 not
think it necessary to provide any safeguards and that	 the
legislature  thought  that  nobody would  be  prejudiced  by
reason of the want of safeguard previous to the seizure,  In
our opinion this portion of the	   section  goes far  beyond
the  purpose for which the Act was enacted and, the  absence
of  the	 safeguards  which the legislature  has	 thought  it
necessary and expedient in other statutes, e.g., the  Indian
Drugs Act, is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental
rights of the petitioners and therefore the first portion of
the  section,  i.e., " any person authorised by any  of	 the
provisions  of this Act" is unconstitutional.  What then  is
the  consequence  of  this unconstitutionality	?   If	this
portion	 is  excised  from  the	 rest  of  the	section	 the
remaining  portion  is not even intelligible and  cannot  be
upheld.	 The whole of the section 'must therefore be  struck
down.
</p><p id="p_102">By a portion of cl. (d) of<a href="/doc/125510/" id="a_142"> s. 3</a> and the whole of B. 8  being
declared unconstitutional the Act is not thereby affected as
they  are  severable  from  the	 rest  of  the	Act.   As  a
consequence of excision of that portion and of<a href="/doc/1237642/" id="a_143"> s. 8</a> from the
Act  the  operation  of the remaining  portion	of  the	 Act
remains	 unimpaired.  <a href="/doc/725224/" id="a_144">R. M. D. Chamarbaughwala v. The  Union
of  India</a>(1).  As a result of<a href="/doc/1237642/" id="a_145"> s. 8</a> being  declared  invalid,
all the goods seized from the petitioners having been seized
without	 the  authority	 of  law must  be  returned  to	 the
respective  petitioners.  It will be for the  Government  to
take  such  action  in regard to the  proceedings  taken  or
prosecutions commenced as is in accordance with the law laid
down in this Judgment.

and <a href="/doc/1237642/" id="a_147"> s. 8</a> unconstitutional and direct therefore that a	writ
of mandamus shall issue directing the respondents to  return
the  goods  seized.  As the petitioners'  challenge  to	 the
constitutionality  of  the Act is partially  successful	 the
proper	order as to costs is that the parties do  pay  their
own costs.
