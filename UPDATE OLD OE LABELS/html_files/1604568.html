      This is an application filed under sub-clauses

      (2),  (6),  (10)	and  (12)  of  <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_1">Section	11</a>  of	 the
Arbitration

      and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 ( hereinafter called the

      Act).  The application is made to the Chief Justice of

      India and after due nomination, has been placed before

      me.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
      The brief facts as set out in the petition, to the

      extent necessary for the purpose of this application,

      are as follows.  The petitioner is a company with its

      registered  office at Les Cascades, Port Luis Republic
of

      Mauritius.   The	respondent  is	 the  promoter	 and
Managing

      Director of M/s C.M.M.  Ltd., Mumbai.  The petitioner

      entered into two agreements both dated 15.8.1995 with

      the respondent under which it was stated that the

      petitioner had agreed to subscribe to a private

      placement of two lots of 85,000 equity shares ( each

      agreement comprising one lot of 85,000 equity shares,

      thereby  aggregating  to	1,70,000 shares)  of  C.M.M.
Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The  shares  were	 having face value  of	Rs.10/-	 per
share.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      They  were agreed to be acquired by the petitioners at
a

      premium of Rs.20/- per share.  The cumulative value

      amounted	to  Rs.51  lakhs ( 1.70 lakhs  x  Rs.30	 per
share).
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The shares were to be held by the petitioners for a

      period  of one year from the date of subscription.  It
was

      stated that the respondent agreed and undertook to

      compulsorily  purchase  back from the petitioners	 the
said

      shares after the expiry of the said period in the

      following manner.(i) under the Ist agreement, 85,000

      with  an	assured return at the rate of 35% p.a.	 and
</p><p id="p_7">(ii)

      under the 2nd agreement, 85,000 with an assured return

      at the rate of 29% p.a.  It was stated that the

      respondent agreed that upon default by the respondent,

      the  respondent would be liable to pay penal  interest
at

      3%  p.a.	 from the date of subscription	till  actual
date

      of payment.  Pursuant to the above agreements, a

      "subscription agreement" was later entered into on

      25.9.95 between the petitioner (the subscriber), the

      respondent-promoter and the C.M.M.  company.


      On 26.9.95, Sigma Credit and Capital Services Pvt.

      Ltd.,  wrote  to	the petitioner stating that  it	 had
taken

      up  the deal of C.M.M.  Ltd.  and that it would ensure
the

      petitioner that the terms of the agreement between the

      prospective  investor  (	petitioner)  and  C.M.M.Ltd.
</p><p id="p_8">-for

      the subscription and assured buy back, especially

      regarding	 the  assured  return	and  the   confirmed
buy-back

</p><p id="p_9">      -	 would	be complied with by both the  parties.	 The
said

      company further undertook to buy-back the 85,000 NRI

      shares of CMM Ltd., at the end of 12 months from the

      date  of investment, at the rate of 25% p.a.  in	case
the

      respondent failed to meet the commitment of buy-back.

      The petitioner paid Rs.51 lakhs to the respondent on

      9.10.95 pursuant to the above agreements and 1,70,000

      shares  were allotted to the petitioner.	By  8.10.96,
the

      respondent did not buy back the shares.  Nor did Sigma

      buy back the shares.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
      On 11.7.1997, the petitioner's lawyer issued a

      registered notice to the respondent complaining that

      after the lapse of one year from the date of

      subscription, neither the respondent nor Sigma Credit

      and Capital Services (P)Ltd.  had honoured their

      commitments as per agreements dated 15.8.95 and letter

      dated  26.9.95.  There was no response to this  notice
by

      the  respondent  or  by Sigma.  A further	 notice	 was
issued

      by the petitioner on 19.4.99 stating that there was no

      response	 to  the  earlier   notice,  that  the	 two
agreements

      dated  15.8.95  contained an "arbitration clause"	 and
that

      the petitioner desired that the disputes and

      differences be referred to arbitration.  It was also

      intimated that the petitioners had appointed Justice

      M.L.   Pendse,  Retired Chief Justice, Karnataka	High
Court

      as their Arbitrator and that the respondent was being

      called upon to appoint his Arbitrator within 30 days

      from the date of receipt of the letter or else the

      respondent  should  confirm  the	appointment  of	 Sri
Justice

      M.L.   Pendse.   In  default,  the  petitioners  would
proceed

      under the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_3">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.	 The

      respondent sent a reply on 28.5.1999 raising various

      contentions.  One of the contentions was that the

      arbitration clause, namely, clause 5 in the agreements

      dated 15.8.95 used the words "may" and that the said

      clause was not mandatory but was an enabling provision

      and,   therefore,	 fresh	consent	  of   parties	 for
arbitration

      was necessary.  On 16.6.99, the petitioner's lawyers

      wrote back to the respondent stating that the

      interpretation   put   by	 the   respondent   on	 the
arbitration

      clause was not correct.  The respondent sent a further

      reply  on	 21.6.99.   Petitioner's   lawyers  sent   a
rejoinder

      on 2.7.99.  Thereafter, the present petition was filed

      under <a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_4">section 11</a> of the Act seeking the appointment of

      arbitrator/arbitrators.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
      In this petition before me, the respondent filed a

      reply and the petitioner thereafter filed a rejoinder.

      Learned counsel for the petitioner Sri U.A.  Rana

      submitted that the word 'may' used in clause 5 of the

      agreement was to be read, in the context , as 'shall'

      and that, in any event, in view of <a href="/doc/675839/" id="a_5">section 16</a> of the

      Act,   the   question  of	  the  "existence"  of	 the
arbitration

      agreement was a matter to be decided by the arbitral

      tribunal and not by me.  A point was raised by the

      petitioner  in the rejoinder based on Ador Samia	Ltd.
Vs.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Peekay  Holdings	Ltd.  ( 19998(8) SCC 572)  that	 the
action

      of the Chief Justice of India or his designate under

      <a href="/doc/605764/" id="a_6">Section 11(6)</a> was an administrative act and did not

      amount to the exercise of any judicial function.	Nor

      would the Chief Justice of India or his designate have

      any trappings of a judicial authority, while acting

      under  <a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_7">section  11</a>.   Counsel also submitted  that  in
Bombay,

      a civil suit would take more than 20 years for

      adjudication, and therefore such a situation should be

      avoided and the matter should be referred to

      arbitration.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
      On the other hand, learned counsel for the

      respondent  Sri  P.H.   Parekh   submitted  that	 the
relevant

      clause, viz., clause 5 was not mandatory in its

      language	and that in a similar case in P.  Gopal	 Das
Vs.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      Kota  Styraw Board ( AIR 1971 Raj.  258), it was	held
by

      the  Rajasthan  High  Court that the use of  the	word
'may'

      indicated that a fresh consent of both parties for

      arbitration was necessary.  Counsel submitted that

      <a href="/doc/675839/" id="a_8">section 16</a> of the Act would not apply to the situation

      on hand and that it was permissible for me to decide

      whether clause 5 was an arbitration clause or not.


      On the above submissions, the following points

      arise for consideration:
</p>
<p id="p_15">      (1) Whether clause 5 amounted to an arbitration clause

      at  all  and  whether such a question  amounted  to  a
dispute

      relating to the 'existence' of the arbitration clause?

      Whether such a question should be decided only by the

      arbitral tribunal under <a href="/doc/675839/" id="a_9">section 16</a> and could not be

      decided by the Chief Justice of India or his designate

      while dealing with an application under <a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_10">section 11</a>?


      (2) If the Chief Justice or his designate could decide

      the said question, then whether clause 5 of the

      agreements dated 15.8.95 which used the words "may be

      referred"	 required  fresh  'consent' of	the  parties
before

      a reference was made for arbitration?


      (3) To what relief.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
      Point 1:
</p>
<p id="p_17">
      This point raises a question as to the scope of

      <a href="/doc/675839/" id="a_11">section  16</a>  on  the one hand and <a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_12">section	 11</a>  on	 the
other.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">      Before referring the said section, I shall refer

      to the relevant clauses 4 and 5 in the two agreements

      dated 15.8.95.  They read as follows:


      "Clause  4:  It is hereby agreed that, if any  dispute
arises	in  connection with these presents, only  courts  in
Bombay would have jurisdiction to try and determine the suit
and  the  parties hereto submit themselves to the  exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts in Bombay."

</p><p id="p_20">      Clause  5:   It  is  also agreed by  and	between	 the
parties	  that	any  dispute  or  differences	arising	  in
connection   with   these  presents   may  be  referred	  to
arbitration  in	 pursuance of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_13">Arbitration Act</a>, 1947,  by
each  party appointing one arbitrator and the arbitrators so
appointed  selecting  an umpire.  The venue  of	 arbitration
shall be at Bombay."
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      The petitioner's counsel submits that the question

      whether clause 5 extracted above tantamounts to a

      dispute as to 'existence" of the arbitration agreement
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      is  a  question  which  can be  decided  only  by	 the
arbitral

      tribunal in view of <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_14">section 16</a> of the Act and that it

      cannot  be  decided  by  me.  That  section  reads  as
follows:

of  the statement of defence;  however, a party shall not be
precluded  from	 raising such a plea merely because that  he
has  appointed,	 or participated in the appointment  of,  an
arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      (3) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the
scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter

make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award

</p><p id="p_28">      For appreciating the scope of <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_17">section 16</a> of the

      new  Act, it is necessary to go back to <a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_18">section 33</a>  of
the

      Indian Arbitration Act, 1940.  That section vested

      jurisdiction  in the court to decide whether there was
in

      'existence' an arbitration clause or not, whenever the

      'existence'  of the arbitration clause was  challenged
by

      any of the parties.  That section read as follows:


      "<a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_19">Section	33</a>:   Arbitration agreement or award  to  be
contested by application -
</p>
<p id="p_29">      Any  party  to an arbitration agreement or any  person

the  effect  of either determined, shall apply to the  Court
and  the  Court	 shall decide the  question  on	 affidavits,
........"
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p>      In M/s.  D.  Gobindram Vs.  M/s Shamji Kalidas Co.<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">      [AIR 1961 SC 1285 (at 1293)(para 25)] it was held that

      the question as to the existence of arbitration clause

      was for the Court to decide under <a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_20">section 33</a> and not

      for  the arbitrators.  In Khardah Co.Ltd.	 Vs.  Raymon
&amp;

      Co.(India) Pvt.Ltd.  (AIR 1962 SC 1810) and In Waverly

      Jute  Mills  Co.Ltd.  Vs.	 Raymon &amp; Co.  (India)	Pvt.
Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_33">      (AIR 1963 SC 90, at 96 para 17), it was held that the

      question	as to the validity of the contract was	also
for

      the Court to decide under <a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_21">section 33</a> and not for the

      arbitrator.  If there was no arbitration clause at the

      time of entry of the arbitrators on their duties, the

      whole proceedings would be without jurisdiction.	In

      Renusagar	 Power Co.  Ltd.  Vs.  General Electric	 Co.
(AIR

      1985 SC 1156 = 1985(1) SCR 432) (at p.1170) it was

      stated that ordinarily,.	as a rule, an arbitrator had
no

      authority to clothe himself with power to decide the

      question of his own jurisdiction unless parties

      expressly conferred such a power on him.



      Thus, it is clear from <a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_22">section 33</a> of the old

      Act of 1940 that any question as to the "existence" of

      the arbitration agreement was to be decided only by

      application  to  the Court and not by the	 arbitrator.
This

      disability on the part of the arbitrator has now been

      removed  by <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_23">section 16</a> of the new Act.  Now <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_24">section 16</a>
has

      conferred power on the arbitral tribunal to decide

      whether there is in 'existence' an arbitration clause.


      But, it must be noted that the language employed

      by <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_25">section 16</a> of the new Act shows that the said

      provision	 is  only  an enabling	one  which,-  unlike
<a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_26">section

      33</a> in the old Act of 1940,- now permits the arbitral

      tribunal to decide a question relating to the

      'existence', of the arbitration clause.  This section

      corresponds  to  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_27">Article 16</a> of the UNCITRAL Model	 Law
and

      <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_28">Article 21</a> of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.  While

      <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_29">Article 16</a> of the Model Law says that the arbitral

      tribunal	may rule on its own jurisdiction, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_30">Article 21</a>
of

      the  Rules  states that the 'arbitral  tribunal  shall
have

      power  to rule' on these questions.  Such power  given
to

      the   arbitral  tribunal	is   also  referred  to	  as
'Kompetenz

</p><p id="p_34">      - kompetenz".
</p>
<p id="p_35">

      The more important question however is whether

      <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_31">section 16</a> excludes the jurisdiction of the Chief

      Justice of India or his designate in this behalf if a

      question as to the existence of the arbitration clause

      is  raised  by  the  respondent in his  reply  to	 the
petition

      filed under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_32">section 11</a>.  (I am not concerned with the

      question of the validity or effect of the arbitration

      clause, in the present case).  In my view, <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_33">section 16</a>

      does  not	 take  away the jurisdiction  of  the  Chief
Justice

      of India or his designate, if need be, to decide the

      question of the 'existence' of the arbitration

      agreement.   <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_34">Section  16</a> does not declare that  except
the

      arbitral tribunal, none else can determine such a

      question.	 Merely because the new Act permits the

      Arbitrator to decide this question, it does not

      necessarily follow that at the stage of section 11 the

      Chief  Justice of India or his designate cannot decide
a

      question	as  to	the  existence	of  the	 arbitration
clause.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">      The interpretation put on <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_35">section 16</a> by the

      petitioner's  counsel that only the arbitral  tribunal
can

      decide about the "existence" of the arbitration clause

      is  not  acceptable for other reasons also apart	from
the

      result  flowing  from  the use of the  word  'may'  in
section

</p><p id="p_38">      16.  The acceptance of the said contention will, as I

      shall presently show, create serious problems in

      practice.	  As  Saville  L.J.  stated in a  speech  at
Middle

      Temple Hall on July 8, 1996:  "Question of the

      jurisdiction  of	the tribunal cannot be left  (unless
the

      parties agreed) to the tribunal itself, for that would

      be a classic case of pulling oneself up by one's own

      bootstraps".   (	A practical approach to	 Arbitration
Law,

      Keren Tweeddale &amp; Andrew Tweeddale, (1999) Blackstone

      Press Ltd.)(P.75).  Let us take this very case.  If

      indeed clause 5 does not amount to an 'arbitration

      agreement',  it will, in my view, be anomalous to	 ask
the

      arbitrator to decide the question whether clause 5 is

      at  all an arbitration clause.  It is well settled and
has

      been repeatedly held that the source of the

      jurisdiction of the arbitrator is the arbitration

      clause.  [see Waverly Jute Mills case (AIR 1963 SC 90)

      above referred to ) When that is the position, the

      arbitrator cannot, in all situations, be the sole

      authority to decide upon the "existence" of the

      arbitration clause.  Supposing again, the contract

      between the parties which contained the arbitration

      clause remained at the stage of negotiation and there

      was no concluded contract at all.	 Then in such a case

      also,  there  is no point in appointing an  arbitrator
and

      asking  him to decide the question as to the existence
of

      the  arbitration	clause.	 But, I may point  out	that
there

      can be some other situations where the question as to

      the  "existence"	of  an	arbitration  clause  can  be
decided

      by  the arbitrator.  Take a case where the matter	 has
gone

      to the arbitrator without the intervention of an

      application  under  <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_36">section  11</a>.	 Obviously,  if	 the
question

      as  to  the  existence of the  arbitration  clause  is
raised

      before  the arbitral tribunal, it has power to  decide
the

      question.	 Again in a case where the initial existence
of

      the arbitration clause is not in issue at the time of

      <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_37">section  11</a>  application but a point is raised  before
the

      arbitral tribunal that the said clause or the contract

      in  which	 it is contained has ceased to be in  force,
then

      in such a case, the arbitrator can decide whether the

      arbitration  clause  has	ceased to be  in  force.   A
question

      may be raised before the arbitrator that the whole

      contract	including  the arbitration clause  is  void.
Now

      <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_38">Section  16</a>  of  the  new	 Act  permits  the  arbitral
tribunal

      to  treat	 the  arbitration clause as  an	 independent
clause

      and  <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_39">section 16</a> says that the arbitration clause	does
not

      perish  even  if the main contract is declared  to  be
null

      and void.	 Keeping these latter and other similar

      situations apart, I am of the view that in cases where
</p><p id="p_39">-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      to start with - there is a dispute raised at the stage

      of the application under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_40">section 11</a> that there is no

      arbitration clause at all, then it will be absurd to

      refer the very issue to an arbitrator without deciding

      whether there is an arbitration clause at all between

      the parties to start with.  In my view, in the present

      situation, the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of

      India  or	 his designate to decide the question as  to
the

      'existence'  of  the  arbitration	  clause  cannot  be
doubted

      and cannot be said to be excluded by <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_41">section 16</a>.


      Further, a reading of sub-clauses (4),(5) and (6)

      of <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_42">section 11</a> shows that they enable the Chief Justice

      or his designate to appoint arbitrator or arbitrators,

      and likewise <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_43">section 11(12)</a> enables the Chief Justice

      of India or his designate to appoint arbitrator or

      arbitrators;  under Rule 2 of the scheme framed by the

      Chief Justice of India, a request is to be made to the

      Chief Justice of India alongwith with a duly certified

      copy of the 'original arbitration agreement'.  <a href="/doc/1311823/" id="a_44">Section

      2(b)</a> of the Act defines `arbitration agreement' as an

      agreement referred to in <a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_45">section 7</a>.  <a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_46">section 7</a> defines

      'arbitration agreement' as follows:</blockquote><p id="p_40">


</p><p id="p_41">      "S.7.   Arbitration  agreement  (1)   In	this   Part,
"arbitration agreement" means an agreement by the parties to
submit	to  arbitration all or certain disputes	 which	have
arisen	or  which  may arise between them in  respect  of  a
defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not.

</p><p id="p_42">      (2)  An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an
arbitration  clause  in	 a  contract or in  the	 form  of  a
separate agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_43">      (3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.

      (4)  An  arbitration agreement is in writing if it  is
contained in --
</p>
<p id="p_44">      (a) a document signed by the parties;

</p><p id="p_45">      (b)  an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other
means  of  telecommunication which provide a record  of	 the
agreement;  or

</p><p id="p_46">      (c)  an exchange of statements of claim and defence in
which the existence of the agreement is alleged by one party
and not denied by the other.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      (5)   The	 reference  in	a  contract  to	 a  document
containing  an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration
agreement if the contract is in writing and the reference is
such  as  to  make  that  arbitration  clause  part  of	 the
contract.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">      The words in sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_47">section 7</a>, "means an

      agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration", in

      my  opinion, postulate an agreement which	 necessarily
or

      rather mandatorily requires the appointment of an

      arbitrator/arbitrators.	<a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_48">Section	 7</a> does not cover  a
case

      where  the parties agree that they "may" go to a	suit
or

      that they 'may' also go to arbitration.


      Thus, unless the document filed by the party

      before  the Chief Justice of India or his designate is
an

      `arbitration agreement' as defined in <a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_49">section 7</a> as

      explained above, requiring a reference in a mandatory

      sense, no reference, in my view, can be made to the

      arbitral tribunal.  It is, as already stated, indeed

      implicit - if an objection is raised by the respondent

      before  the  Chief Justice of India or  his  designate
that

      the so called arbitration clause is not an arbitration

      clause at all falling within <a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_50">section 7</a> - that such a

      question will have to be decided in the proceedings

      under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_51">section 11</a> of the Act.  Therefore the contention

      raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner that

      the  question  -	whether clause 5  of  the  agreement
amounts

      to  an  arbitration clause - is to be decided only  by
the

      arbitral tribunal is liable to be rejected.


      It is true that in <a href="/doc/78969/" id="a_52">Ador Samia Pvt.  Ltd.	vs.  Peekay

      Holdings	Ltd.   &amp; Others</a> [1999 (8) SCC 572],  it	 has
been

      held that the Chief Justice or his designate under

      <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_53">section  11(6)</a> acts in an administrative capacity	 and
he

      does  not	 exercise any judicial function and that  he
has

      no  trappings  of	 a  judicial  authority.   But	this
decision,

      in my view, cannot support the plea raised by the

      petitioner  in  his  rejoinder.	Even  if  the  Chief
Justice

      of  India or his designate under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_54">section 11(12)</a> is  to
be

      treated  as an administrative authority, the  position
is

      that when the said authority is approached seeking

      appointment of an arbitrator/arbitrator tribunal under

      <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_55">section 11</a> and a question is raised that there is, to

      start with, no arbitration clause at all between the

      parties, the Chief Justice of India or his designate

      has to decide the said question.


      For the aforesaid reasons, this objection raised

      by the learned counsel for the petitioner is rejected.

      Point 1 is decided accordingly.


      Point 2:
</p>
<p id="p_50">
      Does clause 5 amount to an arbitration clause as

      defined  in  <a href="/doc/1311823/" id="a_56">section 2(b)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_57">section 7</a>?  I	 may
here

      state that in most arbitration clauses, the words

      normally used are that "disputes shall be referred to

      arbitration".   But  in the case before me, the  words
used

      are `may be referred'.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
      It is contended for the petitioner that the word

      'may' in clause 5 has to be construed as `shall'.

      According	 to  the petitioner's counsel, that  is	 the
true

      intention of the parties.	 The question then is as to

      what is the intention of the parties?  The parties, in

      my view, used the words `may' not without reason.	 If

      one looks at the fact that clause 4 precedes clause 5,

      one  can see that under clause 4 parties desired	that
in

      case of disputes, the Civil Courts at Bombay are to be

      approached  by  way of a suit.  Then follows clause  5
with

      the  words `it is also agreed' that the dispute  'may'
be

      referred to arbitration implying that parties need not

      necessarily  go to the Civil Court by way of suit	 but
can

      also  go	before	an arbitrator.	Thus,  clause  5  is
merely

      an enabling provision as contended by the respondents.
I

      may also state that in cases where there is a sole

      arbitration  clause couched in mandatory language,  it
is

      not preceded by a clause like clause 4 which discloses

      a	 general  intention  of the parties to go  before  a
Civil

      Court  by	 way  of suit.	Thus, reading clause  4	 and
clause

      5 together, I am of the view that it is not the

      intention of the parties that arbitration is to be the

      sole remedy.  It appears that the parties agreed that

      they can "also" go to arbitration also in case the

      aggrieved	 party does not wish to go to a Civil  Court
by

      way of a suit.  But in that event, obviously, fresh

      consent  to go to arbitration is necessary.   Further,
in

      the  present  case, the same clause 5, so far  as	 the
Venue

      of arbitration is concerned, uses word 'shall'.  The

      parties, in my view, must be deemed to have used the

      words `may' and `shall' at different places, after due

      deliberation.
</p>
<p id="p_52">

      A somewhat similar situation arose in <a href="/doc/452708/" id="a_58">B.Gopal Das

      vs.   Kota Straw Board</a> [AIR 1971 Raj.  258].  In	that
case

      the clause read as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_53">
      "That  in case of any dispute arising between us,	 the
matter	may  be referred to arbitrator mutually agreed	upon
and acceptable to you and us."
</p>
<p id="p_54">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      It was held that fresh consent for arbitration was

      necessary.  No doubt, the above clause was a little

      clearer  there  than  in the case before me.   In	 the
above

      case too, the clause used the word `may' as in the

      present  case.   The  above   decision  is   therefore
directly

      in point.</blockquote><p id="p_55">



</p><p id="p_56">      Before leaving the above case decided by the from

      Rajasthan High Court, one other aspect has to be

      referred to.  In the above case, the decision of the

      Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/845207/" id="a_59">Jyoti Brothers vs.	 Shree Durga

      Mining  Co</a>.   [AIR  1956	Cal.   280]  has  also	been
referred

      to.  In the Calcutta case, the clause used the words

      "can" be settled by arbitration and it was held that

      fresh  consent  of  parties was necessary.   Here	 one
other

      class of cases was differentiated by the Calcutta High

      Court.   It  was pointed out that in some	 cases,	 the
word

      `may'  was used in the context of giving choice to one
of

      the  parties  to go to arbitration.  But, at the	same
time,

      the clause would require that once the option was so

      exercised by the specific party, the matter was to be

      mandatorily referred to arbitration.  Those cases were

      distinguished in the Calcutta case on the ground that

      such cases where option was given to one particular

      party, the mandatory part of the clause stated as to

      what should be done after one party exercised the

      option.  Reference to arbitration was mandatory, once

      option was exercised.  In England too such a view was

      expressed in Pittalis and Sheriffenttin [1986 (1) QB

      868].   In the present case, we are not concerned with
a

      clause  which used the word `may' while giving  option
to

      one party to go to arbitration.  Therefore, I am not

      concerned	 with  a situation where option is given  to
one

      party to seek arbitration.  I am, therefore, not to be

      understood as deciding any principle in regard to such

      cases.
</p>
<p id="p_57">      Suffice it to say, that the words 'may be

      referred'	 used in clause 5, read with clause 4,	lead
me

      to the conclusion that clause 5 is not a firm or

      mandatory arbitration clause and in my view, it

      postulates a fresh agreement between the parties that

      they will to go to arbitration.  Point 2 is decided

      accordingly against the petitioner.


      Point 3:
</p>
<p id="p_58">      In the light of the finding on Point 2, it is

      obvious  that I have to dismiss this petition.  It may
be

      that  if the petitioner files a suit in Bombay,  there
can

      be  considerable	delay.	 But that is  no  ground  to
construe

      the clause differently.  I may state however, that in

      case a Civil suit is filed, it will be for the

      petitioner to seek an early disposal of the case and I

      have  no	reason	to doubt that the civil	 court	will
treat

      the request of the petitioner for early disposal with

      due consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
      With the above observations, this petition is

      dismissed but in the circumstances without costs.
